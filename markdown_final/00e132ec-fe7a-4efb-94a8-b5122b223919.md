## Question

What are the risks of radiation therapy to a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of radiation therapy in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and how to translate that into management recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility given TP53's role in DNA damage response. Then, I should quantify the magnitude of second primary malignancy risk from clinical studies. Next, I will examine dose, technique, and age-related modifiers. After that, I need to check whether there is increased radiosensitivity versus radioresistance of tumors. Then, I should review guideline positions and consensus statements. Finally, I will synthesize practical management principles and surveillance implications, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. LFS is due to germline TP53 pathogenic variants, impairing the guardian-of-the-genome response to ionizing radiation and increasing susceptibility to therapy-related second primaries, which provides a mechanistic basis for heightened radiation carcinogenesis risk in this population [^111xSFzW] [^115ZayPH].

> I will now examine the magnitude of risk from clinical data. In a cohort of 47 children with LFS, those who received radiotherapy for the first cancer had a median time to second primary of 13.3 years versus 25.1 years without radiotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 7.9, and overall survival after the first cancer was markedly shorter with radiotherapy, supporting a strong association between radiotherapy and earlier second malignancy and worse survival in this group [^11313u7b] [^1147ViTa] [^114NsYdT]. Wait, let me verify the directionality and consistency; yes, multiple analyses from the same dataset converge on earlier second primaries and worse survival after radiotherapy exposure, reinforcing causality concerns despite the retrospective design [^11313u7b] [^1147ViTa].

> Next, I should review adult and breast-specific data to ensure generalizability. In a cohort of 227 women with germline TP53 variants and early breast cancer, the 5-year radiation-induced sarcoma rate after breast radiotherapy was 4.8%, and a separate series of 48 LFS patients with early breast cancer reported a 10% incidence of radiation-induced malignancies within the irradiated field, with technique appearing to matter, as 3D conformal radiotherapy showed 0% RIM versus 100% with 2D and 50% with IMRT in small subgroups, though I need to acknowledge the small numbers and potential selection bias here [^1177yHDr] [^116tYiB2]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this signal; yes, professional society guidance treats irradiation of the intact breast as contraindicated in TP53 carriers, favoring mastectomy to avoid radiotherapy when feasible [^111V7KJQ] [^111Yei1N].

> Let me consider dose, technique, and age-related modifiers. Higher radiation dose and larger treatment volumes are associated with increased second malignancy risk in survivors generally, and in LFS specifically, modern conformal techniques and proton therapy are favored to minimize integral dose and stray radiation when radiotherapy cannot be avoided, particularly in children who are uniquely vulnerable to radiation carcinogenesis and in whom latency to second tumors may be shorter [^111XKey2] [^112LBWk6] [^11434Ud8]. I should double-check that pediatric guidance acknowledges this; NCCN pediatric CNS guidance notes that germline TP53 and younger age at irradiation heighten secondary malignancy risk, supporting dose/volume minimization and careful justification of radiotherapy in this population [^11434Ud8].

> Now, I need to distinguish radiosensitivity of normal tissues from tumor radiosensitivity and radioresistance. Wait, let me verify this nuance. Expert reviews indicate that while LFS carriers may have similar acute normal tissue radiosensitivity to the general population, their tumors may be relatively radioresistant or at least not more curable by radiation, and the dominant clinical concern is the elevated risk of second primary malignancies rather than excessive acute toxicity per se [^112LBWk6]. But hold on, I should also check disease-specific signals. In TP53-mutated choroid plexus carcinoma, multiple series suggest limited benefit and potential harm from radiotherapy, with recommendations to avoid routine radiotherapy in young children when alternatives exist, which aligns with the broader caution in LFS [^116Pw7zi].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my synthesis reflects consensus. Major guidelines advise avoiding radiotherapy in TP53 carriers when equally effective alternatives exist, prioritize surgery or non-genotoxic strategies, and recommend genetic testing before initiating therapy so that radiotherapy can be avoided if a germline TP53 variant is identified, with NCCN listing TP53 as a relative contraindication to breast-conserving therapy requiring radiation and oncology guidelines recommending mastectomy rather than breast irradiation in TP53 mutation carriers [^1126HJbk] [^111yCE19] [^113egPcm] [^111V7KJQ] [^111Yei1N]. I should confirm that multidisciplinary planning is emphasized; yes, expert statements call for MDT discussions integrating second cancer risk, prognosis, and curative alternatives before exposing LFS patients to radiotherapy [^112LBWk6].

> I will now translate this into practical management principles. Let me think about risk stratification and technique selection. When radiotherapy is unavoidable, use the smallest fields, lowest effective dose, and most conformal modality, with proton therapy considered to reduce integral dose, and document explicit informed consent regarding second malignancy risk and surveillance plans, ideally within a specialized center experienced in hereditary cancer syndromes [^112LBWk6] [^115HtmfN]. Hold on, I should verify that these adaptations are framed as risk mitigation rather than risk elimination. Yes, even with best practices, the second cancer risk remains elevated, so lifelong surveillance remains mandatory [^112LBWk6].

> Next, I should review surveillance implications because second primaries can occur in or outside radiation fields and may be accelerated. Annual whole-body MRI is recommended for TP53 carriers to detect early primaries, with brain MRI included given the bimodal incidence of CNS tumors, and survivors should undergo targeted examination of previously irradiated sites with a low threshold to image new symptoms given the high background risk and potential for earlier onset after radiotherapy [^111yCE19] [^113Ywzih] [^111XKey2]. Wait, let me verify that these recommendations are consistent across guidelines; yes, international consensus endorses intensive MRI-based surveillance tailored to age and genotype, with attention to prior radiation fields [^111yCE19] [^113Ywzih].

> But wait, what if the tumor is genuinely radioresistant and local control without radiation is unlikely? I need to ensure we do not overstate avoidance. In select scenarios, such as unresectable sarcomas or high-grade gliomas in LFS, radiotherapy may still be indicated after exhaustive consideration of alternatives, with explicit acknowledgment of second malignancy risk and implementation of dose/volume minimization strategies and close follow-up, recognizing that tumor control must be balanced against long-term carcinogenic risk in shared decision-making [^112LBWk6] [^115HtmfN] [^114H3tfc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; each case warrants MDT review and documentation that equivalent non-radiation options have been considered or are not feasible [^112LBWk6].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Radiation therapy in LFS confers a substantially increased risk of earlier second primary malignancies, with hazard ratios around 7–8 for time to second cancer in exposed children and clinically meaningful absolute risks of radiation-induced sarcomas after breast radiotherapy, without clear evidence of improved tumor radiosensitivity, leading guidelines to recommend avoidance of radiotherapy when possible, preference for surgery or non-genotoxic strategies, and, when radiotherapy is necessary, meticulous technique and lifelong surveillance to mitigate and detect second primaries early [^11313u7b] [^1177yHDr] [^111V7KJQ] [^111Yei1N] [^112LBWk6] [^111yCE19].

Radiation therapy in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) carries a **markedly increased risk of second primary malignancies** due to germline TP53 mutations, with a 7.9-fold faster onset of second cancers in irradiated children (median 13.3 vs 25.1 years) and a 3.2-fold higher mortality [^11313u7b] [^1147ViTa]. Radiation-induced sarcomas and other tumors often arise within the radiation field, and the risk is **dose-independent**, indicating no safe threshold [^116tYiB2] [^112LBWk6]. Given this, **radiation should be avoided when alternatives exist**; if unavoidable, use the lowest effective dose, minimal volume, and proton therapy to reduce scatter [^112LBWk6] [^115HtmfN]. Mastectomy is preferred over breast-conserving surgery in LFS to avoid breast radiation [^111V7KJQ] [^111Yei1N], and lifelong surveillance is essential [^111AF8VS].

---

## Increased risk of second primary malignancies

- **Second primary malignancies**: LFS patients have a > 40% lifetime risk of multiple primary tumors, often after radiation or chemotherapy [^111yCE19] [^115ZayPH].

- **Radiation-associated risk**: Irradiated LFS children develop second cancers significantly earlier (median 13.3 years) than non-irradiated peers (25.1 years; HR 7.9) [^11313u7b] [^1147ViTa].

- **Radiation-induced sarcomas**: Sarcomas frequently arise within radiation fields, including chest wall sarcomas after breast RT [^1147Hy8n] [^114NsYdT].

- **Dose independence**: RT-induced malignancy risk appears dose-independent, with no safe threshold identified [^116tYiB2].

---

## Types of radiation-induced malignancies

Common **radiation-induced malignancies** in LFS include:

| **Malignancy type** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Sarcomas | - Osteosarcoma <br/> - Leiomyosarcoma <br/> - Fibrosarcoma [^1147Hy8n] [^111KZ8Kc] [^114NsYdT] |
| Breast cancer | Contralateral or ipsilateral recurrence after breast-conserving therapy [^113egPcm] |
| Brain tumors | Gliomas, meningiomas, particularly in pediatric patients [^11434Ud8] |
| Leukemia | - Acute myeloid leukemia <br/> - Myelodysplastic syndrome after RT and chemotherapy [^113FZHTp] [^115rtmZZ] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Avoidance of radiation**: RT should be avoided when equally effective alternatives exist; prioritize surgery or non-genotoxic therapies [^112LBWk6] [^115ZayPH].

- **Breast cancer management**: Mastectomy is preferred over breast-conserving surgery to avoid breast radiation [^111V7KJQ] [^111Yei1N].

- **Dose and volume minimization**: Use the lowest effective dose, minimal treatment volume, and proton therapy to reduce scatter radiation [^112LBWk6] [^115HtmfN].

- **Lifelong surveillance**: Annual whole-body MRI and brain MRI are recommended for early detection of new primaries [^115ZayPH] [^111yCE19].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Irradiated LFS patients have significantly **shorter median survival** (9.7 years) than non-irradiated patients (29.2 years; HR 3.2) [^11313u7b] [^1147ViTa]. Radiation accelerates the emergence of second cancers, shortening the interval between primaries and worsening prognosis [^11313u7b] [^114NsYdT]. Given these outcomes, **individualized risk–benefit assessment** is essential, balancing tumor control against second malignancy risk [^112LBWk6].

---

## Summary of risks associated with radiation therapy in LFS

- **Increased risk of second primary malignancies**: Markedly elevated and earlier onset after radiation [^11313u7b] [^1147ViTa].

- **Radiation-induced sarcomas**: Frequent within radiation fields [^114NsYdT] [^116tYiB2].

- **Dose-independent risk**: No safe radiation threshold identified [^116tYiB2].

- **Reduced overall survival**: Higher mortality in irradiated patients [^11313u7b] [^114NsYdT].

- **Need for lifelong surveillance**: Essential for early detection of new primaries [^113Ywzih] [^111yCE19].

---

Radiation therapy in LFS carries a **high risk of second primary malignancies** and reduced survival; therefore, it should be avoided when possible, and when necessary, delivered with the lowest dose, minimal volume, and proton therapy, alongside lifelong surveillance [^112LBWk6] [^115HtmfN].

Abstract Purpose The purpose of this article was to provide an overview of syndromic gliomas. Design The authors conducted a nonsystematic literature review. Results Cancer predisposition syndromes are genetic conditions that increase one's risk for certain types of cancer compared with the general population. Syndromes that can predispose one to developing gliomas include neurofibromatosis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Lynch syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex. The standard treatment for sporadic glioma may involve resection, radiation therapy, and/or alkylating chemotherapy. However, DNA-damaging approaches, such as radiation and alkylating agents, may increase the risk of secondary malignancies and other complications in patients with CPSs. In some cases, depending on genetic aberrations, targeted therapies or immunotherapeutic approaches may be considered. Data on clinical characteristics, therapeutic strategies, and prognosis of syndromic gliomas remain limited.

Conclusion In this review, we provide an overview of syndromic gliomas with a focus on management for patients with CPSs and the role of novel treatments that can be considered.

### Definitive and postoperative radiation therapy for basal and squamous cell cancers of the skin: executive summary of an American Society for Radiation Oncology clinical practice guideline [^117Y7CqL]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASTRO guideline — definitive radiation therapy (RT) for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) may be considered as a curative option when surgery can compromise function or cosmesis in an anatomically sensitive area. Careful selection among the various RT techniques can further enhance cosmetic and functional sparing, with orthovoltage beam or brachytherapy techniques well-suited for especially sensitive ocular anatomy associated with medial canthus or eyelid lesions, and specialized radiation techniques (eg, surface and interstitial brachytherapy) having additional capacity to deliver definitive RT doses to achieve tumor eradication while minimizing normal tissue exposure. Recurrence rates were similar for excision (3.8%), Mohs surgery (3.8%), and external-beam radiation (3.5%). Retrospective studies have found that SCC portends a worse local control and disease survival than BCC when single modality treatment is utilized, and emerging evidence suggests that patients with cSCC and high-risk features or locally advanced disease are particularly vulnerable to worse outcomes, with multimodality therapy — including combinations of surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy — possibly conferring better disease control than RT or surgery alone; a multidisciplinary cancer care team with an emphasis on shared decision-making is beneficial for this population. RT carries risks including acute dermatitis, dryness, permanent local alopecia, telangiectasias and — in rare cases — secondary malignancy; two important principles are that histologic confirmation is required prior to initiation of treatment and that overall life expectancy should be considered and discussed with younger patients. The use of definitive RT is discouraged for the treatment of cSCC or BCC in patients with genetic conditions predisposing them to heightened radiosensitivity, such as ataxia telangiectasia, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome), or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and poorly controlled connective tissue disorders are a relative contraindication; available surgical and systemic options should be exhausted before RT is offered to patients with heightened radiosensitivity.

Impact of Genetic Testing Results on Management Recommendations

Identification of patients with pathogenic variants in these genes can influence patient management in terms of high-risk screening and risk reduction as well as therapeutic options related to surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies.–For example, identifying that a breast cancer patient has a BRCA1 pathogenic variant provides that patient the opportunity to learn of her elevated risk for contralateral breast cancer as well as of ovarian cancer and to make educated decisions to reduce those risks. Studies are underway to determine whether these patients also might benefit from PARP inhibitors being included in their adjuvant therapy regimen. Another example is that radiation is relatively contraindicated in patients with TP53 pathogenic variants (associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) due to their increased risk of developing radiation-induced secondary malignancies.

Identifying a patient who has a pathogenic variant that indicates high hereditary breast cancer risk can have a profound impact on that patient's health and management. Additionally, it has potential impact on that patient's family members who should be counselled to consider testing for the mutation identified in the family, the result of which can guide their risk of breast cancer development and consideration of risk management strategies.

Just because a hereditary pathogenic mutation that predisposes to breast cancer is identified does not mean that the risk-reducing mastectomy is indicated. Risk-reducing mastectomy can be considered in BRCA1, BRCA 2, PTEN, and TP53. Consideration may also be appropriate for patients with mutations in other genes when combined with a significant family history of breast cancer.

Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants should consider risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy after child-bearing or between the ages of 35–40 years to reduce ovarian and fallopian tube cancer risk. Women with BRCA1 should consider oophorectomy between ages 35–40 years, whereas BRCA2 carriers should consider it between ages 40–45 years.

Prophylactic oophorectomy in premenopausal women with BRCA2 pathogenic variants also has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer by approximately 50%. There also is breast cancer risk reduction from RRSO in BRCA1 patients but to a lesser degree.

### Avoidance or adaptation of radiotherapy in patients with cancer with Li-Fraumeni and heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes [^112LBWk6]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The management of patients with cancer and Li-Fraumeni or heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes is complex because of their increased risk of developing second malignant neoplasms after genotoxic stresses such as systemic treatments or radiotherapy (radiosusceptibility). Clinical decision making also integrates the risks of normal tissue toxicity and sequelae (radiosensitivity) and tumour response to radiotherapy (radioresistance and radiocurability). Radiotherapy should be avoided in patients with cancer and Li-Fraumeni or heritable TP53 cancer-related syndromes, but overall prognosis might be poor without radiotherapy: radioresistance in these patients seems similar to or worse than that of the general population. Radiosensitivity in germline TP53 variant carriers seems similar to that in the general population. The risk of second malignant neoplasms according to germline TP53 variant and the patient's overall oncological prognosis should be assessed during specialised multidisciplinary staff meetings. Radiotherapy should be avoided whenever other similarly curative treatment options are available. In other cases, it should be adapted to minimise the risk of second malignant neoplasms in patients who still require radiotherapy despite its genotoxicity, in view of its potential benefit. Adaptations might be achieved through the reduction of irradiated volumes using proton therapy, non-ionising diagnostic procedures, image guidance, and minimal stray radiation. Non-ionising imaging should become more systematic. Radiotherapy approaches that might result in a lower probability of misrepaired DNA damage (eg, particle therapy biology and tumour targeting) are an area of investigation.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^1147ViTa]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

In total, 22 children received XRT treatment (start date ranges: December 1, 1947 to June 7, 2021) as treatment for the first cancer, and 25 children did not (Table S1).

Median time to second primary cancer after the first cancer primary diagnosis was 13.3 years in children receiving XRT for the first cancer compared with 25.1 years for those who did not (χ 2 = 14.8, P < .0001; Hazard Ratio (HR) = 7.9 [95% CI = 2.8 to 22.6]) (Figure 1, A). Median age at second primary cancer was 18.7 years for those children receiving XRT for their first cancer compared with a median age of 28.0 years for those not receiving XRT (χ 2 = 14.3, P = 0.0002; HR = 7.7 [95% CI = 2.7 to 22.0]) (Figure 1, B). Time to third primary cancer where XRT was received for the first primary cancer was also significantly reduced (χ 2 = 15.0, P = 0.0001; HR = 10.9 [95% CI = 2.4 to 50.2]). Our data were too few on those receiving XRT for the second cancer to analyze.

Figure 1.
Time to second primary cancer (A) and age at second primary cancer (B) with or without radiotherapy (XRT) for the first primary cancer.

As MCGM records commenced in 1990, we also undertook analysis of time to second and third primary for first primary cancer occurring in 1990 or later. Again, this showed significantly reduced time to second (XRT/no XRT for first cancer, median time to second cancer = 9.5/25.1 years, χ 2 = 5.6, P = 0.0028; HR = 5.6 [95% CI = 0.8 to 40.6]) and third primary cancer diagnosis (χ 2 = 9.9, P = 0.0017; HR = 73.6 [95% CI = 5.1 to 1074]).

### Predictive diagnosis of the cancer prone Li-Fraumeni syndrome by accident: new challenges through whole genome array testing [^116BgnH6]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

As array CGH has evolved into a standard diagnostic tool for a variety of conditions, it is very likely that with the advancing use of this technology similar deletions, or deletions of other cancer prone syndromes, will be identified. In each case it will place the physician or genetic counsellor in a special situation as a risk evaluation for tumour development will have to be offered, although this had not been requested initially by the patient or her/his family. The growing risk of identifying individuals with an increased lifetime risk for cancer by accident will fuel the need for sophisticated risk stratification to achieve a better prediction for the occurrence of possible tumour types and the timing of cancer.

### Cancer screening recommendations for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^113DmwcD]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited condition caused by germline mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene encoding p53, a transcription factor triggered as a protective cellular mechanism against different stressors. Loss of p53 function renders affected individuals highly susceptible to a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers. It has recently become evident that children and adults with LFS benefit from intensive surveillance aimed at early tumor detection. In October 2016, the American Association for Cancer Research held a meeting of international LFS experts to evaluate the current knowledge on LFS and propose consensus surveillance recommendations. Herein, we briefly summarize clinical and genetic aspects of this aggressive cancer predisposition syndrome. In addition, the expert panel concludes that there are sufficient existing data to recommend that all patients with LFS be offered cancer surveillance as soon as the clinical or molecular LFS diagnosis is established. Specifically, the panel recommends adoption of a modified version of the "Toronto protocol" that includes a combination of physical exams, blood tests, and imaging. The panel also recommends that further research be promoted to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of these risk-adapted surveillance and cancer prevention strategies while addressing the psychosocial needs of individuals and families with LFS.

### Second primary malignancies of the bones and joints: more common than expected in osteosarcoma patients [^116F3XzX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study of the SEER database examining and updating the incidence and characteristics of SPMs in osteosarcoma survivors found that the cumulative incidence of SPMs was significantly higher than expected for the population based on baseline population rates. In particular, standardized absolute and relative incidence of malignancies in the bones and joints, soft tissue including the heart, and lymphoid and hematopoietic malignancies were significantly higher than expected.

Second primary malignancies are a devastating long-term sequela for many survivors of cancers. According to Soerjomataram and Coebergh, patients with cancer have a 20% higher risk of developing a new primary cancer compared with the general population. Many causal factors are believed to contribute to the development of SPMs. Radiation, for example, has long been observed to induce secondary malignancies at the site of exposure. Chemotherapy, known for its leukemogenic properties, and its adjuncts, such as high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin, have also been linked to SPM development. A family history of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with a variety of malignancies including primary osteosarcoma, can also contribute to the risk of SPM.

### Soft tissue sarcoma, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113ZyQH3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) epidemiology and risk factors — Sarcomas account for only 1% of all adult malignancies and 15% of childhood malignancies, and in 2022 an estimated 13,190 people in the United States will be diagnosed with STS with approximately 5130 deaths; the true incidence is underestimated because many gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) were not captured before 2001. Prior radiation therapy (RT) to the affected area is a risk factor, and other risk factors include various chemicals (eg, herbicides, such as agent orange) and genetic syndromes (eg, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis). More than 50 different histologic subtypes have been identified, and STS most commonly metastasizes to the lungs, while tumors arising in the abdominal cavity more commonly metastasize to the liver and peritoneum.

### Chapter 22: Li-Fraumeni syndrome, including Li-Fraumeni-Like syndrome… [^111hR9TE]. lfs.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

A striking predilection for young age at cancer diagnosis and development of multiple primary cancers are LFS features. The probability of developing a second primary cancer in 200 LFS patients reached 57% by 30 years follow-up. Risk of second cancer was higher in younger patients and in those whose first primary was a sarcoma. The estimated probability of developing a third cancer was 38% at 10 years. Given the nature of the genetic defect in a gene that is central to DNA repair, there is a theoretical basis for concern regarding sensitivity to radiation carcinogenesis in. Associated malignant neoplasms: Risk of developing any invasive cancer was approximately 50% by age 30, and approximately 90% by age 70. The tumor spectrum includes osteogenic and chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, breast cancer, brain cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma.

Early -onset breast cancer accounts for 25% of all LFS-related cancers, followed by soft-tissue sarcoma, bone sarcoma, and brain tumors. The risks of sarcoma, female breast cancer, and hematopoietic malignancies in mutation carriers are more than 100 times greater than those seen in the general population. One specific TP53 mutation was reported to result in adrenocortical tumors in 9. 9% of carriers. Malignancies reported to be associated include melanoma, Wilms and other kidney tumors, gonadal germ cell, pancreatic, gastric, and choroid plexus, colorectal, and prostate cancers. The "classical" LFS malignancies comprise about 80% of all cancers that occur in LFS families.

The incidence of these cancers varies by age, with soft-tissue sarcomas, adrenal and brain tumors predominating before age 10, bone sarcoma the most frequent in the teen years, and breast and brain tumors comprising the majority after age 20. Relative to LFL families, kindreds meeting stringent LFS criteria have more brain tumors, earlier onset of breast cancer, and exclusive occurrence of adrenocortical carcinoma.

### Li-Fraumeni syndrome: a paradigm for the understanding of hereditary cancer predisposition [^115vgvaU]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare cancer predisposing condition caused by germline mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the TP53 transcription factor. LFS is typified by the development of a wide spectrum of childhood and adult-onset malignancies, which includes, among others, the lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndrome and, to a lesser extent, lymphoma. Accordingly, it is important that haematologists/oncologists be familiar with this pleiotropic hereditary cancer syndrome. The high cancer risk and variability in type and age of cancer onset have raised questions about the underlying biology and optimal treatment approaches for individuals with LFS. Since its description almost 50 years ago, many clinical and basic research investigations have provided insights into the pathogenesis, manifestations, genetic testing and management strategies for individuals with LFS. Here we provide an update on the current state of knowledge regarding LFS with an emphasis, where possible, on information relevant to practicing haematologists.

### Isa moderate-risk breast cancer gene or the younger sister of Li-Fraumeni? [^113Noo8p]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The CHEK2 gene is mostly considered as a moderate breast cancer gene with the result that many clinicians have a narrow focus. We present the 10-year journey of a man who had five different cancers and had iterative genetic testing including for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, eventually to discover a pathogenic variant in the CHEK2 gene, possibly explaining his numerous cancers. This diagnosis offered him closure which he had desperately sought for well over a decade. A pathogenic variant in the CHEK2 gene can potentially explain these cancers because of its function as a tumour suppressor gene. Consideration is warranted of what this means for individuals with CHEK2 variants who may develop multiple cancers, their prognosis and whether different treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or target agents would need modification. We encourage more research into the many faces of the CHEK2 gene and the potential for predisposition to multiple cancers.

### Baseline surveillance in Li-Fraumeni syndrome using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging: a meta-analysis [^113Ywzih]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Guidelines for clinical management in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a multiple-organ cancer predisposition condition, are limited. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) may play a role in surveillance of this high-risk population.

Objective

To assess the clinical utility of WBMRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers at baseline.

Data Sources

Clinical and research surveillance cohorts were identified through the Li-Fraumeni Exploration Research Consortium.

Study Selection

Cohorts that incorporated WBMRI for individuals with germline TP53 mutations from January 1, 2004, through October 1, 2016, were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted by investigators from each cohort independently and synthesized by 2 investigators. Random-effects meta-analysis methods were used to estimate proportions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportions of participants at baseline in whom a lesion was detected that required follow-up and in whom a new primary malignant neoplasm was detected.

Results

A total of 578 participants (376 female [65.1%] and 202 male [34.9%]; mean [SD] age, 33.2 [17.1] years) from 13 cohorts in 6 countries were included in the analysis. Two hundred twenty-five lesions requiring clinical follow-up were detected by WBMRI in 173 participants. Sixty-one lesions were diagnosed in 54 individuals as benign or malignant neoplasms. Overall, 42 cancers were identified in 39 individuals, with 35 new localized cancers treated with curative intent. The overall estimated detection rate for new, localized primary cancers was 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%).

Conclusions and Relevance

These data suggest clinical utility of baseline WBMRI in TP53 germline mutation carriers and may form an integral part of baseline clinical risk management in this high-risk population.

### Predictive diagnosis of the cancer prone Li-Fraumeni syndrome by accident: new challenges through whole genome array testing [^115Wi3Bt]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

However, we also identified a loss of the TP53 gene within the deleted region. TP53 regulates the cell cycle and functions as a tumour suppressor involved in preventing cancer. As such, TP53 has been designated as the "guardian of the genome". In fact, the TP53 gene is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. The overall lifetime risk of cancer in patients with TP53 germline mutations is in the range of 80–90%, with a risk as high as 40% within the first two decades of life.

This condition was named Li–Fraumeni syndrome after the physicians who first recognised it. The classical definition of the Li–Fraumeni syndrome is based on the following three parameters: (1) a proband with a sarcoma diagnosed before the age of 45; (2) a first degree relative with cancer before the age of 45; and (3) another first or second degree relative with either a sarcoma diagnosed at any age or any cancer diagnosed under the age of 45. Although sarcomas are quite frequently observed in Li–Fraumeni syndrome, a broad range of other tumours may occur including breast cancer, bone cancer, brain tumours, lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, leukaemia, adrenal cortical neoplasia, and others. Furthermore, more relaxed criteria were released for variations of a Li–Fraumeni-like syndrome.

### Marrow-ablative consolidation chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy delivered in a risk-adapted manner for newly diagnosed children with choroid plexus carcinoma [^114XPE6H]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) are early childhood cancers characterized by loss of TP53 function and poor survival. We are analyzing data on TP53 status, survival, and second cancers from the largest cohort of CPC receiving chemotherapy followed by consolidation with marrow-ablative chemotherapy (HDCx). Additionally, we discuss the rationale for targeted therapies for CPC patients. Currently, 8 of the 13 with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome-associated CPC were treated and continued CPC-free, indicating that HDCx improves CPC-free survival in young children with TP53 -mutated CPC. These data justify the inclusion of HDCx in the planned prospective international trial for children with TP53 -mutated CPC.

### Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: a new relative contraindication for breast conservation therapy [^112dcB1y]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence is overwhelming that breast conservation, which consists of lumpectomy and radiation, is equivalent to mastectomy for patients with early stage breast cancer. These 2 local therapy options are presented to patients with early stage breast cancer, and decisions are a personal choice after weighing the risks and benefits of both approaches. However, for some patients, breast conservation is not an option due to contraindications for radiation.

Radiation oncology residents are taught to quickly cite the standard contraindications for breast conservation, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome and scleroderma, which are both rare syndromes. The U.S. registry of Li-Fraumeni patients includes only 400 patients, and the prevalence of scleroderma has been estimated at 276 cases per million population. Radiation for Li-Fraumeni syndrome is discouraged due to the high risk of secondary cancers in this population. Radiation in the setting of scleroderma can cause exaggerated fibrosis that extends to underlying viscera outside of the radiation portal with risk of treatment-related mortality, although reports vary with regard to the degree of radiation toxicity.

Another rare syndrome that nearly exclusively affects women is lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), with a prevalence of approximately 9 patients per million population. This rare multisystem disease can affect the lungs and cause lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax. We performed a thorough literature search and were not able to identify any studies or reports on the use of breast conservation treatment in a patient with LAM; thus, we herein present the first case report on this topic.

### Guidelines for the Li-Fraumeni and heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes [^115WDwxv]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Scope of the guidelines

These guidelines have been elaborated by members of the European Reference Network (ERN) on the Genetic Tumour Risk Syndromes (GENTURIS) in order to integrate the available information with clinical utility and to assist health care professionals in the identification and management of patients with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, causing heritable TP53- related cancer (h TP53 rc) syndrome. In particular, these guidelines take into account the diversity of clinical presentations associated with germline TP53 variants, the variability of the TP53 variant penetrance, the role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the development of subsequent primary tumour and the medical benefit of surveillance protocols. These guidelines do not signify nor intend to be a legal standard of care, they should support clinical decision making, but never replace clinical professionals. This is particularly critical for h TP53 rc syndrome, considering the diversity of clinical expression related to germline TP53 variants.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^11313u7b]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) arising from germline TP53 mutation results in defective DNA repair and increased risk of multiple primary cancers beginning in childhood. Curative intent radiotherapy is often used to treat childhood cancer but its impact in children in LFS has not been reviewed. We undertook a retrospective case-series review of 4 children with a solid cancer diagnosed ≤ 16years to assess time and survival following second cancer diagnosis. Following radiotherapy for the first cancer diagnosis, median time to second primary cancer diagnosis was 13.3years and median survival 9.7years. Where no radiotherapy was received median time to second primary cancer diagnosis was 25.1years [Chi2 = 14.8, P < .0001; HR = 7.9 (95% CI:2.8–22.6)], and median survival of 29.2years [Chi2 = 12.5, P = 0.004, HR = 3.2 (95% CI: 1.5–6.6)]. Radiotherapy for first cancer in children with LFS is associated with adverse outcomes and ought be considered only in the absence of other potentially curative options. Where unavoidable, second cancer risks must be minimised.

### Guiding treatment choices for elderly patients with glioblastoma by a comprehensive geriatric assessment [^115LRWAe]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology and Risk Factors

The US Registry data show that the incidence of GBM increases with age, rising from 0.15 per 100,000 population per year in children to a peak of 15.03 per 100,000 aged 75 to 84 years. This means that nearly half of the patients are diagnosed with GBM aged 65 years or more and are thus designated as elderly patients. However, there is of course no definition of "elderly" with a clear cut calendar age limit as reflected by the different age limits in the studies ranging from 55 to 70 years.

Only very few patients (1–2%) with GBM are affected by a hereditary cancer syndrome like Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2, and usually develop GBM earlier in life. The main number of patients is sporadic GBM. GBM incidence seems to increase with age, potentially a result of cumulative exposure to still unidentified noxes and stressors. The only so far identified cause is ionizing radiation, as was most convincingly shown by a population-based study including more than 10,000 persons treated with low-dose irradiation for tinea capitis that showed a dose-dependent increased risk of 1.98/Gy (95% CI 0.73–4.69). Long-term survivors from childhood brain tumors treated with radiotherapy also show an increased risk for the development of malignant gliomas. Moreover, as sequences of human cytomegalovirus can be found in almost all malignant gliomas, an oncomodulatory role of the cytomegalovirus or of other yet unidentified viral interactions can be postulated. How this could be explored further or exploited for future therapy remains a matter of ongoing debate and research.

### Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma with anaplasia and BEND5-NTRK2 fusion in a young adult with a history of cranial radiation for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma [^112erDLv]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pediatric patients are at increased risk of glioma development after therapeutic radiation which is age- and dose/volume-dependent. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study reported a 8.7 standardized incidence ratio in children previously treated with therapeutic radiation compared to matched controls. Radiation-induced gliomas (RIG) are typically higher grade, present in atypical sites (eg, suprasellar region, cerebellum), and have a poor prognosis with a median survival of 11 months. Development of PXA following radiation is rare but has been reported. By definition, RIGs occur in a previously irradiated area, have sufficient latency period, have histology distinct from the primary tumor, and lack a cancer predisposition syndrome. Our patient's PXA occurred outside of the targeted field of previous radiation (Figure 1A and B), therefore classifying this tumor as a RIG, particularly in a patient with unknown cancer predisposition status, is speculative at best. However, solid tumors have been reported within a radiation field of 0.5 Gray, and secondary CNS malignancies have been reported in volumes that receive < 0.1 Gray. According to our patient's treatment plan, she received about 1.4 Gy exposure in the likely area of involvement (Figure 1B). Therefore, the effect of this scatter contributing to neoplastic transformation in our patient should be considered.

Survivors of childhood rhabdomyosarcomas have an increased risk of developing a secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), which has been found to be independent of the use of therapeutic radiation to the primary site. This suggests that the presence of an underlying predisposition variant is likely contributing to this risk. A retrospective analysis of the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) program reported that the majority of SMN were sarcomas, regardless of primary RMS site. Only two gliomas were reported, however, these were in patients with lower extremity RMS who did not receive any therapeutic radiation. A large cohort study by the Children's Oncology Group reported that 7.3% of children with RMS harbored a cancer predisposition variant, of which 10% had embryonal RMS and 3% had alveolar RMS. As our patient reportedly tested negative for Li-Fraumeni syndrome many years ago, we strongly recommended repeat and expanded testing for cancer predisposition syndromes. Unfortunately, our patient has declined further genetic testing.

Along the same lines, somatic inactivation of the trans allele — via the LOH, cnLOH, or copy gain LOH (cgLOH) — is a common occurrence in patients with Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) — rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by PGV in TP53. LFS patients are at an increased risk of developing multiple cancers, including ~4% incidence of hematological malignancies. In tumors arising in LFS individuals, LOH/cnLOH of TP53 was seen in a majority (86%) of cases that appeared to have occurred as early as in utero.
3 Prior cytotoxic and immunosuppressive therapies. Cancer survivors are at a 4.7‐fold higher risk of developing leukemia compared to the general population. As the effectiveness of cancer‐directed therapies has improved survival, long‐term complications of these therapies have come to focus. For instance, the incidence of t‐MN has risen over the last two decades: from 0.04/10 000 new cases between 2001 and 2007 to 0.20/100 000 new cases between 2008 and 2014.

### Increased risk for thyroid carcinoma in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome… [^111DRuBq]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract 10612 Background: Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome are predisposed to a 90% lifetime risk of cancer, thus undergoing extensive cancer surveillance. While thyroid cancer is not a core LFS-associated malignancy, increased incidence of thyroid carcinoma has been reported within the LFS tumor spectrum. In the general population, thyroid cancer incidence has soared mainly via incidental detection. We investigated the rate of thyroid carcinoma in relation to p53 mutational process and increased screening. Results: Among 600 patients from 400 families with LFS, 39 patients from 36 families developed thyroid carcinoma at an average age of 42 years. The majority of LFS patients with thyroid carcinoma were female. Thyroid carcinoma was the presenting cancer diagnosis in 17 patients.

Over 70% of thyroid carcinoma diagnoses were detected incidentally either via LFS cancer screening or via an imaging study unrelated to LFS screening. Intermediate to high risk of recurrence based on tumor characteristics was noted in 17 patients, warranting consideration of radioactive iodine therapy, including tall cell subtype, oncocytic or follicular histology, incomplete resection, extrathyroidal extension, and greater than five positive lymph nodes. Five of these 17 patients received RAI. The SIR for thyroid carcinoma in LFS compared to SEER was 13. The SIR was elevated for LFS patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma both prior to and after genetic testing.

Conclusions: In this multi-institutional cohort, a 6–9% prevalence rate of thyroid carcinoma was observed in LFS patients and families, with > 70% of the tumors identified incidentally. The rate of thyroid carcinoma in LFS is significantly elevated over the general population.

The question of mosaicism

The presence of mosaic TP53 alterations should be considered in patients with sporadic cancers strongly suggestive of a disease-causing TP53 variant, such as childhood ACC, choroid plexus carcinoma, and breast cancer before 31 years of age and in patients with multiple primary tumours belonging to the TP53 core tumour spectrum. The absence of detectable TP53 variants after analysis of blood DNA using NGS, even performed at a high depth, does not guarantee the absence of mosaic alterations which can be restricted to other tissues than blood. Therefore, a complete screening for TP53 disease causing variants in highly suggestive situations should include analysis of tumour tissue, which is so far not systematically performed. In contrast, the detection of a TP53 variant in a small fraction of NGS reads from blood DNA does not always correspond to a mosaic alteration and molecular geneticists should be aware of two pitfalls: the first corresponds to circulating tumour DNA, commonly observed in patients with metastatic cancers. For instance, the detection of a TP53 variant in the blood from a patient with metastatic high grade serous ovary carcinoma is likely to correspond to circulating tumour DNA, considering the very high frequency of somatic TP53 alterations in these malignancies (> 95%); the second is due to clonal haematopoiesis, corresponding to the occurrence, in hematopoietic stem cells of somatic TP53 alterations conferring a growth advantage. Clonal haematopoiesis was initially reported in patients over 70 years of age, but can be detected from 30 years of age. The frequency of clonal haematopoiesis is increasing with age, tobacco use and exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore, when a TP53 variant is detected in a small fraction of NGS reads from blood, it is critical, before concluding that the presence represents a mosaic TP53 alteration, to respect the following rules: (i) consider the clinical presentation (suggestive or not of the presence of a disease-causing TP53 variant) and medical history (treatments, metastases, etc…) and (ii) confirm the presence of the variant in the tissue from which the tumour originated. Further confirmation in an unaffected tissue with no lymphocyte content, such as a hair follicle, skin biopsy or nail clippings, should also be considered if circulating tumour DNA is suspected from metastatic disease.

Genetic Predisposition

Retinoblastoma

The tumor suppressor gene retinoblastoma (RB1) serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint regulator (Table 3). Lack of the allele, RB1, displays Mendelian inheritance patterns in an autosomal dominant fashion. Due to the mutation with subsequent loss of this tumor suppressor gene, various neoplasms can result including osteosarcoma, melanoma, breast, and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Although RB1 mutation results in classic retinoblastoma of the eye, osteosarcoma remains the second most common malignancy in this patient cohort. Screening for retinoblastomas is done in neonates with red reflex testing before discharge from the neonatal nursery.

Table 3
Summary of Key Points

Secondary malignancies in patients with retinoblastoma, including osteosarcoma, are common, particularly in the setting of radiation therapy which historically was part of the treatment algorithm. Rates of development are around 13.1% to 38.5% at 30 years or longer after irradiation. However, current rates of secondary malignancy are likely decreasing today because radiation therapy is becoming less frequently used in these patients from 30.5% to 2.6% of cases. Screening for sarcoma development in patients with heritable retinoblastoma has not been shown to have benefit.

Li-Fraumeni

Another predisposition syndrome, Li-Fraumeni, has a high association with numerous malignancies. Like RB1 dysfunction, TP53 serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint regulator and inherited loss of function mutations displays Mendelian inheritance characteristics in an autosomal dominant fashion. Heterozygous germline variation in the TP53 allele results in a lifetime cancer risk of ≥ 90% for women and ≥ 70% for men. The five most common malignancies in these patients are adrenocortical carcinomas, breast cancer, central nervous system tumors, osteosarcomas, and soft-tissue sarcomas.

These patients tend to develop malignancies early in life with 41% occurring before age 18 years, with osteosarcoma occurring in approximately 12% of individuals. Families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome do demonstrate anticipation as well, likely secondary to telomerase shortening. Overall, 3% of osteosarcoma cases are found in Li-Fraumeni patients. Cancer-screening guidelines for these patients have been described by multiple organizations. Screening includes whole-body MRI, laboratory studies, and endoscopy. The Toronto protocol for screening has been shown to have improved overall survival compared with no surveillance.

### Radiation-sensitive genetically susceptible pediatric sub-populations [^113QbEcg]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Major advances in pediatric cancer treatment have resulted in substantial improvements in survival. However, concern has emerged about the late effects of cancer therapy, especially radiation-related second cancers. Studies of childhood cancer patients with inherited cancer syndromes can provide insights into the interaction between radiation and genetic susceptibility to multiple cancers. Children with retinoblastoma (Rb), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) are at substantial risk of developing radiation-related second and third cancers. A radiation dose-response for bone and soft-tissue sarcomas has been observed in hereditary Rb patients, with many of these cancers occurring in the radiation field. Studies of NF1 patients irradiated for optic pathway gliomas have reported increased risks of developing another cancer associated with radiotherapy. High relative risks for second and third cancers were observed for a cohort of 200 LFS family members, especially children, possibly related to radiotherapy. Children with NBCCS are very sensitive to radiation and develop multiple basal cell cancers in irradiated areas. Clinicians following these patients should be aware of their increased genetic susceptibility to multiple primary malignancies enhanced by sensitivity to ionizing radiation.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: a 2023 update [^113Jmkhs]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The 20-year post-HCT cumulative incidence is 6.5% for basal cell carcinoma and 3.4% for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The risk of melanoma is also significantly increased. Areas of previously irradiated skin are the most vulnerable to developing carcinomas, further exacerbated by a history of excessive sun exposure and chronic skin GVHD, which itself can be triggered or aggravated by sun exposure. The role of IST in precipitating skin cancer is another a concern. Screening and prevention of skin malignancies mimic the guidance offered for skin cGVHD (see Dermatologic Complications).

Survivors also are at higher risk for CNS tumors and sarcoma. Meningioma is the most frequent CNS tumor, although more aggressive histologies may occur. Heightened awareness for symptoms should be emphasized in patients after cranial irradiation or TBI. Survivors are at risk for secondary bone cancers, with a standardized incidence ratio of 8.5 to 13. Risk factors may include underlying cancer predisposition syndromes (eg, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia) and radiation therapy. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion in patients who present with relevant symtoms.

### Li-Fraumeni syndrome: cancer risk assessment and clinical management [^11144JK8]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Carriers of germline mutations in the TP53 gene, encoding the cell-cycle regulator and tumour suppressor p53, have a markedly increased risk of cancer-related morbidity and mortality during both childhood and adulthood, and thus require appropriate and effective cancer risk management. However, the predisposition of such patients to multiorgan tumorigenesis presents a specific challenge for cancer risk management programmes. Herein, we review the clinical implications of germline mutations in TP53 and the evidence for cancer screening and prevention strategies in individuals carrying such mutations, as well as examining the potential psychosocial implications of lifelong management for a ubiquitous cancer risk. In addition, we propose an evidence-based framework for the clinical management of TP53 mutation carriers and provide a platform for addressing the management of other cancer predisposition syndromes that can affect multiple organs.

### Radiotherapy-induced malignancies in breast cancer patients with TP53 pathogenic germline variants (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) [^111KZ8Kc]. Familial Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The risk of radiotherapy-induced malignancies (RIMs) is a concern when treating Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni Like (LFL) patients. However, the type of TP53 pathogenic germline variant may possibly influence this risk. TP53 p.R337H mutation is particularly prevalent in Brazil. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients with pathogenic TP53 variants treated for localized breast cancer in a Brazilian cohort. We evaluated retrospectively a cohort of patients with germline TP53 pathogenic variants treated for localized breast cancer between December 1999 and October 2017. All patients were followed by the Hereditary Cancer Group of an academic cancer center. Our primary objective was to evaluate the occurrence of RIMs after adjuvant radiotherapy. Sixteen patients were evaluated; 10 (62.5%) had a germline TP53 p.R337H pathogenic variant. Median age was 39.8 years. Thirteen patients had invasive ductal carcinoma: 8 (61.5%) were hormone receptor-positive; 6 (46.1%), human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified. Three patients had ductal carcinoma in situ. Most patients (N = 12/16, 75%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of 52.5 months, 2 patients (2/12, 16.6%) had RIMs. One had a fibrosarcoma and the other, a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. In the group treated with radiotherapy, one distant recurrence was diagnosed (1/12), and no loco-regional recurrence occurred. Among 4 patients who did not receive radiotherapy, 2 presented with loco-regional recurrence. In this cohort of patients with LFS enriched in TP53 p.R337H pathogenic variant, the incidence of RIMs after treatment of localized breast cancer was lower than previous literature. Nevertheless, rates of RIMs were still alarming. Early molecular diagnosis and careful evaluation of treatment risks and benefits are essential for these patients.

### Systemic treatment strategies for patients with hereditary breast cancer syndromes [^112kKf2W]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Hereditary breast cancer syndromes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and constitute a unique patient population, making up approximately 5%-10% of breast cancer cases in the United States. By virtue of the germline mutations that define these syndromes, invasive breast cancers in these patients have unique mechanisms that can be rationally targeted for therapeutic opportunities distinct from standard of care treatments in nongermline mutation associated breast cancers. This review intends to describe existing data on several of the most common hereditary breast cancer syndromes, including BRCA-related breast cancer syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome, specifically focusing on rational therapeutics utilized in these distinct patient subgroups and completed or ongoing clinical trials evaluating their efficacy. By exploiting the distinct biologic features associated with these syndromes, tailored treatment strategies have the potential for improved efficacy and lower toxicity. Knowledge of the emergence of these targeted cancer therapies is critical for appropriate management in these patients, extending beyond treatment to highlight the need for appropriate genetic screening to allow for early recognition of these patients and therefore appropriate treatment.

Implications For Practice

Molecular testing allows for identification of germline mutations that place individuals at high risk for breast cancer and that are associated with distinct histopathology and molecular characteristics that define the invasive breast cancer cases that these patients develop. These unique characteristics may ultimately provide rational targets for systemic treatments with improvements in both morbidity and efficacy. Identification of patients with these germline mutations is important for not only appropriate screening and prophylaxis, but knowledge of therapies specifically targeting several of the most common hereditary breast cancer syndromes is essential to ensure appropriate treatment of invasive breast cancers in these patients.

### A systematic review of high-grade glioma associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^115LMHa8]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by an increased risk of early-onset and multiple tumors across various organ systems, predominantly linked to germline TP53 mutations. While commonly associated neoplasms include sarcomas, breast cancer, and adrenocortical carcinoma, the occurrence of high-grade gliomas (HGG), including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), in LFS patients is less documented and typically presents at a younger age relative to sporadic cases. A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on clinical studies and case reports that explore the association between HGG and LFS. A comprehensive PubMed search was used to capture relevant studies. The inclusion criteria focused on patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LFS and histopathologically verified HGG. A total of 248 articles were initially identified, with 8 studies meeting the final inclusion criteria after independent review and consensus. Overall, 8 studied reported on patients with either WHO grade 3 or 4 gliomas in the setting of LFS. In total these studies represent 12 patients, with 8 (66%) WHO grade 4, and 4 (33%) WHO grade 3. 9 (75%) patients underwent maximal safe resection, 5 (42%) underwent concurrent TMZ and EBRT. 9 (75%) patients underwent external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), 1 (8%) underwent intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and 1 (8%) underwent adjuvant treatment with tumor treating fields (TTF) therapy. Overall chemotherapy utilization was 75% with 9 patients receiving some form of chemotherapy. The median time to recurrence following initial treatment was 7 months (IQR: 2.00–7.00). Time to progression was variable, ranging from 5.1 months to 7 years. 64% of patients succumbed to their disease with a median OS of 17 months across studies. LFS associated HGGs are a genetically heterogenous entity. Detailed study of outcomes reported in the literature with respect to these genetics will develop further insight into therapeutic response and prognostication.

### Health-related quality of life and fear of progression in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^114WDcLU]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Li‐Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome (CPS) caused by (likely) pathogenic germline variants in the TP53 gene (P/LP TP53) (Li et al.). It was most recently defined as a spectrum, comprising four subtypes (phenotypic LFS, LFS, attenuated LFS, and incidental LFS) (Kratz et al.). P/LP TP53 variant carriers (VC) have a highly elevated lifetime risk of developing cancer. Risk estimation is challenging, as cancer penetrance varies according to mutation type, age, and sex (Amadou et al.). Thus, different overall risk estimations are found in the literature, varying from 80% to nearly 100% of participants developing cancer by 70 years of age (Amadou et al; Mai et al.). Owing to the fact that LFS is a dominantly inherited CPS, a striking familial cancer history is common, with an estimated range of only 7–20 percent for de novo cases (Jhaveri et al.).

### Recurrence of mucosal melanoma in Li-Fraumeni syndrome: a follow-up of an index case [^117WwR1J]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case demonstrates recurrence of the original primary mucosal melanoma in this index patient, 8 years after therapy. Although PCR-based sequencing of the relapse biopsy revealed mutations separate from the TP53 mutation of the initial biopsy, a metastatic process was still favored, given the fact that discordances between primary and metastatic melanomas can be observed. Original melanoma cells escaping the initial lymph node dissection, surviving aggressive radiation treatment, and then clinically re-emerging 8 years later represents the most likely explanation for this patient's recurrence. An additional possible explanation includes a Spitz nevus, which underwent benign metastasis and then transformed into melanoma after radiation therapy. Another possible explanation would be nevi present in the patient's lymph nodes that transformed into melanoma under the influence of radiation.

Selecting the most appropriate therapy for these undescribed cases poses a significant challenge, as it is important to consider the benefits and risks of adjuvant therapy in LFS, along with the need for long-term follow-up to monitor for formation of second primary malignancies. Although radiation-induced tumors are rare and typically expected to occur more than 10 years after the radiation exposure, cases have been described in which this phenomenon occurs more frequently and much sooner for patients with LFS after undergoing radiotherapy. These findings suggest that employing a more conservative approach that avoids radiotherapy may represent the best treatment route. Despite the increased theoretical risk of developing a second primary malignancy in patients with LFS after receiving radiotherapy, this patient displayed no major evidence of a second primary malignancy. She instead developed recurrence of the initial aggressive malignancy targeted by the radiotherapeutic attempt for locoregional control. This case may provide support for using this same treatment strategy when confronted with similar scenarios in the future. Ongoing surveillance of this index patient remains crucial for further characterization of treatment roles in this rare disease. Recently proposed surveillance guidelines for LFS include annual clinical examination, with special attention to prior sites of radiotherapy, in addition to annual whole-body MRI, breast MRI for women between the age of 20 and 65, and annual brain MRI until the age of 50. At the time of writing, the patient is undergoing another 4 cycles of immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, with plans for repeat surgery.

### Outcome and molecular analysis of young children with choroid plexus carcinoma treated with non-myeloablative therapy: results from the SJYC07 trial [^111nr3PT]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

The previously observed survival advantage of patients undergoing GTR/NTR could not be reproduced in our cohort, however, owing to the small number of patients in our cohort who did not achieve a GTR/NTR, it seems unwise to argue against aggressive surgical management in this disease. Our surgical approach was influenced by these prior findings and our patient population was managed accordingly. If GTR/NTR was not achieved after the first surgery, a staged approach was taken to allow for repeat surgery after 2–4 cycles of induction chemotherapy. In this way 77% of the population achieved a GTR/NTR before completion of therapy. Consequently, owing to our favorable outcomes, our recommendation is to continue this approach in future management of CPC.

Similar to radiation therapy, the benefit of the maintenance chemotherapy was hard to ascertain in this small population whose outcome was so heavily predicated by TP53 mutational status. Eight patients received maintenance and six survived while two, both with TP53 mutations, died. Thus, the utility of maintenance remains questionable and with no appreciable benefit our impression is that this additional therapy is not necessary.

Perhaps the most important, but unsatisfactory, finding of this study is that TP53 mutant CPC harbor a very poor prognosis. The poor survival observed herein, confirms previous findings and helps to define a high-risk group within CPC. The unsatisfactory aspect of this finding lies in the knowledge that, at present, a better, more curative, therapeutic alternative is not available for these patients. Nonetheless, determining the TP53 mutational status in CPC at the time of diagnosis is paramount for 3 reasons: (1) this knowledge allows oncologists to better prepare and guide parents through therapeutic decisions, (2) this feature, when positive, identifies a very high risk population in whom alternative novel therapeutic options should be explored and, (3) this identifies a population for whom germline testing should be offered. As seen in our cohort, about half of the patients had TP53 mutated CPC and one-half of these carried the TP53 mutation in their germline. This translates to approximately one-third of CPC patients having Li Fraumeni syndrome which predisposes them and any affected family member to almost 100% lifetime risk of cancer. Therefore identification of patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome is important not just for the patient and their prognosis but also for the family as it informs on other affected family members and the need for additional surveillance.

### Li-Fraumeni syndrome: imaging features and guidelines [^1119whRx]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations of the tumor protein p53 gene (TP53), which encodes the p53 transcription factor, also known as the "guardian of the genome". The most common types of cancer found in families with LFS include sarcomas, leukemia, breast malignancies, brain tumors, and adrenocortical cancers. Osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma are the most common sarcomas. Patients with LFS are at increased risk of developing early-onset gastric and colon cancers. They are also at increased risk for several other cancers involving the thyroid, lungs, ovaries, and skin. The lifetime risk of cancer in individuals with LFS is greater than 70% in males and greater than 90% in females. Some patients with LFS develop multiple primary cancers during their lifetime, and guidelines have been established for screening these patients. Whole-body MRI is the preferred modality for annual screening of these patients. The management guidelines for patients with LFS vary, as these individuals are more susceptible to developing radiation-induced cancers-for example, women with LFS and breast cancer are treated with total mastectomy instead of lumpectomy with radiation to the breast. The authors review the role of imaging, imaging guidelines, and imaging features of tumors in the setting of LFS. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### F18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography / computed tomography screening in Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^1161nXDv]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) have an inherited cancer predisposition to a diverse array of malignancies beginning early in life; survivors of one cancer have a markedly elevated risk of additional primary tumors. The underlying genetic defect in the majority of the families is a germline mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. The diversity of tumors and rarity of families have contributed to the difficulty in devising effective screening recommendations for members of LFS kindreds.

Objective

To gather preliminary data with which to evaluate F18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging as a potential surveillance modality to detect early malignancies in asymptomatic members of LFS kindreds.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Members of LFS families with documented germline TP53 mutations or obligate carrier status, no history of cancer within 5 years of enrollment, and no symptoms of cancer or ill-health were offered FDG-PET/CT scanning as a screening test in a comprehensive US cancer center from 2006 to 2007. Scans were initially reviewed clinically, then centrally reviewed by an expert radiologist.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary outcome was the detection of new primary cancers using FDG-PET/CT scanning.

Results

Of 15 individuals, baseline FDG-PET/CT scan identified asymptomatic cancers in 3 (20%). Two individuals had papillary thyroid cancers (stage II and stage III) and one individual had stage II esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Conclusions

These preliminary data provide the first evidence for a potential cancer surveillance strategy that may be worthy of further investigation for patients with LFS. Concerns about radiation exposure and other challenges inherent in screening high-risk patients will require further consideration.

### Long-term survival following chemoradiation in locoregional recurrent germlineMutated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^1166nqPV]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Radiation therapy for PDA treatment is controversial, but molecular determinants of clinical benefit are poorly characterized. In unselected patients with locally advanced unresectable PDA, the median OS following chemotherapy with and without chemoradiation therapy is approximately 20 months. The 2-year local progression-free survival is less than 25% following moderate doses (50–54 Gy) of radiation. This case highlights that patient selection may create a more promising future for radiation therapy as a therapeutic option.

PDA is a multifactorial genetic disease and is associated with several inherited syndromes for which predisposing genes have been identified, including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (STK11/LKB1), familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome (CDKN2A), hereditary breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer syndrome (BRCA1 and BRCA2), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), Juvenile polyposis syndrome (SMAD4/BMPR1A), Lynch syndrome (mismatch repair MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53), hereditary pancreatitis (PRSS1 / SPINK1), as well as cancers associated with loss/mutations of PALB2 and NBN.

The ATM gene plays a critical role in the DNA damage response system. It was first identified in 1995 during the evaluation of the autosomal recessive ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome, which occurs in 1/40,000 to 1/300,000 live birthsand is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, telangiectasias of the conjunctiva and skin, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and increased rate of malignancies, in particular lymphoma and leukemia earlier in life. Germline ATM heterozygosity, which is reported in 0.5% to 1% of the population, does not cause any of the classic ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome manifestations but has been estimated to confer a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of female breast cancer compared with the general population, as well as a 4-fold increased risk of prostate cancer, and PDA (cumulative risk 9.5% by age 80 noncarriers).

### Genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer [^114AqjG3]. ASBrS (2019). High credibility.

Impact of genetic testing results on management recommendations — identification of patients with pathogenic variants in these genes can influence management in terms of high-risk screening and risk reduction as well as therapeutic options related to surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies. For example, identifying that a breast cancer patient has a BRCA1 pathogenic variant provides that patient the opportunity to learn of her elevated risk for contralateral breast cancer as well as of ovarian cancer and to make educated decisions to reduce those risks, and studies are underway to determine whether these patients also might benefit from PARP inhibitors being included in their adjuvant therapy regimen. Another example is that radiation is relatively contraindicated in patients with TP53 pathogenic variants (associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) due to their increased risk of developing radiation-induced secondary malignancies. Identifying a patient who has a pathogenic variant that indicates high hereditary breast cancer risk can have a profound impact on that patient's health and management, and it has potential impact on that patient's family members who should be counselled to consider testing for the mutation identified in the family with results that can guide risk of breast cancer development and consideration of risk management strategies.

### Guidelines for the Li-Fraumeni and heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes [^116AL7Sv]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Fifty years after the recognition of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), our perception of cancers related to germline alterations of TP53 has drastically changed: (i) germline TP53 alterations are often identified among children with cancers, in particular soft-tissue sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, central nervous system tumours, or among adult females with early breast cancers, without familial history. This justifies the expansion of the LFS concept to a wider cancer predisposition syndrome designated heritable TP53-related cancer (hTP53rc) syndrome; (ii) the interpretation of germline TP53 variants remains challenging and should integrate epidemiological, phenotypical, bioinformatics prediction, and functional data; (iii) the penetrance of germline disease-causing TP53 variants is variable, depending both on the type of variant (dominant-negative variants being associated with a higher cancer risk) and on modifying factors; (iv) whole-body MRI (WBMRI) allows early detection of tumours in variant carriers and (v) in cancer patients with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, radiotherapy, and conventional genotoxic chemotherapy contribute to the development of subsequent primary tumours. It is critical to perform TP53 testing before the initiation of treatment in order to avoid in carriers, if possible, radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies. In children, the recommendations are to perform clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound every 6 months, annual WBMRI and brain MRI from the first year of life, if the TP53 variant is known to be associated with childhood cancers. In adults, the surveillance should include every year clinical examination, WBMRI, breast MRI in females from 20 until 65 years and brain MRI until 50 years.

### Frequency of radiation therapy-induced malignancies in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and early-stage breast cancer and the influence of radiation therapy technique [^116tYiB2]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in female patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a condition associated with an increased risk of various malignancies, including radiation therapy (RT)-induced malignancies (RIM) within previously irradiated areas. Our study aimed to assess the incidence of RIM in patients with LFS and early-stage BC treated with adjuvant RT, including the effect of RT dose and technique.

Methods and Materials

We examined patients with a germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variant diagnosed with early-stage BC and monitored by a hereditary cancer team at a single cancer center. The study endpoints included RIM frequency, the association of RIM with the dose and type of RT (2-dimensional [2D] RT, 3-dimensional [3D] RT, and intensity modulated RT [IMRT]), and BC recurrence.

Results

We analyzed 48 patients with a median age of 39 years (range, 21–62). The majority (71%) had the TP53 R337H variant, and 87% were unaware of their LFS diagnosis at the time of BC treatment. Treatment modalities included mastectomy (62%), (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (66%), and RT (62%), with RT being more common after breast-conserving surgery (87% vs 46% with mastectomy, P = 0.010). Among the 30 patients treated with RT, 10% developed RIM in the irradiated field, consisting of 3 soft tissue malignancies. RT dose (≤ 40.8 or > 40.8 Gy) did not influence RIM occurrence, but the type of RT did. RIM was observed in 100% of cases with 2D RT (2/2), 50% with IMRT (1/2), and 0% with 3D RT (0/16) (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Our study underscores a concerning rate of RIM after adjuvant RT, emphasizing the importance of a thorough risk-benefit evaluation before recommending RT, with preference for its avoidance if possible. Although subgroup sizes were limited, the risk of RIM appeared to be influenced by the RT technique, with higher rates observed with 2D RT and IMRT compared with 3D RT. Early TP53 testing is essential to guide the BC treatment plan.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^114NsYdT]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Survival with or without XRT to treat the first primary cancer. Survival following, as first primary cancer: adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (A); soft-tissue sarcoma/osteosarcoma (OS/STS) (B).

Nine children received XRT for the first primary cancer and subsequently developed a second primary cancer. All 9 second primary cancers were OS/STS, and all developed in the radiation field (P < .0001). Second cancers were new primary cancers and not recurrences of the first cancer as indicated by different histology (Table S1).

Overall survival after the first cancer diagnosis was significantly shorter where XRT was received for the first cancer compared to when XRT was not received (XRT-median survival 9.7 years; no XRT-median survival 29.2 years; χ 2 = 12.5, P = 0.0004, HR = 3.2 [95% CI = 1.5 to 6.6]) (Figure 2, A). Survival after second primary cancer diagnosis was not significantly reduced where XRT was used as treatment for the first primary cancer (XRT median survival = 4.1 years; no XRT median survival = 8.5 years, χ 2 = 3.6, P = 0.0571, HR = 3.3 [95% CI = 1.1 to 9.6]).

### Germline TP53 mutations undergo copy number gain years prior to tumor diagnosis [^111xSFzW]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by the early onset of a spectrum of childhood and adulthood cancers including adrenocortical carcinomas, soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, brain tumors and pre-menopausal breast cancers. More than 70–80% of patients who fit the clinical definitions of LFS harbor pathogenic germline variants (mutations) in TP53, a tumor suppressor gene which coordinates the cellular response to DNA damage –. Current LFS patient management focuses on identifying and treating tumors at early stages through intensive multimodal surveillance protocols. It is thought that TP53 mutation carriers may be at a greater risk of developing radiation and chemotherapy-induced second primaries. However, there is little direct evidence to confirm this and while caution is recommended in the use of radiation in LFS patients, current treatment protocols for LFS-associated tumors do not differ from that of their sporadic counterparts. Several studies have shown an elevated number of structural variants in tumors from LFS patients, as well as frequent chromothripsis, and an enrichment for single base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures SBS3, SBS8 and SBS13 –. Critical questions remain unanswered. What are the recurrent second hits following germline mutation of TP53? How do LFS tumors evolve? How do the effects of treatment manifest in subsequent primary tumors in these patients?

### Reply to kratz et al [^116Ua2Ka]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We thank Kratz et al. for their constructive comments which are mostly focused on the differences with the guidelines elaborated in the framework of an international consortium coordinated by Canadian and US teams in 2017.

In medical genetics, the paradigm of cystic fibrosis and CFTR -related disorders has shown that it may be appropriate, not only for health professionals but also for patients, to expand the definition of a syndrome to a wider molecularly based definition, in order to highlight the diversity of phenotypes associated with germline variants. Therefore, we think that it is indeed appropriate to expand the Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) toward to a wider and molecularly based cancer predisposition syndrome, designated heritable TP53- related cancer syndrome. We agree that the recommendation of testing patients presenting only jaw osteosarcoma is so far not supported by published articles but only, as we indicated, on the experience of certain centres. Whereas we considered that it was not justified at the present time to systematically test all children with osteosarcoma (the mutation detection rate being estimated up to 3.8%), the recurrent identification of germline disease-causing TP53 variants in patients with jaw osteosarcoma, an infrequent location as compared to long bones, lead us to formulate this recommendation. It seems that our colleagues have overinterpreted the statement "Testing for disease-causing TP53 variants should be performed before starting treatment in order to avoid in variant carriers, if possible, radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapy and to prioritize surgical treatments". We fully agree that, in cancer patients carrying disease-causing TP53 variants, the first priority is to effectively treat the tumours but we believe that a multidisciplinary team should discuss the risks of recurrence and subsequent primary tumours before the initiation of treatment and choose the best therapy. For instance, after identification of a germline TP53 disease-causing variant in a young woman with invasive, T1N0 breast cancer mastectomy should be offered instead of breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy. The previously published guidelines recommend performing (in all germline TP53 variant carriers), a medical follow-up including annual whole-body MRI (WBMRI) and brain MRI starting from the first year of age, independently of the personal and medical history and type of TP53 variant. However, we must now recognize that the global penetrance of germline TP53 variants has been overestimated, likely depending on so far unrecognized modifying factors. More importantly, we must be aware that only a minor fraction of germline TP53 variant carriers worldwide, and in particular in the USA, have currently access to this intensive protocol. In our guideline, we advocate for a stratified strategy, by recommending presymptomatic testing and the intensive protocol in childhood from birth, under the following conditions: "the index case has developed a childhood cancer; or childhood cancers have been observed within the family; or this variant has already been detected in other families with childhood cancers; or this variant corresponds to a dominant-negative missense variant". However, we also carefully open the door by indicating that testing children in families with only early-onset adult cancers can be considered, but only after careful discussion with the parents in order to address the burden, and uncertain benefits, of surveillance in childhood. Our colleagues consider that the surveillance interval that we propose in children for the detection of adrenocortical carcinoma is too long, compared to the interval previously recommended (6 vs. 3–4 months). They may be right (especially until the age 5, probably not above the age 10), but we are not aware of studies demonstrating the additional value of performing a follow-up every 3–4 months. All the studies, except one, published so far and reporting the efficiency in TP53 v ariant carriers of WBMRI, in terms of tumour detection rate, have been performed without Gadolinium enhancement, which leads to this recommendation. In females with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, breast cancer risk increases significantly after the second decade with a peak between 30–44 years and cumulative risk reaches a plateau before 60. Therefore, we think that it is appropriate to fix an age limit for breast MRI at 65 years. A recent review on brain tumours in TP53 variant carriers has confirmed that brain tumours present a bimodal distribution with the highest peak in young children before 5 years of age and a small peak in adults observed between the third and fourth decades. This supports our proposal to perform brain MRI until 50 years. Finally, we confirm that the studies, which had suggested that colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with germline TP53 variants, suffer from certain limitations: the first reported in a series of 397 patients, from 64 LFS families, 16 cases of CRC (4%). The lifetime risk for CRC is estimated in the general population to 4%. Furthermore, among the patients with CRC, the majority had not been tested themselves but were first- or second-degree relatives of TP53 variant carriers. In a second article, the authors reported in a series of 467 patients with CRC at age 40 years or younger, six germline TP53 variants but examination of these variants, based on the current classification criteria, shows that only two out of the six variants meet criteria for being classified as a class 4 or 5 variant. A third study reported colorectal tumours in 8 among 93 patients with germline TP53 variants (8.6%), but the authors did not provide data on TP53 variants. As cancer geneticists and oncologists, we highlight that the risk of overloading the medical follow-up in high genetic risk individuals is to alter the compliance of the patients.

### The first two confirmed sub-saharan African families with germline TP53 mutations causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^117GgbV5]. Familial Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare inherited cancer syndrome characterised by the early onset of specific cancers. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is associated with germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene, TP53. This study reports the first cases of molecularly confirmed LFS germline mutations in sub-Saharan Africa. Three black African patients, all with LFS-associated cancers, were seen through the Clinical and Counselling Section of the Division of Human Genetics at the National Health Laboratory Service and University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, during 2011–2012. All three patients (two were related) were recruited into this research study. Sequence analysis of the coding region of the TP53 gene identified a Class IV (likely pathogenic) variant, c.326T > C (p. Phe109Ser), in the two related patients, and a known pathogenic mutation, c.1010G > A (p. Arg337His), also referred to as the Brazilian founder mutation, in the other patient. A confirmed diagnosis in these patients will assist in tailored medical management (it is recommended that individuals carrying a germline TP53 mutation avoid radiotherapy as this might cause secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies) and in addition, genetic testing of at-risk family members can be offered. Very little is known and documented on LFS in African individuals. Despite the small number of patients in this study, the results support the need for diagnostic genetic testing for LFS in South Africa.

### Do hereditary syndrome-related gynecologic cancers have any specific features? [^112JZBVp]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Li-fraumeni syndrome

Li-fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an extremely rare autosomal-dominant hereditary disorder characterized by a germline mutation in the tumour-suppression gene p53, which leads to an estimated 50-fold risk over the general population of developing several types of cancer, more than half occurring before age 30. Although endometrial and ovarian cancers have been found to occur excessively in at least some families who have met criteria for LFS, their link to the syndrome is not definitely established, occurring at a much lower rate than other cancer types, like breast cancer.

Actually, the fact that distal fallopian tubes of women with LFS are exquisitely prone to developing p53 signatures, identical to those described in BRCA1/2-mutations carriers and general population, does not mean an association with ovarian cancer, as at least one more genotoxic event is needed to produce the malignant phenotype.

There are no studies specifically examining the relation between LFS and endometrial cancer.

### Surgery for Li Fraumeni syndrome: pushing the limits of surgical oncology [^112eG4qr]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Li Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome due to a germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. It results in multiple primary neoplasms in children and adults. A common question when faced with a Li Fraumeni patient who develops multiple primary cancers and/or recurrences is what is the proper treatment? Data suggests that ionizing radiation exposure increases the incidence of second malignancies in the Li Fraumeni population. Therefore, how much surgery can a cancer patient tolerate and still derive benefit from it?

Methods

We describe a representative case of a 54-year-old female with Li Fraumeni syndrome with an enlarging adrenocortical hepatic metastasis, a new primary ampullary cancer, and an extensive surgical history.

Results

We performed a simultaneous pancreaticoduodenectomy and repeat partial hepatectomy.

Conclusions

We propose that surgery is underutilized in metastatic solid organ familial cancers in general, and argue that an aggressive surgical approach should be considered in a multidisciplinary manner for patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome and recurrent tumors. However, because of the rarity of this familial cancer there is a paucity of evidence to support this approach, therefore a review of the literature is presented.

### Successful treatment of a-mutant glioblastoma with everolimus [^113S6rS7]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 14-year-old boy with familial Li-Fraumeni syndrome presented with diplopia. Brain MRI revealed a right temporoparietal rim-enhancing mass. Following surgical resection and diagnosis of a gigantocellular-type glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), his family wished to avoid cytotoxic chemotherapy given the amplified risk of secondary malignancy. As such, we performed whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, which revealed germline TP53 and somatic TSC2 mutations. On completion of adjuvant radiotherapy, he was started on maintenance therapy with everolimus per recommendations from our multi-institutional brain tumour precision medicine tumour board. He has achieved a complete remission with resolution of visual symptoms and remains on everolimus therapy with concurrent electromagnetic field therapy, now 33 months from diagnosis. Our data highlight the benefit of precision medicine in children with GBM and offer insight into a targetable pathway that may be involved in similar cases.

Introduction

The median age for breast cancer diagnosis in China is 47 years, which is at least 10 years younger than that in Western countries. Early-onset breast cancer, defined as breast cancer diagnosed at age of 40 years or younger, accounts for > 16% of cases, with an increasing trend in China. In contrast, the prevalence of early-onset breast cancer in Western countries is significantly lower, ranging only from 4–6%. In other words, the population of early-onset breast cancer patients in China is substantial, roughly equivalent to the total number of early-onset breast cancer patients in Europe. Notably, young age at breast cancer diagnosis is usually considered associated with a higher frequency of carrying pathogenic variants (PVs) of breast cancer susceptibility genes –. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) genes are the dominant genes mutated in early-onset breast cancer and genetic testing for BRCA1/2 is recommended for all breast cancer patients with young onset. However, BRCA1/2 mutations are only responsible for 40–60% of hereditary breast cancer cases –, suggesting that other predisposing genes also play an important role in hereditary cases.

Though much rarer than BRCA1/2 mutations, pathogenic TP53 variants are associated with a high risk of breast cancer. Previous studies has found that patients harbored TP53 PVs has higher risks of developing bilateral breast cancer, higher rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast-conserving therapy, and even worse overall survival –. More importantly, TP53 PVs are strongly associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by an early age of onset and a high lifetime risk of multiple primary cancers, including early-onset breast cancer, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, brain tumors, and leukemias. Once the first cancer develops, nearly half of patients develop another cancer after a median of 10 years; thus, more attention is needed to monitor the occurrence of other primary cancers after breast cancer onset.

### Recurrence of mucosal melanoma in Li-Fraumeni syndrome: a follow-up of an index case [^112mj5MN]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

LFS is a rare, malignancy-promoting disease with few reported treatment options. It is important to consider the increased risk of second primary malignancy formation after patients with LFS have undergone radiotherapy, and an approach that avoids radiation is supported. However, the risk of initial primary malignancy recurrence must also be considered, especially in cases where the primary malignancy is aggressive, such as mucosal melanoma. Regardless of the treatment approach that is chosen, long-term surveillance remains critical.

### Assessing risk in young patients… [^113dHDkh]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance This page summarizes guidelines to help health care providers identify young women at higher risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Background Health care providers can play a critical role in reducing the incidence of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer by identifying patients with elevated risk. The following guidelines can help identify young women who may have a higher risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and detect early-onset breast cancer among these women. Who is at high risk for breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, women who are at high risk for breast cancer include those who:

- Have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of about 20% to 25% or greater, according to risk assessment tools that are based mainly on family history.
- Have a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.
- Have a first-degree relative with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, and have not had genetic testing themselves.
- Had radiation therapy to the chest before age 30.
- Have Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, or have first-degree relatives with one of these syndromes. Genetic counseling and testing guidelines

### Update on cancer screening recommendations for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^111AF8VS]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition condition characterized by a high lifetime risk for a wide spectrum of malignancies associated with germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Secondary malignant neoplasms are particularly common. Early cancer detection through surveillance enables early intervention and leads to improved clinical outcomes with reduced tumor-related mortality and treatment-related morbidity. Since the 2017 publication of LFS tumor surveillance guidelines from the inaugural American Association for Cancer Research Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop, understanding the genotype-phenotype relationships in LFS has evolved, and adaptations of the guidelines have been implemented in institutions worldwide. The "Toronto Protocol" remains the current standard for lifelong surveillance; however, as outlined in this perspective, modifications should be considered about the use of certain modalities to target organs in an age-dependent manner. The Working Group's recommendations have also been extended to include a more detailed outline for surveillance in the adult TP53 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant carrier population, based on the recognition that early education of both practitioners and patients on what to expect after the transition from childhood/adolescence to young adulthood is important in preparing them for changes in surveillance strategies. In this perspective, we provide an up-to-date clinical overview of LFS and present our updated consensus tumor surveillance recommendations from the 2023 American Association for Cancer Research Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop.

### Adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer and Li-Fraumeni syndrome: oncologic results and incidence of second neoplasms… [^114hsazd]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract e12589 Background: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease related to an increased risk of various types of cancer, including radio-induced neoplasms, due to the TP53 gene mutation. We describe here the oncological results and the incidence of second neoplasms in LFS patients submitted to adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. As far as we know, this is the largest worldwide experience ever reported in this clinical setting. Methods: Patients with BC and with indication of genetic testing for LFS were referred to the Oncogenetics Department and, after screening by a Geneticist, the patients were submitted to genetic sequencing to detect the R337H mutation of the TP53 gene. The medical records of the patients diagnosed with this mutation were retrospectively analyzed to identify BC patients with history of previous adjuvant RT to verify the oncologic outcomes and the incidence of second neoplasms in these patients.

Results: Nine patients with LFS and BC submitted to previous RT were identified. The median follow-up from the end of RT was 56 months. 5/9 patients developed more than one primary tumor, 1 of which was unequivocally radio-induced. Of the 9 patients evaluated, 8 were alive and without evidence of BC. The only death occurred in a patient with 2 primary tumors after metastases to the Central Nervous System. Local control after adjuvant breast RT was 100%. Conclusions: Adjuvant RT should be used with caution in LFS patients. Second neoplasms occurred in 5 of 9 patients, 1 of which was unequivocally radio-induced.

The R337H mutation of the TP53 gene seems to be related to a lower incidence of radio-induced tumors and greater local control in BC patients after adjuvant RT when compared to another series.

### Chest wall leiomyosarcoma after breast-conservative therapy for early-stage breast cancer in a young woman with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^1147Hy8n]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is one of the most penetrant forms of familial cancer susceptibility syndromes, characterized by early age at tumor onset and a wide spectrum of malignant tumors. Identifying LFS in patients with cancer is clinically imperative because they have an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and are more likely to develop radiation-induced secondary malignancies. This case report describes a young woman whose initial presentation of LFS was early-onset breast cancer and whose treatment of this primary malignancy with breast conservation likely resulted in a secondary malignancy arising in her radiation field. As seen in this case, most breast cancers in patients with LFS exhibit a triple-positive phenotype (estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/HER2-positive). Although this patient met classic LFS criteria based on age and personal and family history of cancer, the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian Cancer endorse genetic screening for TP53 mutations in a subset of patients with early-onset breast cancer, even in the absence of a suggestive family history, because of the potential for de novo TP53 mutations.

### Li-Fraumeni syndrome and whole-body MRI screening: screening guidelines, imaging features, and impact on patient management [^115j2P23]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal-dominant inherited syndrome containing a germline mutation in the TP53 gene, which predisposes to oncogenesis. Leukemia and tumors of the brain, soft tissues, breasts, adrenal glands, and bone are the most common cancers associated with this syndrome. Patients with LFS are very susceptible to radiation, therefore the use of whole-body MRI is recommended for regular cancer screening. It is important to recognize the common tumors associated with LFS on MRI, and it is also important to be aware of the high rate of false-positive lesions.

Conclusion

Whole-body MRI is useful for the detection of cancer in patients who come for regular screening; however, it is associated with pitfalls about which the radiologist must remain aware.

### Subsequent primary neoplasms among bone sarcoma survivors; increased risks remain after 30 years of follow-up and in the latest treatment era, a nationwide population-based study [^114wnyz8]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The increased risk for SPNs among OS and ES survivors is likely to have different aetiologies. For OS survivors the excess risk can be partly attributed to a genetic predisposition. Li Fraumeni, hereditary retinoblastoma and Rothmund-Thompson syndrome are associated with OS and other malignancies including breast and skin cancer.– To our knowledge there is no such genetic predisposition associated with ES. Moreover, nearly 7% of the OS patients in this cohort were diagnosed with another malignancy prior to OS diagnosis, whereas this was only the case for 1.2% of the ES patients. This indicates that a number of OS patients in our cohort harbour a cancer predisposition syndrome, or have received treatment prior to primary OS diagnosis with alkylating agents, anthracyclines or RT, all of which may cause OS. Apart from genetic predisposition in OS patients, differences in the use of RT may be a major reason for the differences observed in SPNs in this study. Radiotherapy has traditionally been considered mainstay of local treatment of ES. OS on the contrary, is regarded as a RT- resistant malignancy, and therefore RT has been restricted to non-resectable or incompletely resected tumours associated with poor prognosis, where few patients will survive long enough to acquire a SPN. The use of RT in the treatment of primary ES is debated and has led to different local treatment strategies in the US and Europe.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^1143EJLW]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering first cancer diagnoses from 1990 onward (when MCGM records began) only, survival after the first primary cancer was also significantly reduced where XRT was used as treatment (XRT median survival = 5.5 years; no XRT median survival = 29.2 years, χ 2 = 4.7, P = 0.0302, HR = 3.0 [95% CI = 0.9 to 10.2]).

We present a comprehensive analysis exclusively in children with LFS (germline TP53) related cancers. To our knowledge, it is the largest single dataset pertaining to children, and we detail outcomes for 47 children with LFS childhood solid cancer with or without curative intent XRT for the first cancer.

Median time to second tumor where XRT was received was 13.3 years, similar to that reported in other series of adults and children combined. Median survival for ACC and OS/STS (core LFS childhood cancers) was also significantly reduced where XRT was received. Similarly, significantly poorer outcomes have been previously noted after XRT in a much smaller series of 31 (4 children) individuals with LFS, although all the second cancers in our series were new primaries rather than recurrences.

Radiated tissues typically have a diminished growth potential, often manifesting in distorted anatomy of the spine, thoracic wall, and leg-length discrepancy. Inclusion of the growth plate in the radiation field increases the risk of anatomic alterations.

One of the most worrisome long-term issues in this population is the higher risk of second malignancy. The most common second malignancies are leukemia, lymphoma and breast cancer. In girls treated for mediastinal Hodgkins disease during adolescence, the risk of breast cancer can be as high as 20–40 times the baseline population risk. Radiation therapy also increases the risk of second tumors within the field. Although osteosarcoma is the most feared second skeletal tumor, benign osteochondromas are the most common growths present within a previously irradiated bone. Genetic predisposition syndromes affecting the p-53 suppressor gene (such as the Li Fraumeni syndrome) increase the risk of a variety of second tumors. Increased surveillance is key to improved outomes.

Diminished pituitary axis function following cranial irradiation, and diminished fertility are well known endocrinologic complications of pediatric cancer. Two recently discovered long-term complications include a higher risk of obesity compared to siblings, and a higher risk of diabetes, especially in patients who have received abdominal or total body radiation.

In conclusion, it is important for radiologists to be aware of the potential short- and long-term complications of pediatric cancer so that early diagnosis and effective prevention treatment can be instituted.

Pediatric MRI-safety revisited

Haukeland University Hospital, 5020 Bergen, Norway

The increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inevitably poses the question of safety, as magnetic and electromagnetic fields can influence biological systems. In the absence of ferromagnetic devices and equipment, including biomedical implants, there is no reproducible scientific study showing a health hazard associated with exposure to MRI, i.e. a combination of static, gradient and radiofrequency (RF) fields. However, the majority of studies address the effect of each single type field, while studies on their combined effect in humans are sparse.

### Isa moderate-risk breast cancer gene or the younger sister of Li-Fraumeni? [^113VM6BE]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This man meets the modified Chompret criteriawith multiple tumours including glioma, clear cell renal cell cancer, urothelial cancer, basal cell cancer as well as multifocal bilateral papillary thyroid cancers in combination with the family history. However, only cancer this man suffered from which is described in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome spectrum of cancers is a glioma. In the absence of a pathogenic variant in the TP53 gene, we posit that his cancers are driven by the CHEK2 mutation, potentially behaving like TP53.

Inherited RCC comprises 5% of all renal cell cancers, based on germline mutations in the VHL, FH, BAP1, SDHB, SDHC, SDHS, TSC1, TSC2 and MITF genes. CHEK2 has been implicated in RCC, especially the missense variant I157T. However, literature around CHEK2 1100delC is less clear. According to Näslund-Koch et al, CHEK2 *1100delC HR for kidney cancer is 3.45 (95% CI 1.09–10.9) that supports the theory of driving renal cell cancer, but CHEK2 *1100delC was not observed in any of the patients with renal cell cancer in Huzano and Kolosza, therefore, the data supporting the role of CHEK2 *1100delC are conflicting.

The link between CHEK2 mutation and gliomas is plausible because of its role as a tumour suppressor gene; case reports published suggest CHEK2 mutation as the possible cause of medulloblastomas, as well as primary gliomas and astrocytomas. Germline mutations in CHEK2 do not seem to cause either high-grade or low-grade gliomas, in contrast to the TP53 gene. No biopsy was undertaken, so no tissue was available to seek somatic mutations.

Genotyping may be useful for the radiation oncologist when determining treatment options. The primary concerns include increased radiation toxicity, secondary cancers or lack of efficacy in certain tumours.

Truncating mutations in ATM causing breast cancer and radiation toxicity is one such instance. There are concerns about TP53 mutations and an increased risk of secondary canceror lack of radiation sensitivity with germline mutations. There is insufficient information about CHEK2 mutation and radiation. Still, it is possible that the tumour had a degree of radioresistance as evident by the lack of response to treatment.

Germ-line mutations in specific genes predispose family members to cancer. Prediction of the exact tumor type and timing of cancer initiation is fundamental to the development of management strategies for these individuals. Recent advances in our understanding of the general processes that control cancer initiation may enable us to tailor more precise risk stratification. This, in turn, will lead to more effective early detection strategies, which would result in more favorable clinical outcomes. In this review, we highlight the steps and methods used to reach this futuristic model.

### Guidelines for the Li-Fraumeni and heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes [^115ZayPH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

The impact of radio and chemotherapy on the development of subsequent primary tumours

Germline TP53 variant carriers have a remarkably high incidence of subsequent primary tumours, which may occur in more than 40% of TP53 variant carriers. Subsequent primary tumours often develop after the exposure of TP53 variant carriers to radio and/or chemotherapy treatments. The demonstration of the contribution of radiotherapy and conventional chemotherapy to the development of subsequent primary tumours in these carriers came from consistent observations of sequential development of multiple tumours after treatment by chemo- or radiotherapy of a first tumour and the development of tumours within the radiotherapy field. A cause-effect was strongly supported by studies of the impact of chemo- and radiotherapy in lymphocytes with wild-type or mutant TP53 genotype and LFS mouse models. Therefore, in cancer patients, testing for disease-causing TP53 variants must absolutely take place before starting treatment and if a disease-causing TP53 variant is found, priority should be given to surgical or ablative treatments, avoiding radiotherapy when possible and using preferably non-genotoxic chemotherapies.

Surveillance protocols

Surveillance protocols for carriers bearing disease-causing TP53 variants have recently been elaborated in the framework of an international consortium coordinated by Canadian and US teams. These protocols indicate that carriers should undergo abdominal ultrasound every 3–4 months, annual whole-body MRI (WBMRI) and annual brain MRI (the first with gadolinium enhancement) from the first year of life. Additionally, female carriers should undergo annual breast MRI from the age of 20 years onwards. The option of risk-reducing mastectomy may be discussed on a case-by-case basis. Several international studies, mostly performed without gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), have confirmed the efficiency of WBMRI, with an overall estimated detection rate of 7% for new and localised primary cancers on a first prevalent screen. Given that GBCAs may be retained for months or years in several organs, multiple GBCAs administrations should probably be avoided in germline TP53 variant carriers and only macrocyclic GBCAs, which are apparently less retained in the body, should be used.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes arising in patients with germline TP53 mutation and Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^113FZHTp]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), characterized by predisposition to early onset of a variety of malignancies, is usually associated with germline mutation of the tumor-suppressor gene, TP53. Mutation carriers are at increased risk of multiple primary tumors, many of which arise in previous radiation-therapy sites. In patients with LFS, acute myeloid leukemia is uncommon and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is rare.

Objective

To evaluate the morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular diagnostic findings of 3 unique cases of MDS arising in patients with germline TP53 mutation, 2 with classic LFS.

Design

We searched the Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Registry in the Department of Genetics at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Texas) and identified 3 patients with documented germline TP53 mutations or LFS who had developed MDS during a period of 6 years (2000–2005). The clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular diagnostic data and bone marrow aspirate smears and biopsies on all patients were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining with antibody to p53 was also performed.

Results

Two patients met the criteria for classic LFS; one had no history of malignancy in first-degree relatives. The MDS followed chemotherapy and radiation therapy and progressed to acute myeloid leukemia in 2 patients. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated chromosome 5 abnormalities in a complex karyotype in all cases. Two patients died, one of acute myeloid leukemia and one with glioblastoma multiforme, MDS, and persistent pancytopenia.

Conclusions

Patients with LFS may develop MDS, which is most likely therapy-related and is associated with cytogenetic markers of poor prognosis.

### Clinical and genetic characteristics of carriers of the TP53 C.541C > T, p. Arg181Cys pathogenic variant causing hereditary cancer in patients of arab-muslim descent [^116JZcbz]. Familial Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

TP53 is a tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle, DNA repair, metabolism and apoptosis in response to DNA or cellular damage. Somatic variants in TP53 are found in over 50% of all human cancers. Germline pathogenic variants in TP53 classically cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) with most carriers developing characteristic cancers, for example adrenocortical carcinoma, sarcomas and primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Testing for TP53 is recommended for all patients who meet clinical LFS criteria, updated 'Chompret Criteria' (detailed in Table 2) and current surveillance recommendations for carriers include annual whole body and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biannual abdominal ultrasound from age of birth, and colonoscopy every 2 years from the age of 25 (the full surveillance protocol which is recommended in Israel is detailed in supplementary appendix 1).

In recent years, a growing number of large cohorts have shown cancer patients found to be carriers of TP53 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, who did not present with classical features of LFS, had late onset of cancer or cancers not previously associated with LFS and little or no family history of cancer. The variability in the age of onset and penetrance was found to be correlated with specific variants in TP53. Yet, it is unclear whether other modifier genes or possibly additional environmental and lifestyle factors, including smoking or exposure to ionizing radiation, contribute to cancer development among carriers of these lower penetrance variants. The clinical phenotype of attenuated-LFS has not been well described, and as such the appropriateness of the rigorous screening regimen recommended for classic LFS has not been proven in cases of attenuated LFS variants. If and how the surveillance should be modified in accordance with the expected milder phenotype, has yet to be formalized.

### Germ line mutations associated with leukemias [^113YhVDu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Several genetic syndromes have long been associated with a predisposition to the development of leukemia, including bone marrow failure syndromes, Down syndrome, and Li Fraumeni syndrome. Recent work has better defined the leukemia risk and outcomes in these syndromes. Also, in the last several years, a number of other germ line mutations have been discovered to define new leukemia predisposition syndromes, including ANKRD26, GATA2, PAX5, ETV6, and DDX41 In addition, data suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with therapy related leukemias harbor germ line mutations in DNA damage response genes such as BRCA1/2 and TP53 Recognition of clinical associations, acquisition of a thorough family history, and high index-of-suspicion are critical in the diagnosis of these leukemia predisposition syndromes. Accurate identification of patients with germ line mutations associated with leukemia can have important clinical implications as it relates to management of the leukemia, as well as genetic counseling of family members.

### Mutant p53 drives clonal hematopoiesis through modulating epigenetic pathway [^113jHups]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), also known as age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH), occurs when a single mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) contributes to a significant clonal proportion of mature blood lineages during aging –. CHIP is common in aged healthy individuals and associated with increased risks of hematological neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) –. CHIP is also associated with increased all-cause mortality and risk of cardio-metabolic disease –. While these findings suggest that mutations identified in CHIP likely drive disease development, mechanisms by which these mutations promote HSPC expansion are largely unknown –.

Most individuals with CHIP carry hematological malignancy-associated mutations, including DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, JAK2, and TP53 –. The TP53 gene, which encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53, ranks in the top five among genes that were mutated in CHIP –. p53 bears the usual hallmarks of a transcription factor and regulates a large number of genes in response to a variety of cellular insults, including oncogene activation, DNA damage, and inflammation, to suppress tumorigenesis. TP53 mutations and deletions were found in approximately half of all human cancers, including hematological malignancies. Recently, somatic TP53 mutations were identified in CHIP –. TP53 mutations were also commonly found in therapy-related CHIP. Interestingly, some individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), who carry germline TP53 mutations, develop MDS and AML as they age. Indeed, somatic TP53 mutations are present in 10% of MDS and AML cases and in 30% of secondary MDS and AML patients arising after exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. While TP53 mutations are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in MDS and AML. how mutant p53 drives the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies are not fully understood.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^117Kq9Y6]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) arising from germline TP53 mutation results in defective DNA repair and increased risk of multiple primary cancers beginning in childhood. Curative intent radiotherapy is often used to treat childhood cancer, but its impact on children with LFS has not been reviewed.

We undertook a retrospective case-series review of 47 children with a solid cancer diagnosed age less than 16 years to assess time and survival after second cancer diagnosis.

After radiotherapy for the first cancer diagnosis, median time to second primary cancer diagnosis was 13.3 years and median survival 9.7 years. Where no radiotherapy was received, median time to second primary cancer diagnosis was 25.1 years (χ 2 = 14.8, P < .0001; Hazard Ratio = 7.9 [95% CI = 2.8 to 22.6]), and median survival of 29.2 years (χ 2 = 12.5, P = 0.004, Hazard Ratio = 3.2 [95% CI = 1.5 to 6.6]).

Radiotherapy for first cancer in children with LFS is associated with adverse outcomes and ought to be considered only in the absence of other potentially curative options. Where unavoidable, second cancer risks must be minimized.

### Guidelines for the Li-Fraumeni and heritable TP53-related cancer syndromes [^111yCE19]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Fifty years after the recognition of the Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), our perception of cancers related to germline alterations of TP53 has drastically changed: (i) germline TP53 alterations are often identified among children with cancers, in particular soft-tissue sarcomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, central nervous system tumours, or among adult females with early breast cancers, without familial history. This justifies the expansion of the LFS concept to a wider cancer predisposition syndrome designated heritable TP53- related cancer (h TP53 rc) syndrome; (ii) the interpretation of germline TP53 variants remains challenging and should integrate epidemiological, phenotypical, bioinformatics prediction, and functional data; (iii) the penetrance of germline disease-causing TP53 variants is variable, depending both on the type of variant (dominant-negative variants being associated with a higher cancer risk) and on modifying factors; (iv) whole-body MRI (WBMRI) allows early detection of tumours in variant carriers and (v) in cancer patients with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, radiotherapy, and conventional genotoxic chemotherapy contribute to the development of subsequent primary tumours. It is critical to perform TP53 testing before the initiation of treatment in order to avoid in carriers, if possible, radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies. In children, the recommendations are to perform clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound every 6 months, annual WBMRI and brain MRI from the first year of life, if the TP53 variant is known to be associated with childhood cancers. In adults, the surveillance should include every year clinical examination, WBMRI, breast MRI in females from 20 until 65 years and brain MRI until 50 years.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^116Xnpqg]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

There was no difference in age at first cancer diagnosis for those children receiving XRT for this cancer compared with those not (mean age first cancer diagnosis = 4.8 years XRT, 5.3 years no XRT, P = 0.7100).

Because ACC and OS/STS are core childhood cancers in LFS, we considered time to second primary cancer and survival from the first primary for these cancers. Adrenocortical carcinoma was associated with significantly decreased survival (Figure 2, A), but not time to second primary cancer, where XRT was used (median time to second primary: XRT = 13.8 years, no XRT = 25.1 years, χ 2 = 3.1, P = 0.0807, HR = 2.6 [95% CI = 0.7 to 10.2]; median survival: XRT = 16.0 years, no XRT = 31.7 years, χ 2 = 7.2, P = 0.0072, HR = 4.3 [95% CI = 1.2 to 15.9]). OS/STS was associated with both statistically significantly decreased time to second primary cancer, and survival (Figure 2, B), where XRT was used (median time to second primary: XRT = 10.5 years, no XRT = 29.4 years, χ 2 = 8.2, P = 0.0041, HR = 6.0 [95% CI = 1.1 to 31.9]; median survival: XRT = 4.2 years, no XRT = 16.6 years, χ 2 = 4.0, P = 0.0472, HR = 2.5 [95% CI = 0.9 to 6.8]).

### Increased risk of malignancies in a population-based study of 818 soft-tissue sarcoma patients [^117Kmrt9]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) represent less than 1% of all malignancies and constitute a group of biologically heterogeneous tumours. Some subtypes, for example, synovial sarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma are characterised by specific gene fusions, whereas others, for example, pleomorphic liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) carry multiple complex genetic alterations. An increased risk of STS has been found in survivors of various types of childhood cancers, including retinoblastoma, leukaemia, Wilms' tumour, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Also survivors of childhood STS, osteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma have been shown to be at increased risk of multiple primary malignancies, including bone sarcomas and STS. Development of multiple primary malignancies may also represent a side effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which yield an increased risk of secondary malignancies, including STS. Children with STS who have been treated with radiotherapy have a nearly eight-fold risk of developing a second malignant neoplasm, including bone and STS.

Based on current knowledge heredity, probably accounts for only a small subset of STS, although these tumours have been associated with several hereditary syndromes. Among these, the most well-known are neurofibromatosis due to mutations in the NF1 gene with an increased risk for neurofibrosarcomas and the Li–Fraumeni syndrome caused by germline mutations in TP53 with increased risks for STS, leukaemia, brain tumours, and breast cancer. However, STS have been associated also with premature ageing within the Werner syndrome and Rothmund–Thomson syndrome due to mutations in the genes WRN and RECQ4 and has been described to develop in melanoma syndrome kindreds with CDKN2A mutations and in Lynch syndrome families with mutations in mismatch-repair genes. In addition, STS occur in familial forms with yet unidentified modes of inheritance and underlying genetic causes.

Two recent studies have described development of multiple primary malignancies in adult STS patients, and also suggested that STS patients may be at risk of developing a second primary STS. We used the southern part of the Swedish Cancer Registry to identify all individuals with STS during the time period 1964–2001 to characterise development of multiple primary malignancies in this cohort and to assess the risk of a second primary malignancy after STS.

### Outcome and molecular analysis of young children with choroid plexus carcinoma treated with non-myeloablative therapy: results from the SJYC07 trial [^116Pw7zi]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of radiotherapy in managing CPC, especially for young children, has been controversial. Review of data from the SEER database indicated no survival benefit with the use of radiotherapy for pediatric CPC (< 20 years of age), and a meta-analysis of 28 children with CPC and Li-Fraumeni syndrome demonstrated a trend, albeit nonsignificant, towards inferior survival when treated with radiation. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated radio-resistance conferred by TP53 mutations implying that TP53 mutant CPCs will not benefit from RT. On the contrary, the risk of radiation-induced subsequent neoplasm is genuine and such a risk is exaggerated in children younger than 5 years at diagnosis and in those with germline TP53 mutation; a clinical profile enriched in patients with CPC. In this study the effect of radiation therapy was hard to ascertain since only 4 (31%) patients received radiation and, when received, radiation was not uniform since 3 received focal therapy while 1 received CSI. Nonetheless, 5 out of the 8 surviving patients did so without radiation therapy and our analysis revealed no statistical survival difference between those who did and did not receive radiation. Furthermore, only one patient with TP53 mutated CPC received radiation therapy and this patient died of disease. Thus, our data are too sparse to make a statement about the utility of RT in this population. However, with no appreciable benefit and a well-known high adverse event profile in this young population who already display a high prevalence of neurocognitive and behavioral impairment, we recommend against a RT-containing regimen for frontline treatment of children with CPC unless convincing evidence to the contrary becomes available.

### P53 therapy in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^113GHzrf]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that greatly increases the risk of developing multiple types of cancer. The majority of Li-Fraumeni syndrome families contain germ-line mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We describe treatment of a refractory, progressive Li-Fraumeni syndrome embryonal carcinoma with a p53 therapy (Advexin) targeted to the underlying molecular defect of this syndrome. p53 treatment resulted in complete and durable remission of the injected lesion by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans with improvement of tumor-related symptoms. With respect to molecular markers, the patient's tumor had abnormal p53 and expressed coxsackie adenovirus receptors with a low HDM2 and bcl-2 profile conducive for adenoviral p53 activity. p53 treatment resulted in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis documented by p21 and cleaved caspase-3 detection. Increased adenoviral antibody titers after repeated therapy did not inhibit adenoviral p53 activity or result in pathologic sequelae. Relationships between these clinical, radiographic, and molecular markers may prove useful in guiding future application of p53 tumor suppressor therapy.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1177URqz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) epidemiology, risk factors, and age-related outcomes — In the United States, the age-adjusted incidence is 1.8 per 100,000 individuals per year with approximately 6100 new cases and 1400 deaths estimated in 2025, and the median age at diagnosis is 17 years, with 53.5% of patients diagnosed at < 20 years of age; 29.6% are diagnosed at ≥ 45 years and only approximately 13.7% at ≥ 65 years. ALL represents 75% to 80% of acute leukemias among children, making it the most common form of childhood leukemia, whereas ALL represents approximately 20% of all leukemias among adults. Risk factors include age > 70 years, exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and genetic disorders (including Down syndrome; with additional rare conditions such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, Klinefelter syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Bloom syndrome, and ataxia telangiectasia). Analyses from the SEER database have shown improvements in survival for pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 89% and 61%, respectively, but adult survival remains low at approximately 20% to 40%, and is especially poor in older adults at approximately 20%. The exception is infants < 1 year, a group that has not seen improvement over the last 30 years, with a 5-year OS of 55.8%. AYA cure rates remain suboptimal compared with children despite substantial improvements with the adoption of pediatric regimens; AYA may be treated on pediatric or adult protocols depending on local practice, and favorable cytogenetic subtypes (ETV6::RUNX1 ALL and hyperdiploidy) occur less frequently while high-risk BCR::ABL or Ph-like ALL is higher in AYA.

### Li-Fraumeni syndrome: the genetics and treatment considerations for the sarcoma and associated neoplasms [^113W14fY]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder first reported by Drs Li and Fraumeni in 1969. Malkin was the first to describe a germline mutation as an underlying defect of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Cancer risk in mutation carriers has been estimated to be 50% by age 40 and 90% by age 60. Children of affected parents have an approximate 50% risk of inheriting the familial mutation. Functional assays have been established that allow for easy genetic testing for TP53 mutation. Treatment goals center on early detection and surgical resection of affected organ. Targeted therapy for the TP53 gene may hold promise for the future.

### Recognition of Li Fraumeni syndrome at diagnosis of a locally advanced extremity rhabdomyosarcoma [^11598utu]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

A contemporaneous presentation of a second breast cancer in a mother and an extremity rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in her daughter led to the diagnosis of the Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Although the association between LFS and RMS in young patients is well recognised 1 there are no guidelines as to how this knowledge should influence the optimal management of these patients. After reviewing the literature about the natural history of the LFS 2, the incidence of second malignancy (SMN) in RMS survivors 3–6 and the management of extremity RMS 7–9, we are concerned that contemporary RMS treatment, combining non-mutilating surgery with chemoradiotherapy, may be associated with an excessive SMN risk in LFS patients with advanced RMS. We question whether treatment should be individualised and, where possible and acceptable to the family, measures such as amputation should be the considered to attain local control for LFS patients with RMS as this will avoid the need for local radiotherapy without compromising long-term function and quality of life 10.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^114N8eRP]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

We cannot exclude that poorer survival after XRT might be explained by prognostically unfavorable cancers being more likely to receive XRT — for example, tumor size not being amenable to curative surgery or limited medical treatment options for historical case patients. Certain tumor types requiring XRT may also imply a higher probability of a shorter sojourn time to second malignancy, but this does not explain the shortened time (although not significant) to second tumor after XRT for adrenal tumors.

The management of cancers arising in children and young people with hereditary predisposition is challenging given the increased risk of metachronous cancers, particularly in LFS where this risk is greater than 40%. Although management of the first cancer typically takes precedence, life-long cancer risk and cancer specific mortality must be considered.

The shortened time to metachronous primary cancer we demonstrate does provide clinical evidence for current guidance that XRT should be avoided in children with LFS 3 where possible. Although not conclusively demonstrated, our data do suggest that the shortened time may affect survival through causing the subsequent primary cancer earlier. Therefore, where no other potentially curative therapeutic options are available, then second cancer risk needs to be minimized — for example, using proton-beam approaches.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^111XKey2]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Radiation (all fields) — any radiation (including TBI) exposure: Potential late effects include subsequent benign or malignant neoplasm occurring in or near radiation field, such as dysplastic nevi, skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma), bone malignancies, and oral cancer. Periodic evaluation — history: skin lesions; changing moles (asymmetry, bleeding, increasing size, indistinct borders); bone pain (especially in irradiated field); and persistent thickening or lump of soft tissue or bone, performed yearly. Physical: skin self exam monthly; and yearly inspection and palpation of skin and soft tissues in irradiated field(s), dermatologic exam of irradiated fields, and palpation of bones in irradiated field. Counseling advises patients to promptly seek medical attention for symptoms (e.g., bone pain, bone mass, persistent fevers). Potential considerations for further testing and intervention include dermatology consultation for evaluation and monitoring of atypical nevi, diagnostic imaging in patients as clinically indicated, and surgical and/or oncology consultation as clinically indicated; see relevant guideline sections to determine screening for specific radiation fields. Risk modifiers listed include patient factors (younger age at treatment; adolescent at treatment [bone malignancies]); cancer/treatment factors (higher radiation dose, especially ≥ 30 Gy (bone malignancies), large radiation treatment volumes, alkylating agent exposure, and orthovoltage radiation [commonly used before 1970] due to delivery of greater dose to skin and bones); and pre-morbid/co-morbid conditions such as predisposing mutation (e.g., p53, NF1), bilateral or familial retinoblastoma (implying RB1 likely pathogenic variant), and Gorlin syndrome (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), plus health behaviors (sun exposure, tanning booths).

### Li-Fraumeni syndrome presenting as mucosal melanoma: case report and treatment considerations [^115VbaiP]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a familial cancer predisposition associated with a germline mutation in TP53. Patients with LFS are at risk of developing malignancies and require comprehensive screening. We describe an index case of LFS presenting with mucosal melanoma.

Methods

A 21-year-old woman presented with a left maxillary mucosal lesion and a left neck mass. Biopsies revealed metastatic mucosal melanoma, which is a pathology previously unreported in LFS families. Genetic testing revealed LFS, with a germline TP53 mutation, and pedigree analysis identified 9 first-degree and second-degree relatives with hematologic malignancies.

Results

The patient underwent a maxillectomy and left neck dissection, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. At 30-month follow-up, there was no evidence of local, regional, or distant failure, nor did she develop a second primary tumor.

Conclusion

This represents the first reported case of LFS associated with mucosal melanoma. Treatment considerations, specifically the risks of adjuvant therapy in LFS, are discussed. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: E20-E22, 2017.

### TP53-associated early breast cancer: new observations from a large cohort [^1177yHDr]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent large, well-annotated international cohort of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and early-stage breast cancer was examined for shared features.

Methods

This multicenter cohort study included women with a germline TP53 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant and nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2022. Clinical and genetic data were obtained from institutional registries and clinical charts. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize proportions, and differences were assessed using χ2 or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Metachronous contralateral breast cancer risk, radiation-induced sarcoma risk, and recurrence-free survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier methodology.

Results

Among 227 women who met study criteria, the median age of first breast cancer diagnosis was 37years (range = 21–71), 11.9% presented with bilateral synchronous breast cancer, and 18.1% had ductal carcinoma in situ only. In total, 166 (73.1%) patients underwent mastectomies, including 67 bilateral mastectomies as first breast cancer surgery. Among those patients with retained breast tissue, the contralateral breast cancer rate was 25.3% at 5 years. Among 186 invasive tumors, 72.1% were stages I to II, 48.9% were node negative, and the most common subtypes were hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative (40.9%) and hormone receptor positive/HER2 positive (34.4%). At a median follow-up of 69.9months (interquartile range = 32.6–125.9), invasive hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative disease had the highest recurrence risk among the subtypes (5-year recurrence-free survival = 61.1%, P = 0.001). Among those who received radiation therapy (n = 79), the 5-year radiation-induced sarcoma rate was 4.8%.

Conclusion

We observed high rates of ductal carcinoma in situ, hormone receptor-positive, and HER2-positive breast cancers, with a worse outcome in the hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative luminal tumors, despite appropriate treatment. Confirmation of these findings in further studies could have implications for breast cancer care in those with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

### Genetic predisposition in sarcomas: clinical implications and management [^115HtmfN]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Radiotherapy use and risk in sarcomas with genetic predisposition

RT in patients with hereditary sarcomas has to be considered carefully, as potential risks vary between syndromes. If alternative curative treatment modalities are available, avoidance of RT can be considered. If RT is required as a part of standard multi-modal treatment, proven to achieve cure, the potential benefit often outweigh the risks. When considering RT, total dose, fractionation dose, fraction number and the irradiation volume should be limited whenever possible to spare normal tissues. Novel approaches have also been developed that could help determine suitability for RT and inform RT dosing, including a gene expression based radiosensitivity indexand a genome-based model for adjusting RT dose. Highly conformal RT techniques, such as proton beam therapy (PBT), can be of benefit in sarcoma-associated predisposition syndromes. In studies, PBT plans were adjusted to minimal gross tumour volume and were safe in terms of acute and chronic toxicities. Though tumour control was often achieved using RT, some patients developed SPCs during follow up.

SPCs can be induced by ionizing radiation but can also develop spontaneously as patients with predisposition syndromes are prone to develop SPC. In patients with retinoblastoma, up to 40% of SPC occurred outside the radiation volume, indicating that tumour predisposition or other treatments might play a central role. In patients with LFS, RT-induced sarcomas were reported to arise less frequently than previously expected. Regarding RT for SPC, decisions are largely multi-disciplinary and case specific. For SPC in previously irradiated areas, The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer consensus guidelines on re-irradiation provide considerations for decision making and indicate re-irradiation can be considered for new malignancies for patients when other options are limited. Within the LFS community, fear and resistance are associated with RT, although it might not be substantiated by recent literature. While balancing risks and benefits, the need for optimal treatment of the current sarcoma should always prevail.

Radiotherapy summary:

- In patients with genetic predisposition related sarcomas, who may have increased risk of adverse effects including secondary malignancies, radiotherapy should be restricted to individuals where alternative effective treatment options are not available. Alternative treatment modalities may need to be explored to mitigate these risks.
- Tailoring radiotherapy approaches based on genetic predisposition is crucial. Techniques such as highly conformal proton beam therapy may reduce normal tissue toxicity while effectively controlling tumours and should be considered.

### Radiotherapy results in decreased time to second cancer in children with Li Fraumeni syndrome [^116aKMdn]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a high-risk age-related cancer predisposition syndrome arising from (likely) pathogenic variants (PGVs) of TP53. This risk begins from birth with 20% of children developing a cancer by age 5 years, 40% by age 18 years, and greater than 40% of individuals will develop multiple metachronous primary tumors. The classical cancer spectrum includes adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) in children, osteo- and soft tissue sarcoma (OS, STS) and central nervous system tumors in adults and children, and breast cancer in women.

P53 plays a critical role in DNA repair. In p53-deficient cells, DNA damage acquired through ionizing radiation risks being propagated, resulting in increased risk of neoplastic transformation. In view of this, recent guidance suggests that, for LFS, where a cancer has developed the use of curative intent radiotherapy (XRT) should be limited where possible. This is despite a lack of direct evidence of an increased risk of second primary malignancies beyond anecdotal or small reports. Given this guidance, the challenges of managing childhood cancers occurring in LFS in view of the remaining years of life at risk from further primary cancers and the lack of direct evidence, we undertook a retrospective evaluation of the outcomes after radiotherapy for LFS-associated childhood cancers in our institution to attain data to help inform management.

### Regular surveillance for Li-Fraumeni syndrome: advice, adherence and perceived benefits [^116355qn]. Familial Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate which methods for regular surveillance, if any, are offered to high risk LFS family members, the extent to which such advice is followed, and the possible psychological burden or benefits associated with regular surveillance for health conditions associated with LFS. Although the actual medical benefits of surveillance for LFS are limited, the vast majority of LFS family members receive advice to undergo regular surveillance and report being adherent with the advice given.

Although the surveillance guidelines for LFS in the Netherlands solely include regular breast surveillance from age 20–25 years and an optional annual physical examination, this study shows that the specific screening advice given to high risk LFS family members in the Netherlands is more extensive and diverse than the guidelines. The large majority receive tailored screening advice based on family history. The national guidelines have recently been updated, and in these updated guidelines surveillance based on family history is included as optional. This is in accordance with the US guidelines for regular surveillance published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

Since regular surveillance for breast cancer is the only surveillance method considered to be effective, it is encouraging that all eligible high risk women aged 25 years or older received advice to undergo regular breast cancer surveillance, and adhere to this advice. It is notable that, despite the controversy about possible increased radiation sensitivity associated with p53 mutations, approximately two-thirds of these women were advised to undergo an annual mammography instead of a breast MRI. In addition, the large majority of these high risk individuals received tailored screening advice, based on their personal family history of cancer.

As hypothesized, individuals who received advice for regular surveillance and adhered to that advice reported greater benefits from regular surveillance, compared to those who were not (fully) adherent. The main perceived benefit of regular surveillance was the possible early detection of cancer. Additionally, regular surveillance provides a sense of control and security. Only limited barriers to surveillance were reported, and no differences regarding these barriers were found between those who were and were not (fully) compliant. However, although not significant, those who were not (fully) compliant with the advice received reported that regular surveillance may cause unnecessary worry, is inconvenient or can cause practical problems with finances or insurance.

### Chest wall sarcoma: 18F-FDG PET / CT in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [^114QjLSJ]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder also known as the SBLA cancer syndrome (sarcoma, breast, leukemia, and adrenal). A 39-year-old female patient with a history of bilateral breast cancer treated with bilateral mastectomies and radiation treatment 4 years ago and left chest wall pleomorphic sarcoma 1 year ago presented with a small hypermetabolic right chest wall mass on 18F-FDG PET/CT. This mass was found to be a spindle cell sarcoma. FDG PET/CT plays an important role in following up oncology patients, particularly in group of high-risk malignancy, for detecting small hypermetabolic lesions.

### Delayed chromosome changes in gamma-irradiated normal and Li-Fraumeni fibroblasts [^111CndiS]. Radiation Research (2002). Low credibility.

Knockout mice with only one Trp53 allele (± genotype) are highly susceptible to radiation-induced cancers, possibly through numerical chromosome changes. Patients with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, having heterozygous TP53 germline mutations (+/mut genotype), are also susceptible to spontaneous and radiogenic cancers. We have investigated the susceptibility of six Li-Fraumeni syndrome +/mut and six normal fibroblast strains to induced numerical and unstable structural aberrations at six population doublings after exposure to 3 or 6 Gy gamma rays. Four of the irradiated Li-Fraumeni syndrome strains showed small increases in both aberration types, similar to those seen in the normal strains. In two irradiated Li-Fraumeni syndrome strains, there were high levels of induced structural changes, and one of these showed a modest increase in hyperploidy. We suggest that enhanced sensitivity to delayed radiation-induced chromosome changes in Li-Fraumeni syndrome cells requires other genetic alterations in addition to TP53 heterozygosity, apparently in contrast to the situation in Trp53 heterozygous null mice. If such additional alterations occur in vivo in Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients, they may predispose them to radiogenic cancers, mainly through enhanced structural rather than numerical chromosome changes. Our findings raise questions about the validity of quantitative extrapolation of cytogenetic data from Trp53-defective mice to radiogenic cancer risk in humans.

### The journey to CAR T cell therapy: the pediatric and young adult experience with relapsed or refractory B-ALL [^116t9kvf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Much like in the settings of post-SCT recurrence and primary chemoresistance, CAR T cell therapy may be a much-needed alternative treatment for patients with recurrent extramedullary leukemia, including relapsed CNS disease, as discussed in the case of Patient 2. Although isolated extramedullary relapse has a better prognosis than BM recurrence, CNS leukemia at diagnosis is an independent risk factor for relapse and inferior outcome; SCT is also less effective in patients with CNS involvement at relapse. Thus CAR T cell therapy may be a superior option for patients with CNS relapse, including those with low-level disease and cranial nerve involvement. Importantly, CAR T cell therapy does not require further radiation therapy in patients who may be nearing the maximum tolerated dose of cranial radiation or in whom it would be neurotoxic. Data thus far in patients with CNS relapse treated with CAR T cell therapy indicate positive outcomes. In an analysis of 53 patients with r/r ALL who received tisagenlecleucel, 12 had previous CNS relapse. Of those patients, 8 (67%) experienced a CR for a median of 8 months (range, 3–22 months) with no CNS relapse. Importantly, 98% of infused patients evaluated had detectable tisagenlecleucel in their cerebral spinal fluid.

Finally, CAR T cell therapy may be particularly valuable for vulnerable patient populations, including children and adolescents with Down syndrome, chromosomal breakage syndromes, Li Fraumeni syndrome, or toxicities from prior therapy that excluded SCT. This is an important group for getting back into remission after relapse given the toxicities associated with salvage chemotherapy and SCT preparative regimens. In particular, patients with Down syndrome have increased relapse rates and fare particularly poorly following relapse, with 3-year survival of 10–25%. In a phase 2, global trial of CAR T cell therapy, 6 patients with Down syndrome were infused with tisagenlecleucel with no other treatment modifications. Overall response rates (including CR and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery) in this patient subset were comparable to those of patients who did not have Down syndrome. Rates of adverse events were also similar.

### The US postmarketing surveillance study of adult osteosarcoma and teriparatide: study design and findings from the first 7 years [^112wVqEf]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

In initial preclinical studies in rats administered teriparatide, a dose-dependent increase in the risk of osteosarcoma incidence was observed. Although subsequent studies demonstrated a "no-effect" dose in ratsand no bone tumors in a long-term study of cynomolgus monkeys, the US product label contains a warning to physicians and patients about a potential risk of osteosarcoma and to use the product only in the absence of other risk factors for osteosarcoma (e.g. Paget's disease of bone, prior radiation therapy, or children or young adults with open epiphyses) and to limit exposure to a maximum of 2 years.

Osteosarcoma in humans is a primary malignant bone tumor (a sarcoma in which the neoplastic cells produce osseous matrix) that occurs with a bimodal age distribution, with peaks in adolescents and the elderly and slightly higher incidence in males than females. In US adults, incidence varies with age: 1.7 per million in those aged 25 to 59 years and 4.2 per million for those aged 60 years and older. Although there is limited information about the etiology of osteosarcoma in adults, it has been observed in association with Paget's disease of the bone and after radiation treatment to the bones. In addition, rare inherited disorders, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 mutation) and retinoblastoma (pRb loss) are associated with increased rates of osteosarcoma. Other potential risk factors, including trauma/injury at the tumor site, have been suggested. One study evaluated the potential role of occupational exposures, including exposure to pesticides. Fluoride exposure from drinking water as a possible risk factor for osteosarcoma in children and young adults has been extensively studied, but the preponderance of data has not supported a causal association. At present, the majority of osteosarcomas are diagnosed in patients without identified risk factors.
