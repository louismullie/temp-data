## Question

What are the considerations for propranolol use during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about considerations for propranolol use during pregnancy, integrating regulatory status, indications where benefits may outweigh risks, fetal and neonatal safety signals, trimester-specific concerns, and peripartum management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory/labeling framework and what the FDA labeling actually says today versus historical categories. Then, I should confirm which pregnancy indications have guideline support for propranolol and where it is not first-line. Next, I will examine fetal safety data, including malformations, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal beta-blockade near delivery. After that, I need to consider trimester-specific risks and how risk changes closer to delivery. Finally, I will outline practical management approaches, alternatives, and monitoring strategies that reconcile maternal benefit with fetal safety, ensuring citations underpin each claim [^113FV7SY] [^1123SXAV] [^115RpoPr].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status and risk summary. Propranolol's historical FDA pregnancy category was C, but current US labeling uses the PLLR narrative; prolonged clinical experience has not identified a drug-associated increase in major birth defects or miscarriage, yet labels consistently caution to use only if potential maternal benefit justifies fetal risk and to anticipate neonatal beta-blockade if used near delivery [^113FV7SY] [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo]. Wait, I should verify the animal data specifics: rats showed embryotoxicity at 150 mg/kg/day but not at 80 mg/kg/day (approximately the MRHD by BSA), while rabbits showed no embryo/neonatal toxicity up to about five times the MRHD, which supports a dose-related animal signal without definitive human teratogenicity, reinforcing a cautious benefit–risk stance in pregnancy [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo].

> Next, I should review where the benefits may plausibly outweigh risks based on guidelines. For maternal arrhythmias, ESC 2022 supports considering propranolol for long-term management of idiopathic sustained ventricular tachycardia during pregnancy, alongside metoprolol or verapamil, when clinically indicated and individualized to the patient's hemodynamics and substrate [^113rQV4q]. I need to check endocrine and hepatic scenarios: propranolol is acceptable for thyrotoxicosis management in pregnancy in ESC 2018, and nonselective beta-blockers including propranolol are recommended to initiate or continue for primary or secondary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage in portal hypertension during pregnancy if no contraindications exist, which is a situation where fetal risk is balanced against life-threatening maternal bleeding risk [^115RpoPr] [^112ZPw2U]. Hold on, let me not conflate hypertension guidance: for chronic or gestational hypertension, first-line agents are nifedipine (extended-release preferred), labetalol, or methyldopa per ESC 2024 — propranolol is not among preferred first-line antihypertensives in pregnancy, so it should generally be avoided for routine BP control unless a compelling non-BP indication exists [^1123SXAV].

> Now I will examine fetal and neonatal safety signals. Decades of observational experience have not shown an increased risk of overall major congenital anomalies or miscarriage with propranolol exposure, which is reassuring for baseline teratogenic risk, though confounding is possible in many datasets [^113FV7SY]. Wait, I listed "Reassuring Findings" and then jumped numbering to "3. Growth restriction" — that was sloppy; let me reorganize: multiple labels report inconsistent but concerning links between beta-blockers (including propranolol) and intrauterine growth restriction, and a Cochrane analysis suggests higher SGA risk with beta-blockers as a class, with some condition-specific literature suggesting higher IUGR rates on nonselective agents compared with beta-1 selective agents in certain cohorts, so growth surveillance is prudent if long-term therapy is required [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo] [^113dZmTK] [^1178un6L]. I should double-check neonatal outcomes near delivery: consistent across FDA labels, neonates exposed in utero close to delivery can present with bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression, and delivery planning should ensure appropriate monitoring and supportive care resources are available [^113FV7SY] [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo].

> I will now consider first-trimester risks. Class-wide meta-analysis reports no increase in overall congenital anomalies with first-trimester beta-blocker exposure but did observe increased odds of certain organ-specific defects (cardiovascular, orofacial clefts, neural tube defects), though heterogeneity, confounding by indication, and small numbers limit causal inference, so early pregnancy exposure warrants caution and shared decision-making, especially if alternatives are reasonable [^111MZiRG]. But wait, I should reconcile this with the FDA narrative: contemporary labels for propranolol do not identify a drug-associated increase in major defects, underscoring the uncertainty and the need to contextualize class meta-analysis findings against drug-specific evidence and clinical necessity [^113FV7SY].

> Next, I should review the second and third trimesters, when fetal growth and placental hemodynamics are central. Genetic instrumental variable analyses suggest that beta-blockade mechanisms may lower birthweight, and prospective cohorts of metoprolol/bisoprolol exposures report increased small-for-gestational-age rates compared with some comparators, though maternal disease severity remains a confounder; thus, if propranolol is required chronically beyond mid-gestation, I need to ensure serial fetal growth assessment and consider beta-1 selective alternatives if efficacy allows [^113inPiu] [^117Ki6jo] [^114keGaa]. Hold on, let me verify the directionality again: the effect sizes vary and atenolol appears particularly associated with lower birthweight in several datasets, reinforcing that agent selection within the class matters, and that propranolol decisions should be individualized rather than extrapolated mechanically from class signals [^113e56TJ].

> Peripartum management requires special attention. I should confirm that the time window matters: labels emphasize risk "near the time of delivery", not uniformly across gestation, for neonatal bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression, which means I should either plan to use the lowest effective dose, consider timing adjustments where clinically safe, and ensure neonatal monitoring and glucose surveillance post-delivery if exposure occurred close to labor, with NICU readiness for symptomatic infants [^113FV7SY] [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo] [^115RpoPr]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote "time-dependent" without specifying the label language; the FDA wording specifically ties risk to exposure "near the time of delivery", so I will stick to that phrasing to avoid overgeneralization [^113FV7SY].

> I need to check hypertension guidance once more so I do not overstate propranolol's role. For pregnant patients with nonsevere hypertension, network and Cochrane meta-analyses support treating to reduce severe hypertension, but guideline-preferred agents are extended-release nifedipine, labetalol, or methyldopa; renin-angiotensin system blockers are contraindicated, and atenolol should be avoided given stronger associations with fetal growth restriction, so propranolol should not be the default antihypertensive in pregnancy [^116tMPqY] [^1123SXAV] [^113EDV8P] [^113e56TJ] [^112pCAbj]. Let me reconsider: if a patient is already on propranolol for a compelling indication, BP effects can be counted but may be insufficient alone, necessitating addition of pregnancy-preferred agents rather than dose escalation that could increase fetal beta-blockade risk near term [^1123SXAV].

> For arrhythmias, I should confirm the hierarchy of options. ESC 2022 allows propranolol or metoprolol for idiopathic sustained VT in pregnancy, and contemporary reviews note that all antiarrhythmics cross the placenta and require individualized dosing due to altered pharmacokinetics in pregnancy; sotalol may be effective but carries fetal bradycardia and QT-prolongation concerns, so if beta-blockade is indicated, a beta-1 selective agent is often preferred unless there is a specific rationale for nonselective blockade like in certain channelopathies, keeping close maternal-fetal monitoring in place [^113rQV4q] [^115LB8zg] [^114Nh1V9] [^112tYtFa]. Hold on, I should verify I am not implying a prohibition on propranolol; it remains acceptable for specific arrhythmia scenarios, but the selection should weigh maternal efficacy, fetal growth considerations, and neonatal beta-blockade risk, revisited each trimester as physiology shifts [^113rQV4q] [^115RpoPr].

> Practical monitoring and mitigation steps follow from these risks. I need to ensure baseline risk assessment and shared decision-making, document the indication, use the lowest effective dose, and schedule serial fetal growth ultrasounds if long-term therapy is anticipated, given SGA signals with beta-blockers as a class; if therapy continues within days of delivery, I should alert neonatology for postnatal observation with heart rate and glucose monitoring for at least the early transitional period, especially in late preterm or growth-restricted infants [^113dZmTK] [^113FV7SY]. If unexplained fetal growth deceleration occurs, I should reconsider beta-blocker selection, dosing, or the need for continuation versus alternative therapies, balancing maternal disease control against modifiable fetal risks in collaboration with maternal-fetal medicine and the relevant specialty team [^113inPiu].

> I will now examine lactation considerations briefly. Let me verify label language: propranolol is present in human milk at low levels; while specific adverse effects are not well-defined, caution is advised and maternal clinical need should be weighed against potential exposure, with attention to infant bradycardia or hypoglycemia if high maternal doses are used postpartum or if the infant is premature or growth-restricted [^114BCbW8] [^116oiLhE]. But wait, I should not overstate harm; most lactation experiences with propranolol are uneventful, yet prudent monitoring is reasonable in higher-risk dyads given class pharmacology [^114BCbW8].

> In summary, I need to ensure propranolol in pregnancy is framed as acceptable when there is a compelling maternal indication — such as certain arrhythmias, thyrotoxicosis, or variceal prophylaxis — while for routine hypertension first-line choices remain nifedipine ER, labetalol, or methyldopa; long-term beta-blocker exposure carries a signal for fetal growth restriction, and use near delivery increases the likelihood of neonatal beta-blockade manifestations that warrant planned monitoring, so decisions should be individualized, revisited across trimesters, and coordinated with obstetrics and neonatology to optimize both maternal control and fetal-neonatal safety [^113rQV4q] [^115RpoPr] [^112ZPw2U] [^1123SXAV] [^113FV7SY].

---

Propranolol crosses the placenta [^113FV7SY] and is not teratogenic, but is associated with **fetal growth restriction** [^113inPiu] and **neonatal bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression** [^116oiLhE] in pregnancy [^1173irx2]. Use only if **benefits outweigh risks** [^112rJUQM], with close **fetal growth monitoring** and neonatal observation at birth. First-line antihypertensives in pregnancy are **labetalol**, **extended-release nifedipine**, or **methyldopa** [^1123SXAV] [^116tMPqY]; propranolol is reserved for specific indications — such as arrhythmias [^113rQV4q], thyrotoxicosis [^115RpoPr], or variceal bleeding [^112ZPw2U] — when alternatives are unsuitable.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and placental transfer

The **placental transfer** of propranolol [^113FV7SY] occurs readily, exposing the fetus to significant drug levels [^116oiLhE]. Maternal **pharmacokinetics** [^115Nh6Lx] are altered during pregnancy, potentially requiring dose adjustments [^1169QB9X].

---

## Fetal and neonatal risks

- **Fetal growth restriction (FGR)**: Propranolol is associated [^1173irx2] with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) [^113inPiu] and small-for-gestational-age infants [^113FV7SY] [^113dZmTK].

- **Neonatal bradycardia**: Propranolol exposure near delivery [^116oiLhE] can cause neonatal bradycardia [^113FV7SY] [^1173irx2].

- **Neonatal hypoglycemia**: Propranolol can cause neonatal hypoglycemia [^113FV7SY], especially with maternal fasting or poor intake.

- **Respiratory depression**: Neonatal respiratory depression [^113FV7SY] has been reported with propranolol exposure near delivery [^116oiLhE] [^1173irx2].

---

## Teratogenicity

Congenital anomalies are not increased; propranolol is **not associated with major congenital malformations** or miscarriage [^113FV7SY].

---

## Clinical indications during pregnancy

Propranolol is **not first-line for hypertension** in pregnancy [^1123SXAV] but may be used for **specific indications**:

- **Arrhythmias**: Propranolol is recommended for long-term management of idiopathic sustained ventricular tachycardia [^113rQV4q] during pregnancy.

- **Thyrotoxicosis**: Propranolol is acceptable for treating thyrotoxicosis [^115RpoPr] in pregnancy [^112rJUQM].

- **Variceal bleeding**: Propranolol is recommended for primary or secondary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage [^112ZPw2U] in pregnancy when no contraindications exist.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **labetalol**, **extended-release nifedipine**, or **methyldopa** as first-line antihypertensives in pregnancy [^1123SXAV] [^116tMPqY]. Only use **propranolol** when the potential benefits outweigh the risks [^112rJUQM], with careful monitoring of fetal growth and neonatal outcomes [^113FV7SY].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Fetal monitoring**: Regular ultrasound monitoring of fetal growth is recommended due to the risk of IUGR [^113FV7SY].

- **Neonatal monitoring**: Neonates exposed to propranolol should be monitored for bradycardia [^113FV7SY], hypoglycemia [^116oiLhE], and respiratory depression [^112rJUQM].

- **Dose adjustments**: Propranolol dosage may need adjustment during pregnancy [^115Nh6Lx] due to altered pharmacokinetics [^1169QB9X] [^113FV7SY].

---

## Alternative medications

Alternative medications include **labetalol** [^1123SXAV], the preferred beta-blocker for hypertension in pregnancy due to a better safety profile, and **metoprolol**, which is considered safer than propranolol for hypertension in pregnancy. **Methyldopa** [^112pCAbj] is recommended for mild to moderate hypertension, and **nifedipine** [^116tMPqY] is the preferred calcium channel blocker, in pregnancy.

### Inderal XL [^113FV7SY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prolonged experience with propranolol in pregnant women over several decades, based on published interventional and observational studies, has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal outcomes. Bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression have been observed with the use of beta-blockers, including propranolol, in utero near the time of delivery. There are inconsistent reports of intrauterine growth restriction with beta-blocker use, including propranolol, during pregnancy. Untreated hypertension during pregnancy can lead to serious adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus (see Clinical Considerations and Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g. need for cesarean section, and postpartum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^1173irx2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

Propranolol hydrochloride is classified as Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive and developmental toxicology studies, propranolol hydrochloride was administered to rats by gavage or in the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At doses of 150 mg/kg/day, but not at 80 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the maximum recommended human oral daily dose on a body surface area basis), treatment was associated with embryotoxicity, as evidenced by reduced litter size and increased resorption rates, as well as neonatal toxicity, including deaths. When administered in the feed to rabbits throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses as high as 150 mg/kg/day (approximately five times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose), no evidence of embryo or neonatal toxicity was noted.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Intrauterine growth retardation, small placentas, and congenital abnormalities have been reported in neonates whose mothers received propranolol during pregnancy. Neonates whose mothers received propranolol at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and/or respiratory depression; therefore, adequate facilities for monitoring such infants at birth should be available. Propranolol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Nursing mothers**: Propranolol is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when propranolol is administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of propranolol in pediatric patients have not been established.

Bronchospasm and congestive heart failure have been reported coincidentally with propranolol use.

### Lopressor [^112jQFCR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated an association of adverse developmental outcomes with maternal use of metoprolol during pregnancy. Untreated hypertension and myocardial infarction during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus. In animal reproduction studies, metoprolol has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at oral dosages of 500 mg/kg/day, approximately 11 times the daily dose of 450 mg in a 60-kg patient on a mg/m² basis.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g. need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: Living with uncertainty [^114DZ7zt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Nifedipine is available in a short/immediate‐acting capsule and a prolonged‐acting tablet, usually prescribed 2 to 3 times daily. As a vasodilator, the shorter-acting preparations are more likely to be associated with rapid acute decreases in blood pressure and reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, causing increases in heart rate and headaches, especially when used at higher doses (> 60 mg/d). Moreover, abrupt decreases in blood pressure associated with nifedipine capsules can be potentially problematic for placental perfusion.

Dose‐related maternal adverse effects attributable to nifedipine, such as headache, tachycardia, hypotension flushing, and nausea, have been well documented. However, no comparative data exist for amlodipine in pregnancy. Amlodipine, which has a gradual onset of action, is less likely to be associated with vasodilator symptoms and thus may be associated with better compliance and possibly smoother 24‐hour blood pressure control compared with twice‐daily nifedipine tablets. However, if the extended‐release preparation of nifedipine is used, the differences may not be significant in terms of 24‐hour blood pressure control or side effects.

The slow onset of amlodipine implies that antihypertensive effects are delayed (≈8 hours). Limited information suggests that both nifedipine and amlodipine enter breast milk but are unlikely to be associated with adverse fetal effects. Additional questions, not addressed by most studies, assess the impact of drug safety for different maternal diagnoses, such as preeclampsia versus chronic conditions.

### Fetoplacental vascular effects of maternal adrenergic antihypertensive and cardioprotective medications in pregnancy [^115z4DTL]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

**Aim 1: Adrenergic receptor expression in the fetoplacental and in the adult peripheral microvasculature**: In adults, the peripheral microcirculation has the crucial function of regulating nutrient and waste exchange, as well as controlling local vascular tone and blood perfusion within the tissues. Similarly, the fetoplacental vasculature facilitates fine control of blood flow by maintaining low resistance and high flow throughout gestation to deliver sufficient oxygen and nutrients to the fetoplacental circulation for normal fetal growth. Although sympathetic nervous system stimulation is known to regulate vascular tone in the adult peripheral circulation, the fetoplacental circulation is devoid of such innervation. While adrenergic receptors are widely distributed within the cardiovascular system, with locus-specific and functional expression depending on both animal species and the vascular bed, limited information is available concerning the human fetoplacental microcirculation. Figure 3 summarizes information on relative adrenergic receptor expression in the fetoplacental and adult peripheral microvasculature of humans, rodents, and other species (goat, pig, cat, and rabbit).

### SPL drug information for sotalol hydrochloride [^114Nh1V9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Use of sotalol hydrochloride IV (also known as Betapace) in pregnant patients across all trimesters should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Evidence suggests fetal harm in animal studies. Both the administration of sotalol and the untreated underlying condition during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the mother, fetus, or neonate. The incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) is increased and may be more symptomatic during pregnancy. Breakthrough arrhythmias may occur as therapeutic drug concentrations are challenging to maintain due to increased volume of distribution and heightened drug metabolism during pregnancy. Sotalol crosses the placenta and is detectable in amniotic fluid. Observational studies indicate potential fetal adverse effects such as growth restriction, transient fetal bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, maternal uterine contractions, and intrauterine death.

Sotalol may also enhance QT prolongation in the immature heart, which could increase the risk of serious fetal arrhythmia and/or intrauterine death. It is crucial to monitor exposed neonates for symptoms of β-blockade and to continuously monitor mothers treated with sotalol during labor and obstetric delivery, as the risk of arrhythmias rises during this process. Sotalol hydrochloride IV is classified as category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate.

### Safety of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy: A Mendelian randomization study [^1137kbLd]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker (BB) and calcium channel blocker (CCB) antihypertensive drugs are commonly used in pregnancy. However, data on their relative impact on maternal and foetal outcomes are limited. We leveraged genetic variants mimicking BB and CCB antihypertensive drugs to investigate their effects on the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and birthweight using the Mendelian randomization paradigm.

- **Methods**: Genetic association estimates for systolic blood pressure (SBP) were extracted from summary data of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 757,601 participants. Uncorrelated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SBP (p < 5×10^-8) in BB and CCB drug target gene regions were selected as proxies for drug target perturbation. Genetic association estimates for the outcomes were extracted from GWASs on 4,743 cases and 136,325 controls (women without a hypertensive disorder in pregnancy) for pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, 7,676 cases and 130,424 controls (women without any pregnancy-related morbidity) for gestational diabetes, and 155,202 women (who have given birth at least once) for the birthweight of the first child. All studies were in European ancestry populations. Mendelian randomization estimates were generated using the two-sample inverse-variance weighted model.

- **Results**: Although not reaching the conventional threshold for statistical significance, genetically-proxied BB was associated with reduced risk of pre-eclampsia (OR per 10 mmHg SBP reduction 0.27, 95%CI 0.06–1.19, p = 0.08) and increased risk of gestational diabetes (OR per 10 mmHg SBP redu.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^116oiLhE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**: In a series of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies, propranolol hydrochloride was given to rats by gavage or in the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At doses of 150 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a body surface area basis), treatment was associated with embryotoxicity, including reduced litter size and increased resorption rates, as well as neonatal toxicity, such as deaths. Propranolol hydrochloride was also administered in the feed to rabbits (throughout pregnancy and lactation) at doses as high as 150 mg/kg/day (about 5 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose). No evidence of embryo or neonatal toxicity was noted.

	- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Intrauterine growth retardation has been reported for neonates whose mothers received propranolol hydrochloride during pregnancy. Neonates whose mothers received propranolol hydrochloride at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Adequate facilities for monitoring such infants at birth should be available. Propranolol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

### The risk of congenital malformations associated with exposure to β-blockers early in pregnancy: a meta-analysis [^111MZiRG]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

β-blockers are commonly used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Despite their common use, data about the risks of congenital anomalies in offspring have not been fully summarized. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the teratogenicity of β-blockers in early pregnancy. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Clinical Trials, and hand searches. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models based on odds ratios (ORs). Prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out to explore heterogeneity.

Randomized controlled trials or observational studies examining the risks of congenital malformations associated with first-trimester β-blocker exposure, compared with no exposure, were included. Thirteen population-based case-control or cohort studies were identified. Based on meta-analyses, first-trimester oral β-blocker use showed no increased odds of all or major congenital anomalies (OR = 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.10; 5 studies). However, in analyses examining organ-specific malformations, increased odds of cardiovascular defects (OR = 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–3.42; 4 studies), cleft lip/palate (OR = 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.79–5.43; 2 studies), and neural tube defects (OR = 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.19–10.67; 2 studies) were observed. The effects on severe hypospadias were nonsignificant (1 study).

Causality is difficult to interpret given the small number of heterogeneous studies and the possibility of biases. Considering the frequency of β-blocker exposure during pregnancy, further research is needed.

### Intrauterine growth retardation in pregnant women with long QT syndrome treated with beta-receptor blockers [^1178un6L]. Neonatology (2021). Low credibility.

Pregnant women with inherited long QT syndrome (iLQTS) are at an increased risk for preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) due to their underlying disease. They also face a risk of arrhythmogenic events, particularly during the postpartum period, owing to physiological changes and increased emotional/physical stress. β-receptor blockers can effectively prevent life-threatening Torsades de Pointes ventricular tachycardia and are considered the treatment of choice in iLQTS. Although the use of β-receptor blockers during pregnancy is recommended, IUGR is commonly reported for prenatally exposed infants. IUGR, especially in preterm infants, can lead to adverse neonatal outcomes.

This review was conducted to assist clinicians in their selection of β-receptor blocker treatment for pregnant women with iLQTS by:

- **Summarizing the available literature**: Addressing the impact of different β-receptor blockers on IUGR.
- **Reporting additional aspects**: Highlighting factors that might influence the selection of β-receptor blockers.

In general, experts recommend the use of nonselective β-receptor blockers, such as nadolol and propranolol, for iLQTS management, as these drugs appear to be superior in effectiveness. However, β-1-selective receptor blockers, such as bisoprolol or metoprolol, are less likely to affect uterine contraction and peripheral vasodilation and are associated with lower rates of IUGR and fetal hypoglycemia. They are therefore recommended, except atenolol, as first-line therapy for pregnant women. Additionally, maternal factors such as iLQTS genotype and other underlying comorbidities should be considered when selecting treatment options.

### Evolving mechanisms of action of beta blockers: Focus on nebivolol [^115wbehn]. Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on beta-blocker toxicity:

- **Definition**: Beta-blocker toxicity refers to an overdose or excessive exposure to β-blocker medications.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of β-blocker toxicity involves the excessive blockade of β-adrenergic receptors, which leads to a decrease in heart rate and myocardial workload.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of β-blocker toxicity is estimated at 5.1% among hospitalized patients with acute poisoning.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with β-blocker toxicity often present with bradycardia, hypotension, and varying degrees of atrioventricular block. In severe cases, patients may experience life-threatening cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological interventions.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of β-blocker toxicity can range from mild to severe, depending on the amount of β-blocker ingested and the time elapsed before treatment.

### Oral beta-blockers for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^113dZmTK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Antihypertensives, such as beta-blockers, are used for pregnancy hypertension in the belief that these will improve outcomes for both mother and baby.

- **Objective**: To assess whether oral beta-blockers are better than placebo, or no beta-blocker, and have advantages over other antihypertensives, for women with mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2002), bibliographies of retrieved papers, and personal files.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials comparing beta-blockers with placebo or no therapy, or other antihypertensives, for women with mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted the data independently and were not blinded to trial characteristics or outcomes. Whenever possible, we contacted authors for missing data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-nine trials (approximately 2500 women) are included. Thirteen trials (1480 women) compared beta-blockers with placebo or no beta-blocker. Oral beta-blockers decrease the risk of severe hypertension (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.53; 11 trials, N = 1128 women) and the need for additional antihypertensives (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 7 trials, N = 856 women). There are insufficient data for conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality or preterm birth. Beta-blockers seem to be associated with an increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 12 trials, N = 1346 women). Maternal hospital admission may be decreased.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^1118htja]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infantile hemangioma, specifically with respect to oral beta-blockers, AAP 2019 guidelines recommend instructing caregivers to administer propranolol with or after feeding. They should also hold doses at times of diminished oral intake or vomiting to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^113nT9Q8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used based on the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, thereby improving outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant trials were identified in the register of trials maintained by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched. Date of last search: October 2000.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined whenever possible as systolic blood pressure 140–169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90–109 mmHg. Comparisons were made between one or more antihypertensive drug(s) and placebo, no antihypertensive drug, or another antihypertensive drug, with treatment planned to continue for at least seven days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers.

- **Main results**: Overall, this review includes 40 studies (3797 women), 24 of which compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (2815 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) [17 trials, 2155 women; relative risk (RR) 0.52 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.64); risk difference (RD) -0.09 (-0.12 to -0.06)].

Regarding the use of propranolol hydrochloride IV (also known as Hemangeol) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans exists, necessitating the monitoring of fetal bradycardia. Additionally, monitor neonates for hypoglycemia. The drug propranolol hydrochloride IV (also known as Hemangeol) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Propranolol therapy for congenital chylothorax [^116GDyPd]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Congenital chylothorax is a rare and often severe anomaly without well-established medical therapies. Previously, propranolol use in patients with lymphatic malformations and secondary chylothorax was associated with improvement in clinical signs. We hypothesized that propranolol treatment would be beneficial for severe congenital chylothorax. We reviewed medical records of neonates born from 2015 to 2019 at our tertiary center with a prenatal diagnosis of congenital chylothorax for whom either prenatal or postnatal propranolol therapy was initiated.

Inclusion was limited to fetuses diagnosed with severe congenital chylothorax without significant genetic, infectious, or cardiac anomalies, and who underwent prenatal interventions to mitigate consequences of the condition. Propranolol was administered orally to pregnant women at 20 mg 4 times daily and increased to a maximum dose of 40 mg 4 times daily, or to infants at 0.3 mg/kg/d and increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/d. Primary outcomes were the time course of resolution of ultrasonographical, clinical, and/or radiologic signs of chylothorax after treatment with propranolol.

Four neonates met the inclusion criteria. In 2 cases, prenatal initiation of propranolol led to resolution of the chylothoraxes before delivery (38 and 32 days after treatment) on a dose of 40 mg/day 4 times daily. Neonates had a normal postnatal course. Postnatal propranolol was initiated in 2 neonates with respiratory failure when chylothoraces were refractory to standard management. Stabilization and improvement of their pleural effusion was observed by imaging.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy [^115RpoPr]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of propranolol hydrochloride PO (also known as Hemangeol) in pregnant patients across all trimesters, it should only be used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is important to monitor for fetal bradycardia and to observe neonates for hypoglycemia and respiratory depression. Patients managed for hypertension may continue treatment during pregnancy unless contraindications exist. Propranolol can be used for maternal arrhythmias during pregnancy and is also acceptable for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.

The drug propranolol hydrochloride PO is classified under Category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, though not causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Metoprolol [^113hBtNo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated an association of adverse developmental outcomes with maternal use of metoprolol during pregnancy (see Data). Untreated hypertension and heart failure during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, metoprolol has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at oral dosages of 500 mg/kg/day, approximately 24 times the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient on a mg/m² basis.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations: Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g. need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Stroke volume and heart rate increase during pregnancy, increasing cardiac output, especially during the first trimester. There is a risk for preterm birth.

### Safety of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy: A Mendelian randomization study [^113inPiu]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

We leveraged genetic variants mimicking BB and CCB drug classes to investigate their respective effects on pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and birthweight. Our results support the assertion that BB antihypertensive drugs may lower birthweight by providing consistent results in MR analysis and evidence of a shared causal variant in colocalization analysis. Caution and pharmacovigilance may therefore be warranted regarding the use of BB antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy. Conversely, our genetic evidence supported that CCB reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia but had no apparent impact on birthweight category or gestational diabetes. CCBs may therefore be the preferred first-line agent to treat hypertension in pregnancy because of a potentially superior safety profile.

Treatment of mild hypertension in pregnancy has been shown to lead to a lower risk of adverse maternal outcomes in a recent RCT. In this study, the majority of patients were given labetalol or nifedipine as the first-line antihypertensive agent. These antihypertensive drugs, BB and CCB agents respectively, are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK as first- and second-line agents for hypertension in pregnancy. However, evidence regarding their comparative safety and efficacy is scarce. Historically, ethical concerns surrounding RCTs in pregnancy have precluded their implementation, especially in the setting of primary prevention. Where RCTs have been undertaken, they often lack sufficient enrolment to detect adverse effects.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: Living with uncertainty [^113L17Mv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The practitioner is faced with the challenge of prescribing (or continuing) antihypertensive medications, which may be beneficial for the mother but are of unclear benefit for the fetus. The drugs most commonly used — methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine — are widely accepted as safe in pregnancy, based on many years of experience, observational data from large databases, and meta-analyses of multiple small clinical trials. A recent comprehensive systematic review of published studies addressing adverse outcomes in children with in utero exposure to antihypertensive medications found 47 studies eligible for inclusion, and only 5 were considered of excellent quality. Although several studies reported increased odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital malformations in treated patients compared with normotensive untreated reference groups, these adverse effects were not uniformly observed in different studies within the same class of medication. Similar adverse events were also observed in untreated hypertensive women. The authors concluded that although there is no compelling evidence for teratogenicity of most antihypertensive agents, the methodological weakness of the evidence prevents definitive answers about the safety of these drugs, even when including studies with hundreds of thousands of participants.

### Safety of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy: A Mendelian randomization study [^116DGce3]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, using large-scale genetic association data, we find evidence supporting that maternal BB antihypertensive drug use during pregnancy may lower birthweight. Our findings provide an important rationale for pharmacovigilance studies on BBs and RCTs comparing BB and CCB drugs in pregnancy.

### Fetoplacental vascular effects of maternal adrenergic antihypertensive and cardioprotective medications in pregnancy [^116jiSeT]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Although adrenergic therapies are prescribed to improve maternal cardiovascular function during pregnancy, the data supporting the effect of these medications on fetal growth and development are lacking. All known adrenergic receptor subtypes are functionally expressed in the umbilico-fetoplacental vasculature. However, there remains little evidence for specific receptor expression in the microcirculation of the placental villi, particularly within stem arterioles, which are likely the most important locus in the regulation of placental vascular tone. Delineating the downstream pathways in the microcirculation of the placenta could provide important knowledge for predicting the net effects on the fetus. The evidence presented in this review highlights the unique nature of placental adrenergic pharmacology and the dearth of knowledge regarding the effects of antihypertensive and cardiac therapeutics on fetal blood flow through this vital organ. Understanding the vasoreactivity of the fetoplacental vasculature in response to locus-specific adrenergic activation/deactivation, and subsequently the impact on blood flow, is a key priority in obstetric research.

### Study protocol: Safety and efficacy of propranolol 0.2% eye drops in newborns with a precocious stage of retinopathy of prematurity (DROP-ROP-0.2%): A multicenter, open-label, single arm, phase II trial [^113RPvnn]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

For a long time, an oxygen saturation level lower than 90% has been suggested to reduce the risk of ROP. However, the recent demonstration that a higher oxygen saturation (91–95%) correlates with improved survival represents an actual dilemma because, unfortunately, it induces a higher risk of ROP development. Apart from oxygen tension, which is the main factor promoting the expression of angiogenic growth factors in proliferative retinopathies, other mechanisms are involved in the vascular response to ischemia/hypoxia. These include the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and the production of nitric oxide. Genetic factors might also affect the risk for ROP, even though none have been identified thus far. The disease progresses more often in white than black infants and in boys than girls.

- **The role of the β-adrenergic system**: Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenoreceptor (β-AR) antagonist. For many years, it has been largely used in the pediatric population affected by cardiovascular diseases (i.e. arterial hypertension, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Fallot tetralogy, and arrhythmia), hyperthyroidism (i.e. neonatal thyrotoxicosis), migraine, and portal hypertension with gastroesophageal varices at risk of bleeding. Propranolol is also effective and sufficiently safe in treating infantile hemangioma (IH) in childhood, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently authorized the use of propranolol for life-threatening IH, at risk of ulceration or permanent deformation. The working mechanisms of propranolol in reducing proliferative IH are under investigation.

### Pregnancy outcome after first trimester exposure to bisoprolol: An observational cohort study [^114keGaa]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are frequently used during pregnancy, with labetalol and metoprolol being considered drugs of choice. As there are no prospective pregnancy studies for bisoprolol yet, our aim was to analyze pregnancy outcomes after bisoprolol exposure.

- **Methods**: Pregnancies exposed to bisoprolol during the first trimester were retrieved from the German Embryotox pharmacovigilance database. Pregnancy outcomes of prospectively ascertained pregnancies were compared with women neither exposed to beta-blockers nor other antihypertensives. Additionally, retrospective reports on adverse drug reactions were screened for patterns of birth defects.

- **Results**: Inclusion criteria for the prospective study were met by 339 bisoprolol-treated women and 678 patients in the comparison cohort. Neither the risk for spontaneous abortions [adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj.) 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66–1.70] nor for major congenital malformations [adjusted odds ratio (ORadj.) 0.77; 95% CI 0.34–1.75] was increased after first trimester bisoprolol treatment. However, higher rates of preterm births [ORadj. 1.90; 95% CI 1.17–3.11] and reduced birthweights in singleton pregnancies (adjusted standard deviation score difference -0.48; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.34) were noted. Continued treatment with beta-blockers until birth was associated with a higher risk for growth restriction than first trimester exposure only. A sensitivity analysis did not suggest higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in hypertensive women on bisoprolol compared with nonhypertensive bisoprolol-exposed women.

### Neonatal effects of intrauterine metoprolol/bisoprolol exposure during the second and third trimester: a cohort study with two comparison groups [^117Ki6jo]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of beta-blockers during the second and third trimester on fetal growth, length of gestation, and postnatal symptoms in exposed infants.

- **Methods**: The prospective observational cohort study compared 294 neonates of hypertensive mothers on metoprolol or bisoprolol during the second and/or third trimester with 225 methyldopa-exposed infants and 588 infants of nonhypertensive mothers. The risks for reduced birth weight, prematurity, neonatal bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory disorders were analyzed.

- **Results**: The rate of small-for-gestational-age children was significantly higher in long-term beta-blocker exposed infants (24.1%) compared with the methyldopa cohort [10.2%, odds ratio (OR)adj 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–5.2] and the nonhypertensive cohort (9.9%, ORadj 4.3, 95% CI 2.6–7.1). The risk for preterm birth was significantly increased compared with nonhypertensive pregnancies (ORadj 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–3.8) but not compared with the methyldopa cohort. Neonatal adverse outcomes occurred more frequently in the study cohort (11.5%) compared with the nonhypertensive comparison group (6.5%) and the methyldopa cohort (8.4%), but without statistical significance [ORadj 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.0 and ORadj 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.3, respectively].

- **Conclusion**: Long-term intrauterine exposure to metoprolol or bisoprolol may increase the risk of being born small-for-gestational-age. It is still a matter of debate to what extent maternal hypertension contributes to the lower birth weight. Serious neonatal symptoms are rare.

### Coreg CR [^1178Hc7v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data regarding the use of COREG CR in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at clinically relevant doses (see Data). Oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and an increased frequency of delayed fetal skeletal development at maternally toxic doses that were 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In addition, oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss at doses 25 times the MRHD (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Review of cardiovascular drugs in pregnancy [^1169QB9X]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is now the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States, highlighting the importance of proper cardiovascular management as maternal mortality increases. Significant physiological changes during pregnancy affect the heart's ability to respond to pathological processes, such as hypertension and heart failure. These physiological changes further affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of cardiac medications. During pregnancy, these changes can significantly alter medication efficacy and metabolism.

This article systematically reviews the literature on the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of cardiovascular drugs used for hypertension and heart failure during pregnancy and lactation. According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines, it is recommended to transition pregnant patients to methyldopa, nifedipine, or labetalol.

Heart failure medications, including beta-blockers, furosemide, and digoxin, are relatively safe and can be used effectively. While medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have been shown to be beneficial in the general population, they are teratogenic and, therefore, contraindicated in pregnancy.

Cardiovascular medications can also enter breast milk, and care must be taken when selecting drugs during the lactation period. A summary of the safety of drugs during pregnancy and lactation from the online resource, LactMed by the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET database, is included.

### Propranolol for treatment of genital infantile hemangioma [^115byoLA]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Genital infantile hemangiomas are vascular anomalies that often require complex management and interdisciplinary care. Propranolol was first used to treat patients with infantile hemangiomas in 2008 and has since gained acceptance as first-line therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: We review the presentation, course, management, and outcomes of all cases of genital infantile hemangiomas managed by propranolol administration at a single institution from April 2010 to July 2014.

- **Results**: During the study period, 9 patients with genital infantile hemangiomas were referred to our hemangioma treatment clinic. Propranolol was initially administered under careful outpatient monitoring at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily in 8 patients. One patient, a 700 gm premature infant, was started on therapy in the inpatient setting at 0.5 mg/kg daily, given the history of prematurity. All patients underwent a successful increase of dose to at least 2 mg/kg for the observation phase after tolerating the starting doses. One patient discontinued propranolol prematurely per parental request due to concern regarding peripheral vasoconstriction. Otherwise, no patient demonstrated significant hypotension, symptomatic bradycardia, hypoglycemia, or other major side effect requiring treatment discontinuation. All patients who continued the treatment protocol had an excellent response to therapy.

- **Conclusions**: Propranolol therapy for genital infantile hemangiomas was successfully initiated and the dosage increased in 9 young children without significant side effects and with marked improvement in all patients who completed the study.

### SPL drug information for sotalol hydrochloride [^115LB8zg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of sotalol hydrochloride PO (also known as Betapace) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Both the use of sotalol and the untreated underlying condition in pregnancy can cause adverse outcomes to the mother and fetus/neonate. The incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) is increased and may be more symptomatic during pregnancy. Breakthrough arrhythmias may also occur during pregnancy, as therapeutic drug concentrations may be difficult to maintain due to the increased volume of distribution and increased drug metabolism during pregnancy.

Sotalol crosses the placenta and is found in amniotic fluid. From published observational studies, potential fetal adverse effects include growth restriction, transient fetal bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, maternal uterine contractions, and intrauterine death. Sotalol may have a greater effect on QT prolongation in the immature heart, increasing the risk of serious fetal arrhythmia and/or intrauterine death. Exposed neonates should be monitored for symptoms of β-blockade. Mothers treated with sotalol should be continuously monitored during labor and obstetric delivery, as the risk of arrhythmias increases during these processes.

The drug sotalol hydrochloride PO (also known as Betapace) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate.

### Levophed [^112GN1Yu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Limited published data, consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery, have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. The clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower. Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately two times the maximum recommended dose on an mg/m³ basis for four days during organogenesis.

The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**:
	- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy that can be fatal if untreated.

### Efficacy of propranolol to reduce cesarean delivery in prolonged labor: A randomized controlled trial [^113mVfVu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

The study PROPEL, conducted by Jennifer A. McCoy and colleagues in 2023, was published in the journal "Obstetrics and Gynecology". This study focuses on labor dystocia, shoulder dystocia, and cesarean delivery. The trial investigated the role of propranolol in patients experiencing prolonged labor. It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 164 female patients.

Patients included in the trial had a singleton gestation of ≥ 36 weeks with prolonged labor. Key exclusion criteria comprised severe preeclampsia, maternal heart rate < 70 beats/min, maternal blood pressure < 90/50 mmHg, asthma, diabetes requiring insulin during labor, and cardiac contraindications to β-blockade. The interventions were: 84 patients received propranolol (at an intravenous dose of 2 mg) and 80 patients received a placebo (intravenous dose of 2 mL normal saline).

The primary outcome showed no significant difference in cesarean delivery rates (57.1% vs. 57.5%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.76 to 1.29). Secondary outcomes included no significant differences in maternal morbidity (12% vs. 6%; RR 2, 95% CI -1.12 to 5.12), shoulder dystocia (4% vs. 5%; RR 0.8, 95% CI -3.23 to 4.83), and neonatal morbidity (8% vs. 5%; RR 1.6, 95% CI -3.38 to 6.58).

The conclusion of the PROPEL study was that, for patients with a singleton gestation of ≥ 36 weeks and prolonged labor, propranolol was not superior to placebo regarding cesarean delivery.

### Antihypertensive drugs during pregnancy [^115GBxBk]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical disorders during pregnancy, associated with increased adverse maternal and fetal outcomes both acute and long-term. Despite the lack of evidence on the benefits or harms, antihypertensive agents are widely used in treating these pregnancies. Multiple agents are available, and various guidelines recommend different agents, doses, and regimens in the absence of information about their pharmacokinetics, disposition, and pharmacodynamic effects during pregnancy.

Randomized trials comparing antihypertensive therapy to a placebo are lacking, and the available data have not demonstrated clinical benefits due to inadequate sample sizes, which preclude ruling out even moderate to large effects on perinatal outcomes. Furthermore, there is limited data on teratogenic effects, adverse fetal-neonatal effects, and long-term infant outcomes. These challenges stem from a lack of interest and support from the government and pharmaceutical companies regarding research in pregnant women, largely due to regulatory and medical-legal concerns. Consequently, there is an urgent need to conduct clinical research in this area.

### Inderal XL [^114BCbW8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: Propranolol is present in human milk at low levels, but the related risk to a breastfed infant is unknown. There are no data on the effects of propranolol on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Inderal XL and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Inderal XL or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Based on the published literature, beta-blockers, including propranolol, may cause erectile dysfunction. In rats, propranolol inhibits spermatogenesis [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness of propranolol in pediatric patients have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of Inderal XL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

- **Renal impairment**: The exposure to propranolol is increased in patients with renal impairment. Initiate Inderal XL therapy in patients with impaired renal function at the lowest dose (80 mg) once daily and monitor patients closely for adjusted dosing as necessary.

### In utero beta 2 adrenergic agonist exposure and adverse neurophysiologic and behavioral outcomes [^113QPFZ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Beta 2 adrenergic receptor overstimulation during critical periods of prenatal development can induce a permanent shift in the balance of sympathetic-to-parasympathetic tone. This is a biologically plausible mechanism whereby beta 2 adrenergic agonists can induce functional and behavioral teratogenesis, which explains their association with increases in autism spectrum disorders, psychiatric disorders, poor cognitive and motor function, impaired school performance, and changes in blood pressure in offspring. The use of beta 2 adrenergic agonists should be limited to proven indications when alternative drugs are ineffective or unavailable; the risks of untreated disease to the mother and fetus are greater than the risk posed by the beta 2 adrenergic agonist.

### Edarbyclor [^116AUiZC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Edarbyclor can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death (see clinical considerations). Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents.

When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Edarbyclor as soon as possible.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**:

	- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g. need for cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

	- **Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions**: Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters.

### Supraventricular arrhythmia in pregnancy [^112tYtFa]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

All antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) cross the placenta, although data on fetal toxicity are often limited. If possible, drug therapy may be avoided or postponed until after the first trimester, in which the teratogenic risk is highest, but therapy can be necessary and justified in persisting arrhythmias. Due to the altered maternal pharmacodynamics and kinetics, the required drug dosage may be either lower or higher (e.g. digoxin, due to increased clearance and volume of distribution) than in non-pregnant women. In case 1, adenosine and verapamil were used, both of which prolong the effective refractory period of the AV node and have a success rate of 90% in terminating acute attacks. Alternatively, digoxin or beta-blockers could be used to terminate or suppress AV(N)RT. Adenosine can be safely administered in the same dosage as in non-pregnant patients. There are few data on verapamil or diltiazem, but no teratogenicity or maternal side effects during pregnancy are reported. Caution is warranted when combining class 1C or 1A because of potentially deleterious negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on mother and fetus.

Sinus rhythm in case 1 was established only after the delivery, which shows the crucial role that pregnancy physiology has in provoking the new onset or (frequent) recurrence of arrhythmia.

### Assessment of severity of long QT syndrome phenotype and risk of fetal death [^115PeWaA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The effect of β‐blocker therapy on birth weight was studied, with women receiving β‐blocker (BB) therapy throughout pregnancy in 44 of 64 cases (69%). The breakdown was as follows: sixteen pregnancies occurred while taking metoprolol (36%), 16 while taking atenolol (36%), and fewer while taking bisoprolol (n = 6, 14%), nadolol (n = 5, 11%), and propranolol (n = 1, 2%). The number of women with pregnancies taking BB therapy was not statistically significantly different between those that resulted in live births versus fetal deaths (34 of 51 [67%] versus 10 of 13 [77%], respectively; P = 0.739).

Ten (20%) newborns experienced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). All babies with IUGR were exposed during pregnancy to BB therapy: 5 to atenolol, 3 to nadolol, and 2 to metoprolol. Only 1 of those babies was born preterm at 34 weeks after an urgent cesarean section due to fetal distress (1900 g, 6th percentile), whereas the remaining 9 were born at term with a mean birth weight of 2719 ± 235 g. Babies born at term to mothers taking BBs had significantly lower birth weights than those whose mothers had not taken BBs during pregnancy (2973 ± 298 g versus 3470 ± 338 g, respectively; P = 0.002). This difference remained statistically significant even after excluding patients treated with atenolol (3040 ± 294 g versus 3470 ± 338 g, P = 0.011). Moreover, babies born at term to mothers on BBs with a QTc > 500 ms had significantly lower birth weights compared with those born to mothers taking BBs with a QTc < 500 ms (2783 ± 283 g versus 3084 ± 256 g, P = 0.029).

### Propranolol for induction of labor in nulliparas trial a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^111mBniS]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). High credibility.

Propranolol hydrochloride is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist that has known activity in the myometrium. Small trials have shown that propranolol decreases the duration of induced labor, although those studies are limited by methodological variability.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to determine whether the addition of a single dose of propranolol to induce labor in nulliparous women would decrease total time to vaginal delivery.

- **Study design**: This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nulliparous patients undergoing term induction of labor with a singleton, nonanomalous gestation. Subjects were randomized to receive 2 mg of intravenous propranolol hydrochloride or an identical-appearing saline placebo, administered 30 minutes after starting the induction of labor. Investigators, labor floor staff, and patients were blinded to the study drug allocation. The primary outcome was time to vaginal delivery. Secondary outcomes included mode of delivery, duration of the phases of labor, time to full dilation, composite maternal morbidity, and composite neonatal morbidity. Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis with a P value of ≤ .05 considered significant.

- **Results**: In this study, 240 patients were enrolled from December 2017 to December 2018, with 121 patients randomized to the propranolol group and 119 to the placebo group. The two groups had similar baseline characteristics. Of the patients randomized, 154 (64.2%) delivered vaginally. There was no significant difference in time from the start of the induction of labor to vaginal delivery between the two groups.

### Oral antihypertensives for nonsevere pregnancy hypertension: Systematic review, network meta- and trial sequential analyses [^116tMPqY]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal, fetal, and newborn mortality and morbidity worldwide. As such, a large proportion of antenatal care is devoted to their detection. It is established that antihypertensive therapy is better than placebo or no antihypertensive therapy (placebo/no therapy) at decreasing the risk of severe maternal hypertension. A strategy of blood pressure (BP) control in pregnancy with antihypertensive therapy reduces severe hypertension without adversely affecting fetal/newborn death or illness, fetal growth restriction, or preterm birth. Importantly, severe hypertension is associated with heightened maternal and fetal/newborn risk, similar to (and independent of) preeclampsia, making severe hypertension an outcome worthy of avoidance and not just one worthy of detection and treatment. Many national and international clinical practice guidelines now advocate BP control in pregnancy.

The choice of antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy remains controversial. In previous direct comparisons, no antihypertensive has been shown to be superior to others, even among the most commonly recommended: labetalol, other β-blockers, nifedipine, and methyldopa. However, there is substantial uncertainty around point estimates of effect, due (at least in part) to the limited number of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing drugs directly. Recent advances in meta-analytical methods now enable the use of indirect evidence through network meta-analysis (NMA), an approach that pools data from multiple different treatments.

### Drug treatment of hypertension in pregnancy: A critical review of adult guideline recommendations [^116T597X]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

This review evaluates the guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension in pregnancy as presented by 25 national and international guidelines developed for the management of arterial hypertension in adults. There is a general consensus that oral α-methyldopa and parenteral labetalol are the drugs of choice for nonsevere and severe hypertension in pregnancy, respectively. Long-acting nifedipine is recommended by various guidelines as an alternative for first-line and second-line therapy in nonsevere and severe hypertension. The safety of β-blockers, atenolol in particular, in early and late stages of pregnancy is unresolved; their use is contraindicated according to several guidelines. Diuretic-associated harmful effects on maternal and fetal outcomes are controversial; their use is discouraged in pregnancy. It is important to develop specific guidelines for treating hypertension in special groups such as adult females of childbearing age and sexually active female adolescents to minimize the risk of adverse effects of drugs on the fetus. In several guidelines, the antihypertensive classes, recommended drugs, intended drug formulation, and route of administration are not explicit. These omissions should be addressed in future guideline revisions to enhance the guidelines' utility and credibility in clinical practice.

### Toprolxl [^11556rtK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Untreated hypertension and heart failure during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the fetus. Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with metoprolol use during pregnancy. However, there are inconsistent reports of intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality with maternal use of beta-blockers, including metoprolol, during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, metoprolol has been shown to increase post-implantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at oral dosages of 500 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 24 times the daily dose of 200 mg in a 60-kg patient on a mg/m² basis.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g. need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). It also increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death.

### Pregnancy outcome in thoracic aortic disease data from the registry of pregnancy and cardiac disease [^111ULUgv]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted to treat pregnant patients with MFS with beta-blockers. The 2018 pregnancy guidelines advise that beta-blocking agents should be considered throughout pregnancy in women with MFS and other HTAD, indicating that it is the preferred therapy in the case of coexistent arterial hypertension. In ROPAC, only 51% of pregnant women with MFS with aortic dilatation were treated with a beta-blocker. Birth weight tended to be lower when the mother had been treated with a beta-blocking agent, although this was not significant. Retrospective data from the UK demonstrate beta-blocker use in 64.2% of pregnant women with MFS with significantly lower birth weight in patients on beta-blocking agents. Again, more prospective data are needed in order to draw definite conclusions.

There was a strikingly high rate of delivery by CS in this cohort (63%). All patients with vEDS had an elective CS as recommended by the guidelines. Most Turner women also had a CS for unclear indications, most presumably related to the small body size of the mother. There are limited data on the effect of labor, specifically the active phase of labor, on the risk of aortic dissection. Although CS is considered an attractive option as it is scheduled and changes to maternal hemodynamics are less compared with labor, vaginal delivery is the preferred mode of delivery in the majority of patients with cardiovascular disease due to lower risk of infection, bleeding, and morbidity postpartum. Data recently published by Minsart et al. suggested that vaginal delivery with rigorous pain control and avoidance of

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^111QZHHo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease and thereby improve the outcome.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (as of 30 April 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg, were included. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, with treatment planned to continue for at least seven days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine trials (4723 women) were included. Twenty-nine trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3350 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) (20 trials, 2558 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.13 to -0.07); number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 10 (8 to 13)), but little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) as of 13 September 2017, along with reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg, were included. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug when treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy.

- **Main results**: For this update, we included 63 trials, with data from 58 trials involving 5909 women, and found a moderate to high risk of bias overall. We carried out GRADE assessments for the main 'antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug' comparison only. Evidence was graded from very low to moderate certainty, with downgrading noted in the main results.
