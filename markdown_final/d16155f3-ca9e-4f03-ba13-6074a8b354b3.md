## Question

Can naltrexone help stimulate the mu-opioid receptor and still help with mood?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether naltrexone can stimulate the mu-opioid receptor and still help with mood. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about naltrexone's core pharmacology at clinically used doses. Then, I should examine the proposed low-dose naltrexone paradox and whether it implies any true receptor stimulation. Next, I will review clinical evidence on mood effects at both standard and low doses. After that, I should consider related data on balanced opioid modulation as a comparator framework. Finally, I will integrate safety considerations and synthesize a clinically sound conclusion with appropriate caveats [^115R7M1d] [^111Mgspr].

> Let me first confirm the basic pharmacology before making any inferences about "stimulation". Naltrexone is a competitive opioid receptor antagonist with highest affinity at the mu-opioid receptor, and the FDA labeling explicitly states it has little or no opioid agonist activity and effectively blocks exogenous opioid effects in a dose-dependent, time-limited manner, with 50 mg oral dosing commonly producing robust blockade for at least 24 hours and higher doses extending that window to 48–72 hours, which argues against direct mu-receptor stimulation at therapeutic antagonist doses [^115R7M1d] [^11387xWQ] [^111h9ukH].

> Wait, let me verify a common source of confusion regarding low-dose naltrexone. Some clinical narratives describe LDN as functioning like a partial agonist, but I should be careful here because that characterization is imprecise and potentially misleading; mechanistically, LDN still acts as a transient antagonist, with the downstream effect hypothesized to be compensatory upregulation of endogenous opioids and their receptors after brief blockade rather than direct stimulation of the mu receptor itself, so I need to correct the notion that naltrexone "stimulates" mu receptors in any direct pharmacologic sense [^112CQtgD] [^111Mgspr] [^115R7M1d].

> I will now examine the low-dose paradox more closely. At doses around 1–5 mg, LDN is thought to produce brief receptor occupancy and then a rebound in opioid tone via increased ligand and receptor expression over the subsequent hours, and it may also modulate neuroinflammation through TLR-4 and microglial pathways; this could indirectly enhance net opioid signaling across a 24-hour period without implying intrinsic mu-agonism by naltrexone itself, which remains an antagonist at the receptor level [^111Mgspr] [^117T55zg] [^117TrCRy].

> Next, I should review the mood-related evidence to see if any clinical signal aligns with this indirect model. A small randomized augmentation trial in major depressive disorder found that 1 mg twice daily LDN improved MADRS scores compared with placebo when added to pro-dopaminergic regimens, though the sample was tiny and the signal remains preliminary; case series in conditions like ME/CFS also describe mood and energy improvements with LDN, but these are uncontrolled and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I must not over-interpret them [^112MP3rS] [^117H91b4] [^113WGXTh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose generalizability, because standard-dose naltrexone tends to show the opposite pattern on affective experience. Experimental human work demonstrates that naltrexone reduces the pleasantness and relief associated with pain relief, consistent with blockade of endogenous opioid hedonic processing, and extended-release naltrexone labeling lists depression and related symptoms among common adverse reactions, which aligns with the expectation that sustained mu-opioid antagonism can blunt positive affect in some individuals [^114sNH5T] [^116YY7TN].

> Let me consider a mechanistic comparator to anchor expectations. Balanced opioid modulation using buprenorphine, a partial mu agonist and kappa antagonist, combined with the mu antagonist samidorphan produced antidepressant effects as adjunctive therapy in randomized trials, which supports the idea that carefully tuned opioid system signaling can improve mood; however, that strategy relies on partial agonism plus antagonism and is mechanistically different from naltrexone monotherapy, so I should not infer that naltrexone alone can directly stimulate mu receptors to help mood [^115p5ckg] [^11114TCj].

> I need to check dose-response and timing assumptions to avoid overstatement. Most LDN reports converge on 1–4.5 mg once daily, often at night, with some heterogeneity up to about 9 mg, while efficacy — when seen — may accrue gradually over weeks to months; by contrast, once doses rise into the conventional antagonist range, the paradoxical indirect enhancement appears to disappear and pure blockade predominates, which is not expected to favor mood enhancement in most settings [^117TrCRy] [^1147b9eR] [^111Mgspr].

> But wait, what about safety and context, especially regarding opioids. I should confirm that naltrexone's blockade is surmountable and that patients can become more sensitive to opioids after discontinuation, creating an overdose risk if prior opioid doses are resumed; additionally, there is a case report suggesting that chronic LDN might heighten sensitivity to exogenous opioids, which reinforces the need for caution with peri-procedural or acute pain management plans in patients using LDN [^11387xWQ] [^116Tkmub] [^112J9S5W].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. No, naltrexone does not and cannot directly stimulate the mu-opioid receptor because it lacks intrinsic agonist activity, but at low doses it may indirectly enhance net opioid signaling over the day via compensatory mechanisms and neuroimmune modulation, which in small and context-specific studies has been associated with mood improvement; by contrast, standard-dose naltrexone generally dampens hedonic processing and may worsen mood in some people, so any mood benefit with LDN remains investigational, modest in evidence quality, and highly context-dependent [^115R7M1d] [^111Mgspr] [^112MP3rS] [^114sNH5T].

> In practical clinical terms, I need to ensure that patients understand the distinction between blockade and stimulation, that LDN for mood is off-label with limited high-quality evidence, and that safety planning around opioid exposure and discontinuation is essential; if mood is the target, a balanced opioid modulation strategy such as buprenorphine-samidorphan has more robust randomized data but is mechanistically distinct, whereas LDN should be viewed as an experimental adjunct with careful monitoring and shared decision-making regarding uncertain benefit and known antagonist pharmacology [^115p5ckg] [^116iiG7k] [^115R7M1d] [^111Mgspr].

No, naltrexone **does not stimulate mu-opioid receptors**; it is a **pure antagonist** that blocks these receptors and can reduce hedonic tone, potentially worsening mood in some patients [^11387xWQ] [^114sNH5T]. At low doses, naltrexone may transiently increase endogenous opioids via brief blockade, but this is not reliable or clinically established for mood improvement [^111Mgspr] [^112J9S5W] [^117T55zg]. For mood enhancement via mu-opioid pathways, **partial agonists like buprenorphine** are more appropriate [^11114TCj] [^115p5ckg].

---

## Pharmacological properties of naltrexone

Naltrexone is a **pure opioid antagonist** with high mu-opioid receptor affinity; it competitively blocks endogenous and exogenous opioids without intrinsic agonist activity [^11387xWQ] [^115R7M1d]. It is indicated for opioid and alcohol dependence, **not for mood enhancement** [^116vLf6i] [^111c9NgM].

---

## Naltrexone's interaction with mu-opioid receptors

Naltrexone binds mu-opioid receptors and **prevents their activation** [^11387xWQ] by endogenous opioids, which can reduce hedonic tone and may worsen mood in some patients [^114sNH5T] [^116ijqH6] [^116qYygz]. It **does not stimulate mu-opioid receptors** or enhance mood through this pathway.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding mood effects of naltrexone

Clinical evidence shows naltrexone **does not improve mood** via mu-opioid receptor stimulation and may reduce hedonic tone, worsening mood in some patients [^114sNH5T] [^114EhpFr]. It is not indicated for mood enhancement and may precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals, further worsening mood [^11387xWQ] [^115R7M1d].

---

## Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) and mood

LDN (1–5 mg/day) is hypothesized to transiently increase endogenous opioids via brief receptor blockade, but evidence for mood improvement is **limited and inconsistent** [^112MP3rS] [^112CQtgD]. LDN is **not a reliable** or clinically established method for mood enhancement [^117T55zg].

---

## Alternative medications for mood enhancement via mu-opioid receptors

Partial agonists like buprenorphine can enhance mood by partially activating mu-opioid receptors, providing antidepressant effects without full-agonist risks [^11114TCj]. Buprenorphine is being studied for treatment-resistant depression and may be **more appropriate** for mood enhancement via mu-opioid pathways [^115p5ckg].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Clinicians should recognize that naltrexone **does not stimulate** mu-opioid receptors or enhance mood [^11387xWQ] and may reduce hedonic tone, worsening mood in some patients [^114sNH5T]. For mood enhancement via mu-opioid pathways, **partial agonists like buprenorphine** may be more appropriate [^11114TCj] [^115p5ckg]. Naltrexone is a **pure antagonist** that blocks mu-opioid receptors and is not indicated for mood enhancement [^115fGgwB].

### Opioid modulation with buprenorphine/samidorphan as adjunctive treatment for inadequate response to antidepressants: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115p5ckg]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder has been associated with dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system. The authors sought to determine whether opioid modulation achieved through administration of ALKS 5461, a combination of a μ- and κ-opioid partial agonist, buprenorphine, and a μ-opioid antagonist, samidorphan, would exhibit antidepressant activity in patients with major depression.

- **Method**: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage sequential parallel comparison design study was conducted in adults with major depression who had an inadequate response to one or two courses of antidepressant treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive treatment with 2 mg/2 mg of buprenorphine/samidorphan (the 2/2 dosage group), 8 mg/8 mg of buprenorphine/samidorphan (the 8/8 dosage group), or placebo. Antidepressant effect was measured based on change from baseline to the end of 4 weeks of treatment on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Clinical Global Impressions severity scale (CGI-S).

- **Results**: Compared with the placebo group, there were significantly greater improvements in the 2/2 dosage group across the three depression outcome measures (HAM-D: -2.8, 95% CI = -5.1, -0.6; MADRS: -4.9, 95% CI = -8.2, -1.6; CGI-S: -0.5, 95% CI = -0.9, -0.1). There was also evidence of improvement in the 8/8 dosage group, although it did not achieve statistical significance. Overall, the buprenorphine/samidorphan combinations were well tolerated, and there was no evidence of significant adverse effects.

### Vivitrol [^115R7M1d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist with the highest affinity for the mu opioid receptor. It has little or no opioid agonist activity.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Naltrexone has few, if any, intrinsic actions besides its opioid-blocking properties. However, it does produce some pupillary constriction by an unknown mechanism. The administration of Vivitrol is not associated with the development of tolerance or dependence. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, Vivitrol will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology.

	- Occupation of opioid receptors by naltrexone may block the effects of endogenous opioid peptides. It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of exogenous opioids. The neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the reduction in alcohol consumption observed in alcohol-dependent patients treated with naltrexone are not entirely understood; however, the involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical data.

	- Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids through competitive binding at opioid receptors. This makes the blockade produced potentially surmountable, but overcoming full naltrexone blockade by administration of opioids may result in non-opioid receptor-mediated symptoms such as histamine release. Vivitrol is not considered aversive therapy and does not cause a disulfiram-like reaction either as a result of opioid use or ethanol ingestion.

- **Results**:

- **Naltrexone decreases relief/pleasantness ratings**: Naltrexone intake resulted in reduced relief (mean ± SD at "170": 54.6 ± 21.6, "195": 55.8 ± 23.7) and pleasantness ratings ("170": 58.7 ± 21.2, "195": 53.8 ± 26.3) compared with placebo (relief "170": 61.8 ± 21.4, "195": 64.9 ± 24.6; pleasantness "170": 63.1 ± 25.0, "195": 63.5 ± 24.8) at both target pain intensities (F[1177.5] = 9.29, P = 0.0027). The target pain intensity had no effect on relief or pleasantness ratings (F[1178.4] = 0.0046, P = 0.95), and relief and pleasantness ratings did not differ from each other (F[1177.2] = 0.034, P = 0.85). Neither interaction effects nor the effect of sex was significant and therefore removed from the model. In the final model, 14 potential influential observations (of 207) were identified. Removal of the respective datapoints did not change the statistical inference of the model.

Figure 2: Naltrexone reduces relief/pleasantness ratings. Naltrexone effect on relief/pleasantness ratings at target pain intensities "170" and "195" displayed as raw values in the naltrexone and placebo session (A) and as difference in relief/pleasantness ratings between the naltrexone and the placebo session (negative value denoting a reduction of the ratings by naltrexone) (B). The raincloud plots display the raw data (colored dots), mean values and 95% confidence intervals (black dots/diamonds and bars) and probability distributions (vertical "clouds").

### Low-dose naltrexone for treatment of dermatologic conditions: A clinical review [^111Mgspr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid receptor antagonist that may be compounded at lower doses (1–5mg) to treat inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) transiently blocks the opioid receptor, resulting in increased ligand and receptor expression, favoring κ over μ receptors and decreasing inflammatory mediators and itch. In addition, LDN antagonizes non-opioid receptors including the pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4).

Altogether, the anti-inflammatory properties of LDN have supported its use in dermatologic conditions, including Hailey-Hailey disease, Darier disease, pruritus, lichen planus, psoriasis, dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and body-focused repetition behaviors. LDN has demonstrated efficacy in treating these dermatologic conditions with improvement in disease severity, body surface area involvement, and associated symptoms. However, clinical response may vary based on initial disease presentation. There is also evidence supporting LDN in combination with other anti-inflammatory agents. Fewer side effects have been reported with LDN compared to standard naltrexone doses, though larger studies are required to optimize dosage and management.

LDN is frequently compounded by a pharmacy, which may pose barriers to access. In this clinical review, we describe updated and practical uses of LDN in inflammatory dermatologic conditions, associated side effects, cost barriers, and comparisons to standard naltrexone doses.

### Antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor in the cancer patient: Fact or fiction [^111qpkCH]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Opioids are a cornerstone in the management of perioperative pain, but their use is also linked to potentially worse oncological outcomes. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is overexpressed in many cancer types versus normal tissue, and its activation appears to facilitate VEGF-induced angiogenesis, increase vascular permeability, and blunt immune response. However, the role of opioids and MOR in tumor progression is still debated due to the flawed design of numerous preclinical studies. It is believed that antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor may play a role in cancer progression since MOR activation is linked to tumor progression, and MOR antagonism has been postulated as a potential target strategy for cancer treatment.

There are two types of mu-opioid receptor antagonists: those with a central effect, such as naltrexone (NTX), and those acting peripherally, known as PAMORAs. The PAMORAs are specifically designed to avoid blood–brain barrier penetration and counteract mu-opioid-related side effects outside the central nervous system. They have been studied in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative ileus (POI). Their main therapeutic indication is opioid-induced constipation (OIC), related to MOR activation in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. These agents are considered safe, effective, and well-tolerated.

Nonetheless, mu-opioid receptor antagonists can influence cancer progression through alternative pathways, such as interaction with the opioid growth factor-opioid receptor axis.

### Duramorph [^114tDKoh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Morphine is a full opioid agonist and selectively targets the mu-opioid receptor, though it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of morphine is analgesia, and like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be constrained by adverse reactions, including respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) depression. The precise mechanism of its analgesic action remains unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to contribute to the analgesic effects of this drug.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Morphine affects the central nervous system by inducing respiratory depression through direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. This respiratory depression involves reduced responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Additionally, morphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. While pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose, they are not pathognomonic, as pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings. Marked mydriasis, rather than miosis, may be observed due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Both early and late respiratory depression (up to 24 hours post dosing) have been reported following neuraxial administration. Circulation of the spinal fluid can lead to elevated concentrations of morphine reaching the CNS.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^117TrCRy]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Throughout the investigated trials, there was significant variation in the timing of follow-up assessments, with study designs ranging from a day to a year, and the average follow-up time roughly 12 weeks. During these follow-ups, patients had variable responses to low-dose naltrexone (LDN), with some showing improvement quickly, while others only after more time had passed. Despite the inconsistent timing of improvements, there appears to be an increase in efficacy over time, with a large subset of patients seeing some benefit.

Dosing varied among the studies, ranging from 0.2 mg to 9 mg daily, but 4.5 mg daily was the most used dosing regimen. It is well published that 4.5 mg daily is a feasible target dose for LDN. This is likely due to LDN's paradoxical effect, where doses up to 4.5 mg daily appear to enhance opioid signaling, whereas at higher doses this effect disappears and opioid antagonism begins. Nevertheless, efficacy was seen with doses as low as 1 mg and as high as 9 mg. It should be noted that under the titration scheme used in many of these published reports, patients were usually started on a lower dose and were titrated accordingly based on their pain and side effects, usually at initial follow-up assessment. Thus, it is unclear whether the improvements seen at subsequent visits are time or dose dependent, which is a limitation of the rigor of previous research. Further studies could be conducted focusing on when the patient first noted changes in symptoms, in addition to trialing various doses without adjustments.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^1164w2xv]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is used as an off-label treatment in low doses for several chronic immune-modulated disorders in many countries. Although only small-scale clinical trials have been performed, these suggest efficacy in several diseases, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War Illness. Despite numerous internet reports of response to low-dose naltrexone (LDN) for chronic fatigue syndrome, no clinical trials exist in this condition. Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, pain, and autonomic and neurocognitive disturbances.

This series of three case reports, compiled by individuals with long-term ill-health due to chronic fatigue syndrome, shows the range of responses observed when taking LDN, from life-changing to only a reduction in some symptoms. Treatment doses ranged from 4 to 12 mg. Clinical trials may be warranted to explore the potential use of naltrexone in people with these debilitating illnesses, which currently have no licensed treatments available.

### Randomized, proof-of-concept trial of low dose naltrexone for patients with breakthrough symptoms of major depressive disorder on antidepressants [^112MP3rS]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Given the proposed dopaminergic mechanism of low-dose naltrexone (LDN), we examined its efficacy as augmentation for depressive breakthrough on pro-dopaminergic antidepressant regimens.

- **Methods**: Twelve adults (67% female, mean age = 45 ± 12) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) on dopaminergic antidepressant regimens (stimulants, dopamine agonists, bupropion [≥ 300 mg/day], aripiprazole [≤ 2.5 mg/day], or sertraline [≥ 150 mg/day]) were randomized to naltrexone 1 mg b.i.d. (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6) augmentation for 3 weeks.

- **Results**: All subjects completed the trial. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) scores (primary outcome measure) decreased from 21.2 ± 2.0 to 11.7 ± 7.7 for LDN, from 23.7 ± 2.3 to 17.8 ± 5.9 for placebo (Cohen's d = 0.62; p = 0.3 between treatment groups). HAM-D-28 scores decreased from 26.2 ± 4.0 to 12.0 ± 9.8 for LDN, from 26.3 ± 2.6 to 19.8 ± 6.6 for placebo (d = 1.15; p = 0.097). Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-10 item) scores decreased from 30.4 ± 4.9 to 12.2 ± 8.4 for LDN, from 30.7 ± 4.3 to 22.8 ± 8.5 for placebo (d = 1.45; p = 0.035). MADRS-15 item scores decreased from 36.6 ± 6.2 to 13.2 ± 8.8 for LDN, from 36.7 ± 4.2 to 26.0 ± 10.0 for placebo (d = 1.49; p = 0.035). Clinical Global Improvement Scale-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased from 4.3 ± 0.5 to 3.0 ± 1.1 for LDN, from 4.3 ± 0.5 to 4.0 ± 0.6 for placebo (d = 1.22; p = 0.064).

- **Limitations**: Small study; restrictions on allowed antidepressants.

- **Conclusion**: LDN augmentation showed some benefit for MDD relapse on dopaminergic agents. Confirmation in larger studies is needed.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^1147b9eR]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) is a novel therapeutic treatment option for patients with centralized chronic pain. Numerous small case reports and a few higher-quality trials support the use of LDN in chronic pain. Despite this, LDN is still used off-label for many chronic pain conditions. It is imperative that higher-quality, well-designed, and controlled studies be conducted to expand and potentiate the application of LDN and its utility profile, as well as help with the standardization of treatment regimens. Even though such studies are much needed, LDN still offers promising results in the clinical management of refractory symptoms in patients with these chronic centralized pain conditions.

### A combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone blocks compulsive cocaine intake in rodents without producing dependence [^114rkTuu]. Science Translational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine, a synthetic opioid that acts at both μ and κ opioid receptors, can decrease cocaine use in individuals with opioid addiction. However, the potent agonist action of buprenorphine at μ opioid receptors raises its potential for creating opioid dependence in non-opioid-dependent cocaine abusers. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone (a potent μ opioid antagonist with weaker δ and κ antagonist properties) could block compulsive cocaine self-administration without producing opioid dependence.

The effects of buprenorphine and various doses of naltrexone on cocaine self-administration were assessed in rats that self-administered cocaine under conditions of either short access (noncompulsive cocaine seeking) or extended access (compulsive cocaine seeking). Buprenorphine alone reproducibly decreased cocaine self-administration. Although this buprenorphine-alone effect was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by naltrexone in both the short-access and the extended-access groups, the combination of the lowest dose of naltrexone with buprenorphine blocked cocaine self-administration in the extended-access group but not in the short-access group.

Rats given this low dose of naltrexone with buprenorphine did not exhibit the physical opioid withdrawal syndrome seen in rats treated with buprenorphine alone, and naltrexone at this dose did not block κ agonist-induced analgesia. The results suggest that the combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone at an appropriate dosage decreases compulsive cocaine self-administration with minimal.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1159cNtU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific duration for naltrexone treatment. The duration should be determined based on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. It should be recognized that naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms, as there is no physical dependence associated with its use.

### Oxycontin [^111HtXcQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.

	- The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in CO2 tension and electrical stimulation.

		Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g. pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see overdosage (10)].

	- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food…

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116Tkmub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Vulnerability to opioid overdose**: After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification.

This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc) if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment.

Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).

There is also the possibility that a patient who is treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect of naltrexone hydrochloride. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is a potent antagonist, the blockade produced by naltrexone hydrochloride is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt, on

### Antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor in the cancer patient: Fact or fiction [^116HFmWb]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The mechanism of the potential antitumor effect of MOR antagonists has been investigated primarily using naltrexone (NTX) and methylnaltrexone (MNTX), although we found a single article discussing the effect of nalmefene on cellular glycolysis. There is a dual ambivalent effect of MOR antagonists, mainly studied with NTX on cancer cells and immunity depending on dosage. The effects of low-dose NTX and MNTX are summarized below.

- **Biochemical mechanisms**: Antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor exhibit antineoplastic action through different pathways. Low-dose naltrexone and methylnaltrexone have unique biochemical mechanisms involving the opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor (OGFr), the κ opioid receptor (KOR), the δ opioid receptor (DOR), and the µ opioid receptor (MOR). Additional components include bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), all contributing to an inhibitory effect on cancer cells.

NTX exhibits a dose-dependent dual immunoregulator effect on cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. It has been reported that intermittent blockade by low-dose NTX can result in feedback production of more opioid peptides and receptors, thus inhibiting cell proliferation via compensatory up-regulation of OGF and OGFr. However, continued blockade can suppress the activity of OGFr. NTX dosages vary depending on indications. While NTX is used for drug withdrawal and prevention of relapse at the dosage of 50 mg/day, it can be used to regulate chronic pain and treat immune diseases at a lower dosage.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111P9ZLD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is limited clinical experience with naltrexone hydrochloride overdosage in humans. In one study, subjects who received 800 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride daily for up to one week showed no evidence of toxicity.

In mice, rats, and guinea pigs, the oral LD50 values were 1,100 to 1,550 mg/kg, 1,450 mg/kg, and 1,490 mg/kg, respectively. High doses of naltrexone hydrochloride (generally ≥ 1,000 mg/kg) produced salivation, depression or reduced activity, tremors, and convulsions. Mortalities in animals due to high-dose naltrexone hydrochloride administration usually resulted from clonic-tonic convulsions and/or respiratory failure.

In view of the lack of actual experience in treating naltrexone hydrochloride overdose, patients should be treated symptomatically in a closely supervised environment. Physicians should contact a poison control center for the most up-to-date information.

### Redefining ketamine pharmacology for antidepressant action: Synergistic NMDA and opioid receptor interactions [^114H6nox]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Ketamine is a racemic compound and medication comprised of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine enantiomers, along with its metabolites. It has long been used as a dissociative anesthetic, analgesic, and recreational drug. More recently, ketamine, its enantiomers, and its metabolites have been used or are being investigated for the treatment of refractory depression, as well as for comorbid disorders such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and opioid use disorder. Despite its complex pharmacology, ketamine is primarily referred to as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist.

In this review, the authors argue that ketamine's pharmacology should be redefined to include opioid receptors and the endogenous opioid system. They also highlight a potential mechanism of action of ketamine for depression attributed to bifunctional, synergistic interactions involving NMDA and opioid receptors.

### Understanding how opioids contribute to reward and analgesia [^116wVdEF]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Opioids acting at the mu opioid (MOP) receptor produce powerful analgesia and an intensely rewarding effect that can lead to addiction. The analgesic effect of MOP receptor agonists derives from a direct inhibitory effect on pain transmission at the spinal-cord level and through activation of a descending pain-modulatory pathway. The rewarding effect of MOP agonists results from their actions in the mesostriatal dopamine pathway, which is classically associated with both natural and drug rewards.

Both the analgesic and rewarding effects of MOP agonists are best understood in the context of decision-making under conditions of conflict. Pain is one of many competing motivational states, and endogenous opioids suppress responses to noxious stimuli in the presence of conflicting motivations, such as hunger or a threatening predator. When a food reward is available, MOP agonists microinjected into the mesostriatal circuit promote its consumption while concomitantly suppressing responses to noxious stimulation. Thus, the mesostriatal "reward" circuit appears to perform a function critical to decision-making and can either amplify or suppress responses to noxious stimuli.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^113WGXTh]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

She tried various alternative treatments with little improvement. In 2006, she experienced slight improvement while taking antibiotic combinations, including phenoxymethylpenicillin and azithromycin, but relapsed rapidly after stopping them. In 2009, she was started on oral vitamin D supplementation, which did not improve her symptoms of fatigue. Due to her history of polymorphic light eruption since her mid-teens, she remains on colecalciferol 20,000 IU every two weeks, maintaining normal vitamin D levels.

In 2010, she was prescribed low-dose naltrexone (LDN) initially at 1.5 mg, with a slow increase over two years. She noticed slightly increased energy and reduced food intolerances at 4.5 mg/day but had to reduce the dose to 3 mg due to increased headaches. Ten months later, she started increasing the dose again without recurrence of symptoms. Subsequent stepped dose increases coincided with further improvements in energy, mood, and pain. At 9 mg, frequent episodes of abdominal pain subsided, allowing her to resume a full diet, including wheat and dairy. Her prescribing doctor suggested experimenting to find the optimum LDN dose. She increased to 7.5 mg twice per day but eventually settled on 6 mg twice per day, which she has maintained for the past seven years.

### Meta-analysis and review of dopamine agonists in acute episodes of mood disorder: Efficacy and safety [^112M52jF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy and safety of partial and complete dopamine agonists in the treatment of acute mood disorder episodes. Randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials of dopamine agonists in the treatment of acute mood disorder episodes were identified in the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases and included in the meta-analysis.

- **Monotherapy of mania**: Improved remission rates were found for cariprazine (odds ratio (OR): 2.08, P < 0.01) and for high-dose aripiprazole (OR: 3.00, P = 0.05), but not for low-dose aripiprazole.

- **Bipolar depression**: No improvement of remission and response rates was found for aripiprazole in monotherapy. However, an improved response rate (OR: 10.27, P < 0.01) was found for pramipexole only as an add-on to another mood stabilizer.

- **Major depressive disorder**: Relatively similar improvements of remission rates were found for high-dose (OR: 1.96, P < 0.01) and low-dose aripiprazole (OR: 1.68, P = 0.01), as well as brexpiprazole (OR: 1.52, P = 0.05) as an add-on to antidepressant medication.

Our meta-analysis shows that partial dopamine agonists at high doses are effective in treating acute mania. In major depressive disorder, which is resistant to classical antidepressants, low doses of partial dopamine agonists as adjunct therapy may represent a relatively safe and effective alternative.

### Structural and dynamic insights into the activation of the μ-opioid receptor by an allosteric modulator [^1136HJFH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Interestingly, allosteric modulators, compounds that bind to receptor sites different from the orthosteric ligand-binding site, have been shown to enhance GPCR activation beyond what is achievable by orthosteric agonists alone. Although there are examples that have studied the mechanism of allosteric modulation of GPCRs using in silico approaches, the structural basis underlying the activity enhancement by the allosteric modulators remains incompletely understood. This gap in knowledge could potentially hinder the rational design of allosteric modulators.

One reason for this limited understanding is the minimal structural differences observed when comparing GPCR three-dimensional structures in the presence and absence of allosteric modulators, although they provide valuable information on the interaction sites of the allosteric modulators on GPCRs. The lack of discernible differences that can be readily connected to the function of GPCR might be because these structural characterizations were conducted in crystals or ice, conditions that suppress functional dynamics essential for GPCR functions, and/or because the binding of intracellular binders forces the structures of GPCRs into the intracellular effectors-bound forms, obscuring the possible differences that may exist in the absence of these intracellular binders, which directly dictate the differences in activities.

### Antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor in the cancer patient: Fact or fiction [^115R1FAf]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The role of antagonists of the mu-opioid receptor in cancer progression remains to be elucidated. The objective of this review was to summarize the available evidence on the effects of mu-opioid receptor antagonists on tumor progression and prognosis in different types of cancers. It also includes an evaluation of the available findings on their mechanism of action.

Recent findings have highlighted studies related to the use of methylnaltrexone (MNTX) and naltrexone (NTX) in cancer outcomes. There is consistent preclinical evidence of their potential action on cancer growth and spread, primarily mediated by their effect on the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis, resulting in depressed cell replication. However, clinical results are scarce and limited to poor-quality evidence. Further high-quality studies are warranted to investigate the role of mu-opioid receptor antagonists as a therapeutic option in different types of cancer, especially in patients where classical treatment causes unacceptable side effects.

### Mitigo [^115zrnPA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **12 Clinical pharmacology**:

- **Mechanism of action**: Morphine is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of morphine is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.

The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Morphine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Morphine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g. pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

### Naltrexone: Not just for opioids anymore [^114PSZGQ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a semi-synthetic opioid with competitive antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence, but adherence to daily dosing has been recognized as a factor limiting long-term effectiveness. Recently, a long-acting injectable formulation of naltrexone has received FDA approval for treating alcohol and opioid dependence. This article reviews the pharmacology of naltrexone, the evidence supporting the use of extended-release naltrexone, and the clinical challenges in the induction of patients to this medication.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the patient's psychosocial needs and offering or referring them to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs, in conjunction with extended-release naltrexone. Treatment with naltrexone should not be precluded or delayed if the patient decides to decline psychosocial treatment or if psychosocial treatment is unavailable, provided that appropriate medication management is in place. Consider using motivational interviewing or enhancement techniques to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services that address their individual needs.

### The mu-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil induces acute dysphoria irrespective of its analgesic properties [^116Akuaj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Mu-opioidergic agonists are believed to induce euphoria, whereas kappa-agonists are thought to lead to dysphoria. Our study investigated mood effects of remifentanil, a mu-receptor opioid agonist, in healthy male volunteers. Moreover, we examined interactions between mood and pain.

- **Experimental conditions**: Three conditions were investigated in 21 volunteers: saline, 0.05, and 0.15 microg kg(-1) min(-1) remifentanil. Each condition was investigated during non-painful heat and during painful heat stimulation.
- **Measurement tools**: Mood was measured with the von Zerssen's mood scale (Bf-S score), and pain intensity was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). High Bf-S scores reflect discontent and dysphoria.
- **Results**: Changes were tested for significance using a linear mixed model approach. Remifentanil significantly increased Bf-S scores during painful heat (+91.4%), indicating a negative mood effect, although it reduced VAS scores of painful heat intensity (-49.0%). The type of sensory stimulation (non-painful versus painful) had no effect on mood. There was no interaction between remifentanil dose and type of stimulation. Our results provide evidence for negative mood effects of remifentanil, which occur with and without pain. Given that remifentanil reduces pain, one might expect analgesia-related amelioration of mood instead.
- **Clinical implications**: In clinical practice, these remifentanil effects should be considered, and a comedication might be advisable.

### No change in the consumption of thyroid hormones after starting low dose naltrexone (LDN): A quasi-experimental before-after study [^1141K3U3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The opioid antagonist naltrexone in low doses (typically < 5 mg/day) is being used off-label against several autoimmune diseases. In a recent review, the authors claim that low dose naltrexone (LDN) has beneficial immunomodulatory effects by acting on the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) or as a direct immunomodulating agent, by elevating endogenous opioids, or by affecting cytokine production.

A few small randomized clinical trials show promising results in inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain conditions. Although no studies in thyroid disease have been published, LDN has been proposed as an alternative add-on to regular hypothyroid therapy. Some patients report astounding improvements, and there are patients and doctors who claim that LDN may be beneficial in autoimmune thyroid disease, but definitive evidence is lacking.

Decades of high dose naltrexone in the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction indicate that LDN has an excellent safety profile, and with increasing awareness among patients, it is highly likely that endocrinologists increasingly will have requests to prescribe LDN.

In 2013, the number of users of LDN in Norway increased from almost zero to 0.3% of the population within a few months following a TV documentary. This surge in LDN use could be considered a natural experiment that makes quasi-experimental pharmacoepidemiological studies possible. We seized the opportunity to examine whether there were changes in the dispensing of thyroid hormones in selected patients following the initiation of LDN therapy.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^114eeUuq]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Outcome and follow-up: case 1

Now aged 63, 30 years after the initial meningitis, she currently has a normal quality of life with no signs of ill health, although energy levels can reduce slightly during infections, prolonged overexertion, or excessive mental effort. Such reductions can be delayed up to 48 hours after the initial overstimulation, suggesting continuing mild post-exertional malaise. Symptoms such as poor sleep and excessive pain are absent.

Up until starting low-dose naltrexone (LDN), she was receiving the UK Government's Disability Living Allowance at the higher rate for mobility (requiring the person to have severe walking difficulties) and the middle rate for care (requiring frequent help during the day). These payments were reduced and then finally stopped three years after starting LDN when it became clear she was stable and well. She could walk and, more recently, cycle without problems. Prior to starting LDN, her intellectual and cognitive functioning was very limited. These abilities have returned, apart from continuing cognitive impairments due to the meningitis.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^111YDpkj]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Given the widespread use of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) in many countries and numerous internet reports, it is somewhat surprising that this is the first medical series of case reports on its effect in people with chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis. The mechanism of action for naltrexone at low doses in this disease group is unknown. It is possibly due to the rebound of endorphins following short-term suppression or to a direct action suppressing inflammation induced by microglia. There have been no formal dosing studies of naltrexone at low doses in any disorder. Therefore, although the dose of 3–4.5 mg is established in clinical practice, some practitioners use 9 mg (Klimas, personal communication, 2017) or higher in chronic fatigue syndrome. Causality and dosing need further study.

All case reports are limited by their lack of control for confounding factors and potential placebo responses. Such factors can only be adequately controlled within a randomized double-blind clinical trial. In the recent placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter trial of rituximab in chronic fatigue syndrome, the placebo response rate was 35%. Alternative explanations for improvements in these cases could include fluctuations in the underlying disease, which can appear as temporary improvements, and occasionally, the disease improves spontaneously. However, all three subjects had tried alternative treatments without the long-term effects that LDN has produced, which in cases 2 and 3 were specific to particular symptoms.

### μ-opioid receptor system mediates reward processing in humans [^116ijqH6]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The human reward system promotes motivated behavior toward signals providing safety and opportunities for homeostasis. The endogenous opioid system is intimately involved in both hedonic functions and incentive motivation, generating pleasurable sensations when consuming palatable foods. Injection of µ-opioids into the mesolimbic reward system is rewarding in its own right, and µ-opioid receptor (MOR) stimulation in the shell of the nucleus accumbens increases pleasure obtained from foods and may also promote feeding. Similarly, opioid agonists increase and opioid antagonists decrease food intake and hedonic responses to palatable foods, respectively, whereas inverse MOR agonists diminish the hedonic impact of feeding.

These data are paralleled by human imaging work showing that feeding triggers endogenous opioid release in the brain's reward circuit, possibly contributing to the pathophysiology of obesity. Repeated overstimulation of the MOR system following food consumption may lead to lasting downregulation of MOR, thus providing a candidate neurobiological mechanism that reinforces overeating in obese individuals. Indeed, positron emission tomography (PET) studies have established that MOR levels are downregulated in patients with morbid obesity and binge-eating disorder.

### Opiate antagonists do not interfere with the clinical benefits of stimulants in ADHD: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the mixed opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone [^114EhpFr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). High credibility.

- **Objective**: Methylphenidate activates μ-opioid receptors, which are linked to euphoria. μ-Opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone, may attenuate the euphoric effects of stimulants, thereby minimizing their abuse potential. This study assessed whether the combination of naltrexone with methylphenidate is well-tolerated while preserving the clinical benefits of stimulants in subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- **Methods**: We conducted a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of naltrexone in adults with DSM-IV ADHD receiving open treatment with a long-acting formulation of methylphenidate from January 2013 to July 2015. Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System (SODAS) methylphenidate was administered twice daily. It was titrated to approximately 1 mg/kg/day over 3 weeks and was continued for 3 additional weeks depending on response and adverse effects. Subjects were adults with ADHD preselected for having experienced euphoria with a test dose of immediate-release methylphenidate. The primary outcome measure was the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS).

- **Results**: Thirty-seven subjects who experienced stimulant-induced (mild) euphoria at a baseline visit were started in the open trial of SODAS methylphenidate and randomly assigned to naltrexone 50 mg or placebo. Thirty-one subjects completed the study through week 3, and 25 completed through week 6. Throughout 6 weeks of blinded naltrexone and open methylphenidate treatment, the coadministration of naltrexone with methylphenidate did not interfere with the clinical benefits.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^113nK2SU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film contains buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. Naloxone is a potent antagonist at mu-opioid receptors and produces opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists when administered parenterally.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Subjective effects**: Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect. In opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent, acute sublingual doses of buprenorphine/naloxone tablets produced opioid agonist effects which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg/2 mg and 16 mg/4 mg of buprenorphine/naloxone.

	- Opioid agonist ceiling effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo, and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent. Both active drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response. However, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect.

### Potential drug interaction with opioid agonist in the setting of chronic low-dose opioid antagonist use [^112J9S5W]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Low dose naltrexone (LDN) has been evaluated in several small studies for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. It is thought to work through modulation of inflammatory mediators and upregulation of endogenous opioid receptors, which may hypersensitize patients to exogenous opioids. Drug-drug interaction screening tools built into electronic health records and other services identify the interaction as a risk of opioid withdrawal rather than hypersensitivity.

We present a case of a drug-drug interaction in a patient who was receiving LDN for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The patient received a single dose of oxycodone 5 mg, resulting in obtundation unresponsive to painful stimuli. This necessitated the administration of naloxone boluses and infusion, as well as admission to the intensive care unit for one night. The patient responded well to naloxone therapy and was discharged in satisfactory condition.

### Opioid dependence: Rationale for and efficacy of existing and new treatments [^115Ei4hL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Opioid dependence is a chronic and relapsing medical disorder with a well-established neurobiological basis. Opioid agonist treatments, such as methadone and the recently approved buprenorphine, stabilize opioid receptors and the intracellular processes that lead to opioid withdrawal and craving. Both methadone and buprenorphine have been proven effective for the treatment of opioid dependence and can contribute to a decreased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In addition, a buprenorphine/naloxone combination appears to have a decreased potential for abuse or diversion, compared with that associated with methadone. Largely because of these properties, recent legislation now affords an unprecedented opportunity for general physicians to offer opioid agonist treatment through their offices. This review focuses on the neurobiological basis of opioid dependence, the rationale for methadone and buprenorphine treatments, and issues in prescribing these medications to patients with HIV infection.

### Butrans [^113Q9Er1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptors, an agonist at delta-opioid receptors, and a partial agonist at ORL-1 (nociceptin) receptors. The contributions of these actions to its analgesic profile are unclear.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Buprenorphine produces respiratory depression through direct action on brainstem respiratory centers. This involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brainstem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Buprenorphine also causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but not pathognomonic, as pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with worsening hypoxia in overdose situations.

	- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Buprenorphine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed, and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

- **Effects on the cardiovascular system**: Buprenorphine produces effects on the cardiovascular system.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^114dKyWa]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is used as an off-label treatment in low doses for several chronic immune-modulated disorders in many countries. Although only small-scale clinical trials have been performed, these suggest efficacy in several diseases, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War Illness. Despite numerous internet reports of response to low-dose naltrexone (LDN), no clinical trials exist in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. This condition is characterized by chronic profound fatigue, post-exertional malaise, pain, and autonomic and neurocognitive disturbances.

This series of three case reports, compiled by people with long-term ill health due to chronic fatigue syndrome, shows the range of responses they observed when taking LDN, from life-changing effects to a reduction in some symptoms only. Treatment doses ranged from 4 to 12 mg. Clinical trials may be warranted to explore the potential use of naltrexone in people with these debilitating illnesses, which currently have no licensed treatments available.

### Dsuvia [^112RXLMU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Sufentanil is an opioid agonist that is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of sufentanil is analgesia and sedation, thought to be mediated through opioid-specific receptors throughout the CNS. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Sufentanil produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation. Sufentanil causes miosis, even in total darkness.

### Effects of low-dose naltrexone on quality of life in high-grade glioma patients: a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial [^112CQtgD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

At diagnosis and throughout the disease course, patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) experience a diminished quality of life (QOL) and increased fatigue. Naltrexone, an orally semisynthetic opiate antagonist, is FDA-approved for the treatment of heroin and alcohol addiction. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been observed to improve QOL and lower fatigue in other neurological illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis. LDN is believed to function as a partial agonist and can lead to shifts in neurochemicals that reduce fatigue. Based on this, we sought to study whether LDN has an impact on QOL and fatigue in patients with HGG.

In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we randomized 110 HGG patients to receive placebo (N = 56) or LDN 4.5 mg orally at night (N = 54). Subjects received LDN or placebo at day 1 of concurrent radiation and temozolomide therapy and continued for 16 weeks. The change from baseline in patient-reported outcomes of QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain) and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue) was assessed.

Demographics included WHO grade IV (85%), male (56%), KPS 90–100 (51%), grossly resected (55%), and a mean age of 56 years. QOL and fatigue changes between baseline and post concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy were not significantly different between patients receiving LDN or placebo. The adverse event profiles for LDN and placebo were similar and attributed to concomitant use of temozolomide.

LDN has no effect on QOL and fatigue in HGG patients during concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

### Depression - a major but neglected consequence contributing to the health toll from prescription opioids [^112radKP]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Prescription opioid analgesic (POA) use is common, especially in North America, and is associated with extensive morbidity and mortality. While both medical and non-medical POA use have been documented to be linked with mental health problems, specifically depression, newly emerging epidemiological evidence suggests that the onset of depression post-initiation of POA use may be common. Neurobiological factors, specifically regarding the impact of POAs on brain functioning, and/or psycho-social processes may be relevant pathways. These pathways must be better understood to guide clinical interventions. Incident depression outcomes may add to the extensive health toll from widespread POA use.

### The mixed opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone mitigates stimulant-induced euphoria: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone [^116qYygz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Supratherapeutic doses of methylphenidate activate μ-opioid receptors, which are linked to euphoria. This study assessed whether naltrexone, a mixed μ-opioid antagonist, may attenuate the euphoric effects of stimulants, thereby minimizing their abuse potential in subjects with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- **Methods**: We conducted a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of naltrexone in adults with DSM-IV ADHD receiving open treatment with a long-acting formulation of methylphenidate (January 2013 to June 2015). Spheroidal oral drug absorption system methylphenidate (SODAS-MPH) was administered twice daily, titrated to approximately 1 mg/kg/d over 3 weeks, and continued for an additional 3 weeks depending on response and adverse effects. Subjects were adults with ADHD preselected for having experienced euphoria with an oral test dose of 60 mg of immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH). The primary outcome measure was Question 2 (Liking a drug effect) on the Drug Rating Questionnaire, Subject version, assessed after oral test doses of 60 mg of IR-MPH were administered after the third and sixth weeks of treatment with SODAS-MPH.

- **Results**: Thirty-seven subjects who experienced stimulant-induced (mild) euphoria at a baseline visit were started in the open trial of SODAS-MPH and randomized to naltrexone 50 mg/d or placebo. Thirty-one subjects completed through week 3, and 25 completed through week 6. Naltrexone significantly diminished the euphoric effect of IR-MPH during the heightened-risk titration phase.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^116Gspui]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

In rodent models of depression (chronic social defeat stress and inflammation induced), it was shown that naltrexone pre-treatment did not block the antidepressant effects of (R, S)-ketamine. However, in a subsequent preclinical study, it was demonstrated that opioid antagonists abolish the ability of (R, S)-ketamine to reduce depression-like behavior and lateral habenula cellular hyperactivity.

The authors suggested the opioid system is "necessary but not sufficient" for the antidepressant actions of (R, S)-ketamine in rodents, as activation by morphine, a mu-opioid agonist, at a dose high enough to induce a hedonic response, did not mimic the rapid antidepressant-like effects of ketamine or reduce lateral habenula neuronal activity. The authors argued that in their studies of lateral habenula cellular activity, (R, S)-ketamine did not appear to act as a mu-opioid agonist, but some mu-opioid receptor activity was necessary for NMDA receptor antagonism.

In brain regions, including the habenula, NMDA receptors and opioid receptors display colocalization, and NMDA receptor activation can be modulated by actions of opioid receptors. Taken together, this suggests a potential interaction that may be explained by direct "crosstalk" between the glutamatergic and opioid receptor systems or by convergence at downstream signaling pathways.

There are several potential convergences between opioid signaling and other mechanisms implicated in the antidepressant action of ketamine. For example, the administration of endogenous opioids has been shown to upregulate BDNF expression in the…

### Low dose naltrexone in dermatology [^112Li2kh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) has been successfully studied as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory therapy in a wide range of conditions, including Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, cancer, chronic regional pain syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth, and multiple sclerosis. Recently, off-label LDN has been shown to improve dermatologic conditions such as systemic sclerosis, Hailey-Hailey disease, lichen planopilaris, and guttate psoriasis. In this article, we examine the existing evidence for the use of LDN in skin disease and discuss its potential application in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).

### Molecular biology of opioid analgesia [^111KoUrd]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Opioids provide excellent pain relief in most patients, yet the responses of patients to individual opioids can vary markedly, even among the mu opioids. Understanding this variability would greatly enhance our ability to treat patients appropriately. Classical pharmacological studies have long implied the existence of multiple subtypes of mu opioid receptors. More recently, a number of variants of the cloned mu opioid receptor have been described. These variants all show the same selectivity for mu opioids, confirming their classification as mu opioid receptors. Yet, they differ in their functional activation by opioids as well as in their localization within cells and regions in the brain. These multiple mu opioid receptors may help explain the range of responses seen clinically among patients for the various opioid drugs.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116iiG7k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is recommended that the prescribing physician relates the following information to patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride:

You have been prescribed naltrexone hydrochloride as part of the comprehensive treatment for your alcoholism or drug dependence. You should carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are taking naltrexone hydrochloride. A naltrexone hydrochloride medication card may be obtained from your physician and can be used for this purpose. Carrying the identification card should help to ensure that you can obtain adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, be sure to inform the treating physician that you are receiving naltrexone hydrochloride therapy. You should take naltrexone hydrochloride as directed by your physician.

Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to lower doses of opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued or temporarily interrupted. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to them of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose.

Advise patients that because naltrexone hydrochloride can block the effects of opioids, they will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opioid drug in small doses while on naltrexone hydrochloride. Further emphasize that administration of large doses of heroin or any other opioid to try to bypass the blockade is dangerous and can lead to serious consequences.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111h9ukH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment should be initiated with an initial dose of 25 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride. If no withdrawal signs occur, the patient may be started on 50 mg a day thereafter. A dose of 50 mg once a day will produce adequate clinical blockade of the actions of parenterally administered opioids. As with many non-agonist treatments for addiction, naltrexone hydrochloride is of proven value only when given as part of a comprehensive plan of management that includes some measure to ensure the patient takes the medication.

- **Naloxone challenge test**: Clinicians are reminded that there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful if there is any question of occult opioid dependence. If signs of opioid withdrawal are still observed following the naloxone challenge, treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride should not be attempted. The naloxone challenge can be repeated in 24 hours.

	- The naloxone challenge test should not be performed in a patient showing clinical signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, or in a patient whose urine contains opioids. The naloxone challenge test may be administered by either the intravenous or subcutaneous routes.

	- **Intravenous**:
		- Inject 0.2 mg naloxone.
		- Observe for 30 seconds for signs or symptoms of withdrawal.
		- If no evidence of withdrawal, inject 0.6 mg of naloxone.
		- Observe for an additional 20 minutes.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: A scoping review [^117T55zg]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

At low doses, naltrexone (LDN) has been shown to modulate inflammation through the interruption of microglial cell activation within the central nervous system. One of the most likely contributors to centralized pain is changes in microglial cell processing. Therefore, it has been postulated that LDN can be used to manage patients with pain resulting from central sensitization due to this relationship. This scoping review aims to synthesize the relevant study data for LDN as a novel treatment strategy for various centralized pain conditions.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, guided by the Scale for Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) criteria.

Forty-seven studies related to centralized pain conditions were identified. Many of the studies were case reports/series and narrative reviews, but a few randomized control trials have been conducted. Overall, the body of evidence revealed improvement in patient-reported pain severity and in outcomes related to hyperalgesia, physical function, quality of life, and sleep. Variability in dosing paradigms and the time to patient response was present in the reviewed studies.

Evidence synthesized for this scoping review supports the ongoing use of LDN for the treatment of refractory pain in various centralized chronic pain conditions. Upon review of the currently available published studies, it is apparent that further high-quality, well-powered randomized control trials need to be conducted to establish efficacy.

### Dose escalation of naltrexone to reduce stress responses associated with opioid antagonist induction: A double-blind randomized trial [^114LsKVT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). High credibility.

To describe the role of opioid antagonist induction in reducing stress response and withdrawal symptoms, the complexity of naltrexone induction is limiting broader applicability of opioid antagonist-assisted abstinence. The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the stress response of two low-dose naltrexone induction protocols under minimal oral sedation. The study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial set in an open setting in-patient unit. Participants included adults with opioid use disorder and at least a year-long history of opioid use.

- **Intervention protocol**: Patients received either a single 12.5mg naltrexone oral dose (SI group) or an escalating dosage regimen starting from 50μg up to a cumulative dose of 12.5mg (ED group).

- **Main outcome measure**: Differences in cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations 1 hour after the start of naltrexone induction were observed.

In the study, 124 patients were enrolled, and 68 remained in the trial at the point of randomization: 33 in the SI group and 35 in the ED group. Eight patients were excluded from the final analysis. Results showed that plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations were significantly higher in the SI group with a mean difference between groups of 313nmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 182–444, P < 0.001) and 36.9pg/mL (95% CI 12.3–61.4, P = 0.004), respectively.

- **Secondary outcomes**: SI patients experienced significant increases in plasma cortisol, ACTH concentrations, and withdrawal scores. In the ED group, these measures remained at or below baseline throughout the 24-hour period from the start of naltrexone induction.

In conclusion, the study demonstrates the implications of dose escalation in naltrexone induction on stress response and withdrawal symptoms, offering insights into optimizing treatment protocols for opioid antagonist-assisted abstinence.

### Endogenous opioids contribute to the feeling of pain relief in humans [^1132zt86]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Endogenous opioids mediate the pleasurable responses to positively reinforcing stimuli such as palatable food. Yet, the reduction or omission of a negative experience can also be rewarding (negative reinforcement). As such, pain relief leads to negative reinforcement and evokes a pleasant feeling in humans. Although it has been shown that the feeling of pleasure associated with positive reinforcement is at least partly mediated through endogenous opioids, it is currently unknown whether similar neurochemical mechanisms are involved in the pleasant feeling evoked by pain relief.

In this study, 27 healthy participants completed two identical experimental sessions, one with placebo and one with naltrexone, an endogenous opioid antagonist. Pain relief was induced by superficial cooling after heat stimulation of capsaicin-sensitized skin. Participants rated the relief and pleasantness in response to the cooling. Endogenous opioid blockade by naltrexone decreased relief and pleasantness ratings compared with placebo (P = 0.0027). This study provides evidence that endogenous opioids play a role in mediating the pleasant feeling of pain relief in humans. Clinically, the rewarding nature of pain relief and its underlying mechanisms require consideration because of their potential reinforcing effects on behaviors that might be beneficial short-term but maladaptive long-term.

### Low-dose naltrexone as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome [^117H91b4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

He noticed an improved sleep pattern and now experiences fewer colds, which are no longer associated with an energy dip or subsequent depression. Retrospective scoring of depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale suggests his average mood improved from 13 (11–21 signifies depression) to 7 (0–7 signifies no abnormality), with his anxiety scores being normal throughout.

His functional level improved from being mild to moderately limited on a daily basis (60%–70% on a functional activity scale) to mild limitations (80%–90% on a functional activity scale). The improvements are sufficiently marked that he intends to continue low-dose naltrexone long term. For the past 4 years, he has followed a gluten and wheat-free diet and has been vegan for the past 18 months, partly due to cheese causing increased nasal symptoms. He has not tried altering his diet after starting naltrexone.

### Opposite effects of opioid blockade on the blood pressure-pain relationship in depressed and non-depressed participants [^112UbAs1]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

The effect of the opioid antagonist naltrexone on the relationship between blood pressure and pain was examined in 24 participants with major depressive disorder and 31 non-depressed controls, before and after 25 minutes of stressful mental arithmetic. Pain was induced by immersing the non-dominant foot in 2 degrees C ice-water for as long as possible or until 4 minutes had elapsed (the cold pressor test). Blood pressure was measured before each cold pressor test and at 2-minute intervals during mental arithmetic.

In the group as a whole, neither depression nor naltrexone influenced blood pressure at any stage of the experiment. However, naltrexone disrupted an association between elevated resting blood pressure and low levels of pain in non-depressed controls, suggesting that endogenous opioid peptides are involved in blood pressure-mediated analgesia. Effects were similar when expressed in relation to blood pressure during psychological stress.

In contrast to controls, blood pressure was unrelated to pain in depressed participants in the placebo condition. However, naltrexone unmasked an association between blood pressure and pain — those with the highest blood pressure reported the least cold-induced pain. Thus, endogenous opioids apparently masked an analgesic mechanism linking elevated blood pressure with reduced sensitivity to pain in participants with major depressive disorder. Noradrenergic mechanisms involved in active coping, stress-induced analgesia, and baroreflexes might account for these findings.

### Stress-evoked opioid release inhibits pain in major depressive disorder [^1154ZhTC]. Pain (2008).

To determine whether stress-evoked release of endogenous opioids might account for hypoalgesia in major depressive disorder (MDD), the mu-opioid antagonist naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo was administered double-blind to 24 participants with MDD and to 31 non-depressed controls. Eighty minutes later, participants completed a painful foot cold pressor test and, following a 5-minute interval, began a 25-minute arithmetic task interspersed with painful electric shocks. Ten minutes later, participants completed a second cold pressor test. Negative affect was greater in participants with MDD than in non-depressed controls throughout the experiment, and increased significantly in both groups during mental arithmetic.

Before the math task, naltrexone unmasked direct linear relationships between the severity of depression, negative affect while resting quietly, and cold-induced pain in participants with MDD. In contrast, facilitatory effects of naltrexone on cold- and shock-induced pain were greatest in controls with the lowest depression scores. Naltrexone strengthened the relationship between negative affect and shock-induced pain during the math task, particularly in the depressed group, and heightened anxiety in both groups toward the end of the task. Thus, mu-opioid activity apparently masked a positive association between negative affect and pain in the most distressed participants.

These findings suggest that psychological distress inhibits pain via stress-evoked release of opioid peptides in severe cases of MDD. In addition, tonic endogenous opioid neurotransmission could inhibit depressive symptoms, potentially providing a mechanism for the modulation of pain perception and emotional distress in individuals with MDD.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116C8NJV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naltrexone hydrochloride is used in the treatment of opioid addiction and has been shown to produce complete blockade of the euphoric effects of opioids in both volunteer and addict populations. When administered in a manner that enforces compliance, it effectively blocks opioids but does not affect cocaine or other non-opioid drugs of abuse.

There is no data demonstrating an unequivocally beneficial effect of naltrexone hydrochloride on rates of recidivism among detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals who self-administer the drug. The failure of the drug in this setting appears to be due to poor medication compliance.

The drug is reported to be most useful in good prognosis opioid addicts who take it as part of a comprehensive occupational rehabilitative program, behavioral contract, or other compliance-enhancing protocol. Unlike methadone or LAAM (levo-alpha-acetyl-methadol), naltrexone hydrochloride does not reinforce medication compliance and is expected to have a therapeutic effect only under external conditions that support continued use of the medication.

### Imaging of opioid receptors in the central nervous system [^114b393C]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Abuse of μ-opioids is increasingly manifested as a major health issue due to the large potential for a strong physical addiction developed to this drug. From early work that led to the development of methadone maintenance treatment for heroin addiction in the 1960s, it is known that μ-selective agonists with long-acting pharmacokinetics, such as methadone or partial agonists like buprenorphine, are the most effective treatments for this disorder. A successful pharmacotherapeutic treatment is dependent on a sustained and steady effect on the opioid receptors (ORs) and requires a tailored dose regimen.

Use of PET molecular imaging with opioid-selective radioligands will be important for evaluating substitution therapy regimens and developing improved medications by correlating the dose and efficacy of the pharmacological agent with the resulting receptor occupancy. Methadone is a potent μ-selective agonist and a study of its receptor occupancy when given to heroin addicts was performed using [18 F]FCyF (μ- and κ-OR antagonist). Relative to healthy non-treated controls, a reduction in receptor availability of 19–32% was found, with the degree of receptor occupancy correlating with methadone plasma levels.

In contrast, no difference in [11 C]DPN (μ-, δ-, and κ-antagonist) binding was seen in a study between opioid-dependent subjects on methadone compared to drug-free healthy volunteers. The lack of change in binding was verified in an animal study.

### Buprenorphine [^11114TCj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Buprenorphine sublingual tablets contain buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **Subjective effects**: Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect. Opioid agonist ceiling effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo, and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were administered in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent. Both active drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects.

		For all measures where the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response. However, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8–32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^11387xWQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacodynamic actions: Naltrexone hydrochloride is a pure opioid antagonist. It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of intravenously administered opioids. When coadministered with morphine on a chronic basis, naltrexone hydrochloride blocks the physical dependence on morphine, heroin, and other opioids.

Naltrexone hydrochloride has few, if any, intrinsic actions besides its opioid blocking properties. However, it does produce some pupillary constriction by an unknown mechanism. The administration of naltrexone hydrochloride is not associated with the development of tolerance or dependence. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, naltrexone hydrochloride will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology.

Clinical studies indicate that 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride will block the pharmacologic effects of 25 mg of intravenously administered heroin for periods as long as 24 hours. Other data suggest that doubling the dose of naltrexone hydrochloride provides blockade for 48 hours, and tripling the dose provides blockade for about 72 hours.

Naltrexone hydrochloride blocks the effects of opioids by competitive binding (i.e. analogous to competitive inhibition of enzymes) at opioid receptors. This makes the blockade produced potentially surmountable, but overcoming full naltrexone blockade by administration of very high doses of opiates has resulted in excessive symptoms of histamine release in experimental subjects.

The mechanism of action of naltrexone hydrochloride in alcoholism is not understood.
