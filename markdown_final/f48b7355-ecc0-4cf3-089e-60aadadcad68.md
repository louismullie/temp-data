## Question

Hga1c goal for a patient with diabetes at 44 years old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate HbA1c goal for a 44-year-old with diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's age and likely life expectancy. Then, I should verify diabetes type and duration. Next, I will assess comorbidities and hypoglycemia risk. After that, I need to weigh the benefits and risks of intensive versus standard control. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized target and outline monitoring and safety considerations, including CGM-based metrics if applicable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. At 44 years old, this patient has a long life expectancy, typically exceeding 20–30 years, which materially increases the potential lifetime benefit of tighter glycemic control on microvascular outcomes, assuming it can be achieved safely [^116ouwun] [^1142jopc].

> I need to check diabetes type and duration because that shifts targets. If this is type 2 diabetes, shorter duration and absence of established cardiovascular or advanced microvascular disease favor more aggressive goals; if type 1, the same principle applies, with the DCCT/EDIC data showing durable benefits from early intensive control, though I should confirm the patient's current regimen and hypoglycemia history before pushing lower targets [^111NcTfD] [^11577bVq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single number. I should review guideline hierarchies. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 recommends an HbA1c goal of less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults without problematic hypoglycemia, while emphasizing individualization; AACE recommends ≤ 6.5% if safely achievable; VA/DoD suggests 7.0–8.5% for most but acknowledges greater net benefit of lower targets in younger, healthier patients with longer life expectancy; AAFP supports < 7% for most adults under 65, again with individualization [^116uj2d1] [^116ee3iZ] [^114PdFx9] [^1125X52E].

> Wait, let me verify the risk–benefit balance for a 44-year-old. Intensive control reduces microvascular complications and, when started early, may confer a legacy cardiovascular benefit, but it increases hypoglycemia risk and treatment burden; in younger patients with long life expectancy, the absolute risk reduction for complications is larger, so a lower target is often justified if hypoglycemia can be minimized [^111NcTfD] [^116ouwun] [^1142jopc].

> I should double-check hypoglycemia risk and comorbidities before finalizing. Absence of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, advanced kidney disease, or significant cardiovascular disease supports a more stringent target; conversely, if the patient has frequent lows, limited self-care capacity, or high-risk medications, I would relax the goal toward 7.0–7.5% or even up to 8.0% depending on severity and context [^116ee3iZ] [^114UCmQQ] [^116uj2d1].

> Let me synthesize a practical, individualized target. For a 44-year-old with diabetes, no significant hypoglycemia, and no advanced complications, a reasonable primary target is HbA1c less than 7.0%, with consideration of 6.0–6.5% if it can be achieved safely with low hypoglycemia risk and acceptable burden; if hypoglycemia emerges or comorbidities accrue, I would adjust to 7.0–7.5% or higher as indicated [^116uj2d1] [^116ee3iZ] [^114UCmQQ].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this. I will set a lower bound to avoid overtreatment: if HbA1c is below about 6.0% on therapy, I should consider de-intensifying hypoglycemia-prone agents; if using CGM, I will target time in range greater than 70% and keep time below 70 mg/dL under 4%, intensifying therapy if these are not met and reassessing quarterly [^114s2vz4] [^114JaC2j] [^116uj2d1].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on insulin or sulfonylureas with recurrent lows? In that case, I should confirm that I am not over-treating; I would raise the HbA1c goal toward 7.0–7.5% or even 7.5–8.0% if necessary, switch to lower-hypoglycemia-risk agents when possible, and prioritize CGM to guide safer titration and reduce time in hypoglycemia [^116ee3iZ] [^11243yZ1] [^11478i8u].

> I will now examine special scenarios. If this is type 1 diabetes, the same < 7% default applies, with the option to target ≤ 6.5% if safely achievable, and I should ensure frequent glucose monitoring or CGM to balance tight control with hypoglycemia avoidance; if the patient has limited life expectancy or high treatment burden, I should relax goals and focus on symptomatic control rather than a numeric target [^111M9U9g] [^11577bVq] [^111HEBNb].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically actionable: for a 44-year-old with diabetes, absent significant hypoglycemia or advanced complications, target HbA1c less than 7.0%, and consider 6.0–6.5% if it can be achieved safely with minimal hypoglycemia; individualize upward to 7.0–7.5% or higher if hypoglycemia, comorbidities, or treatment burden emerge, and use CGM metrics to monitor safety and guide therapy adjustments over time [^116uj2d1] [^116ee3iZ] [^11243yZ1].

For a 44-year-old with diabetes, the typical HbA1c goal is **< 7%** [^116uj2d1] if it can be achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or treatment burden [^114s2vz4]. More stringent targets (6.0–6.5%) may be considered for patients with a long life expectancy, short diabetes duration, and no cardiovascular disease, provided hypoglycemia risk is low [^116ee3iZ] [^116ouwun]. Individualize targets based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences, and reassess regularly as clinical circumstances change [^114UCmQQ] [^1174JCJs].

## General HbA1c targets for adults with diabetes

Current guidelines recommend **individualized HbA1c targets** based on patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and life expectancy [^114UCmQQ] [^116jLqtW]. For most nonpregnant adults with diabetes, the ADA recommends an HbA1c goal of **< 7% (53 mmol/mol)** if it can be achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or treatment burden [^116uj2d1] [^114TK8UY].

---

## Specific considerations for a 44-year-old patient

At 44 years old, patients typically have a longer life expectancy, which increases the potential long-term benefits of achieving tighter glycemic control [^116ouwun]. However, the HbA1c target must still be individualized based on the following factors:

- **Diabetes duration**: Shorter duration of diabetes may allow for more stringent targets, whereas longer duration may necessitate more conservative goals [^116ouwun].
- **Presence of comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or other significant comorbidities may warrant less stringent targets to avoid hypoglycemia and treatment burden [^116ee3iZ].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: Patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness should have less stringent targets to minimize recurrence [^116ee3iZ].
- **Patient preferences and lifestyle**: Individual patient goals, adherence, and lifestyle factors should be considered in setting HbA1c targets [^114UCmQQ].

## Recommended HbA1c target for a 44-year-old patient

Given the typical clinical profile of a 44-year-old patient, the following HbA1c targets are recommended:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended hba1c target** |
|-|-|
| General recommendation for most patients | < 7% (53 mmol/mol) [^116uj2d1] |
| Patients with short diabetes duration, no cardiovascular disease, and low hypoglycemia risk | 6.0–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol) [^116ee3iZ] [^116ouwun] |
| Patients with significant comorbidities, long diabetes duration, or high hypoglycemia risk | 7.0–8.0% (53–64 mmol/mol) [^116ee3iZ] [^114UCmQQ] |

## Evidence supporting individualized HbA1c targets

Recent clinical trials and guidelines emphasize the importance of **individualized HbA1c targets** to balance the benefits of glycemic control with the risks of hypoglycemia and treatment burden [^114UCmQQ] [^116jLqtW]. The ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT trials demonstrated that intensive glycemic control can reduce microvascular complications but may increase the risk of hypoglycemia and, in some cases, mortality, particularly in older adults with multiple comorbidities [^111E5Wj2] [^116Mo8cY]. Therefore, individualized targets are essential to optimize outcomes [^114UCmQQ].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of HbA1c targets

HbA1c should be measured at least twice yearly in stable patients and more frequently (every 3 months) if targets are not being met or if therapy changes are made [^notfound]. Regular reassessment of **glycemic goals** is recommended based on changes in patient status, comorbidities, and preferences [^1174JCJs].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a 44-year-old patient with diabetes, the typical HbA1c goal is **< 7% (53 mmol/mol)** if it can be achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia or treatment burden [^116uj2d1]. More stringent targets (6.0–6.5%) may be considered for patients with a short diabetes duration, no cardiovascular disease, and low hypoglycemia risk, while less stringent targets (7.0–8.0%) are appropriate for those with significant comorbidities, long diabetes duration, or high hypoglycemia risk [^116ee3iZ] [^116ouwun]. Individualized targets should be set through shared decision-making and regularly reassessed as patient circumstances evolve [^114UCmQQ] [^1174JCJs].

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^111BvkVY]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The intended effect of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in diabetes populations is to maximize the population-level health benefits of glycemic control while reducing the risk of harm. According to strategies for individualizing glycemic targets from the ADA guideline and Ismail-Beigi et al. 44–70% of the U.S. adult diabetes population should have recommended A1C targets set at or above 7.0%. Despite this dramatic change in glycemic target assignment, one-third of the diabetes population would still be considered uncontrolled using individualized targets instead of a conventional A1C target of < 7.0%. Thus, individualizing glycemic control targets will not obviate the need for continued population-level improvements in glycemic control.

Calls to individualize glycemic targets have grown in recent years, in part because of the increasing recognition that the U.S. diabetes population has a high prevalence of long-standing diabetes, advanced age, and diabetes-related complications, all variables that potentially reduce the benefits and elevate the risks of traditional glycemic control goals. These population-level characteristics raise serious questions about what the goals of diabetes translational and quality improvement research should be. Most diabetes translational and quality improvement research currently aims to move the population toward the glycemic control target of an A1C < 7.0%. For example, a recent study found that primary care providers could significantly increase the number of diabetes patients with an A1C level < 7.0% by increasing their encounter frequency to every 2 weeks. However, if individualization is desirable, then diabetes research efforts should ideally move different segments of the population toward different targets. Diabetes translational research could incorporate individualized targets in a number of ways. An intervention designed to lower blood sugars in a clinic population could still use standard quality improvement tools (e.g. plan-do-study-act cycles, disease registries, and population management), but patients would be assigned to different glycemic control targets. Alternatively, diabetes translational interventions could focus solely on individuals with a common glycemic target, such as healthy younger patients with newly diagnosed diabetes or older diabetes patients with significant comorbidities. Interventions for these populations may not only need specific glycemic targets but they may also need specialized components that account for the unique clinical and behavioral needs of these targeted populations.

Statistical analysis

To understand the implications of individualizing glycemic targets using the ADA guideline, we characterized the size of the U.S. adult diabetes population by duration of diabetes, age, macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, and comorbidity. We then applied the ADA strategy for individualization. The ADA guideline recommends A1C goals more stringent than < 7.0% (e.g. < 6.5%) be considered for patients with a short duration of diabetes and no history of significant macrovascular disease, and A1C goals less stringent than < 7.0% (e.g. < 8.0%) for patients with longstanding diabetes, advanced age, a history of macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, or extensive comorbid conditions.

Second, we applied the Ismail-Beigi strategy for individualization. We simplified their strategy by creating mutually exclusive categories of individualized A1C targets. Age categories were defined to be mutually exclusive (20–44, 45–65, 66–75, and > 75 years). We assigned an individualized A1C target (≤ 6.5, 6.5–7.0, ∼7.0, 7.0–8.0, and ∼8.0%) according to each respondent's age, duration of diabetes, and history of macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications. Details about the individualized A1C target assignment are presented in Table 2.

Additionally, we compared recommended individualized A1C targets to measured levels in order to provide an estimate of the current use of individualized A1C targets in U.S. adults with diabetes. We defined the A1C targets ∼7.0% and ∼8.0% to have a 1.0% range, i.e. 6.5–7.5% and 7.5–8.5%, for analyses comparing individualized targets to measured A1C levels. For all analyses, sampling weights were used to provide estimates that are representative of the U.S. population. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).

### To what target hemoglobin A1c level would you treat this patient with type 2 diabetes? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113A6kBq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults-and 25% of those older than 65 years-have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and glycemic control. The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved safely. Here, 2 experts, a diabetologist and a general internist, discuss how to apply the divergent guideline recommendations to a patient with long-standing T2D and a current HbA1c level of 7.8%.

### Achievement of glycated hemoglobin goals in the US remains unchanged through 2014 [^113Wntfe]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Glycemic control was assessed in three ways: a general target of < 7.0% and an individualized target based on the person's age and diabetes-related comorbidities and poor control (HbA1c > 9.0%), shown in Table 1. The HbA1c target < 7.0% aligns with American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines before 2012 and one of the HEDIS quality metrics (only applied to members under 65 without certain comorbidities). The individualized guidelines were adapted based on guidelines introduced in 2012. HbA1c > 9.0% is considered poor control in various quality metrics, including the National Quality Forum (NQF). Individualized targets were initially developed to offer a patient-centered approach to diabetes management and were introduced in 2012. The ADA-EASD guidelines provide several factors that can be used to guide the development of individualized HbA1c targets. As individualized HbA1c targets were not collected by the NHANEs (i.e. reported by the patient or a treating physician), this analysis followed the same approach to developing individualized targets as Ali and used two factors (age and the presence of complications) to infer individualized targets. These factors were chosen as they were the only two factors that could be objectively observed in our data set. We further modified the individualized targets used by Ali for two groups of patients. First, for persons aged 18–44 years without complications, Ali used the intensive treatment target of < 6.5%, while this analysis used a more conservative target of ≤ 7.0%. Second, for patients aged 65 years and older without complications, Ali used two target values (≤ 7.0 or ≤ 7.5%) because of the lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate target for this risk group, while this analysis used the more conservative target of ≤ 7.5%. Determination of complications was based on the presence of any of the following conditions: self-reported retinopathy, self-reported cardiovascular disease (heart attack, coronary heart disease, or stroke), or measured albumin/creatinine ratio of 30 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine or higher. HbA1c (%), albumin (per milligram), and creatinine (per gram) were all measured directly from blood samples provided by survey participants. All HbA1c measurements were collected during the time of the interview and therefore offer accurate and timely assessments.

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^115DESPV]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, a formal strategy for individualizing targets was published by Ismail-Beigi et al. Similar to diabetes care guidelines, this strategy was based on expert interpretation of outcomes from prominent diabetes trials, including the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified-Release Control Evaluation (ADVANCE), and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT). The Ismail-Beigi strategy used the same clinical characteristics proposed in previous guidelines from the VA-DoD, American Geriatric Society, and ACP (e.g. age, duration of diabetes, history of macrovascular and microvascular complications, comorbidity, and psychosocioeconomic context). Based on their strategy, only adults 20–44 years of age with no history of diabetes-related complications would be recommended an A1C target of ≤ 6.5%, and several populations are recommended individualized A1C targets above the conventional ADA threshold of < 7.0%, including adults 45–65 years of age with established macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, adults > 65 years of age with longstanding diabetes or established macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, and all adults with advanced age. Additionally, because the Ismail-Beigi strategy suggested ranges of glycemic targets (i.e. ∼7, 7.0–8.0, or ∼8.0%), there exists the potential that some patients who could safely tolerate lower glycemic targets may be undertreated in order to stay within range.

### Diabetes in older adults [^111gUUuy]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

What current guidelines exist for treating diabetes in older adults?

Several organizations have developed diabetes guidelines specific to, or including, older adults. The ADA includes a section on older adults in its annual Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes. The section discusses the heterogeneity of persons aged ≥ 65 years and the lack of high-level evidence. The overall recommendations, all based on expert opinion, include the following:
Older adults who are functional, are cognitively intact, and have significant life expectancy should receive diabetes care using goals developed for younger adults.
Glycemic goals for older adults not meeting the above criteria may be relaxed using individualized criteria, but hyperglycemia leading to symptoms or risk of acute hyperglycemic complications should be avoided in all patients.
Other cardiovascular risk factors should be treated in older adults with consideration of the timeframe of benefit and the individual patient. Treatment of hypertension is indicated in virtually all older adults, and lipid and aspirin therapy may benefit those with life expectancy at least equal to the timeframe of primary or secondary prevention trials.
Screening for diabetes complications should be individualized in older adults, but particular attention should be paid to complications that would lead to functional impairment.

The ADA goals for glycemic control do not specifically mention age. The recommendation for many adults is an A1C < 7%, but less stringent goals are recommended for those with limited life expectancy, advanced diabetes complications, or extensive comorbid conditions.

In collaboration with the ADA and other medical organizations, the California HealthCare Foundation/American Geriatrics Society panel published guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes in 2003. A significant proportion of the recommendations concerns geriatric syndromes. Highlights of diabetes-specific recommendations include A1C targets of ≤ 7.0% in "relatively healthy adults", while for those who are frail or with life expectancy less than 5 years, a less stringent target, such as 8%, was considered appropriate. The guidelines also suggested that the timeline of benefits was estimated to be at least 8 years for glycemic control and 2–3 years for blood pressure and lipid control.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113WkBmq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (treatment goals), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to individualize glycemic goals prioritizing avoidance of hypoglycemia, with less stringent goals (HbA1c < 8.0% or < 64 mmol/mol and/or time in range 70–180 mg/dL or 3.9–10.0 mmol of 50% and time below range < 70 mg/dL or 3.9 mmol/L of < 1%) in older patients with significant cognitive and/or functional limitations, frailty, severe comorbidities, and a less favorable risk-to-benefit ratio of diabetes medications.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^113QouE3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Glycemic control targets for older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) — target goal for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in older adults generally should be 7.5% to 8%; HbA1c between 7% and 7.5% may be appropriate if it can be safely achieved in healthy older adults with few comorbidities and good functional status, and higher HbA1c targets (8–9%) are appropriate for older adults with multiple comorbidities, poor health, and limited life expectancy; there is potential harm in lowering HbA1c to less than 6.5% in older adults with type 2 DM, and there is no evidence that using medications to achieve tight glycemic control in older adults with type 2 DM is beneficial; for adults younger than 65, using medications to achieve HbA1c levels of less than 6.5% is associated with harms, including hypoglycemia and mortality, except for reductions in MI and mortality with metformin; given the long time frame needed to achieve a reduction in microvascular complications, glycemic goals should reflect patient goals, health status, and life expectancy.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Time in suboptimal glycemic control over 10 years for patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^115FoJXp]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate time in suboptimal glycemic control among patients with incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) over 10 years.

Methods

We calculated percent of time in suboptimal glycemic control using three A1C thresholds (8%, 7.5%, 7%) following T2D diagnosis. Stratified analyses were conducted based on age and A1C levels at T2D diagnosis.

Results

We identified 28,315 patients with incident T2D. Percent of time in suboptimal glycemic control increased with T2D duration. Mean percent time in suboptimal A1C control in the first 2 years following diagnosis was 30%, 34% and 40% for the 8%, 7.5%, and 7% thresholds, respectively. In the 6–10 years following T2D diagnosis, the percent time in suboptimal A1C control increased to 39%, 48% and 61%, for the 8%, 7.5%, and 7% thresholds, respectively. Time in suboptimal glycemic control was longer among younger patients aged 20–44 versus ≥ 65 years and those with higher A1C (> 8%) versus lower A1C (< 7%) at diagnosis.

Conclusions

Over 10 years following diagnosis, T2D patients spent one-third to over one-half of their time in suboptimal glycemic control. Reducing time spent above desired A1C targets could lower risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.

### ACP releases updated guidance statement on A1c… [^113pmsbw]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Goals of glycemic control should be individualized to each patient, after discussing harms and benefits, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense.
- An A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients, because targets of 7% or less do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events. A1C measurement is one method for determining blood glucose levels, but it is inconsistent and can change based on a patient's race and ethnicity. Previous guidelines have recommended the use of medications to reach A1C targets; however, an ideal target remains debatable. This guidance statement from the American College of Physicians aims to help physicians achieve appropriate A1C targets via medication for nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes based on a review of six health care organization guidelines.

Guidance Statements Goals of glycemic control via medication should be individualized to each patient, after talking about benefits and harms of more vs. less control, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense. Because targets of 7% or less vs. approximately 8% do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events, an A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients. However, variability in A1C measurements should still be considered when making treatment decisions. Taking into account patient preference, a stricter A1C target can be considered in persons who are expected to live at least 15 more years. A lower target can be considered in patients who can achieve it with diet and lifestyle changes. Treatment in older persons and those with a shorter life expectancy should aim to reduce symptoms of hyperglycemia, rather than to achieve A1C targets.

In addition, because achieving certain A1C targets is associated with more harm than good, these targets are not recommended in any patient expected to live fewer than 10 years because of older age, living in a long-term care facility, or with a chronic condition. Editor's Note: The "lower is better" drumbeat in the type 2 diabetes treatment community for almost 50 years is starting to fade away as the lack of benefit — and increased risk of harm — has been demonstrated in several studies. Although some endocrine societies are still holding out for lower A1C targets, the American Diabetes Association also has come to recognize the need to consider many factors other than glycemic control when making decisions about treatment goals.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1123awg6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes guidelines and organizations typically advocate a target glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value of 6.5–7.0% but highlight that glycemic management must be individualized. Whereas individualization of both glycemic targets and management is appealing to the clinician as a way of potentially maximizing benefit while minimizing risk, there is little evidence that such an approach will bring more patients to target. It may be argued that this approach could contribute to fewer patients attaining optimal glycemic targets. Nonetheless, the results of recent large outcome trials clearly highlight the fact that individual glycemic target achievement varied markedly, with some patients apparently deriving more clinical benefit and others deriving more harm. At the same time, there is ongoing evidence of a treatment gap in many surveys of clinical practice and a suggestion that algorithm-driven protocols may be more effective. Collectively, therefore, the currently available evidence suggests that algorithm-driven protocols that incorporate individualized targets based on patient characteristics designed to preserve a sound balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control may be an appropriate way of getting more patients to target in a safe and effective manner.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### Glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: time for an evidence-based about-face? [^116HHG4U]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Some diabetes guidelines set low glycemic control goals for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (such as a hemoglobin A(1c) level as low as 6.5% to 7.0%) to avoid or delay complications. Our review and critique of recent large randomized trials in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that tight glycemic control burdens patients with complex treatment programs, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and costs and offers uncertain benefits in return. We believe clinicians should prioritize supporting well-being and healthy lifestyles, preventive care, and cardiovascular risk reduction in these patients. Glycemic control efforts should individualize hemoglobin A(1c) targets so that those targets and the actions necessary to achieve them reflect patients' personal and clinical context and their informed values and preferences.

Individualizing glycemic goals — glycemic goals and pharmacologic management should be individualized and not one size fits all, and glycemic goals should be individualized in the context of shared decision-making to address individual needs and preferences; more aggressive goals may be recommended if they can be achieved safely and with an acceptable burden of therapy and if life expectancy is sufficient to reap the benefits of stringent goals; less stringent goals, such as A1C up to 8% [64 mmol/mol], may be recommended when the benefits of an intensive goal may not be realized or when the risks and burdens outweigh the potential benefits.

### Physician reasons for nonpharmacologic treatment of hyperglycemia in older patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116dVD8V]. Diabetes Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The number of people aged ≥ 65 years is increasing, and currently represents approximately 13.0% of the US population. At the same time, the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among adults aged ≥ 65 years have increased to values of 2.7% annually and 24.8%, respectively. Persons aged ≥ 65 years diagnosed with T2DM in the US have morbidity and mortality rates far in excess of their counterparts without diabetes, including microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Studies, treatment with antihyperglycemic therapies reduced the risk of microvascular and, in the metformin arm, macrovascular disease endpoints among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. Importantly, this early treatment led to sustained benefits related to the development and progression of microvascular disease as well as to emergent risk reduction in macrovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend initiating treatment with metformin, in combination with lifestyle changes, immediately after the diabetes diagnosis, with a target hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) value of < 7.0% for adults. The American Geriatrics Society also recommends a target HbA 1c of ≤ 7.0% for relatively healthy, older adults. However, specific glycemic targets may need to be re-evaluated for higher-risk patients with T2DM in light of the increased mortality observed in patients aggressively treated with antihyperglycemic agents to achieve intensive glucose lowering glycemic targets.

However, many patients aged ≥ 65 years are not prescribed antihyperglycemic agents after diagnosis of T2DM. In a US employer-based health insurance data set, 44.0% of individuals aged ≥ 65 years received no antihyperglycemic therapy in the 12-month period following T2DM diagnosis. Similarly, in a retrospective US cohort study, older patients (age ≥ 65 years) with newly diagnosed T2DM were less likely to have oral antihyperglycemic therapy initiated following diagnosis than younger patients. Among patients who showed disease progression in a 1-year follow-up period (defined as a HbA 1c increase from < 7.0 to ≥ 7.0%), the likelihood of initiating antihyperglycemic therapy decreased by 40.0% with every decade increase in age.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^114Mr1HZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) in older adults — hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) monitoring and self-monitoring: Older adults with DM whose individual targets are not being met should have their HbA1c levels measured at least every 6 months and more frequently as needed or indicated, and for those with stable HbA1c over several years, measurement every 12 months may be appropriate (IIIB). For older adults with DM, a schedule for self-monitoring of blood glucose should be considered depending on functional and cognitive abilities, and the schedule should be based on the goals of care, target HbA1c levels, potential for modifying therapy, and risk of hypoglycemia (IIIB).

Diabetes in older adults — reasonable glucose target ranges and HbA1c by group and hypoglycemia risk are specified as follows. For patients not using drugs that may cause hypoglycemia (e.g., insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides), Group 1 targets are Fasting 90–130 mg/dL and Bedtime 90–150 mg/dL with HbA1c < 7.5%; Group 2 targets are Fasting 90–150 mg/dL and Bedtime 100–180 mg/dL with HbA1c < 8%; Group 3 targets are Fasting 100–180 mg/dL and Bedtime 110–200 mg/dL with HbA1c < 8.5%. For patients using drugs that may cause hypoglycemia, Group 1 targets are Fasting 90–150 mg/dL and Bedtime 100–180 mg/dL with HbA1c ≥ 7.0 and < 7.5%; Group 2 targets are Fasting 100–150 mg/dL and Bedtime 150–180 mg/dL with HbA1c ≥ 7.5 and < 8.0%; Group 3 targets are Fasting 100–180 mg/dL and Bedtime 150–250 mg/dL with HbA1c ≥ 8.0 and < 8.5%. Shared decision-making is emphasized: "individualized goal may be lower or higher", and when using hypoglycemia-inducing drugs, "As long as achievable without clinically significant hypoglycemia; otherwise, higher glucose targets may be appropriate". It is noted that "HbA1c of 8.5% correlates with an average glucose level of approximately 200 mg/dL".

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^116Tc2ws]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Over 280 million people worldwide are known to have diabetes, and this number is projected to grow to 438 million by 2030. Current diabetes treatment guidelines encourage a multifaceted therapeutic approach. Central to these recommendations is early diagnosis and active intervention to realize and maintain glycemic control, with the aim of stopping the development of microvascular complications, reducing the risk of macrovascular events, and ameliorating the symptoms of acute hyperglycemia (,–).

The prognostic significance of A1C in regard to the incidence of diabetes complications, and the risk reductions associated with improvements in A1C, have been documented in both type 1 and type 2 (–,) diabetes. These have led to the underscoring of the importance of A1C target achievement. Many organizations around the world including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence currently advocate a general target level for A1C of 6.5–7.0%. They also all say that the targets of therapy must be individualized. Recently, a joint position statement from the American College of Cardiology, ADA, and the American Heart Association released in response to the premature discontinuation of the glycemic intervention in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial recommended that although an appropriate A1C target is generally < 7.0%, individualized glycemic targets may be appropriate for some patients. For example, they stated that higher A1C targets may be more appropriate for those patients who are older, have longer duration of diabetes, have a history of severe hypoglycemia, exhibit advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, or present with extensive comorbidities. Others have noted that where glucose control closer to normal, or in the normal range, is easily attained, the care necessary to achieve it should be offered to the individual concerned.

### Recommendations… [^1113n6ox]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension.
- Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD. The ADA now states that an A1C of ≥ 6. 5% or previous criteria for fasting glucose or two-hour glucose may be used for diagnosing diabetes. BLOOD GLUCOSE Some studies indicate that the possible risks of intensive glycemic control may outweigh the benefits in certain populations, including those with a history of severe hypoglycemia, and a shorter life expectancy because of older age, frailty, or comorbidities. Less strict A1C goals can be used in these persons.

Additionally, less strict goals can be used for patients if the goal is hard to meet even with intensive self-management education, counseling, and treatment with medications aimed at lowering glucose levels. For most persons, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease. To lower A1C to this level, mean plasma glucose should be 150 to 160 mg per dL, fasting and premeal glucose should be less than 130 mg per dL, and postprandial glucose should be less than 180 mg per dL. Stricter goals might be beneficial in certain patient populations such as those without significant heart disease, shorter disease duration, or longer life expectancy; however, these should be implemented only if they do not cause significant hypoglycemia or adverse effects. In persons with diabetes 40 to 75 years of age, if the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 70 to 189 mg per dL, they should receive a moderate-intensity statin, and if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD, they should receive a high-intensity statin.

### Empirically establishing blood glucose targets to achieve HbA1c goals [^115GpKbF]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent diabetes management guidelines specify that treatment goals should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and duration of disease, with an American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes goal of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) or American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) goal of ≤ 6.5% (≤ 48 mmol/mol) in otherwise healthy patients. Although HbA 1c is the target, it is measured once every 3 months, and day-to-day self-management of diabetes to achieve and maintain the individualized target HbA 1c is facilitated by self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values, especially in patients treated with insulin. To achieve the recommended HbA 1c goals, the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the AACE, and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have recommend SMBG targets (Table 1), the origins of which are obscure but appear to be based predominantly on expert opinion. As a result, there is wide variation in the recommended SMBG targets to achieve a HbA 1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) and little to guide clinicians and patients on how to achieve other, individualized, targets.

We sought to determine the average fasting, postprandial, and bedtime glucose values, based on empirical data, to achieve and maintain target HbA 1c levels in the outpatient setting.

Introduction

The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is on the rise, with an additional 210 million individuals expected to have the disease in 2035 compared with 2013. This is largely due to the aging of populations, with advanced age a known independent risk factor for both developing the disease and experiencing associated complications.

Guidelines pertaining specifically to older patients with diabetes emphasize the influence of age on the appropriacy of treatment regimens and the added importance of recognizing individual patient characteristics in this population. Indeed, elderly patients tend to be more comorbid and have more atherosclerotic vasculature, poorer kidney function, and shorter life expectancy. If the latter is shorter than 20 years, the cardiovascular advantages of stringent glycemic control may not have sufficient time to manifest, and intensive treatment to reach low HbA1c targets may consequently be more harmful than beneficial. Furthermore, patient mental state, functionality, and quality of support systems may dictate the feasibility of meeting such targets in elderly patients, especially where insulin administration is indicated. Therefore, guidelines suggest that individual glycemic targets may be relaxed as age increases (HbA1c 7.5%–8.0%; 58–64 mmol/mol), with prevention of hypoglycemia and quality of life particularly important aspects. Conversely, younger patients with long life expectancies and lower rate of comorbidities may be assigned a more stringent target (HbA1c 6.0%–6.5%; 42–48 mmol/mol), given the potential protective effect of intensive glycemic control against long-term microvascular complications and cardiovascular events.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114Pp9LW]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — individualizing HbA1c targets should account for disease status, complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy; the guideline states the clinician should consider these factors and we suggest clinicians consider the magnitude of expected benefit using principles of absolute risk reduction (ARR) or number needed to treat (NNT), not relative risk, noting that the studies above can provide an order of magnitude of expected benefit, especially in older adults. Establishing an individualized therapeutic goal requires a thorough understanding of patient characteristics, including demographics, behavioral factors, cultural factors, and other social determinants that contribute to disparity in adult diabetes care and outcomes in the U.S. population; understanding the individual patient's characteristics will mitigate the negative impact social determinants of health can have on diabetes outcomes, and considering the presence of end–organ injury or other comorbidities and estimating life expectancy — which weighs the relative risk of death and, when viewed as a function of age, comorbidity, and disability, frailty, or both, can be valuable — supports a more relaxed HbA1c target range and offers clinician flexibility to establish expectations and to choose how to safely improve outcomes.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^116PsnRM]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

PROS AND CONS

In summary, there is excellent clinical evidence that good glycemic control significantly reduces the risk of diabetes complications and particularly the microvascular complications. At the same time, stringent pharmacotherapeutic management to reach an A1C < 6.5% or even 7.0% may be inadvisable or impractical in some patients. Treatment must therefore be individualized over time to maintain an appropriate balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control, taking into account the specific features of the patient (e.g. presence or absence of prior CV disease, duration of diabetes, etc.) and the agents used (e.g. risk of hypoglycemia).

It is also evident from the available data that a major problem in achieving targets continues to be persistent delays in appropriate use of oral agents and insulin. To ensure across the board attainment and maintenance of guidelines-recommended A1C levels, it would appear that physicians and other members of the health care team at all levels need to be presented with well-structured directives, with feedback and audit mechanisms that outline safe therapy intensification processes and do not allow them the excuse of "individualized" therapy.

Shared decision-making (SDM) is described as a collaborative, patient-directed decision-making process that helps the patient set goals and priorities with input from their health care team, family, and other caregivers; the objective is for the patient to make choices that meet his/her needs while honoring personal values and preferences, and the SDM arrow indicates that after consideration of these factors, some patients may have lower or higher targets.

A longer diabetes duration was seen in older patients. This has been identified as an independent risk factor for hypoglycemia. Accordingly, guidelines state that stringent HbA1c targets (6.0%–6.5%) should only be considered for patients with a shorter diabetes duration and long life expectancy, while older patients with longer diabetes durations nearing the end of their lives may have a more relaxed target and higher risks of comorbidities such as impaired renal function and potential side effects to aggressive therapies. While targets must also take into account factors such as comorbidities, microvascular complications, and functional status, it follows that the youngest age group in the present study had the most stringent targets. This is despite them having higher HbA1c and FBG values at baseline, demanding a greater improvement in glycemic control. However, although statistically different, the mean group targets were reasonably similar in magnitude from a clinical perspective (6.8%–7.1%). Considered in the context of guideline recommendations, this is surprising. It is possible that physicians were more lenient with the younger age group because of their high glycemic values at baseline and the wish to set a realistic target. Indeed, setting unrealistically low glycemic targets has been suggested to be counterproductive for long-term motivation in patients with type 1 diabetes, and this is likely to extrapolate to patients with T2DM.

The Work Group noted that intensively lowering HbA1c "will reduce microvascular complications… but not other important clinical outcomes", and that any benefits are "counterbalanced by an increased risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and, in one trial, all-cause mortality".

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^115qBi7K]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To estimate how many U.S. adults with diabetes would be eligible for individualized A1C targets based on 1) the 2012 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline and 2) a published approach for individualized target ranges.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We studied adults with diabetes ≥ 20 years of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2008 (n = 757). We assigned A1C targets based on duration, age, diabetes-related complications, and comorbid conditions according to 1) the ADA guideline and 2) a strategy by Ismail-Beigi focused on setting target ranges. We estimated the number and proportion of adults with each A1C target and compared individualized targets to measured levels.

RESULTS

Using ADA guideline recommendations, 31% (95% CI 27–34%) of the U.S. adult diabetes population would have recommended A1C targets of < 7.0%, and 69% (95% CI 66–73%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. Using the Ismail-Beigi strategy, 56% (51–61%) would have an A1C target of ≤ 7.0%, and 44% (39–49%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. If a universal A1C < 7.0% target were applied, 47% (41–54%) of adults with diabetes would have inadequate glycemic control; this proportion declined to 30% (26–36%) with the ADA guideline and 31% (27–36%) with the Ismail-Beigi strategy.

CONCLUSIONS

Using individualized glycemic targets, about half of U.S. adults with diabetes would have recommended A1C targets of ≥ 7.0% but one-third would still be considered inadequately controlled. Diabetes research and performance measurement goals will need to be revised in order to encourage the individualization of glycemic targets.

### Hemoglobin A1c targets for glycemic control with pharmacologic therapy for nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a guidance statement update from the American College of Physicians [^114M26zM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians developed this guidance statement to guide clinicians in selecting targets for pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The National Guideline Clearinghouse and the Guidelines International Network library were searched (May 2017) for national guidelines, published in English, that addressed hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets for treating type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant outpatient adults. The authors identified guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. In addition, 4 commonly used guidelines were reviewed, from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology, the American Diabetes Association, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the guidelines.

Guidance Statement 1

Clinicians should personalize goals for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on the basis of a discussion of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy, patients' preferences, patients' general health and life expectancy, treatment burden, and costs of care.

Guidance Statement 2

Clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Guidance Statement 3

Clinicians should consider deintensifying pharmacologic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve HbA1c levels less than 6.5%.

Guidance Statement 4

Clinicians should treat patients with type 2 diabetes to minimize symptoms related to hyperglycemia and avoid targeting an HbA1c level in patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years due to advanced age (80 years or older), residence in a nursing home, or chronic conditions (such as dementia, cancer, end-stage kidney disease, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure) because the harms outweigh the benefits in this population.

### Paradox of glycemic management: multimorbidity, glycemic control, and high-risk medication use among adults with diabetes [^115JhCkY]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

We also examined glycemic management among younger and healthier adults in the context of emerging concerns about increased rates of diabetes-related complications and hyperglycemic emergencies in the younger age groups. Our findings confirmed the presence of a risk/treatment paradox, with overall worse glycemic control and low rates of insulin therapy despite elevated HbA 1c levels among younger patients and patients with few comorbidities. Just 46.3% of patients 18–44 years old achieved HbA 1c ≤ 6.9%, compared with 62.5% of patients 75 years and older. Conversely, 23.1% of patients 18–44 years old had HbA 1c ≥ 9.0%, compared with just 5.6% of people ≥ 75 years old. ADA guidelines recommend insulin therapy when HbA 1c levels exceed 10%. Yet, even with HbA 1c ≥ 10%, only half of patients 18–44 years old were treated with insulin, compared with 61% of those ≥ 65 years old. Analogously, only 37% of patients without any of the examined comorbidities and HbA 1c ≥ 10% were treated with insulin, compared with more than 70% of patients with multiple comorbidities. While diabetes management is complex at any age, some of the challenges that young people face may be unique and need to be considered. For instance, younger people with commercial and employer-sponsored insurance are more likely to have high deductible health plans, limited coverage, and/or higher out-of-pocket costs than older adults with Medicare Advantage plans. Younger people may have less contact with healthcare providers and fewer opportunities to intensity treatment. They also have to balance the needs of their diabetes with other responsibilities, such as education, employment, and family. While we considered cumulative clinical complexity in our analyses, we could not capture the intangible work of living with diabetes and the overall burden of disease that people with diabetes face.

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^1132N5ii]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

For nearly a decade, diabetes care guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have recommended that the goal of glycemic control should be to lower the A1C to < 7.0% for adults living with diabetes. This recommendation currently motivates diabetes public health programs and diabetes care translational research. All of these efforts have the overall intention of shifting the national distribution of A1C levels downward in order to improve diabetes outcomes and may lead to overtreatment of A1C levels in certain diabetes populations.

Although the standard A1C target of < 7.0% is probably the best-known feature of the ADA guidelines, the ADA guidelines also recommend that A1C targets should be based on individual clinical circumstances. Similar recommendations for individualized targets have been supported by the Veterans Health Administration-Department of Defense (VA-DoD), American Geriatric Society, American College of Physicians (ACP), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). Recommendations to individualize targets are based on major type 2 diabetes trials that found different levels of benefit, and even harm, from lower A1C levels depending on diabetes population characteristics (e.g. duration of diabetes, age, and comorbidity). According to the ADA, lower A1C targets are recommended for patients with a short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant cardiovascular disease. Conversely, higher A1C targets are recommended for patients with longstanding diabetes, advanced age, limited life expectancy, a history of macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications, extensive comorbidities, or a high risk for severe hypoglycemia. Although guidelines have identified these special populations, recommendations on how to set individualized A1C targets have been open to interpretation.

RESULTS

Respondent characteristics

There were an estimated 18.5 million U.S. adults in 2007–2008 with self-reported diabetes. The mean age of U.S. adults with diabetes was 60 years (Table 1) and average A1C was 7.2%. The mean duration of diabetes was 12 years and about one-third had a history of macrovascular or advanced microvascular complications. The mean weighted combined Charlson Comorbidity Index score for the adult diabetes population was 4.0 points.

Individualization of glycemic targets based on the ADA guideline

Using the ADA guideline, an A1C target more stringent than the conventional A1C of < 7% (e.g. < 6.5%) would apply to 19% (95% CI 15–22%), whereas the conventional A1C target of < 7% would apply to 12% (8–16%), of the U.S. adult diabetes population (Table 2). An A1C target that is set at or above 7.0% (e.g. < 8.0%) would apply to 69% (66–73%) of the U.S. adult diabetes population.

### Is glycemia control in Canadians with diabetes individualized? A cross-sectional observational study [^1146K5CD]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

Diabetes guidelines recommend individualized glycemic targets: tighter control in younger, healthier patients and consideration of more moderate control in the elderly and those with coexisting illnesses. Our objective was to examine whether glycemic control varied by age and comorbidities in Canadian primary care.

Research Design and Methods

Cross-sectional study using data from the electronic medical records of 537 primary care providers across Canada; 30416 patients with diabetes, aged 40 or above, with at least one encounter and one hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurement between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013. The outcome was the most recent HbA1c, categorized into three levels of control: tight (< 7.0%or < 53mmol/mol), moderate (7.0%-8.5%, 53mmol/mol-69.5 mmol/mol) and uncontrolled (> 8.5%or > 69.5mmol/mol). We adjusted for several factors associated with glycemic control including treatment intensity.

Results

Younger patients (aged 40–49) were more likely to have moderate as opposed to tight control than the older patients (aged 80+) (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.49, p = 0.001). The youngest were also more likely to have uncontrolled as opposed to moderately controlled glycemia (OR 3.39; 95%CI 2.75 to 4.17, p < 0.0001). Patients with no or only one comorbidity were more likely to have moderate as opposed to tight control than those with three or more comorbidities (OR 1.66;95% CI 1.46 to 1.90, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Levels of glycemic control, given age and comorbidities appear to differ from guideline recommendations. Research is needed to understand these discrepancies and develop methods to assist providers in personalizing glycemic targets.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^112nSCZM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society — glycemic targets in older adults with diabetes — states: "Avoid using medications to achieve hemoglobin A1c < 7.5% in most adults age 65 and older; moderate control is generally better". The rationale indicates "There is no evidence that using medications to achieve tight glycemic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes is beneficial" and that "using medications to achieve glycated hemoglobin levels less than 7% is associated with harms, including higher mortality rates". It further notes "Tight control has been consistently shown to produce higher rates of hypoglycemia in older adults". Suggested targets are specified: "Reasonable glycemic targets would be 7.0–7.5% in healthy older adults with long life expectancy, 7.5–8.0% in those with moderate comorbidity and a life expectancy < 10 years, and 8.0–9.0% in those with multiple morbidities and shorter life expectancy".

### Public health implications of recommendations to individualize glycemic targets in adults with diabetes [^112n68ch]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate how many U.S. adults with diabetes would be eligible for individualized A1C targets based on 1) the 2012 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline and 2) a published approach for individualized target ranges.

Research Design and Methods

We studied adults with diabetes ≥ 20 years of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2008 (n = 757). We assigned A1C targets based on duration, age, diabetes-related complications, and comorbid conditions according to 1) the ADA guideline and 2) a strategy by Ismail-Beigi focused on setting target ranges. We estimated the number and proportion of adults with each A1C target and compared individualized targets to measured levels.

Results

Using ADA guideline recommendations, 31% (95% CI 27–34%) of the U.S. adult diabetes population would have recommended A1C targets of < 7.0%, and 69% (95% CI 66–73%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. Using the Ismail-Beigi strategy, 56% (51–61%) would have an A1C target of ≤ 7.0%, and 44% (39–49%) would have A1C targets less stringent than < 7.0%. If a universal A1C < 7.0% target were applied, 47% (41–54%) of adults with diabetes would have inadequate glycemic control; this proportion declined to 30% (26–36%) with the ADA guideline and 31% (27–36%) with the Ismail-Beigi strategy.

Conclusions

Using individualized glycemic targets, about half of U.S. adults with diabetes would have recommended A1C targets of ≥ 7.0% but one-third would still be considered inadequately controlled. Diabetes research and performance measurement goals will need to be revised in order to encourage the individualization of glycemic targets.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^111RGTmS]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Targets and duration of disease

Disease duration should be considered when defining HbA1c targets. Early strict glycaemic control prevents micro- and macrovascular complications. Analyses of recent intervention trials in type 2 diabetes indicate that the shorter the disease duration the greater the cardiovascular protection offered by strict glycemic control. Once disease duration is more than 10 to 12 years, that beneficial effect may be lost, may even become detrimental. On the other hand, post hoc analysis of some data suggests that benefits of glycaemic control are likely to occur in patients before the development of clinical cardiovascular disease regardless of the duration of their disease. In young patients, reducing the long-term risk of complications, while ensuring optimal energy metabolism, demands more strict HbA1c targets. Therefore, we should achieve lower targets and get there faster in younger patients while we should aim for safer targets and achieve them more slowly in older patients.

Advanced microvascular complications are difficult to reverse and, by implication, the same is true of established macrovascular disease. Therefore, patients with major micro- and macrovascular complications should not be given strict HbA1c targets. However, in patients with background retinopathy, irrespective of other vascular disease, progression of retinopathy can be limited by controlling HbA1c so, in these patients, a strict HbA1c target could be beneficial. Less strict HbA1c goals can be considered for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, advanced complications, co-morbid diseases and when life expectancy is limited. When it is difficult to achieve targets, despite intensive efforts, it is important to modify the treatment goals, remembering that the risk of complications with increasing HbA1c is exponential, so that a 1% reduction of HbA1c from 10.0 to 9.0% (84 to 75 mmol/mol) should be more effective than an HbA1c reduction from 8.0 to 7.0% (64 to 53 mmol/mol). Taking all these factors into account, it is important to analyze comorbidities in individual patients in order to determine the optimum HbA1c target levels.

Appropriate therapy

As is the case for targets of therapy, so the best drug treatment will vary between patients.

### Individualizing glycemic targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus: implications of recent clinical trials [^1171Uhw4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

One of the first steps in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is setting glycemic goals. Professional organizations advise setting specific hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) targets for patients, and individualization of these goals has more recently been emphasized. However, the operational meaning of glycemic goals, and specific methods for individualizing them, have not been well-described. Choosing a specific HbA(1c) target range for a given patient requires taking several factors into consideration, including an assessment of the patient's risk for hyperglycemia-related complications versus the risks of therapy, all in the context of the overall clinical setting. Comorbid conditions, psychological status, capacity for self-care, economic considerations, and family and social support systems also play a key role in the intensity of therapy. The individualization of HbA(1c) targets has gained more traction after recent clinical trials in older patients with established type 2 diabetes mellitus failed to show a benefit from intensive glucose-lowering therapy on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. The limited available evidence suggests that near-normal glycemic targets should be the standard for younger patients with relatively recent onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and little or no micro- or macrovascular complications, with the aim of preventing complications over the many years of life. However, somewhat higher targets should be considered for older patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and evidence of CVD (or multiple CVD risk factors). This review explores these issues further and proposes a framework for considering an appropriate and safe HbA(1c) target range for each patient.

### Development and evaluation of a patient-centered quality indicator for the appropriateness of type 2 diabetes management [^117WnHBY]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Lowering blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes can reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications but may necessitate polypharmacy and lead to adverse events, including hypoglycemia. Patients who are clinically complex and/or require multiple glucose-lowering agents or insulin to attain desired glycemic targets are most likely to experience hypoglycemia. Clinical practice guidelines advise individualizing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets and glucose-lowering regimens to balance the anticipated benefits of lowering HbA1c with the potential harms. However, current diabetes quality measures used for population health management, public reporting, and pay-for-performance reimbursement are not designed to evaluate this balance. Instead, they consist of dichotomous thresholds of glycemic control, most often < 8%, uniformly applied to nearly all adults aged 18–75 years, irrespective of the patient's clinical complexity, risk for hypoglycemia, and required intensity of glucose-lowering therapy. This approach is not aligned with the goal of delivering high-quality, patient-centered care, and may contribute to the risk/treatment paradox seen in contemporary clinical practice, whereby younger, healthier patients commonly undertreated while older, more clinically complex patients are overtreated. As such, there is an urgent need to align the anticipated benefits and harms of treatment with the therapeutic goals pursued by a given patient.

Uniform, dichotomous measures of diabetes control are ill suited to evaluate the individual-level quality and safety of diabetes care. They may miss undertreatment of younger, healthier adults with diabetes who may be harmed by long-term exposure to hyperglycemia (including HbA1c 7%–8%). They may also miss overtreatment of older, clinically complex, or already intensively treated patients, for whom achieving HbA1 c < 8% may not be possible without substantial hypoglycemia risk and may not yield meaningful improvements in health outcomes. Recognizing the need to support individualized glycemic targets, Pogach and colleagues introduced an out-of-range glycemic control measure for older adults with diabetes (aged ≥ 65 years) who have serious comorbid health conditions. While this measure addresses concerns about overtreatment of older and clinically complex adults, it does not tackle the potential overtreatment of younger clinically complex adults, nor does it address the potential undertreatment of older or younger adults.

Treatment Targets

General Considerations

Hyperglycemia defines diabetes and is directly related to the incidence of complications. Therefore, glycemic control is fundamental to diabetes management. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a prospective randomized controlled study comparing intensive versus standard glycemic control in patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes relatively recently. The DCCT demonstrated that achieving an A1C of < 7% reduced the incidence of microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes compared with standard control, which achieved an A1C of ∼9% during the period of the randomized trial. The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study was a follow-up of the DCCT cohorts. The EDIC study remarkably demonstrated persistent microvascular and cardiovascular benefits in subjects who had previously received intensive treatment, even though their glycemic control had deteriorated over time.

While A1C and blood glucose targets are needed, the ADA emphasizes that glycemic targets should be individualized with the goal of achieving the best possible control while minimizing the risk of severe hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (Table 7). Goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations. More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients. Postprandial glucose may be targeted if A1C goals are not met despite reaching preprandial glucose goals.

Importance

There is substantial uncertainty about optimal glycemic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Observations

Four large randomized clinical trials (RCTs), ranging in size from 1791 to 11,440 patients, provide the majority of the evidence used to guide diabetes therapy. Most RCTs of intensive vs standard glycemic control excluded adults older than 80 years, used surrogate end points to evaluate microvascular outcomes and provided limited data on which subgroups are most likely to benefit or be harmed by specific therapies. Available data from randomized clinical trials suggest that intensive glycemic control does not reduce major macrovascular events in older adults for at least 10 years. Furthermore, intensive glycemic control does not lead to improved patient-centered microvascular outcomes for at least 8 years. Data from randomized clinical trials consistently suggest that intensive glycemic control immediately increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia 1.5- to 3-fold. Based on these data and observational studies, for the majority of adults older than 65 years, the harms associated with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target lower than 7.5% or higher than 9% are likely to outweigh the benefits. However, the optimal target depends on patient factors, medications used to reach the target, life expectancy, and patient preferences about treatment. If only medications with low treatment burden and hypoglycemia risk (such as metformin) are required, a lower HbA1c target may be appropriate. If patients strongly prefer to avoid injections or frequent fingerstick monitoring, a higher HbA1c target that obviates the need for insulin may be appropriate.

Conclusions and Relevance

High-quality evidence about glycemic treatment in older adults is lacking. Optimal decisions need to be made collaboratively with patients, incorporating the likelihood of benefits and harms and patient preferences about treatment and treatment burden. For the majority of older adults, an HbA1c target between 7.5% and 9% will maximize benefits and minimize harms.

Glycemic management — HbA1c targets in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are described as uncertain regarding which patient characteristics would yield greater benefits than harms with lower target ranges, though there are valid reasons to speculate greater net benefit in younger, newly diagnosed patients with minimal or no T2DM complications, longer life expectancy, or low hypoglycemia risk medications. Trial design, conduct, and demographic limitations hinder definitive conclusions for specific subgroups, and additional research is needed to determine whether particular subsets achieve a favorable balance of benefits and harms by targeting lower HbA1c ranges.

### American Geriatrics Society identifies five things that healthcare providers and patients should question [^116Mo8cY]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Glycemic control in older adults with diabetes mellitus — AGS Choosing Wisely recommendation and evidence — states: Avoid using medications to achieve hemoglobin A1c < 7.5% in most older adults age 65 and older; moderate control is generally better. In this population, burden is high (In 2012, 26.9% of United States residents aged 65 and older had diabetes mellitus), and the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target of less than 7.0% is described as inappropriate for older adults because they risk greater harm and the potential benefits are less likely. Because it takes 10 to 19 years before the benefits of more-intensive glycemic control are seen, older adults may not realize those benefits. The ADVANCE trial focused on older adults (mean age 66); at 5 years, intensive control (HbA1c 6.5% (vs) 7.3%) led to decreases in macroalbuminuria (2.9% (vs) 4.1%), but there were no differences in myocardial infarction, major cardiovascular events, retinopathy, neuropathy, or all-cause mortality. The two other large trials of glycemic control also found no improvement in outcomes with intensive glycemic control; in the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (mean age 60), intensive glycemic control (HbA1c 6.9% (vs) 8.1%) resulted in lower rates of progression of nephropathy but with no differences in major cardiovascular outcomes or all-cause mortality. Notably, the four large randomized trials have revealed two major potential harms of more-intensive glycemic control — hypoglycemia and greater mortality — and in ADVANCE severe hypoglycemia was noted in 2.7% of the intensive control group.

### Initial glycemic control and care among younger adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^114Jekah]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing among adults under age 45. Onset of type 2 diabetes at a younger age increases an individual's risk for diabetes-related complications. Given the lasting benefits conferred by early glycemic control, we compared glycemic control and initial care between adults with younger onset (21–44 years) and mid-age onset (45–64 years) of type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Using data from a large, integrated health care system, we identified 32,137 adults (aged 21–64 years) with incident diabetes (first HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% [≥ 48 mmol/mol]). We excluded anyone with evidence of prior type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, or type 1 diabetes. We used generalized linear mixed models, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, to examine differences in glycemic control and care at 1 year.

Results

Of identified individuals, 26.4% had younger-onset and 73.6% had mid-age-onset type 2 diabetes. Adults with younger onset had higher initial mean HbA 1c values (8.9% [74 mmol/mol]) than adults with onset in mid-age (8.4% [68 mmol/mol]) (P < 0.0001) and lower odds of achieving an HbA 1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) 1 year after the diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.70 [95% CI 0.66–0.74]), even after accounting for HbA 1c at diagnosis. Adults with younger onset had lower odds of in-person primary care contact (aOR 0.82 [95% CI 0.76–0.89]) than those with onset during mid-age, but they did not differ in telephone contact (1.05 [0.99–1.10]). Adults with younger onset had higher odds of starting metformin (aOR 1.20 [95% CI 1.12–1.29]) but lower odds of adhering to that medication (0.74 [0.69–0.80]).

Conclusions

Adults with onset of type 2 diabetes at a younger age were less likely to achieve glycemic control at 1 year following diagnosis, suggesting the need for tailored care approaches to improve outcomes for this high-risk patient population.

Recommendations

Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes, and, if achieved soon after the diagnosis of diabetes, is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease. Therefore, a reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults with type 1 diabetes is < 7%. (B)
Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals (such as < 6.5%) for select individual patients, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Appropriate patients might include those with a short duration of diabetes, a long life expectancy, hypoglycemia awareness, and no significant CVD. (C)
Less stringent A1C goals (such as < 8.5%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular/macrovascular complications, or extensive comorbid conditions. (B)
Glycemic control for those of any age with type 1 diabetes should be assessed based on frequent SMBG levels (and CGM data, if available) in addition to A1C in order to direct changes in therapy. (B)

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus — glycemic management: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest using high glycemic variability over time (e.g., fluctuation in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose) as a prognostic indicator for risk of hypoglycemia, morbidity, and mortality. We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy. We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved. In insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not achieving glycemic goals, we suggest real-time continuous glucose monitoring to decrease hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c.

Table B-1 — HbA1c target ranges by major comorbidity or physiologic age and microvascular complications are stratified by life expectancy. For Absent (> 10–15 years of life expectancy), targets are 6.0–7.0% when microvascular complications are Absent or Mild, 7.0–8.0% when Moderate, and 7.5–8.5% when Advanced. For Present (5–10 years of life expectancy), targets are 7.0–8.0% (Absent or Mild), 7.5–8.5% (Moderate), and 7.5–8.5% (Advanced). For Marked (< 5 years of life expectancy), targets are 8.0–9.0% across Absent or Mild, Moderate, and Advanced.

Shared decision-making example — older adult with type 1 diabetes (T1D): Mrs. Jones is a 72-year-old woman with T1D who has had diabetes for 40 years and hypertension on two agents with SBP between 132 and 140, with stage 3 CKD with a GFR of 42. Her HbA1c has been between 6.2 and 6.9 for the last 10 years, and she uses long-acting basal insulin and rapid-acting insulin up to five times daily. From her glucometer, her lowest glucose is 62 mg/dL in the fasting state and otherwise her fasting mean glucose is 128 mg/dL; she reports feeling "fuzzy" and "clumsy" when her glucose is > 200 mg/dL. As part of SDM, she agreed to wear a continuous glucose monitor for up to 10 days, and both parties agreed to focus on the glucose ranges rather than HbA1c with a glucose range of fasting, 100 to 150 mg/dL, and bedtime, 150 to 180 mg/dL, while avoiding glucose levels > 200 mg/dL as much as possible.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111MTZ6f]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with diabetes — treatment goals and risk-factor management are stratified by health status. 13.8A states that those who are otherwise healthy with few and stable coexisting chronic illnesses and intact cognitive and functional status should have lower glycemic goals (such as A1C < 7.0–7.5% [< 53–58 mmol/mol] and/or time in range [TIR] 70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10.0 mmol/L] of ~70% and time below range ≤ 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L] of < 4%) if CGM is used. C 13.8B notes that for intermediate or complex health, selection of glycemic goals should be individualized and should prioritize avoidance of hypoglycemia, with less stringent goals (such as A1C < 8.0% [< 64 mmol/mol] and/or time in range < 70% and time below range < 1%) for those with significant cognitive and/or functional limitations, frailty, severe comorbidities, and a less favorable risk-to-benefit ratio of diabetes medications. C 13.8C advises that older adults with very complex or poor health receive minimal benefit from stringent glycemic goals and that clinicians should focus on avoiding hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia rather than achieving stringent glycemic goals. C 13.9 states that screening for diabetes complications should be individualized in older adults, with attention to complications that would lead to impairment of functional status or quality of life. C 13.10 indicates that treatment of hypertension in older adults with diabetes to individualized blood pressure goals is indicated in most older adults with diabetes. B 13.11 adds that treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors should be individualized considering the time frame of benefit.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^112ncrVR]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 2
A: Change in A1C levels in adults with type 2 diabetes within 3–12 months after initiation of a new diabetes therapy. Of the 15,125 patients starting a new regimen, 81% (12,215) maintained their new therapy regimen without further change throughout the 3- to 12-month postinitiation observation window, without achieving target levels. Adapted from Karter et al. B: Effect of community care vs. university care and standard "usual care" vs. treatment algorithm–driven therapy on A1C. Adapted from Fanning et al.

Poor glycemic management and the ensuing departure from A1C target levels are often attributed in part to clinical inertia and perhaps inappropriate individualization of glycemic targets. Although most people with type 2 diabetes will need insulin therapy to maintain A1C < 7.0% 9 years after diagnosis, there is substantial resistance to its introduction, both from patients and physicians. In many cases, the lag in insulin initiation can present a challenging hurdle, especially when insulin becomes the next treatment option. Choice of treatment is also often influenced by patient characteristics. In a cohort of 253,238 subjects, physicians were more likely to initiate therapy modifications in response to poor control if the patient had higher baseline risk factor values and a history of coronary artery disease or end organ damage and were less likely to do so if the patient was of a minority group. Both appear to be inappropriate individualization. Similarly, hypertension, patient adherence, age, weight, sex (female), and duration of diabetes increased the odds of therapy intensification.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^111E5Wj2]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Data supporting individualization of targets. A: In nearly 50,000 people with diabetes in regular care in New Zealand, 50% were already achieving A1C < 7.1% and 25% were achieving A1C < 6.4%, suggesting that even current target levels are easily achieved in a high percentage of the treated population without special effort. B: In both arms of the ACCORD study, the range of A1C achieved around the mean was large, with over 50% of people outside an interquartile range of 1.1%. Because these study participants were under active management, this suggests that individuals can only achieve very different personal targets.

At the other end of the scale, clinicians are equally familiar with individuals who, for lifestyle reasons or problems with insulin therapy, find it difficult to achieve conventional target levels. Incidence of hypoglycemia or fear of hypoglycemia is often a factor here, although other factors such as fear of weight gain are a factor for some. This reason for individualization has recently gained further attention because of the concerns arising from the results of the glycemic intervention in ACCORD. This large study was of people at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease, being a mean of 62 years old, duration of diabetes of 10 years, and 35% known CV disease at baseline. The intensive strategy aiming for an A1C of < 6.0% caused the study to be stopped prematurely after a median duration of 3.5 years because of a 22% higher mortality in this group, although the primary composite end point of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke was a nonsignificant 10% lower. It was feared by many that the increased mortality was a result of A1C levels being driven "too low" or "too quickly" and/or the result of an about threefold increase in the risk for major hypoglycemia. The risk for mortality appeared to be greater with a prior history of CV event(s) or baseline A1C > 8.0% (both not statistically significant), whereas a significantly reduced primary CV outcome was found in individuals with no history of a CV event and baseline A1C ≤ 8.0% (uncorrected P = 0.04 and 0.03).

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a global public health burden, with type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounting for roughly 90% of all cases. This corresponds to approximately 537 million adults globally in 2021, and the number is projected to increase to 643 million by 2030 and to 784 million by 2045. In addition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 90% of individuals with T2D in the United States are also overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m²) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). This shows that overweight and obesity are almost invariably associated with T2D.

Glycaemic control represents the primary target for people with T2D, regardless of the individual's body weight. Recent guideline recommendations suggest a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) as a glycaemic target for the majority of adults without significant hypoglycaemia. However, glycaemic treatment goals should be individualized based on patient preferences and goals, risk of adverse effects of therapy (e.g. hypoglycaemia and weight gain) and patient characteristics, including frailty and comorbidities. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), more stringent HbA1c targets may be recommended if they can be achieved safely and with acceptable burden of therapy, and less stringent targets (e.g. up to 8% [64 mmol/mol]) may be adequate for patients with limited life expectancy or in cases where the harms of treatment outweigh the potential benefits. Similarly, the shared European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelinesupports individualized HbA1c targets, with HbA1c targets of 6.0%–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol) in younger patients with a short diabetes duration and no evidence of cardiovascular disease, if achieved without significant hypoglycaemia. Less‐stringent HbA1c goals of up to 9% (75 mmol/mol) may be appropriate for elderly patients with long‐standing diabetes, limited life expectancy and frailty with multiple comorbidities.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required (1) between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required and level of commitment to the treatment. Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein-in terms of their convenience of measurement, usefulness and relevance to the physician and patient are also evaluated. When prioritising the variables to be measured it is suggested that where feasible, HbA(1c) should be the standard measurement by which to gauge risk and treatment efficacy. Serial measurements should be made and, where possible, the use of blood glucose meters encouraged, in order to obtain a blood glucose profile for the patient.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) glycemic targets — We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved (Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended). We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of T2DM, comorbidities, and life expectancy. The discussion notes intensive control as targets such as HbA1c < 7.0%. Supporting evidence cited includes a Cochran review of 20 trials (n = 29,986) reporting no significant difference between intensive and conventional glucose control for all-cause mortality but reduced risk of amputation and microvascular diseases in the intensive treatment arm, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

### Care delivery in youth with type 2 diabetes-are we meeting clinical practice guidelines? [^113rQt7L]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Studies indicate high rates of treatment failure and early onset diabetes-related complications in youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aim to describe the quality of care provided to children and youth with T2D.

Methods

This prospective cohort study used administrative datasets to describe individuals aged 10-24yr diagnosed with T2D at < 20yr of age (488 individuals; 2111 person-years). The primary outcome was being 'at goal' for adherence to Canadian clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). This was defined as having either optimal [three diabetes-related physician visits/year, three hemoglobin A1C (A1C) tests/year, and all recommended screening tests for complications (i.e., retinopathy, nephropathy)] or good (two diabetes-related physician visits/year, two A1C tests/year, and at least two screening tests) adherence to CPGs. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling were used.

Results

Sixty eight percentage person-years had poor adherence to CPGs (< 2 physician visits and A1c tests/year and no screening tests). Only 29% and 25% were at goal for adherence in the 15–19 and 20-24yr age groups, respectively. There was a 52% decreased odds of being at goal for adherence 4yr after diagnosis of T2D (p < 0.001). For every year increase in age at diagnosis, there was a 5% decreased odds of being at goal (p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Youth with T2D are not receiving high quality care, and older youth and young adults are particularly at risk. Future research is needed to understand the effectiveness of care in the context of poor adherence as well as patient, physician, and health system factors that might improve adherence.
