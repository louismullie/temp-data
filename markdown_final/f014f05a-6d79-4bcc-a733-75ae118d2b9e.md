## Question

Notes
A 92-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, arthritis, asthma, mild dementia, and a BMI of 26 presents with progressive shortness of breath. Six months ago, she was able to walk one mile daily; now, because of the dyspnea, she has cut back her daily walk to 0.25 miles and avoids stairs. A recent evaluation found progression of the aortic stenosis to be the most likely cause of her dyspnea.
The patient is accompanied today by her grandson, who asks whether she would be a good candidate for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. She resides at an assisted living facility, where she is independent with her activities of daily living (such as bathing, dressing, and toileting) but requires assistance with all instrumental activities of daily living. She is unable to perform a chair stand in the office and walks at a gait speed of 0.6 m/sec with a walker.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which patient factor(s) most determine whether a 92-year-old woman with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis should undergo TAVR — given options like frailty, age, sex, residence, and BMI — and what the decision pathway should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the indication for aortic valve replacement and whether her dyspnea is attributable to severe AS. Then, I should verify surgical risk and whether TAVR is favored over SAVR in this age group. Next, I will assess frailty and disability using validated tools and thresholds. After that, I need to evaluate cognitive status and life expectancy to consider futility. Then, I should review guideline-based risk categories and the role of the Heart Team. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline alternatives, including palliative options and prehabilitation, with explicit shared decision-making steps.

> Let me first confirm the indication for intervention. Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis with exertional dyspnea and reduced functional capacity is a Class I indication for aortic valve replacement, and the progression from 1 mile to 0.25-mile walks with stair avoidance is consistent with symptomatic deterioration attributable to AS, which is typically progressive and carries poor prognosis without valve replacement, so I should not delay confirming severity and correlating symptoms with hemodynamics before proceeding further [^114PTXvF].

> Wait, let me verify the preferred modality in a 92-year-old. Contemporary guidelines favor transfemoral TAVR over SAVR in older adults at increased surgical risk because of lower invasiveness and comparable or superior outcomes in high-risk cohorts, so TAVR would generally be the default consideration here if anatomy and access are suitable, provided the patient is an appropriate candidate otherwise [^115w5S8e].

> I will now examine frailty and disability, since age alone is insufficient. Her gait speed of 0.6 m/s with a walker is below the 0.83 m/s threshold associated with frailty risk, and inability to perform a chair stand is a red flag for severe physical impairment; additionally, dependence in all instrumental activities of daily living signals disability, and together these features meet criteria for moderate-to-severe frailty by ACC consensus tools that use gait speed, chair stand, and ADL/IADL status to stratify risk and anticipate recovery [^115bKPQA] [^111QBALu] [^116TH8BS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how frailty influences outcomes after TAVR. Multiple datasets show frailty independently predicts higher 1-year mortality and poor functional outcomes, with frail patients experiencing roughly 30–50% rates of death or persistent severe symptoms at 1 year, and even among nonagenarians, frailty correlates with markedly higher 30-day and 2-year mortality, so her baseline frailty materially lowers the likelihood of net benefit despite procedural success [^112y4paE] [^115dvHFg] [^116UDK3w].

> Next, I should review cognition and life expectancy. Mild dementia with MMSE likely below 24 places her at increased risk of delirium, functional decline, and limited recovery; moreover, guidelines advise against TAVR when life expectancy is under 1 year or when the chance of survival with benefit at 2 years is under 25%, and in very elderly, frail patients with cognitive impairment, the probability of meaningful functional recovery is low even if hemodynamics improve, reinforcing the need to weigh futility carefully [^112feCfd] [^112DAWTr] [^111rqJUy].

> Let me consider guideline risk categorization. By ACC pathways integrating STS-PROM, frailty, organ dysfunction, and procedure-specific impediments, she fits high to prohibitive risk due to moderate-to-severe frailty, disability, and advanced age, even if her calculated STS-PROM might appear intermediate; importantly, the ACC/AHA framework explicitly places patients with severe frailty or very limited life expectancy into categories where TAVR may be inappropriate, prompting a palliative care discussion rather than procedural pursuit [^117PjHqm] [^114PDoYC] [^114PTXvF].

> I should double-check the role of the Heart Team and shared decision-making. Decisions in such complex, high-risk older adults should be made via a multidisciplinary Heart Valve Team that includes interventional cardiology, CT surgery, geriatrics, anesthesia, imaging, and nursing, with explicit documentation of goals of care, expected benefits, and burdens; this ensures that the patient's values — often centered on function and independence rather than survival alone — are aligned with the realistic post-TAVR trajectory [^113vsYN7] [^1113ZoYS].

> But wait, what if her limitations are predominantly due to AS rather than irreversible frailty; could a bridge strategy help clarify benefit? Balloon aortic valvuloplasty can be considered as a temporary, low-risk intervention to observe whether functional capacity improves meaningfully over 3–6 months; if she achieves greater than 50-meter improvement on 6-minute walk and gains in independence, that would support proceeding to TAVR, whereas lack of improvement would argue against futile intervention and support a palliative focus [^115C7KGH] [^117XiMQ7].

> I need to ensure we address modifiable contributors and set expectations. Prehabilitation with structured exercise and nutrition can mitigate sarcopenia and frailty in selected patients, and even in nonagenarians, cardiac rehabilitation is feasible and may enhance recovery; however, with established dementia and current inability to perform chair stands, the ceiling for functional gain is limited, so any prehabilitation would be framed as optimization for symptom control and quality of life rather than as a guarantee of post-TAVR independence [^1178bzEy] [^114hsdy1].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I am not overstating futility. Given severe frailty, disability, and mild dementia in a 92-year-old, the likelihood of survival with meaningful functional benefit at 2 years is below 25%, which meets guideline thresholds for futility; therefore, she is not a good candidate for TAVR, and the recommended course is a palliative care-centered plan emphasizing symptom control, advance care planning, and consideration of valvuloplasty only as a bridge-to-decision if aligned with goals, with explicit documentation of shared decision-making with the patient and family [^112DAWTr] [^114PTXvF] [^111rqJUy].

---

This 92-year-old woman with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis is a **borderline TAVR candidate** [^114PTXvF] because of her advanced age, frailty, and cognitive impairment, which increase procedural risk and limit functional recovery [^112y4paE] [^112CaiLr]. TAVR may still be reasonable if the heart team confirms severe symptomatic AS, suitable anatomy, and a life expectancy > 1 year [^114PTXvF], and if the patient and family accept the risks and prioritize symptom relief over longevity. If the team finds prohibitive risk or limited benefit, palliative care or balloon valvuloplasty should be considered [^111YNwDe] [^115C7KGH].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend TAVR for patients with severe symptomatic AS who are high or prohibitive surgical risk, provided life expectancy exceeds 1 year and there is a reasonable chance of benefit [^114PTXvF] [^112DAWTr]. For nonagenarians, **individualized assessment** is essential, integrating frailty, cognition, and comorbidities [^115C7KGH].

---

## Frailty assessment and its impact on outcomes

Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes after TAVR, including higher mortality, complications, and functional decline [^112y4paE] [^116UDK3w]. Common tools include gait speed, chair stand, grip strength, serum albumin, and ADLs [^112y4paE] [^116FBcv5]. This patient shows **moderate-to-severe frailty** (gait speed 0.6 m/s, inability to perform chair stand, IADL dependence), which increases risk of poor functional recovery and mortality [^113stBZt] [^116vutQZ].

---

## Age-related considerations

Advanced age alone is not a contraindication to TAVR, but it increases risks of perioperative complications, cognitive decline, and limited functional recovery [^112DAWTr]. Nonagenarians can benefit from TAVR, but outcomes are highly dependent on baseline frailty and comorbidities [^116TfN4v] [^113c2FAB].

---

## Comorbidities and their impact on TAVR candidacy

The patient's comorbidities — coronary artery disease, hypertension, arthritis, asthma, and mild dementia — **increase procedural risk and may limit benefit** [^113gfFXo]. Coronary disease may require PCI, and dementia increases delirium and functional decline risk [^112CaiLr].

---

## Functional status and quality of life considerations

Functional status and quality of life are critical in older adults [^116vutQZ]. TAVR can improve symptoms and quality of life, but frailty and cognitive impairment reduce the likelihood of meaningful recovery [^115cE2M9]. The patient's current limitations suggest **limited potential for improvement** [^113UyLFe].

---

## Procedural risks and benefits

TAVR offers less invasive symptom relief and improved survival versus medical therapy in high-risk patients [^1162uXey], but in nonagenarians with frailty and cognitive impairment, **risks of complications, delirium, and limited functional gain are higher** [^115C7KGH] [^114ZFtWQ] [^113FUQQN] [^112CaiLr].

---

## Alternative treatment options

If TAVR is deemed too risky, **alternatives include**:

- **Medical management**: Diuretics, beta-blockers, and close follow-up [^notfound].
- **Balloon aortic valvuloplasty**: Palliative or bridge to decision [^111YNwDe] [^115C7KGH].
- **Palliative care**: Focus on symptom control and quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary heart team evaluation

A heart team (cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, anesthesia, geriatrics, imaging) should **assess anatomy, frailty, cognition, and comorbidities** to guide shared decision-making [^113vsYN7] [^1113ZoYS].

---

## Patient preferences and shared decision-making

Given the patient's cognitive impairment, the family should engage in shared decision-making to align treatment with her values and goals, emphasizing symptom relief and quality of life [^113vsYN7] [^116tEQcN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

This patient is a **borderline TAVR candidate** due to age, frailty, and cognitive impairment. TAVR may be considered if the heart team confirms severe symptomatic AS, suitable anatomy, and a life expectancy > 1 year, and if the family accepts the risks and prioritizes symptom relief. If the team finds prohibitive risk or limited benefit, palliative care or balloon valvuloplasty should be considered [^114PTXvF] [^111YNwDe].

1 INTRODUCTION

Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common form of acquired valvular heart disease in older adults. 1 The pathophysiology of calcific AS is closely connected to the aging process; with inflammaging, calcification, and repetitive mechanical stress being among the driving mechanisms. 2 An estimated 17% of nonagenarians will develop at least mild AS over the course of their lifetime. 3 By 2050, the number of nonagenarians is expected to quadruple to > 8 million in the United States, 4 and given that there is no proven therapy for the prevention of AS, the number of "oldest old" patients suffering from this disease is expected to mirror the demographic population trends and rise exponentially. When AS becomes severe it is often associated with debilitating symptoms, reduced functional capacity, hospitalizations, and heart failure eventually leading to death. Prognosis is poor in the absence of aortic valve replacement, and historically nonagenarians were excluded from this surgery due to the higher procedural risks and lower perceived benefits.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a therapeutic option for severe symptomatic AS in patients at high surgical risk 5, 6 as well as intermediate and low surgical risk. 7, 8, 9 Nonagenarians were not excluded from this procedure, to the contrary, initial TAVR trials targeted patients that were deemed too old or frail to undergo surgery. Early experiences indicated that these patients could undergo the minimally invasive TAVR procedure with acceptable risk. Since that time, the number of TAVRs performed in nonagenarians has progressively increased, accounting for one out of seven TAVR procedures in the United States between 2011 and 2014. 10 As nonagenarians are increasingly referred for consideration of TAVR, clinicians are tasked to identify the "good 90‐year‐old" who will likely tolerate the procedure and derive meaningful benefits — a forecast that is imperfect but informed by objectifiable features. The goal of this article is to review the literature on TAVR in nonagenarians and to provide guidance for individualized patient‐centered decision making.

Abstract

As the population ages, clinicians will encounter a growing number of nonagenarians suffering from severe aortic stenosis who may be candidates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). By virtue of a healthy survivor effect or a referral bias, these patients may paradoxically have greater resilience and fewer comorbidities than their octogenarian counterparts. They tend to, on average, tolerate the TAVR procedure quite well with low in‐hospital and 1‐year mortality rates of 5.5% and 23%, respectively. Appropriate patient selection should consider individualized estimates of procedural risk, potential for functional recovery and for improved quantity and quality of life. Frailty is much more revealing than chronological age, and it can be measured by brief tools such as the Essential Frailty Toolset. Ultimately, the process of shared decision‐making is paramount to ensure that the course of action is patient‐centered and balances the procedure's expected risks and benefits with the nonagenarian's preferences and values.

### Is transcatheter aortic valve replacement becoming the standard of care in octogenarians? [^112gg55Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Where Are We Going?

As a general trend, when evaluating patient risk, age is becoming the most frequent reason to consider TAVR instead of SAVR. After age, frailty is the second most important reason to select the less invasive treatment. 6 However, at a country or center level, the translation of this large consensus into clinical practice still remains heterogeneous. With the expected results of low‐risk TAVR randomized trials in the next few months, the continued technological improvements, and the demographic projections, there is no doubt that TAVR will rapidly and universally become standard of care in octogenarians with severe aortic stenosis.

Overall procedural risk — risk categories for adults with aortic stenosis (AS) being evaluated for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are defined as follows: Low risk requires STS-PROM < 4% with no frailty, no comorbidity, and no procedure specific impediments. Intermediate risk is STS-PROM 4%-8% or mild frailty or 1 major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively or a possible procedure-specific impediment. High risk is STS-PROM > 8% or moderate-severe frailty or ≥ 2 major organ system compromises not to be improved postoperatively or a possible procedure-specific impediment. Prohibitive risk includes PROMM > 50% at 1 year or ≥ 3 major organ system compromises not to be improved postoperatively or severe frailty or severe procedure-specific impediments.

### Futility, benefit, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111rqJUy]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a transformative innovation that provides treatment for high or prohibitive surgical risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who either were previously not referred for or were denied operative intervention. Trials have demonstrated improvements in survival and symptoms after TAVR versus medical therapy; however, there remains a sizable group of patients who die or lack improvement in quality of life soon after TAVR. This raises important questions about the need to identify and acknowledge the possibility of futility in some patients considered for TAVR. In this very elderly population, a number of factors in addition to traditional risk stratification need to be considered including multimorbidity, disability, frailty, and cognition in order to assess the anticipated benefit of TAVR. Consideration by a multidisciplinary heart valve team with broad areas of expertise is critical for assessing likely benefit from TAVR. Moreover, these complicated decisions should take place with clear communication around desired health outcomes on behalf of the patient and provider. The decision that treatment with TAVR is futile should include alternative plans to optimize the patient's health state or, in some cases, discussions related to end-of-life care. We review issues to be considered when making and communicating these difficult decisions.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) evaluation — frailty and disability: Assessment should start with screening for independence, cognition, and slow walking speed using gait speed — 3 timed trials over a 5-m distance. Patients with gait speed > 0.83 m/s and preserved cognition and independence are likely not frail, whereas those with gait speed < 0.5 m/s or gait speed < 0.83 m/s with disability or cognitive impairment require further evaluation. Nutritional deficiency thresholds are body mass index < 21 kg/m² or albumin < 3.5 g/dL; risk for malnutrition is score ≤ 11 on Mini Nutritional Assessment, and weight loss defined as > 10 lb decline in 1 year adds information. The patient can be classified as not frail, prefrail, or frail based on tests performed.

Aortic stenosis (AS) risk categories for TAVR candidates — individual patient risk assessment combines the STS risk estimate, frailty, major organ system dysfunction, and procedure-specific impediments. The STS risk score predicts 30-day SAVR risk and serves as a starting point, with three STS strata: < 4% (low risk), 4% to 8% (intermediate risk), and > 8% (high risk). The AHA/ACC scheme classifies severe AS into 4 global risk categories: Low risk (STS < 4% with no frailty, no comorbidity, and no procedure-specific impediments), Intermediate risk (STS 4% to 8% with no more than mild frailty or 1 major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively, and minimal procedure-specific impediments), High risk (STS > 8%, or moderate-severe frailty, no more than 2 major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively, or a possible procedure-specific impediment), and Prohibitive risk (preoperative risk of mortality and morbidity > 50% at 1 year, ≥ 3 major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively, severe frailty, or severe procedure-specific impediments).

### Comparative utility of frailty to a general prognostic score in identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement [^116e2TaR]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is a disease disproportionately affecting older adults, expected to increase in incidence with the aging population. Historically, the standard of care for this population has been surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), however, contemporary transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now an option for patients with severe aortic stenosis, who have historically not been surgical candidates and thus had no interventional options. More recently, the approval of TAVR for low-risk patients has augmented procedural volumes among healthier patients. Despite a dynamic risk-profile of the average TAVR candidate, there remain considerable challenges in determining procedural candidacy among the complex and multimorbid patients to whom this intervention was first offered. The anticipated increase in procedural volumes prompt novel considerations in defining procedural candidacy and person-centered outcomes for high-risk individuals.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines emphasize primary care provider roles to recognize, investigate, and appropriately refer for management of valvular heart disease. In doing so, consideration of life-expectancy is recommended as part of evaluation for TAVR, to help determine futility. Prognostic indices for mortality prediction have been developed and applied in the general older adult population. However, the developmental cohorts differ from the population of TAVR candidates with respect to age, comorbidities, and functional status. For example, the Lee index, a well validated and widely adopted 4–10 year prognostic index for mortality was validated among community-dwelling individuals with a median age of less than 70-years. Additionally prognostic indices incorporate demographic factors such as age and sex, and these are typically heavily weighted, which may limit discriminative ability in the oldest old populations. Lastly, prognostic indices to estimate mortality generally do not account for frailty, a state of diminished physiologic reserve, known to confer heightened vulnerability to adverse events in the setting of cardiac surgery. In fact, current literature for TAVR evaluation supports risk stratification by integrating markers of frailty including gait speed and chair stands, or comprehensive geriatric assessment. Nonetheless, adoption of frailty measurements remains low in this setting; the ACC-TAVR risk score does not consider any of the frailty markers.

Patients with inoperable, high-risk, and intermediate-risk aortic stenosis can now be treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration selectively choose centers based on experience and require a collaborative, multidisciplinary team approach in the treatment and decision making for these patients. The work-up has been streamlined. Gated multislice computed tomography angiogram has emerged as the gold standard for assessment of valve anatomy and sizing of the transcatheter heart valve. Assessment of risk has evolved to include a more comprehensive functional and frailty evaluation. Long term-results are needed before the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement into the low-risk category.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) evaluation — physical functioning: The 6-min walk test should be utilized to assess physical functioning and endurance, providing predictive information on likely benefit, long-term mortality, and functional outcomes after TAVR; independence in basic activities of daily living informs baseline function and postprocedural care needs, and these tests are ideally performed in an outpatient setting because results may differ for inpatients.

### Evaluation of changes in functional status in the year after aortic valve replacement [^116vutQZ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Functional status is a patient-centered outcome that is important for a meaningful gain in health-related quality of life after aortic valve replacement.

Objective

To determine functional status trajectories in the year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective cohort study with a 12-month follow-up was conducted at a single academic center in 246 patients undergoing TAVR or SAVR for severe aortic stenosis. The study was conducted between February 1, 2014, and June 30, 2017; data analysis was performed from December 27, 2017, to May 7, 2018.

Exposures

Preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed and a deficit-accumulation frailty index (CGA-FI) (range, 0–1; higher values indicate greater frailty) was calculated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Telephone interviews were conducted to assess self-reported ability to perform 22 activities and physical tasks at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the procedure.

Results

Of the 246 patients included in the study, 143 underwent TAVR (74 [51.7%] women; mean [SD] age, 84.2 [5.9] years), and 103 underwent SAVR (46 [44.7%] women; age, 78.1 [5.3] years). Five trajectories were identified based on functional status at baseline and during the follow-up: from excellent at baseline to improvement at follow-up (excellent baseline-improvement), good (high baseline-full recovery), fair (moderate baseline-minimal decline), poor (low baseline-moderate decline), and very poor (low baseline-large decline). After TAVR, the most common trajectory was fair (54 [37.8%]), followed by good (33 [23.1%]), poor (21 [14.7%]), excellent (20 [14.0%]), and very poor (12 [8.4%]) trajectories. After SAVR, the most common trajectory was good (39 [37.9%]), followed by excellent (38 [36.9%]), fair (20 [19.4%]), poor (3 [2.9%]), and very poor (1 [1.0%]) trajectories. Preoperative frailty level was associated with lower probability of functional improvement and greater probability of functional decline. After TAVR, patients with CGA-FI level of 0.20 or lower had excellent (3 [50.0%]) or good (3 [50.0%]) trajectories, whereas most patients with CGA-FI level of 0.51 or higher had poor (10 [45.5%]) or very poor (5 [22.7%]) trajectories. After SAVR, most patients with CGA-FI level of 0.20 or lower had excellent (24 [58.5%]) or good (15 [36.6%]) trajectories compared with a fair trajectory (5 [71.4%]) in those with CGA-FI levels of 0.41 to 0.50. Postoperative delirium and major complications were associated with functional decline after TAVR (delirium present vs absent: 14 [50.0%] vs 11 [13.4%]; complications present vs absent: 14 [51.9%] vs 19 [16.4%]) or lack of improvement after SAVR (delirium present vs absent: 27 [69.2%] vs 31 [81.6%]; complications present vs absent: 10 [62.5%] vs 69 [79.3%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that functional decline or lack of improvement is common in older adults with severe frailty undergoing TAVR or SAVR. Although this nonrandomized study does not allow comparison of the effectiveness between TAVR and SAVR, anticipated functional trajectories may inform patient-centered decision making and perioperative care to optimize functional outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

TAVR decision pathway outline — patients with severe AS with indication for AVR are identified as a potential TAVR candidate, after which a Heart Valve Team is engaged, including cardiology valve and imaging experts, interventional cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, anesthesia, and valve clinic coordination. Patient selection and evaluation include shared decision making goals of care; clinical information (major CV comorbidities, major non-CV comorbidities, risk score assessment); functional assessment (frailty, physical and cognitive function); and risk categories (low risk, intermediate risk, high or extreme risk). Pre-TAVR cardiovascular imaging includes echocardiography to assess aortic valve anatomy, confirm AS severity, LV function, and MR, AR, PAP, RV function, and TAVR protocol computed tomography angiography (CTA) for vascular access, annular sizing, aortic root anatomy, and interventional planning. The TAVR procedure covers preplanning (valve choice and access options, anesthesia and procedure location, anticipated complication management) and procedural details (vascular access and closure, valve delivery and deployment, postdeployment evaluation, management of complications). Echocardiography (TEE or TTE) is used for annular sizing, valve placement, paravalvular leak assessment, and procedural complications. Post-TAVR management includes early postprocedure monitoring and pain management, early mobilization and discharge planning, and monitoring for conduction abnormalities; long-term management includes antithrombotic therapy and endocarditis prophylaxis, management of concurrent cardiac disease, and evaluation of post-TAVR complications. Post-TAVR imaging calls for echo and ECG post-procedure, at 30 days and then annually, assessing valve function, LV size and function, PA systolic pressure, and cardiac rhythm, with ultimate hand back to Clinical Cardiologist & Primary Care Provider.

### Imaging in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): role of the radiologist [^11188Jh4]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disorder in developed countries, affecting 2–5% of the population over 75 years old. Once symptoms develop, the mortality increases rapidly to approximately 50% within 2 years. The standard of care in treatment of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis remains surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR), which has low peri-operative mortality and improved clinical outcomes. However, high-risk patients often have significant comorbidities such as coronary heart disease, renal insufficiency, lung disease, cerebrovascular disease or frailty that limit their chance of survival. The most commonly used scoring tool to estimate 30-day mortality after cardiac surgery is the Society for Thoracic Surgery Predicted Risk of Mortality score (STS PROM). For the patient population considered unsuitable or at high-risk for sAVR because of underlying comorbidities, the development of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has resulted in an alternative therapy for symptom relief and extension of life.

### The impact of frailty status on survival after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in older adults with severe aortic stenosis: a single-center experience [^113tCAaC]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the impact of frailty in older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for symptomatic aortic stenosis.

Background

Frailty status impacts prognosis in older adults with heart disease; however, the impact of frailty on prognosis after TAVR is unknown.

Methods

Gait speed, grip strength, serum albumin, and activities of daily living status were collected at baseline and used to derive a frailty score among patients who underwent TAVR procedures at a single large-volume institution. The cohort was dichotomized on the basis of median frailty score into frail and not frail groups. The impact of frailty on procedural outcomes (stroke, bleeding, vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and mortality at 30 days) and 1-year mortality was evaluated.

Results

Frailty status was assessed in 159 subjects who underwent TAVR (age 86 ± 8 years, Society of Thoracic Surgery Risk Score 12 ± 4). Baseline frailty score was not associated with conventionally ascertained clinical variables or Society of Thoracic Surgery score. Although high frailty score was associated with a longer post-TAVR hospital stay when compared with lower frailty score (9 ± 6 days vs. 6 ± 5 days, respectively, p = 0.004), there were no significant crude associations between frailty status and procedural outcomes, suggesting adequacy of the standard selection process for identifying patients at risk for periprocedural complications after TAVR. Frailty status was independently associated with increased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 3.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 8.5, p = 0.007) after TAVR.

Conclusions

Frailty was not associated with increased periprocedural complications in patients selected as candidates to undergo TAVR but was associated with increased 1-year mortality after TAVR. Further studies will evaluate the independent value of this frailty composite in older adults with aortic stenosis.

### Frailty and aortic valve disease [^112d33fU]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Frailty is a common occurrence in elderly persons and is present in approximately half of the patients being screened for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) therapy. Accurate assessment of the likelihood of benefit from intervention in the older patient with aortic stenosis is critical with both surgical aortic valve replacement and TAVR now available. Whereas risk algorithms are available that are helpful in predicting outcomes in patients undergoing surgical procedures, measures of frailty are not included in the algorithms. When considering intervention in the elderly patient, the addition of frailty assessment to determine the true risk in this population is essential to determine potential benefit. Gait speed as determined by the 5-m walk test is the most commonly used single test objective measurement of frailty in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is an independent predictor of mortality and major morbidity. Wider application of this and other objective measures of frailty in the population undergoing TAVR is necessary to determine whether it is predictive in this population also.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement program development: recommendations for best practice [^1127Ccjk]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an increasingly available therapy for the management of aortic stenosis in higher risk populations. Beyond addressing the procedural challenges, centers must attend to the unique requirements of developing TAVR programs from referral to follow-up.

Aim

The aim of this article is to outline the recommendations for best practice for program development from centers with early and extensive experience.

Recommendations

The guideline-recommended Heart Team approach requires interdisciplinary agreements, delineation of roles and responsibilities, and the development of the role of the TAVR Coordinator. To support appropriate case selection, the screening and evaluation must be organized in a comprehensive clinic visit. In addition to the multimodality imaging tests, the assessment of functional status and frailty is pivotal to the eligibility decision. Throughout the TAVR trajectory, careful attention must be afforded to the integration of geriatric best practices. Pre-procedure care requires patient and family education to manage expectations and facilitate early discharge planning. Peri-procedural care planning, including equipment requirements, monitoring protocols, and emergency intervention agreements, contributes to procedural success. The aims of post-procedure care are to monitor the recovery, facilitate the rapid return to baseline status, and optimize length of stay. TAVR programs require data management strategies to facilitate and monitor program growth, support program evaluation, and meet the requirements for submission to national registries.

Conclusion

TAVR represents a paradigm shift in the management of structural heart disease. Programmatic success and patient outcomes depend on the development of a comprehensive and collaborative program tailored to TAVR.

Careful individual evaluation

The choice of the intervention mode — SAVR or TAVR — for patients at increased surgical risk should take into account the cardiac and extracardiac characteristics of the patient as well as some important anatomical and technical aspects. Figure 2 provides aspects that should be considered for this individual decision. Importantly, current guidelines favour the use of transfemoral TAVR over surgery in elderly patients at increased surgical risk. In the two large studies on intermediate risk, the mean ages were 82 and 80 years and mean STS scores were 5.8% and 4.5%. Hence, the study results are valid for comparable patient groups.

Frailty

Besides specific organ comorbidities, there is growing interest in the assessment of frailty, an overall marker of impairment of functional, cognitive and nutritional status. Frailty is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after surgery or TAVR. The assessment of frailty should not rely on a subjective approach, but rather on a combination of different objective estimates. Several tools are available for assessing frailty.

Challenging subgroups

There are a number of challenging subgroups with aortic valve disease that need special attention when considering TAVR. Data remain sparse for some specific patient cohorts excluded from key RCTs: low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis; patients with significant coronary artery or concomitant valve disease; aortic stenosis with severe left ventricular outflow tract calcification or previous valve surgery. Moreover, although recent registry data have shown good outcomes for TAVR treatment of bicuspid valves, unique anatomic challenges remain related to differences in annular size, patterns of leaflet calcification and orifice shape when compared with tri-leaflet valves. Different device types may also have different results in these complex patient subgroups.

Younger patients

Data on TAVR are still very limited for patients below 75 years of age and for surgical low-risk patients, in whom SAVR remains the reference method. It has to be emphasised that younger patients differ with regard to anatomy (more bicuspid valves), which affects the results of TAVR (bicuspid valves were also in general excluded in clinical trials), and that long-term durability data for TAVR prosthetic valves are still lacking.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: when should we say no? [^1174zpmw]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The reported improvement in QoL among the major TAVR trials obviously represents the average treatment effect among the treated patients. With any medical intervention, the magnitude of benefit varies from patient to patient and can be impacted by a number of patient-specific and treatment-specific variables. This is especially true when the population in question present numerous comorbid illnesses, as with TAVR recipients. Both cardiac and extra-cardiac conditions can impact outcome after TAVR. It is therefore not surprising that in among the elderly and frail TAVR patients included in the PARTNER 1 trial, more than one-third (35%) of TAVR recipients had a poor outcome at 6 months (death or a KCCQ-OS Score < 45 (equivalent to New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV)). Observational data of real world clinical practice support the randomised trial observation of a substantial proportion of patients failing to achieve treatment goals after TAVR: among more than 13 000 patients included in the US Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology/Transcatheter Valve Therapy (STS/ACC/TVT) Registry with STS scores well distributed among risk classes (47% high risk; 39% medium risk; 14% low risk, mean STS Score 7.7%), 39% of patients presented poor outcomes at 1 year (death, or 10-point decline in KCCQ-OS or KCCQ-OS < 60 (equivalent to NYHA III–IV)). Poor QoL accounted for half of these substandard clinical outcomes.

### Patient evaluation and selection for transcatheter aortic valve replacement: the heart team approach [^1175jRAm]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to significantly impact mortality and quality of life in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are deemed high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Essential to these outcomes is proper patient selection. The multidisciplinary TAVR heart team was created to provide comprehensive patient evaluation and aid in proper selection. This review with outline the history and components of the heart team, and delineate the team's role in risk and frailty assessment, evaluation of common co-morbidities that impact outcomes, and the complex multi-modality imaging necessary for procedural planning and patient selection. The heart team is critical in determining patient eligibility and benefit and the optimal operative approach for TAVR. The future of structural heart disease will certainly require a team approach, and the TAVR heart team will serve as the successful model.

### Cognition, frailty, and functional outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112CaiLr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive impairment and frailty are highly prevalent in older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of cognitive impairment and frailty with functional recovery after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Methods

This was a single-center prospective cohort study of 142 patients who were ≥ 70 years old and underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. Prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement, cognitive impairment was defined as Mini-Mental State Examination score < 24 points (range: 0–30), and moderate-to-severe frailty was defined as a deficit-accumulation frailty index ≥ 0.35 (range: 0–1). The functional status composite score, the number of 22 daily and physical tasks that a patient could perform independently, measured at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively were analyzed using linear mixed-effects model.

Results

The mean age was 84.2 years; 74 subjects were women (51.8%). Patients with moderate-to-severe frailty and cognitive impairment (n = 27, 19.0%) had the lowest functional status at baseline and throughout 12 months, while patients with mild or no frailty and no cognitive impairment (n = 48, 33.8%) had the best functional status. Patients with cognitive impairment alone (n = 19, 13.4%) had better functional status at baseline than those with moderate-to-severe frailty alone (n = 48, 33.8%), but their functional status scores merged and remained similar during the follow-up.

Conclusions

Preoperative cognitive function plays a vital role in functional recovery after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, regardless of baseline frailty status. Impaired cognition may increase functional decline in the absence of frailty, whereas intact cognition may mitigate the detrimental effects of frailty. Cognitive assessment should be routinely performed prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

### Frailty is associated with delirium and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^113FUQQN]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study setting, participants and treatment assignment

The study was conducted in a single tertiary referral centre. Between November 2012 and February 2014 data from 305 patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis referred for aortic valve replacement were reviewed by a heart team consisting of a cardiothoracic surgeon, an interventional cardiologist and a general or imaging cardiologist. Based on the available cardiological data, 177 patients were primarily considered candidates for surgical aortic valve replacement and underwent routine preoperative screening. The remaining 128 patients were considered as high-risk or potentially frail. These patients were referred to a specialised pre-TAVI outpatient clinic, where patients were assessed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiac anaesthesiologist, a cardiac surgeon, a cardiologist and a geriatrician. Based on consensus from this team and the patient, 91 patients were assigned to TAVI, 18 to surgical aortic valve replacement and 19 to medical treatment, figure 1. Two patients assigned to TAVI died before the procedure was performed.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement over age 90: risks vs benefits [^115C7KGH]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the mid‐term, is the patient likely to recover from the procedure and return home within a reasonable timeframe? Conversely, the less‐fortunate patient suffers a vicious cycle of ongoing deconditioning, prolonged hospitalization, and discharge to another healthcare facility. Attributes that may markedly impede or slow down the recovery process include: physical frailty and poor mobility, low social support, active depression. Physical frailty can be assessed with the chair rise and 5‐m gait speed tests, among others. 43, 44

In the long‐term, is the patient likely to benefit from the implanted TAVR in terms of both quantity and quality of life? Irrespective of the technical success of the TAVR procedure, attributes that may preclude any improvement in functional capacity include: a dvanced dementia, b ed‐ or wheelchair‐bound, c achexia or severe sarcopenia, and d isability for all or most basic activities of daily living. Comorbidities that may preclude meaningful improvements in life expectancy include: e nd‐stage dialysis‐dependent renal disease, oxygen‐dependent lung disease, cirrhosis, and advanced cancer. The underlined A‐B‐C‐D‐E mnemonic represents the attributes and comorbidities that should raise serious concerns about the futility of TAVR. Lastly, older patients often present with fatigue or other nonspecific symptoms, and it is important to objectify the functional limitations attributable to AS (and thereby improvable by TAVR). Functional capacity can and should be objectively assessed with the 6‐minute walk test.

Once the information for forecasting risks and benefits has been acquired and analyzed, the clinician can better present the therapeutic options to the patient and assist them in reaching an informed decision that is in‐line with their preferences and values 45 (Table 2). The options may include proceeding with TAVR, proceeding with balloon aortic valvuloplasty, continuing medical management of symptoms and ideally referring to a multi‐disciplinary heart failure clinic, or transitioning to a palliative care plan. 46 Balloon aortic valvuloplasty may be chosen to observe the patient's potential for functional recovery and determine eligibility for TAVR in the future. A good TAVR candidate should exhibit meaningful improvements in physical frailty and functional capacity 3 to 6 months after valvuloplasty (ie, > 1 point in the short physical performance battery and > 50 m in the 6‐minute walk test 47), suggesting that their limitations were predominantly caused by AS rather than other factors not addressed by TAVR.

### Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement with a balloon-expandable valve in low-risk patients [^114zBBaT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) was published by Mack MJ and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the trial question was: is TAVR superior to SAVR in patients with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the population was: 950 patients (292 female, 658 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe aortic stenosis at low risk of death with surgery. The key exclusion criteria were clinical frailty; bicuspid aortic valves; other anatomical features increasing the risk of complications. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 496 TAVR (with a third-generation balloon-expandable valve) n = 454 SAVR (with a bioprosthetic valve). In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year (8.5% vs. 15.1%; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.79). In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in stroke (0.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.88) Significant decrease in death or stroke (1% vs. 3.3%; HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.83) Significant decrease in new-onset AF (5% vs. 39.5%; HR 0.1, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16). In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in safety endpoints at 30 days, including major vascular complications and new permanent pacemaker insertions. In the PARTNER 3 (1-year follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low risk of death with surgery, TAVR was superior to SAVR with respect to death, stroke, or rehospitalization at 1 year.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) evaluation — cognitive function: Cognitive function should be assessed using validated tools to screen for prior disabling stroke, cognitive impairment or dementia, and depression; the Mini Mental State Examination identifies dementia with scores < 24 being abnormal. Although cognitive function post-TAVR is preserved in most, assessment establishes baseline cognitive reserve, and because depression confounds cognitive performance, a history followed by a validated tool such as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale is warranted.

### Frailty in nonagenarians: a bridge too far? [^116zz4wg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

There is no clear consensus about the definition of frailty and how to accurately measure it. There is accumulating evidence that frail old patients have worse outcomes after TAVR compared to non-frail patients. Further randomized research is needed to confirm those concerns and to standardize the role of frailty assessment in patient selection for TAVR.

### Comparative utility of frailty to a general prognostic score in identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement [^116aN7pt]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The poor performance within the TAVR cohort additionally suggests a need for prognostic models that are also capable of finer discrimination when applied to older populations with a narrower age distribution. Lee et al. reported that age explained the majority of variability in mortality, as predicted by their model. Thus, the development of the Lee index within an exclusively community-dwelling population may limit its generalizability to long-term care residents and community-dwellers at risk of new institutionalization.

In addition to its poor accuracy and external validity within older and higher-risk TAVR patients, the Lee index was not optimized to predict person-centered outcomes, such as functional status. Prediction of person-centered outcomes may be especially relevant to high-risk TAVR candidates, whose decisions must weigh sizable disease-mediated mortality with previously accumulated health and functional deficits. In a single center analysis of patient-defined goals among TAVR candidates, only 7% of patients cited survival as their primary desired endpoint. This is as compared to a majority of patients describing a desire to perform a particular activity (48%) or maintain independence (30%). As such, prognostic indices developed from the general population may also be limited in their capacity to characterize the defined priorities of higher-risk procedural candidates. Dedicated research regarding post-TAVR cognitive and functional outcomes, as well as increased representation of the oldest-old within longitudinal population health surveys, may inform more accurate and patient-centered prognostic indices for TAVR candidates.

There are limitations to this study. First, our study was conducted at a large academic medical center across a predominately Caucasian population. Therefore, the generalizability of our findings to medical centers with lower procedural volumes or distinct patient demographics merits further consideration. Second, modest sample size limits our ability to detect a potentially clinically meaningful difference in discrimination for procedure-specific cohorts. Third, our combined endpoint of death or NYHA class III or IV functional status was informed by the self-report. Nonetheless, self-reported functional status has been well-validated against objective endpoints. Lastly, our analysis is predicated upon a composite outcome of symptomatic functional decline and mortality, as compared to the isolated outcome of mortality in the development of the Lee index. The use of a composite endpoint, however, captures functional outcomes, which remain often of paramount importance to older adults.

### Evolution of basic activities of daily living function in older patients one year after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^113UyLFe]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. 1 Survival is approximately 85% in older patients 1 year after TAVI, compared with approximately 50% for medical treatment alone. 2, 3 Clinically relevant improvements in physical function and quality of life have also been observed 1 year after TAVI. 4, 5, 6

Despite these promising results, recent studies have found that outcomes may be poor in selected groups of patients, particularly in those who are very frail. Afilalo et al. found that 20% of 807 survivors experienced a functional decline 1 year after surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement, with frailty being the strongest predictor of functional deterioration. 7 Another study analyzed 1‐year functional outcome in a subgroup of 22 very frail patients who underwent TAVI. 8 In this subgroup, functional trajectory was poor or very poor in 15 patients, fair in seven patients, and good to excellent in none of the patients. These findings question whether TAVI is justified in very frail patients. 9

However, current information on functional outcomes in very frail patients after TAVI is based on small samples in selected studies. Additional data on functional outcomes in frail patients are therefore needed to assist clinicians in making the best possible decisions about treatment. The purpose of our study was to measure the evolution of functional status in a larger cohort of frail patients 1 year after TAVI. We chose to use basic activities of daily living (ADL) as a measure of functional status, given the importance of this functional domain for quality of life and autonomy in older patients. We investigated the association of baseline factors, including cardiac risk scores and frailty status, with the evolution of functional outcomes in this cohort.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: when should we say no? [^1164yUAV]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was born as a last resort for otherwise inoperable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). Initially, the procedure was invasive, associated with serious complications and expensive, but if successful, offered patients with few treatment options the opportunity for improved survival and enhanced quality of life (QoL). Among elderly TAVR candidates, improvement in functional class is often the more relevant benefit of a successful TAVR while younger patients may be more concerned with the longer survival associated with the procedure.

A poor outcome after a specific intervention can be defined as the intervention failing to achieve the expected treatment goals. With TAVR, the treatment goals are improved survival and reduced symptoms and hence, a poor outcome would include death and reduced QoL post procedure. The cornerstone randomised controlled trials of TAVR carefully evaluated objective QoL measures prior to and after TAVR using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a standard measure of symptoms, physical and social limitations, and QoL in patients with heart failure. In the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve (PARTNER) 1 Trial — Cohort B, compared with medical therapy alone, TAVR conferred a 25-point improvement (five points usually considered clinically relevant) in the KCCQ overall summary (KCCQ-OS) Score still lasting after 1 year. Similarly, in high-risk operable patients (PARTNER Cohort A and CoreValve US Pivotal Trial), TAVR was associated with a highly significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the KCCQ-OS Score (increase of 20–30 points) at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year compared with the baseline, with a more rapid improvement in TAVR arm compared with surgery (1-month scores greater after TAVR). Interestingly, the lower the estimated surgical risk the greater the improvement in QoL: in low-risk patients (PARTNER 3 trial), TAVR was associated not only with KCCQ-OS Score increase compared with baseline (19 points at 1 year) but also with greater improvement compared with surgery beyond 1 month: 6 months (p = 0.04) and 12 months (p = 0.04).

### Short-term outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement in elderly patients-results of a comparative cohort study [^1146phCy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of aortic stenosis (AS) increases with age and is estimated to be around 10–13% in people over the age of 80 years. This is expected to increase further as the population continues to age. Elderly patients with AS pose a therapeutic challenge as they often have complex comorbidity, frailty and rehabilitation issues. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) can offer a considerable improvement in survival and quality of life but comes with significant potential risks, particularly in this elderly population. The introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a less invasive procedure with comparable results to SAVR, has called into question the role of SAVR in elderly patients.

In the UK, TAVI is recommended for patients who are unsuitable for surgery due to high operative risk. This practice is based on current guidelines, usually without consideration of the frailty status of the patient. Indeed, the most recent American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines make a Class 1 A recommendation for transfemoral TAVI in preference to SAVR for patients above the age of 80 years who have severe, symptomatic AS and suitable anatomy.

The aim of this study was to compare 30-day and 1-year survival after SAVR for patients aged 70–79 years versus those aged 80 years and over, as well as to identify the risk factors which impact outcomes after SAVR in this elderly population.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk and decision-making pathways — guided actions for aortic valve replacement (AVR) selection are organized as: No current indication for AVR lists periodic monitoring of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and symptoms and re-evaluation when AS is severe or symptoms occur. When AVR is indicated but surgical AVR (SAVR) is preferred over TAVR, the document states 'SAVR recommended in lower-risk patients', notes valve durability considerations in younger patients, and that a concurrent surgical procedure may be needed. For a TAVR candidate with expected benefit > risk, actions include discussion with patient and family and proceeding with TAVR imaging evaluation and procedure. For severe symptomatic AS but benefit < risk (futility), thresholds include life expectancy < 1 year and chance of survival with benefit at 2 years < 25%, with actions including discussion with patient and family, palliative care inputs, and palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty in selected patients.

### The future of transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^111SSSZz]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) into clinical practice, the treatment of aortic stenosis has changed dramatically. In the past, medical therapy with or without balloon aortic valvuloplasty was the only option for inoperable patients. More recently, TAVI has become the treatment of choice for these patients and the preferred alternative for high-risk operable patients. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) currently remains the gold standard for patients at low or intermediate operative risk. As randomized trials have demonstrated comparable results between TAVI and SAVR in the high-risk population, there is now a clear trend towards performing TAVI even in intermediate-risk patients while awaiting the results of randomized trials in that population. Nevertheless, there are still questions regarding TAVI involving paravalvular leak (PVL), stroke, pacemaker requirements, and durability that remain to be more definitively answered before TAVI can routinely be performed in a broader, lower risk population. Improvements in patient selection, imaging, and second and third generation devices have decreased the incidence of PVLs and vascular complications that followed the earliest TAVI procedures, but the rates of perioperative stroke and permanent pacemaker implantation must still be addressed. Furthermore, the long-term durability of TAVI devices and a role for post-procedure antithrombotic management remain unanswered. Until these questions are more clearly answered, it is the Heart Team's task to determine the optimal treatment for each patient based on risk scores, frailty metrics, comorbidities, patient preference, and potential for improvement in quality of life.

5 POSTPROCEDURAL CARE OF NONAGENARIANS

Despite appropriate selection and technical execution, 30%‐40% of older patients report persistently poor functional status and quality of life following TAVR — especially frail older patients who were deconditioned before and increasingly‐so after the procedure. Therefore, frailty should not only be viewed as a prognostic marker, but also a therapeutic target than can be improved with exercise and nutrition, ideally in the context of a structured cardiac rehabilitation program. 48 Nonagenarians have been shown to benefit from cardiac rehabilitation 49 and should not be excluded but rather preferentially referred following TAVR. Cardiac rehabilitation programs can be adapted to their abilities and progress at a suitable pace; they can even be delivered in the home‐based setting as in the ongoing PERFORM‐TAVR Trial (Protein and Exercise for Reversal of Frailty in OldeR Men and women undergoing TAVR; NCT 03522454).

### TAVR in older adults: moving toward a comprehensive geriatric assessment and away from chronological age: family series [^113FbmQk]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis can be considered a model for geriatric cardiovascular conditions due to a confluence of factors. The remarkable technological development of transcatheter aortic valve replacement was studied initially on older adult populations with prohibitive or high-risk for surgical valve replacement. Through these trials, the cardiovascular community has recognized that stratification of these chronologically older adults can be improved incrementally by invoking the concept of frailty and other geriatric risks. Given the complexity of the aging process, stratification by chronological age should only be the initial step but is no longer sufficient to optimally quantify cardiovascular and noncardiovascular risk. In this review, we employ a geriatric cardiology lens to focus on the diagnosis and the comprehensive management of aortic stenosis in older adults to enhance shared decision-making with patients and their families and optimize patient-centered outcomes. Finally, we highlight knowledge gaps that are critical for future areas of study.

### The impact of frailty status on clinical and functional outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in nonagenarians with severe aortic stenosis [^115dvHFg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of frailty status on TAVR outcomes in nonagenarians is unknown. The present study aims to investigate the impact of frailty status on procedural outcomes and overall survival in nonagenarians after TAVR.

Methods

A frailty score (FS) was derived by using preoperative grip strength, gait speed, serum albumin, and daily activities. Patients were divided into two groups: Frail (FS ≥ 3/4) and Non-Frail (FS < 3/4). Health status was assessed using the 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared in both groups. The effect of frailty status on outcomes was investigated. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of overall all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate survival.

Results

Seventy-five patients > 90 years underwent full assessment for frailty status. There was a significant improvement in overall health status of non-frail patients (mean difference: 11.03, P = 0.032). Unadjusted 30-day and 2-year mortality rates were higher in the frail group than the non-frail group. (14% vs. 2% P = 0.059; 31% vs. 9% P = 0.018). Kaplan-Meier estimated all-cause mortality to be significantly higher in the frail group (log-rank test; P = 0.042). Frailty status was independently associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio: 1.84, 95% C. I: 1.06–3.17; P = 0.028) after TAVR.

Conclusion

Among nonagenarians selected to undergo TAVR for severe aortic stenosis, a considerable number are frail. Nonfrail patients report a significant improvement in overall health status in the short term. Worse frailty is strongly associated with diminished long-term survival. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Relation of frailty to outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (from the PARTNER trial) [^112y4paE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an effective treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) in patients who are inoperable or at high risk for surgery. However, the intermediate- to long-term mortality is high, emphasizing the importance of patient selection. We, therefore, sought to evaluate the prognostic value of frailty in older recipients of TAVR, hypothesizing that frail patients would experience a higher mortality rate and a higher likelihood of poor outcome 1 year after TAVR. This substudy of the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves trial was conducted at 3 high-enrolling sites where frailty was assessed systematically before TAVR. In total, 244 patients received TAVR at the participating sites. Frailty was assessed using a composite of 4 markers (serum albumin, dominant handgrip strength, gait speed, and Katz activity of daily living survey), which were combined into a frailty score. The cohort was dichotomized at median frailty score. Outcomes measures were the time to death from any cause for > 1 year of follow-up and poor outcome at 1 year. Poor outcome was defined as (1) death, (2) Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary (KCCQ-OS) score < 60, or (3) decrease of ≥ 10 points in the KCCQ-OS score from baseline to 1 year. At 1 year, the Kaplan-Meier-estimated all-cause mortality rate was 32.7% in the frail group and 15.9% in the nonfrail group (log-rank p = 0.004). At 1 year, poor outcome occurred in 50.0% of the frail group and 31.5% of the nonfrail group (p = 0.02). In conclusion, frailty was associated with increased mortality and a higher rate of poor outcome 1 year after TAVR.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: current perspectives and future implications [^114tCkDG]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an attractive treatment strategy for the treatment of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS), particularly those who are inoperable or at high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. Several multicentre registries and randomised trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this technology in improving the survival as well as functional capacity of patients with AS. Most of the elderly patients with severe AS have multiple non-cardiac comorbidities, which might limit survival and impede the improvement in functional capacity afforded by TAVR. Therefore, optimal patient selection based on precise risk assessment is currently the cornerstone of evaluation of patients for TAVR. Due to the need for a multifaceted approach in patient evaluation, procedural conduct as well as postprocedure management, multidisciplinary heart valve teams have assumed a paramount role in the TAVR process. This review presents the current perspectives in patient selection, risk assessment, procedural considerations and outcomes following TAVR, along with implications for the future.

### Comparative utility of frailty to a general prognostic score in identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement [^116cVgo9]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The peri-procedural morbidity and mortality of TAVR have declined in accordance with the recent adoption of TAVR within healthier populations, in addition to improved procedural techniques and device technology. However, a sizable cohort of complex and vulnerable older adults will continue to require informed counseling as to their procedural risks and anticipated outcomes. Our analysis demonstrates prognostic indices developed from the general, community-dwelling population do not appropriately discriminate risk of poor outcomes among older and multimorbid procedural candidates with frailty. Explicit incorporation of frailty may better discriminate procedural risk high-risk populations, as compared to general prognostic instruments, Lee index and provide useful information for shared decision making.

### Challenges and future opportunities for transcatheter aortic valve therapy [^115FhQVE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a novel less-invasive therapy for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Despite the impressive clinical growth of TAVR, there are many challenges as well as future opportunities.

Results

The heart valve team serves as the central vehicle for determining appropriate case selection. Considerations which impact clinical therapy decisions include frailty assessments and defining clinical "futility". There are many controversial procedural issues; choice of vascular access site, valve sizing, adjunctive imaging, and post-dilatation strategies. Complications associated with TAVR (strokes, vascular and bleeding events, para-valvular regurgitation, and conduction abnormalities) must be improved and will require procedural and/or technology enhancements. TAVR site training mandates a rigorous commitment to established society and sponsor guidelines. In the future, TAVR clinical indications should extend to bioprosthetic valve failure, intermediate risk patients, and other clinical scenarios, based upon well conducted clinical trials. New TAVR systems have been developed which should further optimize clinical outcomes, by reducing device profile, providing retrievable features, and preventing para-valvular regurgitation. Other accessory devices, such as cerebral protection to prevent strokes, are also being developed and evaluated in clinical studies.

Summary

TAVR is a worthwhile addition to the armamentarium of therapies for patients with AS. Current limitations are important to recognize and future opportunities to improve clinical outcomes are being explored.

Patient selection and thresholds for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) — "The survival and symptom reduction benefit of TAVI is seen only in appropriately selected patients", with baseline clinical factors for poor outcomes including advanced age, frailty, smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, liver disease, prior stroke, anemia, and other systemic conditions. The STS estimated surgical risk score may help identify who benefits, and patients with a mechanical impediment to SAVR (e.g., porcelain aorta or prior chest radiation damage) may have better outcomes after TAVI than frail or multiorgan-disease patients. Importantly, "TAVI is not recommended in patients with 1) a life expectancy of < 1 year even with a successful procedure or 2) those with a chance of 'survival with benefit' of < 25% at 2 years".

### TAVR in older adults: moving toward a comprehensive geriatric assessment and away from chronological age: family series [^113N8NGY]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) can be considered a model for geriatric cardiovascular conditions because it encourages the cardiovascular community to realize the limitations of chronological age when assessing suitability of aortic valve replacement in older adults with multiple coexisting geriatric conditions. The remarkable technological evolution of transcatheter heart valves is well documented. Through clinical trials, the concepts of geriatric risk assessments were embedded in the knowledge base of the cardiovascular team, when they were previously only confined to the geriatrics community.

Frailty, a measure of underlying vulnerability in the face of stressors, has now become part of the standard cardiovascular team vocabulary despite the lack of a gold standard assessment. The initial focus of frailty was its use in a dichotomous classification, with a goal of identifying the presence or absence of frailty to determine eligibility or futility for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure. A recent study affirmed that a substantial proportion of patients referred for TAVR procedures showed objective evidence of frailty. In addition, and irrespective of procedural success, this conferred a 50% risk of mortality or poor quality-of-life at 1 year. It is now evident that optimal care for older adults with cardiovascular diseases needs a more comprehensive approach than a simple dichotomous assessment of frailty.

### The impact of frailty on VARC-3 integrated outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic Valve Replacement [^112NeMGZ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

As a consequence of the demographic transition, a substantial proportion of patients with cardiovascular disease have significant comorbidities, which render treatment decisions more complex and interventions more challenging. Frailty is a multidimensional geriatric syndrome defined as slowness, weakness, exhaustion, wasting and malnutrition, poor endurance and inactivity, and loss of independence. An important proportion of patients with severe degenerative aortic stenosis (AS) have coexisting frailty when referred for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has consistently been shown to prolong survival and improve quality of life, Frailty is not directly affected by TAVR and has been associated with poor clinical outcomes and reduced quality of life even after AVR. As a consequence, it remains to be determined whether the favorable effect of TAVR in patients with frailty is limited to survival benefit while expanding morbidity, rather than improving patient-reported outcome measures. Evaluation of treatment success is therefore particularly challenging in this patient population. Available evidence describes clinical outcomes and health status as a composite outcome, which complicates interpretation of the benefit and futility of AVR on disease-specific health status in this population. Given that survival alone is unlikely to fully encompass the goals of disease management (especially in an older population) and that disease-specific health status may improve over time due to attrition of the sickest patients, integration of clinical and patient-reported quality of life measures is likely to be more appropriate to provide a comprehensive assessment of the effect of AVR in frail patients with severe AS. The current Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 outcome criteria propose composite endpoints that integrate clinical outcomes and patient-reported health status measures. In the present study, we aimed to investigate an integrated endpoint of clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life measures according to the presence of frailty in patients undergoing TAVR.

Aortic stenosis — Table 14 provides "A Simplified Framework With Examples of Factors Favoring SAVR, TAVI, or Palliation Instead of Aortic Valve Intervention", outlining examples by column. Factors favoring surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) include concurrent conditions and procedure limits such as "Aortic dilatation‡ Severe primary MR Severe CAD requiring bypass grafting Septal hypertrophy requiring myectomy AF" and "Valve anatomy, annular size, or low coronary ostial height precludes TAVI Vascular access does not allow transfemoral TAVI", with frailty status "Not frail or few frailty measures". Factors favoring transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) include anatomic or prior-treatment considerations such as "Severe calcification of the ascending aorta ("porcelain" aorta)" and "Previous cardiac surgery with at-risk coronary grafts Previous chest irradiation", with frailty "Frailty likely to improve after TAVI". Factors favoring palliation include systemic burden and frailty such as "Moderate to severe involvement of ≥ 2 other organ systems", "Severe frailty unlikely to improve after TAVI", and the risk/benefit threshold "Prohibitive SAVR risk (> 15%) or post-TAVI life expectancy < 1 y". Additional context notes durability evidence: "Long-term (> 20 y) data on outcomes with surgical bioprosthetic valves are available; robust data on transcatheter bioprosthetic valves extend only to 5 y, leading to uncertainty about longer-term outcomes". The table also flags that "‡Dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta may require concurrent surgical replacement, particularly in younger patients with a BAV".

### The impact of frailty on VARC-3 integrated outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic Valve Replacement [^1153w9Rn]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Of note in the present analysis, female sex was more frequently observed in the frail group, which may reflect different disease progression and later diagnosis of AS in women, whereas the age distribution, common comorbidities, surgical risk, and echocardiographic features were similar between frail and nonfrail patients. The overlap of frailty with other comorbidities introduces complexity in distinguishing the independent effects of frailty. Indeed, frailty may serve both as a separate predictor and as an amplifying factor for other high-risk conditions, as seen in our exploratory analyses. This may highlight a critical challenge in frailty research: comorbidities such as cardiovascular and metabolic disorders often coexist with frailty, making it difficult to isolate the specific contribution of frailty to outcomes. These findings suggest that current methods of patient risk stratification that are mainly based on surgical risk scores and anatomical features may underappreciate the impact of frailty in patients undergoing TAVR. Integrated assessment of surgical risk as well as frailty may be key in identifying patient-specific risks and tailoring optimal treatment for the individual patient.

### Good outcome and valve function despite medtronic-corevalve underexpansion [^111ync3E]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

An 80-year old nun with severe calcific aortic stenosis and a bicuspid aortic valve was referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. She was declined for conventional surgery on the basis of poor left ventricular function, frailty, and a logistic EuroSCORE of 29.66. A 29-mm Medtronic-Corevalve bioprosthesis was implanted by transfemoral route. The inflow portion of the stent frame was grossly underexpanded. However, aortic valve area at 1.3 cm² was more than satisfactory for a body surface area of 1.29 m² (indexed area 1.0 cm²/m², peak gradient 23, and mean 16 mmHg). There was an early sustained improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) status, and there was no change in valvular function at 2 year follow-up. This case highlights that gross underexpansion of the Medtronic-Corevalve stent frame is compatible with good bioprosthetic function and excellent symptomatic recovery.

### Functional capacity and health-related quality of life outcomes post transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cE2M9]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Background

transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) provides prognostic benefit for high surgical-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet the impact to patient outcomes is far less understood.

Method

we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate functional capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes for patients up to 12 months post TAVR. A total of 20 eligible publications, comprising randomised-controlled trials, observational studies and a registry study were identified from electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and others (inception to February 2017).

Results

the total sample was 2,775 with a mean age of 81.8 ± 2.1 years, more than half (52%) were female and high surgical risk 9.6 ± 4.3% mean STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk model). Post TAVR, patients had significant improvement in functional capacity of > 40 m in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.69–73.28) and a clinically meaningful increase in ability to perform daily physical-based tasks (Duke Activity Status Index (DASI), mean difference (MD) increase 5.42 points, 95% CI 3.16–7.68). HRQoL improved consistently following TAVR regardless of measure used. Significant increases occurred in the physical component summary scores (PCS) of the short form (SF) health surveys (MD increase 10.45 (SF36) and 10.14 (SF12) points).

Conclusion

functional capacity and HRQoL improved substantially following TAVR, despite evolving patient selection criteria, thus TAVR continues to provide a directly beneficial option for severe AS patients.

Cohort characteristics

Of 103 SAVR and 143 TAVR candidates who completed baseline measurements, a total of 44 had the poor outcome (5 SAVR, 39 TAVR), including 31 deaths (3 SAVR, 28 TAVR). A total of 12 SAVR and 6 TAVR participants were lost to follow up. The mean age of TAVR patients was 6.4-years older than SAVR patients (84.4-years versus 78.0-years; p < 0.001, Table 1). TAVR candidates had a higher mean Charlson comorbidity index score (3.6 versus 2.1; p < 0.001), and a greater STS-PROM (5.9% versus 2.8%; p < 0.001). TAVR patients had greater proportion of ADL impairment (17.0% versus 5.6%; p < 0.001) and IADL disability (80.0% versus 48.3%; p < 0.001). TAVR patients also had lower mean gait speed (0.57 versus 0.94 m/s; p < 0.001), and lower mean MMSE scores (25.1 versus 27.0 points; p < 0.001).

Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'. Initial assessment includes evaluation of AS symptoms, disease severity and comorbidities, and 'Echocardiographic measures of AS severity should be reviewed, disease severity confirmed, and additional imaging performed as indicated'.

### TAVI or No TAVI: identifying patients unlikely to benefit from transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^117Jahd7]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has spawned the evolution of novel catheter-based therapies for a variety of cardiovascular conditions. Newer device iterations are delivering lower peri- and early post-procedural complication rates in patients with aortic stenosis, who were otherwise deemed too high risk for conventional surgical valve replacement. Yet beyond the post-procedural period, a considerable portion of current TAVI recipients fail to derive a benefit from TAVI, either dying or displaying a lack of clinical and functional improvement. Considerable interest now lies in better identifying factors likely to predict futility post-TAVI. Implicit in this are the critical roles of frailty, disability, and a multimorbidity patient assessment. In this review, we outline the roles that a variety of medical comorbidities play in determining futile post-TAVI outcomes, including the critical role of frailty underlying the identification of patients unlikely to benefit from TAVI. We discuss various TAVI risk scores, and further propose that by combining such scores along with frailty parameters and the presence of specific organ failure, a more accurate and holistic assessment of potential TAVI-related futility could be achieved.

### Frailty and transcatheter valve intervention: a narrative review [^1131wQxq]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Frailty is a common clinical syndrome that portends poor peri-procedural outcomes and increased mortality following transcatheter valve interventions. We reviewed frailty assessment tools in transcatheter intervention cohorts to recommend a pathway for preprocedural frailty assessment in patients referred for transcatheter valve procedures, and evaluated current evidence for frailty interventions and their efficacy in transcatheter intervention. We recommend the use of a frailty screening instrument to identify patients as frail, with subsequent referral for comprehensive geriatric assessment in these patients, to assist in selecting appropriate patients and then optimizing them for transcatheter valve interventions. Interventions to reduce preprocedural frailty are not well defined, however, data from limited cohort studies support exercise-based interventions to increase functional capacity and reduce frailty in parallel with preprocedural medical optimization.

### Results differ between transaortic and open surgical aortic valve replacement in women [^116bpeAS]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the well-known impact of female sex on outcome after surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR), few studies investigated its role after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Methods

After propensity-matching for age, baseline comorbidities, previous interventions, priority, frailty score, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular function and associated cardiac diseases, hospital mortality, and procedure-related morbidities of 388 women (194 TAVR versus 194 sAVR)-of 5,231 patients enrolled in 70 centers participating in this prospective multicenter national registry-were analyzed at a central management unit of the Italian National Institute of Health.

Results

Although hospital mortality was comparable (4.1% TAVR versus 3.1% sAVR; p = 0.177), women undergoing sAVR showed a higher rate of transfusion (63.9% versus 37.1% TAVR; p = 0.0001); higher number of transfusions per patient (3.6 ± 0.4 versus 2.3 ± 0.3 TAVR; p = 0.049); a higher incidence of low cardiac output state (5.7% versus 3.6% TAVR; p = 0.017) and acute renal failure (8.8% versus 4.1% TAVR; p = 0.01); and higher mean transprosthetic gradients (15.7 ± 12.6 mm Hg versus 11.9 ± 10.7 mm Hg TAVR; p = 0.004). In contrast, women undergoing TAVR experienced significant postprocedural aortic regurgitation (mild, 37.6% versus 7.7% sAVR; moderate-to-severe, 7.1% versus 1.5% sAVR; p = 0.0001) and a higher rate of stroke (7.7% versus 2.5% sAVR; p = 0.037), major vascular complications (9.3% versus 0.5% sAVR; p = 0.0001), pacemaker implantation (12.4% versus 6.2% sAVR; p = 0.004), need for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (1.0% versus 0% sAVR; p = 0.007), and longer intermediate care unit length of stay (2.5 ± 4.4 days versus 1.4 ± 2.6 days sAVR; p = 0.008). Perioperative myocardial infarction and lengths of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization were comparable (not significant).

Conclusions

Women undergoing sAVR and TAVR experienced different periprocedural morbidities. These data strongly suggest the need to strictly individualize the indications.

### Comparative utility of frailty to a general prognostic score in identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement [^113G3Nia]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, current cardiac risk stratification estimates 30-day mortality and major adverse cardiac events. However frail and multimorbid patients often value functional independence more than longevity. Specifically, work in patients with heart failure had suggests a preference for preservation of quality of life, and TAVR patients have described preserving independence as a primary driving factor in their decisions. An evolution towards predicting functional outcomes may facilitate better informed decisions among older and higher-risk candidates for AVR. Thus, how to best estimate prognosis in this population to inform treatment decisions remains uncertain. In this paper we evaluated the utility of a general prognostic instrument, the Lee index, in prediction of functional decline or death following AVR. We further compare its performance characteristics to a comprehensive geriatric assessment-based frailty index (FI).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Frailty, cognition, quality of life (QoL), immobility, and disability in TAVR candidates — Poor outcome was defined as death, KCCQ < 45, or decrease in KCCQ ≥ 10. Thirty-five percent of patients had a poor outcome at 6 months (19% dead, 16% alive without functional benefit). At 1 year, using a KCCQ threshold of < 60 to predict poor outcome, the frail patients had a 33% mortality rate, compared with 16% for those who were not deemed frail (p = 0.004), and poor outcome occurred in 50% of the frail subgroup versus 32% of the nonfrail subgroup (p = 0.02). In the STS/ACC TVT Registry, those who initially self-reported very poor health status (KCCQ < 25) had a 1-year mortality exceeding 25% after TAVR — more than twice as high as those who felt they had "good" health status at baseline. Frailty by Katz index also predicted outcomes: patients with a Katz score < 6 had a 47% mortality rate at 2 years, compared with 26% for a Katz index of 6, and approximately 50% with a Katz index ≤ 2 were dead by 2 years post-TAVR. Functional decline was observed in 21% of 106 surviving TAVR patients at 6 months, and such measures should be incorporated into the TAVR.

### Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement for inoperable severe aortic stenosis [^1162uXey]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is the recommended therapy for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not suitable candidates for surgery. The outcomes beyond 1 year in such patients are not known.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients to transfemoral TAVR or to standard therapy (which often included balloon aortic valvuloplasty). Data on 2-year outcomes were analyzed.

Results

A total of 358 patients underwent randomization at 21 centers. The rates of death at 2 years were 43.3% in the TAVR group and 68.0% in the standard-therapy group (P < 0.001), and the corresponding rates of cardiac death were 31.0% and 62.4% (P < 0.001). The survival advantage associated with TAVR that was seen at 1 year remained significant among patients who survived beyond the first year (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.92; P = 0.02 with the use of the log-rank test). The rate of stroke was higher after TAVR than with standard therapy (13.8% vs. 5.5%, P = 0.01), owing, in the first 30 days, to the occurrence of more ischemic events in the TAVR group (6.7% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.02) and, beyond 30 days, to the occurrence of more hemorrhagic strokes in the TAVR group (2.2% vs. 0.6%, P = 0.16). At 2 years, the rate of rehospitalization was 35.0% in the TAVR group and 72.5% in the standard-therapy group (P < 0.001). TAVR, as compared with standard therapy, was also associated with improved functional status (P < 0.001). The data suggest that the mortality benefit after TAVR may be limited to patients who do not have extensive coexisting conditions. Echocardiographic analysis showed a sustained increase in aortic-valve area and a decrease in aortic-valve gradient, with no worsening of paravalvular aortic regurgitation.

Conclusions

Among appropriately selected patients with severe aortic stenosis who were not suitable candidates for surgery, TAVR reduced the rates of death and hospitalization, with a decrease in symptoms and an improvement in valve hemodynamics that were sustained at 2 years of follow-up. The presence of extensive coexisting conditions may attenuate the survival benefit of TAVR. (Funded by Edwards Lifesciences; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00530894.).

### Impact of frailty and prefrailty on outcomes of transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement [^112vWiBF]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized trials have shown short- and mid-term benefits with transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement (TAVR versus SAVR) for patients at intermediate or low-risk for surgery. Frailty and prefrailty could explain some of this benefit due to an impaired ability to recover fully from a major surgical procedure.

Methods

We examined 2-year outcomes (survival and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] scores) among patients at intermediate or low surgical risk treated with transfemoral-TAVR or SAVR within the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 2A trial, SAPIEN 3 intermediate-risk registry, and PARTNER 3 trial. Frailty was examined as a continuous variable based on grip strength, gait speed, serum albumin, and activities of daily living. We tested the interaction of frailty markers by treatment (TAVR versus SAVR) in proportional hazards regression models (survival) and piecewise linear regression models (KCCQ), adjusting for patient demographic and clinical factors.

Results

Among the 3025 patients in the analytic cohort (2003 TAVR, 1022 SAVR; mean age 79.3 years, 61.6% men), 799 (26.4%) were nonfrail, 2041 (67.5%) were prefrail (1–2 frailty markers), and 185 (6.1%) were frail (3–4 frailty markers). Increasing frailty (none versus prefrail versus frail) was associated with higher 2-year mortality (5.5% versus 11.1% versus 22.8%; log-rank P < 0.001) and worse 2-year health status among survivors (KCCQ scores adjusted for baseline: 84.8 versus 79.6 versus 77.4, P < 0.001). In multivariable models, there were no significant interactions between frailty markers and treatment group for either survival (interaction P = 0.39) or health status (interaction P > 0.47 for all time points).

Conclusions

In a cohort of older patients with severe aortic stenosis who were at low or intermediate surgical risk, increasing frailty markers were associated with worse 2-year mortality and greater health status impairment after either TAVR or SAVR, but there were no significant interactions between type of valve replacement and frailty with respect to either outcome.

### Standardized endpoint definitions for transcatheter aortic valve implantation clinical trials: a consensus report from the valve academic research consortium [^114p353G]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Quality-of-life and healthcare economic instruments can be useful to assess disability and impairment due to congestive heart failure (e.g. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire)and for mapping health status compared with population-level utility weights (e.g. EuroQOL questionnaire). – However, quality-of-life questionnaires are also prone to bias and must be uniformly administered. The time points for assessment of the aforementioned clinical benefit endpoints should be at 30 days, at 6 months, and at 1 year after initiating therapy. Valve Academic Research Consortium recommends that if any measure of clinical benefit is utilized in clinical trials, there must be careful oversight and adjudication by experienced clinical events committees.

The assessment of 'frailty' in patients with advanced valvular heart disease has become increasingly important and is usually not included in surgical-risk algorithms. Frailty is loosely defined as a biological syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors, resulting from cumulative declines across multiple physiological systems, and causing vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Various frailty indices have been developed and have been correlated with worsening clinical outcomes in geriatric patients in intensive care units and after surgery. – In general, the evaluation of frailty demands a composite analysis of several categorical and continuous variables including mobility, strength, endurance, activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and nutritional status (as discerned by body mass index and biomarkers such as serum albumin). Although there is no standard frailty index which has been applied and validated in high-risk AS patients, multiple preliminary efforts are ongoing and VARC proposes to include measures of frailty in future clinical trials as a component of clinical benefit endpoints.

### Comparative utility of frailty to a general prognostic score in identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement [^111fbt1W]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

We conducted a prospective cohort study of older adults undergoing AVR at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA. Study design and protocols have been previously published. We prospectively enrolled a cohort of patients, aged 70-years or older, undergoing SAVR or TAVR for severe AS at a single academic medical center. Patients were excluded for 1) emergent surgery or surgery involving the aorta or another heart valve; 2) clinical instability (such as hemodynamic instability, acute decompensated heart failure, or active myocardial ischemia); 3) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score < 15 points or active psychosis; or 4) non-English speaking. In total, between 2014 and 2016, we screened 446 patients and enrolled 246. This analysis included 91 SAVR and 137 TAVR patients with available functional status data at 12 months. None of the research data collected impacted ultimate procedural decisions. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written consent was obtained.

### Clinical implications of physical function and resilience in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^113stBZt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, several trials have compared transcatheter and surgical approaches to valve replacement for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Each of these trials has enrolled patients in a specific surgical risk category: extreme, high, intermediate, or low. Recognizing that an objective assessment of frailty and physical function is essential to properly determine procedural risk, several objective tests have been incorporated into these trials to assess and characterize this aspect of a patient's presentation. 7, 8, 9 Chief and simplest among these measures has been the 5‐m gait speed test, which has been recommended for clinical and research use to characterize physical function and frailty and has been used in epidemiology studies to predict survival in older adults. 10, 11

Slow gait speed before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical valve replacement is associated with increased postprocedure mortality and an overall poor outcome. 12, 13, 14, 15 Given its simplicity and predictive value, assessment of gait speed is now routinely performed in all patients considered for TAVR and is a required data element in the TVT (Transcatheter Valve Therapies) registry. However, while its value in preprocedure risk assessment and planning has been demonstrated, what happens to physical function after TAVR is less clear. Accordingly, after the stressor of TAVR, we aimed to characterize the frequency of physical resilience (improvement in physical function as measured by gait speed) versus vulnerability (worsening of physical function) and the clinical implications of each of these trajectories. 16, 17 Specifically, we evaluated gait speed at baseline and 1 year after TAVR, the predictors of change in gait speed, and the associations with mortality and hospitalizations between 1 and 2 years. Given the high proportion of patients undergoing TAVR with impaired physical function, knowing these trajectories of physical function after TAVR, predictors of them, and their clinical implications could inform patient selection and identify opportunities for adjunctive interventions targeting impaired physical function to promote resilience and optimize patient outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk of TAVR and shared decision-making — the final treatment decision should be individualized using clinical and imaging evaluation, risk category, patient goals and expectations, and futility considerations. If the evaluation indicates that AS is not severe or symptoms are not due to AS, it may be prudent to continue periodic monitoring of AS severity and symptoms, deferring intervention until guideline-based criteria are met. Alternatively, the Heart Valve Team evaluation may conclude that the SAVR is the best option if surgical risk is low, the durability of a mechanical or other tissue valve is preferable in a younger patient, or concurrent procedures such as aortic root replacement or coronary bypass grafting are needed. Even when severe symptomatic AS is present, TAVR is considered futile when the expected benefit from TAVR is less than the expected risk; in these patients, palliative care may be the best option in terms of both quality and length of life. In patients who meet guideline-based criteria for TAVR and whose evaluation indicates the benefit is greater than risk, discussion with the patient and family should again review the likelihood of symptom relief or improved survival, possible complications and the expected recovery process, and alignment of patient goals and expectations with possible procedural outcomes.

### Frailty and recurrent hospitalization after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^113S7iQP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Time in hospital for frail patients is significant, and rehospitalizations are common in the first year after TAVR. Frailty assessed with the Hospital Frailty Risk Score was associated with time in hospital and mortality and should be used for patient selection to take days outside the hospital into account when 1‐year life expectancy is estimated before referral for a TAVR. Prevention strategies for frail patients to reduce hospitalization burden are warranted.

### Comparative utility of frailty to a general prognostic score in identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement [^114osSRi]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend considering life expectancy before aortic valve replacement (AVR). We compared the performance of a general mortality index, the Lee index, to a frailty index.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 246 older adults undergoing surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at a single academic medical center. We compared performance of the Lee index to a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI). Logistic regression was used to assess the association of Lee index or FI with poor outcome, defined as death or functional decline with severe symptoms at 12 months. Discrimination was assessed using C-statistics.

Results

In the overall cohort, 44 experienced poor outcome (31 deaths, 13 functional decline with severe symptoms). The risk of poor outcome by Lee index quartiles was 6.8% (reference), 17.9% (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval, [0.9–10.2]), 20.0% (OR 3.4; [1.0–11.4]), and 34.0% (OR 7.1; [2.2–22.6]) (p-for-trend = 0.001). Risk of poor outcome by FI quartiles was 3.6% (reference), 10.3% (OR 3.1; [0.6–15.8]), 25.0% (OR 8.8; [1.9–41.0]), and 37.3% (OR 15.8; [3.5–71.1]) (p-for-trend < 0.001). The Lee index predicted the risk of poor outcome in the SAVR cohort Lee index (quartiles 1–4: 2.1, 4.0, 15.4, and 20.0%; p-for-trend = 0.04), but not in the TAVR cohort (quartiles 1–4: 27.3, 29.0, 21.3, 35.4%; p-for-trend = 0.42). In contrast, the FI did not predict the risk of poor outcome well in the SAVR cohort (quartiles 1–4: 2.3, 4.4, 15.8, and 0%; p-for-trend = 0.24), however in the TAVR cohort (quartiles 1–4: 9.1, 14.3, 29.7, and 40.7%; p-for-trend = 0.004). Compared to the Lee index, an FI demonstrated higher C-statistics in the overall (Lee index versus FI: 0.680 versus 0.735; p = 0.03) and TAVR (0.560 versus 0.644; p = 0.03) cohorts, but not SAVR cohort (0.724 versus 0.766; p = 0.09).

Conclusions

While a general mortality index Lee index predicted death or functional decline with severe symptoms at 12 months well among SAVR patients, the FI derived from a multi-domain geriatric assessment better informs risk-stratification for high-risk TAVR patients.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis — high- or extreme-risk assumptions state that BAV (balloon aortic valvuloplasty) may be considered as either a palliative intervention or a bridge to decision about definitive therapy with AVR (aortic valve replacement), specify life-expectancy stratification around 1 year with trials excluding those with an anticipated life expectancy < 1 year, and outline frailty handling using the Fried criteria with frailty defined as meeting 3 out of 5 criteria while assuming that ≥ 1 objective definition is present and the patient is not severely frail; BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) is included qualitatively with interpretation by age, sex, and renal function, STS-PROM > 15% is used as a comorbidity surrogate, liver disease severity examples use MELD with Child-Pugh as an alternative, and for these scenarios assume that TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) can be performed by a transfemoral approach, with alternative-access TAVR potentially less or not appropriate.

### Degenerative calcific aortic stenosis: a natural history [^116G1NzV]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the consequence of active valve remodelling, which can be easily diagnosed, but for which no preventive strategy is available. It is the most common valve disease in Western countries, where its prevalence increases with age, reaching about 3% after the age of 75. The burden of AS is high and is expected to double within the next 50 years. Surgery is recommended in patients with severe symptomatic AS. In practice, however, surgery is often denied to the elderly owing to extensive comorbidities or 'frailty' and, as a consequence, decision-making is not always consistent with risk-benefit analysis. These findings highlight the need for less invasive approaches in high-risk patients and account for the rapid development of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Preliminary analyses suggest that in-hospital costs of TAVI compare favourably with the costs of surgery. Cost-effectiveness analyses are needed but should be interpreted with caution, given the discrepancies in analyses concerning surgery.

3.3 Functional Evolution According to Frailty Status

Figure 1 depicts the evolution of functional status from baseline to 1 year follow up in surviving patients according to the patients' initial frailty status. Although the proportion of surviving patients with a decline increased more than threefold, from 11.6% in nonfrail patients to 35.3% in very frail patients, it also demonstrates that a relevant proportion of very frail persons actually experienced a favorable course of functional status. Among the 34 surviving patients with the highest level of frailty at baseline, functional status improved in 14 (41.2%) and remained stable in eight (23.5%) patients. In contrast, improvement was minimal in patients with an initially low frailty index due to a ceiling effect (in patients with no ADL limitation at baseline, improvement was not possible).

### The impact of frailty on VARC-3 integrated outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic Valve Replacement [^113kznCj]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

TAVR is preferred over surgical aortic valve replacement in frail patients with aortic stenosis. The assessment of the treatment benefit of TAVR in this population is however equivocal.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of frailty on clinical and patient-reported outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Methods

Patients in the SCOPE I (Safety and Efficacy of the ACURATE Neo/TF Compared to the SAPIEN 3 Bioprosthesis) trial were stratified according to frailty, defined as a multicomponent index that included loss of independence criteria based on activities of daily living, lean body mass, serum albumin, and cognitive impairment or dementia. The outcomes of interest included an endpoint integrating vital and patient-reported disease-specific health status, as well as clinical efficacy according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definition.

Results

Among 739 randomized patients, 122 patients (16.5%) met the definition of frailty. Mean age, comorbidities, and surgical risk were comparable between groups. Patients with and without frailty had similar improvement in patient-reported health status measures after TAVR, while patients with frailty had an increased risk of VARC-3 unfavorable outcome (risk ratio: 1.38, 95% CI: towards reduced VARC-3 clinical efficacy (risk ratio: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.65–1.03) at 3 years after TAVR.

Conclusions

More than 1 in 6 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR were considered frail in the SCOPE I trial. Patients with frailty had a similar improvement in patient-reported health status measures after TAVR, but a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes throughout 3 years of follow-up.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) — patient factors associated with limited benefit and decision-making: Progress has been made in identifying patient characteristics that are statistically associated with markedly limited life expectancy and lower likelihood of functional benefit after TAVR, and no single one of these factors clearly supports denial of TAVR as an option; rather, they inform the decision process. These characteristics include end-stage renal disease or dialysis, advanced lung disease (especially if oxygen dependent), slow ambulation (6-min walk time < 150 m), atrial fibrillation, poor left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LV ejection fraction < 30%), LV stroke volume index < 35 mL/m2, impaired contractile reserve with dobutamine stress echocardiography, low aortic gradient, pulmonary hypertension, severe organic mitral regurgitation, and STS-Predicted Risk of Mortality (PROM) score > 15%; advanced dementia and impaired cognitive ability, active cancer, marked musculoskeletal disability, debilitating frailty, and severe cachexia and sarcopenia (low body mass index) are other conditions for which TAVR procedural denial may be appropriate. Decision making in patients who may have reduced benefit from TAVR does not necessarily mandate that the multidisciplinary team (MDT) deny treatment; however, it should initiate a more thoughtful discussion with the patient and family before moving forward with TAVR, and utilization of palliative care consultants is helpful.

### Treating symptomatic aortic stenosis with transcatheter aortic valve replacement: is there time to wait? [^1141ZUZ6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

However, even after stratifying by urgency status, there still may be clinical factors that drive wait times and could confound the study. Although this study found no significant association between wait times and adverse outcomes following TAVR, these results should nevertheless be interpreted with caution. The primary end points were post‐TAVR outcomes, and the analyses do not fully account for what happened to patients while waiting. In this study, the rate of all‐cause hospitalization after being placed on the wait list was nearly 40%, excluding the index admission of patients who required an urgent TAVR, with 9.1% of hospitalizations being for acute heart failure. It is also important to note that patients who died while waiting for TAVR (suggested in this study to be 5% of the pre‐TAVR population) were excluded from the analysis. Mortality has ranged from 2.0% to 14% in other studies while waiting for a TAVR, which, again, is not negligible and is a potential complication of longer wait times. 8, 10, 11, 12 Longer wait times before an aortic valve replacement (TAVR or surgical aortic valve replacement) have also been associated with decline in functional status and worse prognosis. 10, 13, 14, 15 Similarly, patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who previously declined TAVR but subsequently changed their minds and underwent a TAVR months later have significantly higher 30‐day and cumulative 1‐year mortality than other patients. 16 The majority (75%) changed their minds after an acute heart failure episode. This brings up the importance of patient selection for TAVR. "Cohort C" patients, whose comorbidities and poor functional status would negate any potential benefits of a TAVR procedure, are also more likely to die before and after their procedure. Until more definitive data are available, centers should focus on careful patient selection and continued prompt scheduling of preprocedural testing and the TAVR procedure.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) candidate assessment — anatomical surgical risk factors: Some low-risk candidates for aortic valve replacement (AVR) have features that increase surgical risk, including prior mediastinal irradiation, chest wall abnormalities, and prior surgery with fused bypass grafts or mediastinal structures; in patients with a "porcelain aorta", surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is relatively contraindicated and TAVR is preferred, and peripheral vessel anatomy/atherosclerosis informs TAVR access route decisions and the choice between SAVR and TAVR.

### Transcatheter or surgical aortic-valve replacement in intermediate-risk patients [^115kZo5N]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study PARTNER 2 was published by Leon MB and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER 2 study, the trial question was: is TAVR noninferior to SAVR in intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis? In the PARTNER 2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER 2 study, the population was: 2032 patients (924 female, 1108 male). The inclusion criteria were intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. The key exclusion criteria were heart team assessment of inoperability, evidence of acute myocardial infarction ≤ 1 month, congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve, mixed aortic valve disease, preexisting mechanical or bioprosthetic valve, complex coronary artery disease, HCM with or without obstruction, leukopenia, acute anemia, severe ventricular dysfunction. In the PARTNER 2 study, the interventions were: n = 1011 TAVR (transfemoral or transthoracic placement of SAPIEN XT valve system) n = 1021 surgery (surgical aortic-valve replacement). In the PARTNER 2 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in death from all causes or disabling stroke at 2 years (19.3% vs. 21.1%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09). In the PARTNER 2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause at 2 years (16.7% vs. 18%; RR 0.93, 95% CI -1.44 to 3.3) No significant difference in disabling stroke at 2 years (6.2% vs. 6.4%; RR 0.97, 95% CI -7.32 to 9.26) No significant difference in rehospitalization at 2 years (19.6% vs. 17.3%; RR 1.13, 95% CI -0.67 to 2.93). In the PARTNER 2 study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major vascular complications (7.9% vs. 5.0%), life-threatening bleeding (10.4% vs. 43.4%), AKI (1.3% vs. 3.1%), and new-onset AF (9.1% vs. 26.4%) at 30 days. In the PARTNER 2 study, the conclusion was: in intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR was noninferior to surgery with respect to death from all causes or disabling stroke at 2 years.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: past, present, and future [^113ox1o1]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 PREPROCEDURAL EVALUATION OF PATIENT SUITABILITY FOR TAVR

A comprehensive assessment of patient suitability for valve replacement is conducted by a multidisciplinary heart valve team. Mechanical valves can only be implanted surgically and therefore a transcatheter approach is not appropriate for patients who are deemed more suitable for mechanical valve replacement. The surgical risk profile of a patient can be calculated using scoring systems, such as the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS‐PROM) score.or the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II (EuroSCORE II). Initial TAVR trials were conducted on patients who were inoperable or had a high surgical risk profile (often defined as an STS‐PROM/EuroSCORE II > 8%–10%), to explore the viability of TAVR as an alternative to surgery. Together with improvement in technology and center experience, its feasibility in lower and intermediate risk patient subgroups have since been explored and supported.

Age is important when evaluating the suitability of patients for TAVR; patients from older age groups may benefit from the procedure since it is less invasive compared to conventional open‐heart surgery. Furthermore, a differential effect of patient sex on TAVR outcomes has been reported within the literature. Females have been reported to be more at risk of vascular complications compared to men; this is likely due to more tortuous iliofemoral vasculature and smaller luminal diameters. Large‐scale observational studies have shown that female TAVR patients are often frailer and present with higher STS‐PROM risk scores at baseline. Although patient frailty is not included in the calculation of the STS‐PROM and EuroSCORE II scores, it serves as an independent predictor of mortality and complications during postprocedural recovery.

The two main guidelines for choosing between SAVR and TAVR are the 2020 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)and the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery (EACTS)guidelines. Both guidelines recommend SAVR for younger patients who are suitable for surgery whilst preferring TAVR for older inoperable patients, but the defined age ranges differ as shown by Table 1. There is a further subset of patients who are suitable for either TAVR or SAVR, and thus the assessment of individual characteristics and the balance between valve durability and life expectancy is crucial.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become an accepted alternative to surgery for patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who are inoperable or are at high surgical risk. Recent trials support the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement also in patients at intermediate risk, and ongoing trials are assessing appropriateness in other patient groups. The authors review the key anatomic features integral to the transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure and the echocardiographic imaging required for preprocedural, intraprocedural, and postprocedural assessment.

### Clinical implications of physical function and resilience in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112MMbYr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

However, little is known about the degree to which frailty or, more specifically, physical function is responsive to TAVR and the implications of its potential reversibility. This could have important ramifications for shared decision making and anticipated clinical benefit of TAVR for patients with significant impairment of physical function before TAVR. Some insights come from recent reports. Kim et al reported on functional status after TAVR by conducting serial phone interviews with patients or their proxy to assess the patient's ability to perform 22 daily activities and physical tasks. 24 They identified a spectrum of trajectories for functional status as measured by disability burden after TAVR, and although baseline status influenced the trajectory it did not determine it. The implications of these trajectories for subsequent clinical events were not examined. Schoenenberger et al also reported rates of decline in activities of daily living after TAVR and predictors of it. 25 Abdul‐Jawad Altisent et al reported on changes in 6‐minute walk distance, a marker of aerobic fitness, at 6 months after TAVR and the clinical implications of these changes in functional capacity. 26 They, too, showed a heterogenous response to TAVR in terms of magnitude and direction of change in walk distance and observed that these changes were associated with subsequent clinical outcomes. We extend these prior studies by showing for the first time specifically how physical function as measured by the gait speed test changes after TAVR and the clinical consequences of these changes. Although many factors associated with slower gait speed (Table 2) are also markers of worse survival, we adjusted for multiple factors indicative of poor health status and showed that slower gait speed was independently associated with worse clinical outcomes. As such, slower gait speed is not merely a marker of underlying comorbidities and known risk factors.

### A practical two-stage frailty assessment for older adults undergoing aortic valve replacement [^116FBcv5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite evidence, frailty is not routinely assessed before cardiac surgery. We compared five brief frailty tests for predicting poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement and evaluated a strategy of performing comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in screen-positive patients.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

A single academic center.

Participants

Patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) (n = 91; mean age = 77.8 y) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) (n = 137; mean age = 84.5 y) from February 2014 to June 2017.

Measurements

Brief frailty tests (Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of weight [FRAIL] scale; Clinical Frailty Scale; grip strength; gait speed; and chair rise) and a deficit-accumulation frailty index based on CGA (CGA-FI) were measured at baseline. A composite of death or functional decline and severe symptoms at 6 months was assessed.

Results

The outcome occurred in 8.8% (n = 8) after SAVR and 24.8% (n = 34) after TAVR. The chair rise test showed the highest discrimination in the SAVR (C statistic = .76) and TAVR cohorts (C statistic = .63). When the chair rise test was chosen as a screening test (≥ 17s for SAVR and ≥ 23s for TAVR), the incidence of outcome for screen-negative patients, screen-positive patients with CGA-FI of .34 or lower, and screen-positive patients with CGA-FI higher than .34 were 1.9% (n = 1/54), 5.3% (n = 1/19), and 33.3% (n = 6/18) after SAVR, respectively, and 15.0% (n = 9/60), 14.3% (n = 3/21), and 38.3% (n = 22/56) after TAVR, respectively. Compared with routinely performing CGA, targeting CGA to screen-positive patients would result in 54 fewer CGAs, without compromising sensitivity (routine vs targeted: .75 vs .75; P = 1.00) and specificity (.84 vs .86; P = 1.00) in the SAVR cohort; and 60 fewer CGAs with lower sensitivity (.82 vs.65; p = 0.03) and higher specificity (.50 vs .67; P < .01) in the TAVR cohort.

Conclusions

The chair rise test with targeted CGA may be a practical strategy to identify older patients at high risk for mortality and poor recovery after SAVR and TAVR in whom individualized care management should be considered. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:2031–2037, 2019.

### The impact of frailty on adverse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^112S1avU]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Aortic valve stenosis is the most prevalent form of valvular heart disease in western countries. The prevalence of aortic stenosis increases with age, and its incidence is expected to increase further due to the aging of the population. Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates, including heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. In the past, the standard treatment for aortic valve stenosis was surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been established as an alternative to SAVR for patients who are at a high risk of complications. In comparison to SAVR, TAVR is a less invasive treatment strategy. In current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease, the use of TAVR is recommended over surgical procedures in older patients with an increased surgical risk. Nevertheless, adverse events such as peripheral vascular complications, stroke, residual aortic regurgitation, and the need for pacemaker implantation are associated with TAVR. Therefore, it is important to identify risk factors that predict adverse outcomes of TAVR. Prior research has indicated that preoperative frailty is a strong predictor of 30‐day mortality and late mortality among patients undergoing TAVR. Frailty is commonly defined as a "biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors, resulting from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems, and causing vulnerability to adverse outcomes". Postoperative delirium is frequently observed following TAVR and often leads to a prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. A recent Dutch single‐center study has confirmed the association between frailty and postoperative delirium among 213 TAVR patients, although a self‐developed and not formally validated frailty score was used to assess frailty and the study population was relatively small. Previous studies have examined the impact of frailty on both separate TAVR outcomes and composite outcomes formulated by the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC). However, no study has examined the overall risk of a variety of relevant geriatric complications (including reinterventions, intensive care unit admission, falls, infections, delirium, admission to a rehabilitation center, hospital readmission, and mortality). The aim of our study is to investigate, using a validated frailty instrument, the association between frailty and the total risk of different complications in a large sample of patients undergoing TAVR.

### Clinical trials of transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^114sf6A2]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement(TAVR) has emerged as an effective treatment option in patients with severe aortic stenosis, in large part due to a robust evidence base generated by a series of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). During the past decade more than 15 000 patients have been randomised worldwide in nine clinical trials, mostly for regulatory approval in the United States, making it one of the most carefully scrutinised medical devices at the time of introduction into clinical practice. Initial trials were performed in inoperable or extreme risk patients compared to medical therapy and demonstrated superiority. Subsequent RCTs compared TAVR to surgical aortic valve replacement in high and intermediate surgical risk patients and TAVR was found to be non-inferior in all studies. RCTs of low surgical risk patients have completed enrolment and 1 year outcomes will be available in early 2019. The details of the trials, trial results, outcomes and remaining clinical questions are summarised in this article.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114KXrhK]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 aortic valve intervention — adults < 65 years: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has demonstrated excellent durability, and earlier randomized trials of SAVR versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) enrolled older adults with a mean age in the mid-80s, while more recent lower-risk trials had a mean age in the mid-70s with very few patients < 65 years of age, so the evidence base cannot be extrapolated to these patients. Based on the published evidence, the guideline states that the most prudent course is to recommend SAVR for adults < 65 years of age unless life expectancy is limited by comorbid cardiac or noncardiac conditions, and there are no data for the use of TAVI in patients < 65 years of age; the final choice is made through shared decision-making that accounts for the patient's values and preferences.

### Clinical risk model for predicting 1-year mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^115pX2Ly]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The indicators for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis (AS) patients have been expanding globally in this decade. 1, 2 The latest data revealed the potential advantage of TAVR compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients categorized into a low‐risk subset. 3 With the development of less invasive catheter therapy, decision making for appropriate TAVR candidates should be clinically determined by balancing the risk–benefit and cost‐effectiveness. A patient with a predicted life expectancy of less than 1 year is traditionally considered contraindicated for TAVR. 4 Patients who are very sick need to be identified before the procedure and are best treated with supportive care/noninvasive treatment. Otherwise, some patients classified into the low or intermediate risk category have a subsequent risk of not being included under previous traditional evaluations. Numerous clinical assessments including multiple comorbidities and clinical frailty status enabled us to identify the high‐risk patients undergoing TAVR. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Physicians should pay attention to the entire risk and explain the therapeutic merits to patients and their family. A simple and reliable tool for risk stratification before TAVR is performed is needed in daily practice. Therefore, the current Japanese multicenter study aimed to establish a practical risk prediction model for estimating 1‐year mortality according to the TAVR‐specific clinical variables.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate-and low-risk patients [^114zs6oD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Initially restricted to high‐risk and inoperable patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly being offered to younger and lower‐risk patients with fewer comorbidities who are otherwise good operative candidates and until now would have undergone surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This evolution in clinical practice is underpinned by robust evidence, but do the data support the universal use of TAVR in all patients with AS, or is there still a role for surgery? In this review, we will review the data of TAVR in operable patients, examine potential limitations of TAVR in younger patients, and highlight the areas in which more research is required.

Putting it together: CGA-FI

We believe the time has come for the CGA to be considered the standard within the cardiovascular community in the care of complex older adults (Central Illustration). This is founded on the appreciation of frailty as an important geriatric precept. Furthermore, recently described recognition of the morbidity and mortality implications of geriatric conditions such as falls, sarcopenia, cognitive and physical dysfunction, malnutrition, and other incident or prevalent geriatric conditions has begun to be well-entrenched in the geriatric cardiovascular literature but continues to experience a slow uptake in the community.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment along with physical frailty for older adults in (left) pre-, (middle) during, (right) post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure. Addressing age-associated risks lowers the morbidity and mortality implications of falls, sarcopenia, cognitive and physical dysfunction, malnutrition, and other geriatric conditions. "What Matters Most" to older patients reflects the critical health care decisions related to the transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure that could drive customized treatment plan to sustain and improve health at old age. Knowing and aligning care with each older patient's priorities, values, and preferences reflects a better approach to invasive cardiovascular care and structural heart procedures. TAVR = transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

### Clinical implications of physical function and resilience in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^116TH8BS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of frailty in patients considered for and undergoing TAVR or surgical valve aortic replacement is high, ranging from 26% to 68%, depending on the assessment tool used. 9 Including objective assessment of frailty in the evaluation of patients with AS has been helpful to identify patients who may not benefit from the procedure and to appropriately characterize procedural risk for clinical trials and shared decision making. 22 Indeed, the presence and severity of frailty is associated with worse outcomes after valve replacement. 9

While the components and definition of frailty are debated, impaired physical function is widely accepted as a core feature. 8 Assessment of gait speed is perhaps the most commonly utilized single test of physical function because of the ease of administration and prognostic value. 10 As reported recently from the STS/American College of Cardiology TVT Registry, the median gait speed of patients undergoing TAVR is 0.63 m/s, with only 24% able to walk at what is considered a normal pace (> 0.83 m/s). 13 Slower walkers had increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and lower probability of discharge to home. 13 In a recent analysis of the STS database for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, slower gait speed before surgery was associated with lower survival at early (< 30 days), intermediate (30 days–1 year), and longer (> 1 year) timeframes after surgery. 23

### 5-year outcomes after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement in low-risk Patients with aortic stenosis [^116bhE3j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Evolut Low Risk trial demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was noninferior to surgery for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. Outcomes at 5 years have not been reported.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate 5-year clinical and hemodynamic outcomes with TAVR vs surgery in patients from the Evolut Low Risk trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis to TAVR or surgery. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Secondary endpoints included clinical, echocardiographic, and quality-of-life outcomes through 5 years.

Results

A total of 1,414 patients underwent an attempted implant (n = 730 TAVR, n = 684 surgery). The mean age was 74 years (range 51–88 years), and women accounted for 35% of patients. At 5 years the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was 15.5% for the TAVR group and 16.4% for the surgery group (P = 0.47). The Kaplan-Meier estimates in the TAVR and surgery groups for all-cause mortality were 13.5% and 14.9% (P = 0.39) and for disabling stroke were 3.6% and 4.0% (P = 0.57). Cardiovascular mortality was 7.2% in the TAVR group and 9.3% in the surgery group (P = 0.15). Noncardiovascular mortality in the TAVR group was 6.8% and 6.2% in the surgery group (P = 0.73). A site-level vital status sweep was performed for patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the study. With the addition of these patients, the all-cause mortality rate at 5 years for patients undergoing TAVR was 14.7% and for surgery was 15.2% (P = 0.74). Over 5 years, valve reintervention rate was 3.3% for TAVR and 2.5% for surgery (P = 0.44). A sustained improvement in quality of life was observed in both treatment arms with mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score of 88.3 ± 15.8 in TAVR and 88.5 ± 15.8 in surgery.

Conclusions

At 5 years, patients with severe aortic stenosis who were treated with either TAVR or surgery had comparable rates of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Valve durability and performance were excellent in both arms. This midterm evaluation reinforces the position of TAVR as noninferior to surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk (Medtronic Evolut Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Risk Patients; NCT02701283).

### Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in low-risk patients: puzzle solved? [^116jsnHv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the current study is the largest pooled analysis to date and is a commendable effort to address a complex question. The complexity of this question stems from multiple aspects. One aspect is the definition of "low risk". While STS score and EuroSCORE II are widely used and effective, they come with limitations. These scores include chronological age and many relevant clinical comorbidities, but unfortunately, critical variables such as frailty, cognitive impairment, mobility, and social support are not well represented in either score. Frailty was shown in several studies to strongly predict worse outcomes after cardiac surgeryand TAVR. At times, physicians may rely on these factors in their risk stratification and choice of aortic valve replacement strategy among patients within the same surgical‐risk category. Hence, performing risk stratification for patients based solely on these scores in propensity‐matched studies precludes the role of physician judgment and clinical expertise, and is likely to underestimate the perioperative risk. In the study by Schaefer et al, one of the propensity score‐matched studies included in the current meta‐analysis, the authors attributed the inferior midterm survival with TAVR versus SAVR at 5 years to the sicker population undergoing TAVR despite a well‐performed propensity score matching. That was also observed in the study from the Aortic Valve Replacement in Elective Patients From the Aortic Valve Multicenter (AVALON) Registry, where despite a comprehensive propensity‐score matching, patients in the TAVR group had higher EuroSCORE II and poor mobility, defined by the authors as severe impairment of mobility secondary to musculoskeletal or neurological dysfunction. These markers of frailty are key factors in determining not only the early postoperative surgical risk but also long‐term outcomes. In addition, the predictability of mortality can vary with STS score versus EuroSCORE II in different patient populations, and thus examining outcomes in a pooled analysis of studies using different risk scores is suboptimal and should be interpreted with caution.

### Clinical frailty scale as a predictor of adverse outcomes following aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117W86Zz]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Frailty, as defined by the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale, was predictive of 12-month mortality following either TAVI or SAVR. Our data would support the integration of the CFS into existing risk scores for TAVI to improve risk estimates of mortality. Further research is needed to determine inter-rater agreement on CFS assessments across cardiac, cardiothoracic and geriatric specialties.

### Sarcopenia and cardiovascular diseases [^114hsdy1]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Sarcopenia and Peripheral Arterial Disease

Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at an increased risk for muscle mass disorders such as sarcopenia, particularly those with chronic limb ischemia. Among those with lower extremity vascular disease, sarcopenia is observed in up to 35% of the patients. The typical age-related pathophysiologic changes to muscle occur prematurely in patients with PAD; this includes oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired signaling pathways, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. As a result, reductions in the number and size of type II muscle fibers that occur in PAD patients lead to muscle weakness, functional impairment, and abnormal muscle histology. Sarcopenia is also a poor prognostic marker in patients with PAD. Prospective evaluations found a strong association between skeletal muscle weakness with long-term mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and limb events in patients with PAD.

Sarcopenia and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement

The prevalence of sarcopenia in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement ranges between 21% and 70.2%, depending on the instrument used, degree of impairment, and type of valve replacement. – Pre–transcatheter aortic valve replacement sarcopenia is associated with longer hospital lengths of stay, higher resource use, in-hospital adverse outcomes, disability, discharge to a skilled nursing facility, readmission, and higher 30/90-day and long-term mortality(Table S4). The transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure has substantially improved survival for severe aortic stenosis, but 50% of survivors have sarcopenia, and many of these participants report poor HR-QOL (health-related quality of life) and a decline in their overall functional status during follow-up. A study of 13 351 older adults found that 39% either died or had a poor or declining quality of life 1 year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The authors attributed the decline in quality of life and poor outcomes to sarcopenia, frailty, disability, unintentional weight loss, and inability to perform activities of daily living. Sarcopenia and these geriatric syndromes are intimately connected to prognosis, and there is an unmet need to address these age-associated risks among older patients.

### The impact of frailty on adverse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in older adults: a retrospective cohort study [^114ZFtWQ]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an effective alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for patients who are at increased surgical risk. Consequently, frailty is common in patients undergoing TAVR.

Objectives

This study aims to investigate the impact of frailty on outcomes following TAVR.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including all TAVR candidates who visited the geriatric outpatient clinic for preoperative screening. Frailty status was assessed according to the Groningen Frailty Indicator. The primary outcome of the study was defined as the occurrence of postoperative complications, and this was evaluated according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. An additional analysis was performed to assess the impact of frailty on 1-year all-cause mortality and complications within 30 days of TAVR according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2) criteria. The VARC-2 criteria provide harmonized endpoint definitions for TAVR studies.

Results

In total, 431 patients with a mean age of 80.8 ± 6.2 years were included, of whom 56% were female. Frailty was present in 36% of the participants. Frailty was associated with a higher risk of the composite outcome of complications [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.55 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.03–2.34)], 30-day mortality [adjusted OR: 4.84 (95% CI: 1.62–14.49)], 3-month mortality [adjusted OR: 2.52 (95% CI: 1.00–6.28)] and 1-year mortality [adjusted OR: 2.96 (95% CI: 1.46–6.00)].

Conclusions

Frailty is common in TAVR patients and is associated with an increased overall risk of postoperative complications, particularly mortality. Increased optimization of screening and treatment of frailty in the guidelines for valvular heart diseases is recommended.
