## Question

how to make colloid/vaseline gauze in a place that is inaccessible to vaseline gauze - and in case of emergency bleeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to make colloid/vaseline gauze in a place where vaseline gauze is inaccessible, and what to do in case of emergency bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology because "colloid gauze" is ambiguous and may be confused with fluid colloids. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts for vaseline gauze versus emergency hemorrhage control. Next, I will outline evidence-based alternatives for nonadherent dressings when vaseline gauze is unavailable. After that, I will detail emergency bleeding control using direct pressure, tourniquets, and hemostatic dressings, including improvised options. Finally, I will integrate safety, sterility, and follow-up considerations and summarize a practical decision framework with citations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us. "Colloid gauze" is not a standard term in wound care; I suspect the user means a nonadherent, lubricated gauze like vaseline gauze, whereas "colloid" in medicine typically refers to intravenous solutions such as albumin or starches, which are unrelated to topical dressings, so I should explicitly distinguish these and focus on nonadherent dressings for wound protection and comfort [^115QDzaW].

> Next, I should review the clinical context for vaseline gauze. Vaseline gauze is used to create a nonadherent interface that minimizes pain and tissue trauma during dressing changes, particularly for superficial wounds, donor sites, or healing granulation tissue; it does not provide hemostasis and is not indicated for active bleeding control, so I need to ensure we don't conflate its use with hemorrhage management [^115QDzaW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about substitutes; I should verify what materials are reasonable when vaseline gauze is unavailable. In resource-limited settings, clinicians have used alternatives such as moistened plain gauze, silicone-coated nonadherent dressings, or even improvised nonadherent layers to reduce adherence; the key is to maintain a moist, protected environment while minimizing pain on removal, recognizing that standard gauze alone can dry and adhere, causing bleeding and pain during changes [^115QDzaW] [^115szW8m].

> I will now examine emergency bleeding control, because that is a separate, time-critical problem. For life-threatening external hemorrhage, direct manual pressure is the first-line intervention; if bleeding persists, escalate to tourniquet for extremity wounds or wound packing with hemostatic gauze for junctional or noncompressible sites, and only consider improvised tourniquets or packing if commercial devices are unavailable, as endorsed by contemporary first aid and prehospital guidelines [^115Nd6tL] [^116VgWPd] [^116FSZRA].

> Wait, let me verify the role of hemostatic dressings and what to use when they are not available. Hemostatic gauze (e.g., kaolin-impregnated Combat Gauze) improves time to hemostasis compared with pressure alone in randomized data, but if unavailable, tightly packed plain gauze can still be effective as a temporizing measure; the principle is to pack the wound cavity to the depth of the bleeding source and maintain firm pressure, avoiding removal to reassess unless absolutely necessary [^112xaTjC] [^114BSsTA] [^115guVtx].

> Let me consider improvised options carefully and double-check their limitations. If no commercial tourniquet exists, a wide, nonelastic material with a windlass can be used as an improvised tourniquet, but narrow or elastic devices are discouraged due to ineffectiveness and tissue injury; similarly, if hemostatic gauze is unavailable, plain gauze packing with sustained direct pressure is acceptable, though less efficient than hemostatic agents, and should be combined with rapid transport to definitive care [^116FSZRA] [^115kJCKL] [^114BSsTA].

> I should confirm safety and sterility considerations, especially in austere settings. For nonadherent dressing substitutes, prioritize clean technique and, when possible, sterilization or high-level disinfection of materials; for emergency hemorrhage control, hemorrhage itself is an immediate threat, so controlling bleeding takes precedence over sterility, but once stabilized, address infection risk and wound hygiene promptly, including tetanus prophylaxis and appropriate antibiotics when indicated [^115szW8m] [^115Nd6tL].

> But wait, what if the wound is deep, narrow, or noncompressible and standard packing is difficult? Emerging devices like XStat or CELOX-A are designed for such cavities, yet availability is limited; in their absence, aggressive packing with gauze to the bleeding source and sustained pressure remain the best improvised strategy, with early transport for definitive control and consideration of adjuncts such as tranexamic acid when indicated [^116wPyYW] [^114BSsTA].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and make sure it aligns with evidence. If the clinical need is a nonadherent dressing and vaseline gauze is unavailable, use a clean, moistened plain gauze or a nonadherent alternative to protect the wound and reduce pain on removal, changing as needed to maintain moisture; if the clinical need is emergency bleeding control, apply direct pressure first, escalate to tourniquet for extremity hemorrhage or hemostatic gauze packing for junctional or noncompressible wounds, and use plain gauze packing with sustained pressure only when hemostatic agents are unavailable, all while arranging urgent transport and systemic hemorrhage control measures as appropriate [^115QDzaW] [^115Nd6tL] [^116VgWPd] [^116FSZRA].

In an emergency without vaseline gauze, **plain gauze with petroleum jelly or oil** is a practical substitute for a nonadherent dressing [^115QDzaW]. For bleeding, **direct pressure is first-line** [^115Nd6tL]; if ineffective, pack the wound with gauze and apply a pressure dressing [^114BSsTA]. For life-threatening extremity bleeding, use a tourniquet [^116VgWPd] [^114RUSUV]; for junctional or noncompressible bleeding, use hemostatic gauze if available [^1163MuAt] [^116FSZRA]. Improvise tourniquets or packing only if commercial devices are unavailable [^112ZYNPC] [^114BSsTA].

---

## Substitute for vaseline gauze

When vaseline gauze is unavailable, **plain gauze with petroleum jelly or oil** provides a nonadherent barrier:

- **Materials**: Sterile gauze pads or rolls and petroleum jelly, vegetable oil, or antibiotic ointment.
- **Preparation**: Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or oil to the gauze to create a nonadherent surface.
- **Application**: Place the coated gauze gently over the wound to minimize adhesion and reduce pain on removal [^115QDzaW].

---

## Emergency bleeding control

For active bleeding, **follow this sequence**:

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Direct pressure | Apply firm, continuous direct pressure with sterile gauze or cloth [^115Nd6tL] [^115dchtC] |
| 2 | Pressure dressing | If bleeding persists, pack the wound with gauze and apply a pressure dressing [^114BSsTA] [^112TnTKG] |
| 3 | Tourniquet (extremity) | For life-threatening extremity bleeding uncontrolled by direct pressure, apply a tourniquet 2–3 inches above the wound, tighten until bleeding stops, and note the time [^116VgWPd] [^114RUSUV] |
| 4 | Hemostatic agents | For junctional or noncompressible wounds, use hemostatic gauze (e.g. QuikClot) if available [^1163MuAt] [^116FSZRA] |
| 5 | Improvised tourniquet | If no commercial tourniquet, use a wide band and windlass (e.g. belt and stick) [^112ZYNPC] |

---

## Improvised materials and techniques

In resource-limited settings, **improvise using**:

- **Tourniquet**: Wide cloth or belt with a stick or pen as a windlass [^notfound].
- **Packing**: Clean cloth, tampons, or strips of clothing tightly packed into the wound [^114BSsTA].
- **Pressure dressing**: Elastic bandage, clothing, or tape to secure packing and maintain pressure [^112TnTKG].

---

## Risks and considerations

Improvised methods carry risks; **minimize them by**:

- **Infection**: Use the cleanest materials available and seek medical care promptly [^115szW8m].
- **Tissue damage**: Avoid narrow bands for tourniquets; use wide materials and loosen only if absolutely necessary [^115kJCKL].
- **Rebleeding**: Do not remove packing once placed; transport to definitive care [^114BSsTA].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Nonadherent dressing**: Plain gauze with petroleum jelly or oil as a substitute for vaseline gauze [^115QDzaW].
- **Bleeding control**: Direct pressure first; escalate to pressure dressing, tourniquet, or hemostatic agents as needed [^115Nd6tL] [^116VgWPd].
- **Improvisation**: Use clean, available materials and prioritize rapid transport to medical care [^114BSsTA].

---

In emergencies without vaseline gauze, **plain gauze with petroleum jelly or oil** serves as a nonadherent dressing, while **direct pressure, packing, tourniquets, and hemostatic agents** are used to control bleeding based on severity and location.

Prehospital external hemorrhage control protocol — apply direct pressure/pressure dressing to injury; if direct pressure is effective (hemorrhage controlled) or if direct pressure is ineffective or impractical (hemorrhage not controlled), follow the branches as labeled: wound amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g., extremity injury) use of tourniquet for extremity hemorrhage is strongly recommended if sustained direct pressure is ineffective or impractical, and wound not amenable to tourniquet placement (e.g., junctional injury) apply a topical hemostatic agent with direct pressure. For tourniquets, use a commercially produced, windlass, pneumatic, or ratcheting device, avoid narrow, elastic, or bungee-type devices, utilize improvised tourniquets only if no commercial device is available, and do not release a properly applied tourniquet until the patient reaches definitive care. For non-tourniquet sites, apply a topical hemostatic agent, in combination with direct pressure, for wounds in anatomic areas where tourniquets cannot be applied and sustained direct pressure alone is ineffective or impractical; only apply topical hemostatic agents in a gauze format that support wound packing; only utilize topical hemostatic agents which have been determined to be effective and safe in a standardized laboratory injury model.

Background

A variety of local haemostatic agents is now available to stop troublesome bleeding. These agents are indicated for use during surgical interventions where conventional methods of haemostasis are not applicable because of the site of surgery or the degree of bleeding.

Method

A literature search using the PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge databases identified relevant studies on topical haemostatic agents. Manufacturers' recommendations were also sought through commercial websites.

Results and Conclusion

A significant body of evidence now exists to support the use of topical haemostatic agents in a wide variety of clinical situations. The advantages and disadvantages of many of these agents are highlighted.

Bleeding control

Direct pressure, wound packing and tourniquet application are the mainstem of bleeding control. In catastrophic extremity bleeding, a tourniquet should be applied immediately and tightened sufficiently to stem arterial bleeding. A second tourniquet may be required if the bleeding continues. Some wounds require packing in addition to direct pressure. The bleeding vessel should be located within the wound, and hemostatic gauze applied directly to the source of the bleed, packing tightly until the wound is filled to provide sufficient pressure. A pressure bandage can then be applied over the top of the haemostatic gauze. For neck wounds direct pressure should be maintained and the need for (early) airway interventions should be considered.

5-min scene time

EMS focus should be to provide immediate life-saving interventions and leave scene towards definite care within 5 min. Patients should be assisted to walk to the ambulance where possible or rapidly extricated by carry-chair or stretcher if necessary. All emphasis should be upon leaving scene with a shared understanding that most intervention can be performed en route to hospital. If vascular (IV/IO) access cannot be gained immediately, additional attempts can be made on route if safe to do so. Tranexamic Acid (IV or IM if no access can be obtained), analgesia and basic monitoring can all be managed en route to hospital and if no reliable blood pressure readings are generated, the patient's volume status should be assessed and described by peripheral pulses, colour, diaphoresis and respiratory status.

Uncontrolled exsanguination remains the leading cause of death for trauma patients, many of whom die in the pre-hospital setting. Without expedient intervention, trauma-associated hemorrhage induces a host of systemic responses and acute coagulopathy of trauma. For this reason, health care providers and prehospital personal face the challenge of swift and effective hemorrhage control. The utilization of adjuncts to facilitate hemostasis was first recorded in 1886. Commercially available products haves since expanded to include topical hemostats, surgical sealants, and adhesives. The ideal product balances efficacy, with safety practicality and cost-effectiveness. This review of hemostasis provides a guide for successful implementation and simultaneously highlights future opportunities.

Introduction

Uncontrolled bleeding from trauma and surgery is the leading cause of death worldwide each year. In civil emergencies, the majority of fatalities occur within 1 h following blunt trauma, while penetrating injuries can result in massive bleeding within 5 to 10 min. Timely and efficient management of life-threatening bleeding can provide crucial time for further treatment and greatly decrease mortality rates. Currently, sutures, staples, and clips are the most commonly used methods in clinical settings to close wounds for hemostasis. However, these techniques are impractical outside of the surgical units and are rarely used in emergency situations. To overcome this challenge, non-professional and easy-to-use hemostatic agents are imperative for bleeding control in pre-hospital occasions.

To date, various hemostatic materials in the forms of fabric, sponge, glue, hydrogel, and powder have been developed –. Hemostatic fabric remains the foremost choice for all forms of hemostasis due to its cost-effectiveness, scalability, wide applicability, and ease of storage, transport, and use. The traditional hemostatic fabric is a sterile cotton gauze. The high hydrophilicity and porous nature of gauze allow for blood absorption and concentration of blood components. However, due to the limited clotting capability of this medical gauze, mechanical compression is necessary to facilitate stopping bleeding. Using this method to control bleeding in delicate and hemorrhage-prone organs, such as the heart, liver, and spleen, often leads to secondary damage. Procoagulants such as kaolin, CaCO 3, and zeolite have been incorporated into hemostatic fabric to improve blood clotting –. These nanoclays can expedite blood coagulation reactions, resulting in rapid thrombus formation. Despite this, blood can still penetrate through the pores of the hemostatic fabric and continue to seep, particularly in cases of hypertension. In order to address this issue, various strategies have been explored to modify the wettability of hemostatic fabric by applying a hydrophobic region. For instance, Xu et al. used a hydrophobic paraffin-based coating on the back of a hydrophilic gauze. Yap et al. developed a composite fabric by incorporating hydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) onto carbon nanofibers. Furthermore, our group introduced a flexible long hydrophobic alkyl chain terminated with a catechol group onto the cotton gauze. While this hydrophobic modification can impede the longitudinal penetration of blood through the hemostatic fabric, the issue of blood seepage at the seam between the fabric and tissue is frequently overlooked, leading to the wastage of valuable blood.

### Epistaxis: outpatient management | AAFP… [^116Ure5b]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility. To aid compressive therapy, direct spray of oxymetazoline or application of cotton soaked in oxymetazoline or epinephrine 1: 1, 000 may be useful to abate or slow the bleeding. 12, 13 Clinicians should be aware of the adverse effects of systemic epinephrine absorption, such as elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. 13 The next step is directive therapy. If there continues to be bleeding or a prominent vessel that is suspected to be the source of the bleeding, direct vasoocclusive therapy to the area is warranted. In the outpatient setting, the use of silver nitrate sticks is convenient and effective. Silver nitrate creates a chemical cautery when it comes in contact with a moist mucous membrane. The silver nitrate should be applied in a circumferential pattern around the site of bleeding before it is applied to the bleeding site itself.

Brisk bleeding will wash silver nitrate away before cauterization, so relative hemostasis is needed for this approach to be successful. POSTERIOR EPISTAXIS Posterior epistaxis is often brisk, and given the location of these vessels, it is usually difficult to visualize the site of bleeding. Compared with anterior epistaxis, patients with posterior epistaxis are more likely to require hospitalization and are twice as likely to require nasal packing. 17 As with anterior epistaxis, the physician should evaluate and clear the airway, and provide intravenous access and fluid resuscitation, if needed. Patients with posterior epistaxis generally require referral to an otolaryngologist after stabilization. Chemical cautery is usually not possible for posterior epistaxis because the source of bleeding is rarely identified. 8 The balloon is inflated with 8 to 10 mL of water and gently retracted until it sits in the posterior choana.

If cotton packing is used, the rubber catheter is drawn out of the mouth after it is visualized in the oropharynx. The packing is secured to the end of the catheter and then pulled back through the mouth to sit in the choana. In each case, traction is maintained by clamping the area outside of the nostril, making sure to provide padding between the clamp and the nasal ala to minimize the risk of alar necrosis. 21.

### Wound care in buruli ulcer disease in Ghana and Benin [^115QDzaW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Vaseline gauze was only reported to be used for dressing in about 4% of all cases, which was somewhat surprising. In red wounds, Vaseline gauze should be used because these wounds are not infected and have started healing, and the goal of care for a red wound is protection. As Vaseline gauze does not adhere to the wound surface, it minimizes pain and damage to healthy epithelial and fibroblast cells during dressing changes. Vaseline gauze is relatively inexpensive, and can be prepared by the hospital itself.

The frequency of dressing changes was reported to be once a day in the majority of cases, and from observations it became clear that this frequency was mainly determined by hospital policy rather than by wound characteristics. The only dressing material used was gauze, except for one hospital where staff sometimes used lipocolloids for dressing. Modern dressings such as hydrocolloids are superior in creating a moist wound bed, but are relatively expensive. Moist gauze, applied daily, seems like a reasonable alternative but a disadvantage of using moist gauze is that the moist environment is often not maintained. Under high temperatures initially wet gauze dries fast and acts as a foreign body, causing pain and bleeding during dressing changes. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of modern dressings for BU should be studied, as their higher price might be offset by a reduction in staff costs as this dressing material can remain on the wound for several days. In addition, these dressings increase patient comfort, and some are occlusive and water resistant, which can be advantageous as many BU patients are farmers and are exposed to water and dirt frequently.

Trauma is the leading cause of death from age 1 to 34 years and is the fifth leading cause of death overall in the USA, with uncontrolled hemorrhage being the leading cause of potentially preventable death. Improving our ability to control hemorrhage may represent the next major hurdle in reducing trauma mortality. New techniques, devices, and drugs for hemorrhage control are being developed and applied across the continuum of trauma care: prehospital, emergency room, and operative and postoperative critical care. This brief review focuses on drugs directed at life-threatening hemorrhage. The most important of these new drugs are injectable hemostatics, fibrin foams, and dressings. The available animal studies are encouraging and human studies are required.

### Efficient, biosafe and tissue adhesive hemostatic cotton gauze with controlled balance of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity [^113VGZU4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Massive bleeding from nonfatal traumatic wounds is one of the leading causes of death and disability in battlefields and civilian accidents, because significant blood loss causes symptoms such as hypothermia, coagulopathy, acidosis, sepsis, and organ failure. More than 50% of these mortalities is preventable if emergent and efficient hemostatic measures are applied. This inspires the development of advanced hemostatic products and technologies for prehospital bleeding control of wounded people, in order to increase survival rate and reduce medical costs –.

Cotton gauze has a long history as an effective topical hemostatic fabric for compressible and noncompressible wounds, mainly due to its safety, non-allergy, low cost, adaptability, breathability, stability, blood absorbency, and easy applicability. It is still the most widely used hemostat for traumatic bleeding control, although lots of efficient hemostatic agents have been manufactured and clinically applied in recent two decades –. The hemostatic mechanism of cotton gauze counts on the activation of platelets upon contacting with cotton fiber, and its quick wicking of blood fluid, leading to resting of blood cells and platelets to form blood clots. However, it's often seen that excessive large volume of blood is absorbed by cotton gauze before bleeding stops, due to its highly hydrophilic nature, porous structure, and capillary action among the weaved fibers. Those extra blood losses may be the last straw that causes morbidity or mortality because the blood volume in the circulating system is critical.

Hybrid intracavitary interstitial brachytherapy — resources for emergency management emphasize that one of the most feared acute complications is "significant bleeding at the time of applicator removal". Prior to insertion of interstitial needles, it is "always important to have a current complete blood count (CBC) to check platelet, hemoglobin/hematocrit (hgb/hct) and need for transfusion", and if the patient remains sedated for removal "this is ideal". "Intravenous (IV) access should be in place and IV fluids running with the ability to turn up the rate in the event of heavy bleeding", and "A preprocedure type and cross can also be timely in the event of needing a postpull transfusion". It is "important to have an emergency packing kit available in the procedure suite at the time of needle removal (19)" including "various size speculums, ring forceps, a long forceps without teeth, Kerlex or other similar packing, gauze 4 x 4s, normal saline, lubricating gel, long cotton-tipped swabs and Monsel's solution or Floseal hemostatic matrix or quickclot". During removal, "Always remove the applicator/needles with a brachytherapy nurse or a brachytherapy partner", "Remove applicator and needles expeditiously and if heavy bleeding, use a speculum to locate the source of the bleeding and place packing material to provide counterpressure", and "Consider having a Gynecologic Oncologist available in case of significant bleeding with needle removal".

### FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^112deX6Y]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 FIGO recommendations for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage

Intravenous oxytocin alone is the recommended first‐line uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.
If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable, or if the bleeding does not respond to oxytocin, the use of intramuscular ergometrine, oxytocin–ergometrine fixed dose, or a prostaglandin drug (including sublingual misoprostol, 800 μg) is recommended.
There is no evidence about the safety and efficacy of an additional 800‐μg dose of misoprostol for treatment of PPH when given to women who have already received 600 μg of prophylactic misoprostol orally.
The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference to the use of colloids for the initial intravenous fluid resuscitation of women with PPH.
Early use of intravenous tranexamic acid as soon as PPH is diagnosed but within 3 h of birth in addition to standard care is recommended for women with clinically diagnosed PPH following vaginal birth or cesarean delivery.
Administration of 1 g (100 mg/ml) tranexamic acid intravenously at 1 ml/min (i.e. administered over 10 min), with a second dose of 1 g intravenously if bleeding continues after 30 min, or if bleeding restarts within 24 h of completing the first dose. Reducing maternal deaths due to bleeding through scaling up of tranexamic acid for PPH treatment could have a positive impact on health equity and improve outcomes among disadvantaged women, especially in LMICs.
Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH.
The use of bimanual uterine compression or external aortic compression for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.
If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics, or if uterotonics are unavailable, the use of uterine balloon tamponade is recommended as an effective nonsurgical technique that can potentially improve survival in women with PPH due to uterine atony after ruling out retained products of conception or uterine rupture as a contributing factor.
Use of the nonpneumatic antishock garment is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.
The use of uterine packing is not recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth.
Uterine artery embolization can be another conservative management measure for PPH if technical conditions and skilled human resources are available for its use.
If bleeding does not stop despite treatment using uterotonics and other available conservative interventions (e.g. uterine massage, balloon tamponade), the use of surgical interventions is recommended. Surgical interventions include the use of compression suture techniques, uterine and hypogastric artery ligation, and hysterectomy.
The priority is to stop the bleeding before the patient develops coagulation problems and organ damage from under‐perfusion. Conservative approaches should be tried first, rapidly moving to more invasive procedures if these do not work.

Control of bleeding in first aid — 2015 CoSTR suggested tourniquets for severe external limb bleeding not controlled by direct pressure, but evidence is limited primarily to military case series or animal studies, and civilian data consist of small observational studies. There are no direct comparative studies of tourniquets versus hemostatic dressings or of using a second tourniquet when the first fails, and no studies comparing improvised tourniquets for bleeding control; research on hemostatic dressings is largely animal based. Further research comparing hemorrhage-control methods is needed, and knowledge gaps include optimal education for first aid providers and lay public in proper application of both commercial and improvised tourniquets.

Bleeding control dressings and pressure point methods — In an RCT of 160 patients in the ED with stab wounds to the limbs, the proportion with cessation of bleeding in < 5 minutes was higher for participants who received a hemostatic dressing plus direct pressure (51.2%) compared with participants who received direct pressure alone (32.5%). There are currently no data addressing which type of dressing may be more effective in the first aid setting, but 3 in-hospital RCTs suggest no difference between dressing types in time to cessation of bleeding or complications. Commercial pressure dressings and elastic adhesive dressings may be effective in maintaining hemorrhage control or even as the primary means of hemorrhage control when applied by people who have received bleeding control training, including by non–health care personnel. No studies were identified evaluating the effectiveness of manual compression of the femoral or brachial artery (also known as pressure points) to control distal hemorrhage; in a volunteer study, manual digital occlusion eliminated distal blood flow in most subjects but was not sustained, with distal pulses returning in a median of 40 seconds after brachial artery occlusion and 20 seconds of femoral artery occlusion.

### Is it more dangerous to perform inadequate packing? [^111Tvx2i]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

The trauma patients with liver injury admitted or referred to Ege University School of Medicine, Department of General Surgery between 2001 and 2006 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients who had undergone PHP to control hemorrhage due to major liver injury were included in the study. The demographic variables, injury mechanisms, associated injuries, blood transfusion requirement, the timing of packing removal, presence of additive interventions, and morbidity and mortality rates were reviewed.

An emergency laparotomy was performed on the patients with persistent hemodynamic instability despite both crystalloid and colloid replacement, an acute abdomen with the symptoms of peritonitis or prominent distension, ongoing blood transfusion requirements, penetrating abdominal injuries with confirmed peritoneal injury, and the finding of extensive free fluid on focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST). The criteria for inadequate packing included hemodynamic instability, low hematocrite values, even after the transfusion of many units of blood, insertion of an intraabdominal drainage catheter and signs of inappropriate packing procedure (the number of packs fewer than required or packs placed in wrong locations) in the re-look operation. The patients who had active hemorrhage from the drain placed in the first operation and persistent hemodynamic instability were submitted to an early operation. If there was enough time considering the Patient's hemodynamic criteria, routine computed tomography was also done to determine the extent of the injury.

All the patients were resuscitated according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) recommendations. During laparotomy, the liver injury was graded according to the liver injury scale of American Association of Surgery in Trauma. The damage control surgery consisted of a midline laparotomy with minimal liver mobilization and an initial four-quadrant packing to investigate any additional intra-abdominal injury. On-going bleeding from the liver led to liver packing in conjunction with the Pringle maneuver and selective ligation of any visible bleeding vascular structure or injured bile duct. In such circumstances, the Pringle maneuver was used for a period of 20 min, after which the clamp was released and the liver was re-examined for any further bleeding. Failure to control bleeding led to packing the liver systematically with 5–8 abdominal swabs, considering the capacity of the intraabdominal cavity, in order to restore liver continuity and to provide compression. Temporary closure techniques were applied if there were any concerns about the intra-abdominal pressure.

Uterine Tamponade

Pressure and tamponade are commonly used methods to control bleeding. Uterine packing applies these principles, making it a popular technique for over a century, whereas balloon tamponade is a more recent development.

Uterine packing is a quick, viable option to create hemostasis. Critics' concerns address the large quantities of blood that may be absorbed by the pack or hidden behind the pack before hospital staff can recognize that bleeding has continued. It may be performed in one of two acceptable transvaginal methods; both using non-medicated, dry gauze. The first technique of uterine packing employs a tubular packer, such as the Holmes or Torpin packer. The cervix is exposed, then grasped securely with a sponge forceps or a tenaculum. The stylet or plunger of the packer is used to insert the gauze into the uterus until it is packed tightly all the way to the introitus. In the second technique, a packing or dressing forceps is used to introduce the gauze into the uterus, using short strokes and taking care not to remove the tips of the forceps until the uterus and vagina are tightly packed. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should always be used prophylactically to prevent complications from sepsis. The pack can be left in place and managed in the same fashion as intraabdominal packing for abdominal damage control. To remove the pack, the patient should first receive an anxiolytic, such as 10 mg of IV diazepam before slowly pulling the gauze out. Oxytocin, administered for 12–24 hours after the pack is removed, provides adequate muscle contraction, thus preventing the re-initiation of bleeding.

### Efficient, biosafe and tissue adhesive hemostatic cotton gauze with controlled balance of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity [^115xFUA3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

When the hydrophobic HTMS-g-gauze comes into contact with trauma, blood does not diffuse vertically into the top gauze layer, but it steadily seeps out of the seam of gauze/tissue surface. On the unfolded gauze, only a small area of the first gauze layer in contact with the wound is stained by blood in 60 s (Fig. 5 — unfolded gauze). The gauze is taken away in 10 min when bleeding ceases, it is seen that blood stains the vicinity of the wound and even wets the gauze underneath the thigh, and severe re-bleeding occurs (Fig. 5a), indicating its hemostatic ability is far worse than cotton gauze. For comparison, when HTMS-g-gauze is compressed onto the bleeding wound, blood spills and still seeps out even after 2-min-compressing (Supplementary Movie 3). This is due to the hydrophobic HTMS-g-gauze has a poor moisture management ability, which is not helpful for hemostat. When applied to a bleeding trauma, the hydrophobic HTMS-g-gauze inhibits blood wetting, absorption, wicking and diffusion into the upper gauze layer (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2), resulting in poor hemostatic performance. As for QCG gauze, an acclaimed gauze for effective controlling of severe bleeding, the outflowing blood diffuses into the four-layer gauze in 1 s, but the blood-stained area on the outmost layer gauze is smaller than that on cotton gauze and ABO-g-gauze. The unfolded gauze, which is removed from the post-hemostatic wound, has blood-stains on all four gauze layers (Fig. 5 — unfolded gauze). The wound re-bleeds rather than maintains hemostatic state (Supplementary Movie 2). Very surprisingly, when USO-g-gauze is in contact with the bleeding wound, blood neither diffuses through to the top gauze layer nor seeps out of the seam of gauze/wound surface no matter the gauze is applied with (Supplementary Movie 3) or without compressing (Supplementary Movie 2). Compared with the other five types of gauze, there is only one small blood-stain on the first two gauze layers of four-layers in total (Fig. 5 — unfolded gauze). In the post-hemostasis, it is amazingly found that the wound and its vicinity is dry and clean without obvious blood-stain, and no re-bleeding occurs. These exceptional phenomena strongly indicate that the USO-g-gauze has excellent hemostatic efficiency on the rat femoral artery injury. In an extended similar work (Section 5 of Supplementary Information), we found that chitosan nonwoven whose surface was slightly grafted with USO also showed significantly enhanced hemostatic performance similar to USO-g-gauze, namely controlled blood spreading and diffusion in gauze, no re-bleeding upon gauze removal, and small blood loss, compared to the performance of pristine chitosan nonwoven gauze (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Movie 4).

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^1116xyD8]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Recommendation 17

We recommend the use of topical haemostatic agents in combination with other surgical measures or with packing for venous or moderate arterial bleeding associated with parenchymal injuries (Grade 1B).

Rationale

A wide range of local haemostatic agents are currently available for use as adjuncts to traditional surgical techniques to obtain haemorrhage control. These topical agents can be particularly useful when access to the bleeding area is difficult. Local haemostatic agents include collagen, gelatin or cellulose-based products, fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used for both external and internal bleeding while polysaccharide-based and inorganic haemostatics are still mainly used and approved for external bleeding. The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider several factors such as the type of surgical procedure, cost, severity of bleeding, coagulation status and each agent's specific characteristics. Some of these agents should be avoided when autotransfusion is used and several other contraindications need to be considered. The capacity of each agent to control bleeding was initially studied in animals but increasing experience from humans is now available.

The different types of local haemostatics are briefly presented according to their basis and haemostatic capacity:

i) Collagen-based agents trigger platelet aggregation resulting in clot formation when in contact with a bleeding surface. They are often combined with a procoagulant substance such as thrombin to enhance the haemostatic effect. A positive haemostatic effect has been shown in several human studies.

ii) Gelatin-based products can be used alone or in combination with a procoagulant substance. Swelling of the gelatin in contact with blood reduces the blood flow and, in combination with a thrombin-based component, enhances haemostasis. A similar or superior haemostatic effect has been observed compared with collagen-based agents.

iii) The effect of cellulose-based haemostatic agents on bleeding has been less well studied and only case reports that support their use are available.

### Colloid solutions for fluid resuscitation [^114npt5i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Colloids are widely used in the replacement of fluid volume. However doubts remain as to which colloid is best. Different colloids vary in their molecular weight and therefore in the length of time they remain in the circulatory system. Because of this and their other characteristics, they may differ in their safety and efficacy.

Objectives

To compare the effects of different colloid solutions in patients thought to need volume replacement.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Specialised Register (searched 1 Dec 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2011, issue 4 (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1948 to November Week 3 2011); EMBASE (Ovid) (1974 to 2011 Week 47); ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (1970 to 1 Dec 2011); ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (1990 to 1 Dec 2011); CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to 1 Dec 2011); National Research Register (2007, Issue 1) and PubMed (searched 1 Dec 2011). Bibliographies of trials retrieved were searched, and for the initial version of the review drug companies manufacturing colloids were contacted for information (1999).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing colloid solutions in critically ill and surgical patients thought to need volume replacement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the trials. The outcomes sought were death, amount of whole blood transfused, and incidence of adverse reactions.

Main Results

Ninety trials, with a total of 5678 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Quality of allocation concealment was judged to be adequate in 35 trials and poor or uncertain in the rest. Deaths were obtained in 61 trials. For albumin or PPF versus hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 32 trials (n = 1769) reported mortality. The pooled relative risk (RR) was 1.07 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.32). When the trials by Boldt were removed from the analysis the pooled RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.20). For albumin or PPF versus gelatin, nine trials (n = 824) reported mortality. The RR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.21). Removing the study by Boldt from the analysis did not change the RR or confidence intervals. For albumin or PPF versus Dextran four trials (n = 360) reported mortality. The RR was 3.75 (95% CI 0.42 to 33.09). For gelatin versus HES 25 trials (n = 1756) reported mortality and the RR was 1.03 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.26). When the trials by Boldt were removed from the analysis the pooled RR was 1.04 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.27). RR was not estimable in the gelatin versus dextran and HES versus dextran groups. Forty five trials recorded the amount of blood transfused, however quantitative analysis was not possible due to skewness and variable reporting. Twenty-four trials recorded adverse reactions, with two studies reporting possible adverse reactions to Gel and one to HES.

Authors' Conclusions

From this review, there is no evidence that one colloid solution is more effective or safe than any other, although the confidence intervals are wide and do not exclude clinically significant differences between colloids. Larger trials of fluid therapy are needed if clinically significant differences in mortality are to be detected or excluded.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^111rLqRS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RA), avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are now licensed for use with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia in the periprocedural setting. The study design of the seminal trials in preprocedural thrombocytopenia in patients with cirrhosis (ADAPT, L‐PLUS‐2) focused on achieving a prespecified platelet threshold rather than direct impact on bleeding incidence. Therefore, their role in reducing periprocedural bleeding remains uncertain. A subsequent meta‐analysis reported a 35% relative risk reduction in periprocedural bleeding. These agents may thus be useful in patients with marked thrombocytopenia (< 30 000/µl) or with additional bleeding risk factors.

The low bleeding rate, limited consequence of delayed bleeding and uncertain benefit of the above treatments in prevention of bleeding currently favors not utilizing these interventions in routine practice. At presentation with bleeding in our case, the initial management should focus on local hemostatic control with gauze compression, packing and/or sutures. This is usually successful in controlling bleeding. Antifibrinolytics (topical soaked gauze, mouthwash or oral) may be considered, although specific evidence of efficacy in this setting is lacking.

### Topical haemostatic agents in surgery [^114APmGj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Applications in the pelvis

No topical agent is a substitute for good surgical technique involving careful haemostasis. These products should be used as adjuncts to electrocautery, suture ligation, clips and surgical packing. Although uncommon, potential serious adverse effects and complications relating to the use of haemostatic agents have been reported, and therefore they should be used sparingly and only when necessary. Adverse events have been previously describedand those that are more common are summarized in Table 1. The following description of the use of haemostatic agents and techniques is based on the authors' experience at a high-volume pelvic exenteration unit, where typical blood loss in the pelvis is 1–2 l and can be > 5 l.

The choice of topical haemostatic agent and how it is used depends on the location and nature of bleeding. Generally, inactive matrix agents are most useful for diffuse, minor venous oozing, whereas biologically active agents may be more useful for brisk bleeding or in coagulopathic patients. For generalized minor oozing from raw surfaces in the pelvis, using high-powered electrocautery (80 Watts) by 'arcing' the tip of the diathermy can be effective. If the use of electrocautery is not safe due to the proximity of neurovascular structures (for example, in a dissected pelvic sidewall after lateral lymph node dissection), gently packing the area with gelatin sponges is useful (Fig. 2).

### Emergent management of postpartum hemorrhage for the general and acute care surgeon [^1176zhPJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Injuries to the genital tract may produce severe bleeding, a quantity that may be unexpected to the inexperienced. Optimal repair includes correct positioning of the patient to allow for adequate vision and access of surgical instruments. In order to gain effective control of the bleeding, the injured area should be sutured, starting at the apex of the tear. If the apex cannot be reached, the suture should be started as close to the apex as possible, then, once the remainder of the tear has been approximated, place traction to reach the previously hidden apex. If there is extensive trauma to the vaginal wall, with multiple lacerations, bruising and oozing repairs, vaginal packing to provide hemostasis should be placed and maintained for 12–24 hours. Vaginal packing consists of gauze tape, roller gauze or gauze 4 × 4's that are tied end to end, placed loosely at first, then more tightly in subsequent layers using a ring or dressing forceps to create a mass the size of a softball. It is important to ensure foley catheter has been placed to allow an outlet for urination in addition to monitoring of urine output.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^114SwE8F]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In the case of major pelvic injury, it is nevertheless agreed that damage-control interventional radiology and urgent resuscitative surgery should be initiated early and simultaneously. Adjunct techniques can be combined with a consecutive laparotomy if deemed necessary. This may decrease the high mortality rate observed in patients with major pelvic injuries who have undergone laparotomy as the primary intervention. However, non-therapeutic laparotomy should be avoided. Time to pelvic embolisation for haemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures may impact survival.

Angiography and embolisation are currently accepted as highly effective means with which to control arterial bleeding that cannot be controlled by fracture stabilisation. Radiological management can also be usefully applied to abdominal and thoracic bleeding. Martinelli et al. reported the use of intra-aortic balloon occlusion to reduce bleeding and permit transport to an angiography theatre. In contrast, Morozumi et al. suggested the use of mobile digital subtraction angiography for arterial embolisation performed in the clinic by trauma surgeons. A number of authors argue that permissive hypotension could achieve better survival by achieving pelvic stabilisation and/or angiography through DCR, hypertonic solutions and controlled hypothermia. Institutional differences in the capacity to perform timely angiography and embolisation may explain the different treatment algorithms suggested by many authors. Reports on transcatheter angiographic embolisation suggest a 100% higher mortality during off-hours due to lack of radiological service. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach to these severe injuries is required.

Local haemostatic measures

Recommendation 21

We recommend the use of topical haemostatic agents in combination with other surgical measures or with packing for venous or moderate arterial bleeding associated with parenchymal injuries. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

A wide range of local haemostatic agents is currently available for use as adjuncts to traditional surgical techniques to obtain haemorrhagic control. These topical agents can be particularly useful when access to the site of bleeding is difficult. Local haemostatic agents include collagen, gelatine or cellulose-based products, fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used for both external and internal bleeding while polysaccharide-based and inorganic haemostatics are still mainly used and approved for external bleeding.

The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider several factors, such as the type of surgical procedure, cost, bleeding severity, coagulation status and each agent's specific characteristics. Some of these agents should be avoided when auto-transfusion is applied, and several other contraindications need to be considered. The capacity of each agent to control bleeding was initially studied in animals, but increasing experience in humans is now available.

Facility survey and observation

Facility characteristics

The survey was carried out in 18 health facilities (1 hospital, 3 health centres, 14 dispensaries) from three divisions (Ugogoni, Mlali, Zoissa). All the facilities were government owned and providing antenatal and delivery services. Two of the health facilities offered caesarean delivery. Three health facilities were located in town; the rest (15 health facilities) were in remote areas.

Availability of drugs and medical supplies needed for EmOC

All health facilities surveyed reported having adequate delivery packs. However, there were shortages of some essential drugs and supplies needed for EmOC in most of facilities on the day of survey (Table 2). Oxytocin, which is used for bleeding control, was found in very few facilities (28%); surprisingly, ergometrine, which is now not recommended for bleeding control, was found to be present in seven (39%) facilities. Despite its importance in the initial stabilization of women who experience obstetric emergencies, IV infusions, Ringer lactate and normal saline were present in only half of the facilities.

### Effectiveness of the American college of surgeons bleeding control basic training among laypeople applying different tourniquet types: a randomized clinical trial [^1179o12d]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

More than 500 000 laypeople in the United States have been trained in hemorrhage control, including tourniquet application, under the Stop the Bleed campaign. However, it is unclear whether after hemorrhage control training participants become proficient in a specific type of tourniquet or can also use other tourniquets effectively.

Objective

To assess whether participants completing the American College of Surgeons Bleeding Control Basic (B-Con) training with Combat Application Tourniquets (CATs) can effectively apply bleeding control principles using other tourniquet types (commercial and improvised).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nonblinded, crossover, sequential randomized clinical trial with internal control assessed a volunteer sample of laypeople who attended a B-Con course at Gillette Stadium and the Longwood Medical Area in Boston, Massachusetts, for correct application of each of 5 different tourniquet types immediately after B-Con training from April 4, 2018, to October 9, 2018. The order of application varied for each participant using randomly generated permutated blocks.

Interventions

Full B-Con course, including cognitive and skill sessions, that taught bleeding care, wound pressure and packing, and CAT application.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Correct tourniquet application (applied pressure of ≥ 250 mm Hg with a 2-minute time cap) in a simulated scenario for 3 commercial tourniquets (Special Operation Forces Tactical Tourniquet, Stretch-Wrap-and-Tuck Tourniquet, and Rapid Application Tourniquet System) and improvised tourniquet compared with correct CAT application as an internal control using 4 pairwise Bonferroni-corrected comparisons with the McNemar test.

Results

A total of 102 participants (50 [49.0%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 37.5 [27.0–53.0] years) were included in the study. Participants correctly applied the CAT at a significantly higher rate (92.2%) than all other commercial tourniquet types (Special Operation Forces Tactical Tourniquet, 68.6%; Stretch-Wrap-and-Tuck Tourniquet, 11.8%; Rapid Application Tourniquet System, 11.8%) and the improvised tourniquet (32.4%) (P < .001 for each pairwise comparison). When comparing tourniquets applied correctly, all tourniquet types had higher estimated blood loss, had longer application time, and applied less pressure than the CAT.

Conclusions and Relevance

The B-Con principles for correct CAT application are not fully translatable to other commercial or improvised tourniquet types. This study demonstrates a disconnect between the B-Con course and tourniquet designs available for bystander first aid, potentially stemming from the lack of consensus guidelines. These results suggest that current B-Con trainees may not be prepared to care for bleeding patients as tourniquet design evolves.

### Efficient, biosafe and tissue adhesive hemostatic cotton gauze with controlled balance of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity [^117M5qVU]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 9
Histological changes of the subcutaneous muscle tissue treated with gauzes.

a H&E staining, b toluidine blue staining sections of subcutaneous tissue surrounding the gauzes at varied time intervals in the muscle implantation experiments using rats. The corresponding numbers of: c neutrophil, and d mast cells at different time intervals. Data in c and d are shown as mean ± SD, n = 6, error bars represent SD. Source data for c and d are provided as a Source Data file. Scale bar: 40 μm.

In summary, a highly efficient hemostatic cotton gauze was developed through simply grafting a catechol compound USO (with a long hydrophobic alkenyl side chain) onto cotton gauze surface. The special pendent groups offer wet tissue adhesiveness and hydrophobicity to the gauze. On basis of findings of the DFT calculation and measurements, a new physical hemostatic mechanism is proposed for this gauze, namely many dam-like barriers are formed at the contact surface of gauze/wound tissue and among adjacent fibers. These barriers are capable of retarding blood flowing and controlling the movement of bloodstream at the seam of gauze/wound contact surface and in the gauze, resulting in quick aggregation of erythrocyte to form a thick blood clot for stopping bleeding. Thus, this gauze can overcome the intrinsic high blood absorption capacity of conventional cotton gauze, making it to significantly reduce additional blood loss from bleeding traumas, and therefore increasing survival rate and decreasing medical such as transfusional costs. Excellent hemostatic efficacy (including short hemostatic time, low blood loss, and no re-bleeding) of this gauze was observed on the rat femoral artery and liver laceration models, pig skin laceration and femoral ar1tery massive bleeding wound. Its hemostatic performance is much superior to standard cotton gauze and QCG. The USO-g-gauze displays similar cell and tissue compatibility to cotton gauze. Such an idea and methodology were also successfully applied to make USO-g-chitosan gauze, whose hemostatic efficacy is much better than the chitosan control. We speculate this magic gauze may find very promising emergency-care and clinical applications for controlling traumatic massive bleeding for wounded soldiers in battlefields, civilians in accidents, patients in operation rooms, and patients with coagulopathy.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^115Nd6tL]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

External bleeding control — civilian first aid recommendations: Uncontrolled bleeding is the most important preventable cause of death in 35% of trauma patients and can occur before the arrival of emergency services, and life-threatening bleeding can be recognized by pooling of blood on the ground, rapidly flowing or spurting blood, bleeding that continues despite direct manual pressure, or bleeding that results in systemic symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, chest pain, or loss of consciousness. Control of bleeding is a foundational first aid skill, and applying direct pressure is the mainstay of treatment; direct manual pressure is the hallmark of hemorrhage control. COR 1, LOE C-LD: Direct manual pressure should be applied to achieve initial control of external bleeding. COR 2a, LOE C-LD: A hemostatic dressing can be useful as adjunctive therapy to improve the effectiveness of direct manual pressure. COR 2b, LOE C-LD: Once bleeding has been controlled, it may be reasonable to apply a pressure dressing to maintain bleeding cessation, and the utility of indirect manual pressure (ie, pressure points) for bleeding control is uncertain. COR 2b, LOE C-EO: Mechanical pressure such as pressure bandages or devices might be considered in some situations when direct manual pressure is not feasible. These guidelines are intended for use in the civilian first aid setting; the management of life-threatening bleeding in tactical rescue situations, mass casualty events, and military conflict is outside the scope of these guidelines.

### Thrombin human and fibrinogen (tachoSil) [^114mMned]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2	Method of Application

To ensure TachoSil adheres effectively, follow the recommended handling, preparation, and application procedures. Incorrect handling may result in non-adherence and reduced efficacy of TachoSil.

Cleanse surgical instruments, gloves and adjacent tissues with saline solution to reduce the adherence to the TachoSil patch. The white, inactive side of TachoSil may also adhere to surgical instruments (e.g., forceps), gloves or adjacent tissues covered with blood due to the affinity of collagen to blood. It is important to note that failure to adequately clean adjacent tissues may cause adhesions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Apply the yellow, active side of the patch to the bleeding area (Fig. 2A) and hold in place with gentle pressure applied through moistened gloves or a moist pad for at least three minutes (Fig. 2B).
To avoid pulling the patch loose, first place a clean surgical instrument at one end of the patch before relieving the pressure (Fig. 2C). Gentle irrigation may also aid in removing the pre-moistened pad or gloved hand without removing TachoSil from the bleeding area.
Leave TachoSil in place once it adheres to organ tissue. Only remove unattached TachoSil patches (or part of) and replace with new patches.
TachoSil cannot be resterilized once removed from inner pouch. Discard unused, opened packages of TachoSil at the end of the procedure.

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

### Efficient, biosafe and tissue adhesive hemostatic cotton gauze with controlled balance of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity [^114zwz9E]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Cotton gauze is a widely used topical hemostatic material for bleeding control, but its high blood absorption capacity tends to cause extra blood loss. Therefore, development of rapid hemostatic cotton gauze with less blood loss is of great significance. Here, we develop an efficient hemostatic cotton gauze whose surface is slightly modified with a catechol compound which features a flexible long hydrophobic alkyl chain terminated with a catechol group. Its hemostatic performance in animal injuries is superior to standard cotton gauze and Combat Gauze TM. Its biosafety is similar to cotton gauze and rebleeding hardly occurs when the gauze is removed. Here, we show its hemostatic capability is attributable to the rapid formation of big and thick primary erythrocyte clots, due to its effective controlling of blood movement through blocking effect from tissue adhesion by catechol, blood wicking in cotton, and the hydrophobic effect from long alkyl chains.

### Efficient, biosafe and tissue adhesive hemostatic cotton gauze with controlled balance of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity [^112sH3GA]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Many endeavors to enhance the hemostatic efficacy (reduction in blood loss and bleeding time) of cotton gauze have been made in the academic and industrial circles. Z-Medica in USA has commercialized a gauze brand-named QuikClot Combat Gauze ® (QCG), which is made by binding inorganic mineral kaolin particles onto rayon/polyester nonwoven. Kaolin can activate clotting factor XII to accelerate blood coagulation reactions, leading to fast thrombus formation. This topical hemostat has been clinically adopted in military, emergency care, and hospital for compressible severe hemorrhage. However, its rapid hemostasis efficacy is subsided because of possible loss of kaolin, and the detached kaolin particles may cause risks of unexpected distal thrombus. To increase binding stability of inorganic particles to cotton fiber, mesoporous chabazite zeolite particles were chemically anchored onto fiber surface by an on-site growth route. Such a composite cotton gauze has a better topical hemostatic efficiency than QCG. In the rabbit lethal femoral artery injury model, blood loss of chabazite zeolite-cotton gauze was only about 40% less than that of QCG. For these two kinds of hybrid cotton gauzes, it's obvious that they still absorb large precious volume of blood during bleeding control. Tuning the wettability of a hemostatic fabric was proposed to address this concern. A Janus gauze consisting of a top hydrophobic fabric layer and a bottom hydrophilic cotton fabric layer was developed. It was thought that the hydrophilic layer absorbed blood to expedite clotting, while the hydrophobic layer gives a pressure to inhibit blood diffusion through gauze in lengthways. However, blood permeation in warp and weft directions of the bottom cotton fabric layer is un-avoidable, resulting in losses of valuable blood yet. Furthermore, in most cases, blood seepage from the seam between the hemostatic fabric/wound surface, which leads to massive blood loss as well. A composite gauze with a superhydrophobic Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/carbon nanofiber (PVDF/CNF) bottom coating layer was reported to have fast hemostatic capability and no re-bleeding potential, because of synergetic effects from CNF's acceleration of fibrin fiber formation and PVDF's repellency of blood. Therefore, controlling of movement of blood fluid at the gauze/tissue contact surface and in gauze is the key in designing a highly efficient hemostatic gauze. Inspired by mussel foot protein's good adhesion to wet substrates –, we speculate that cotton gauze with catechol group on its surface may help it adhere to blood-wetted tissue, in order to hinder blood seepage from the seam of gauze/tissue contact surface; meanwhile, the strong interaction among cotton fibers through catechol linkage may slow down blood diffusion in gauze.

### Distal radial access vs transradial access in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: the DRAMI trial [^1167gBDp]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

The DRAMI (Comparison of distal radial access and transradial access for the successful puncture in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) at 3 participating centers in South Korea. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating hospital. All enrolled patients provided written informed consents. Eligible criteria for enrollment were as follows: patients aged ≥ 19 years who were diagnosed with STEMI and scheduled for primary PCI, and presence of palpable distal radial and radial arteries. Exclusion criteria were cardiogenic shock, prior administration of thrombolytic agent before PCI, refusal to participate in the study, presence of ipsilateral arteriovenous fistula, concurrent participation in another clinical study, pregnant or breastfeeding, and patients with a life expectancy of < 12 months. Experienced operators with at least 100 prior DRA procedures were permitted to participate in the trial. If arterial puncture was not achieved within 5 minutes, operators were advised to switch to an alternative access route.

Study procedures

STEMI patients referred for primary PCI were screened and randomly assigned (1:1) to DRA or TRA using a predesigned randomized table in the catheterization laboratory. There were no restrictions on selecting either the right or left side for vascular access. To ensure rapid crossover in emergency situations, simultaneous antiseptic skin preparation of the wrist, anatomical snuffbox area, and femoral region was recommended. Arterial puncture, preceded by subcutaneous lidocaine injection, was performed using either a venipuncture catheter needle or an open steel needle, guided by arterial pulse palpation. Ultrasound-guided arterial puncture was permitted at the operator's preference. Antiplatelet agents, heparin, and spasmolytics were administered according to the standard protocols of each institution. Patients requiring revascularization were treated according to the routine protocol of each respective center. Following the coronary procedures, patent hemostasis was achieved as per each center's protocol, using either adhesive tape fixation with compacted gauze, elastic bandage wrapping, or commercial compression devices. Patient care and medication prescriptions adhered to international STEMI guidelines. Clinical events, bleeding complications, and puncture site abnormalities were assessed before hospital discharge and at 1-month follow-up. Arterial occlusion was carefully evaluated by palpation.

### Polyurethane sheet: a potential substitute of surgical cotton gauze [^112qkiKt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 1
(a) An unused surgical cotton gauze (left), unused polyurethane sheet (center), and polyurethane sheet subjected to the blood-soak and water-rinse procedure 10 times (right). Note that the polyurethane sheet retains sufficient whiteness even after repeated use. Four drops (0.1 cc each) of blood were dropped at 2-cm intervals on a new surgical cotton gauze (b) and a polyurethane sheet that was used 10 times (c). Note that the spread of the blood is lesser on the polyurethane sheet.

This study indicates that the blood absorption power of the polyurethane sheet is equivalent to that of the cotton gauze even after repeated use, and it has the potential to decrease the total amount of sponge usage. Further, accurately identifying the bleeding point might be easier with the polyurethane sheet. Although a future study regarding the safety and feasibility of reuse is warranted, polyurethane sheets may function as a substitute of conventional surgical gauze, thus facilitating a more efficient surgery.

### Gauze-soaked with suction wall: an alternative technique for negative pressure wound therapy [^117VfxxD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of GSUC

In our center, we covered the intended area completely with gauze soaked with normal saline and then sealed it with adhesive Tegaderm film. After this, a nasogastric tube (size 15 Fr) was fixed through an opening over the gauze and connected to a canister and central suction at continuous pressure. We initiated continuous suction at a pressure of 75 mm Hg, increasing it as necessary if the patient experienced excessive soakage or discharge, up to the maximum of 125 mm Hg. In all our cases, we employed intermittent suction for 2 hours on and 5 minutes off.

The frequency of changing the GSUC dressing depends on the wound quality, such as signs of infection and the amount of exudate. The ideal changing interval is every other day; however, in some cases, if the wound is clean, the GSUC can remain in place for 4–5 days. In all our cases, the dressing was changed every other day.

Our ultimate goal for the patients was either to prepare the wounds for grafting or to achieve complete closure.

Bleeding control efficiency in rat femoral artery injury model

The hemostasis efficacy of gauzes on in vitro trauma was evaluated by using the rat femoral artery injury model. The hemostatic performance of the five gauzes is significantly different from each other (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Movie 2). Due to high hydrophilicity, blood quickly permeates into the outmost layer of the stacked four-layer cotton gauze within 1 s. The blood pervasive area on the gauze swiftly expands with increasing time, and the gauze surface is almost fully blood-stained in 60 s. Blood is once again welling out from the wound when the gauze is removed after bleeding stops in 5 min. On the unfolded gauze, the four gauze layers are completely wetted by blood (Fig. 5 -unfolded gauze). These phenomena imply that it absorbs a large volume of blood before bleeding is controlled, and the thrombus is easily destroyed when gauze is removed from the wound (Fig. 5a). The hemostatic performance of ABO-g-gauze is similar to that of cotton gauze, i.e. blood also quickly permeates and wets the whole four-layer ABO-g-gauze. However, the area wetted by blood on it is slightly smaller than that on cotton gauze in 60 s, and the red color of the bloody ABO-g-gauze is lighter than that of cotton gauze (Fig. 5a). On the unfolded ABO-g-gauze, the piles of the four gauze layers are fully permeated by blood, which is like the case of cotton gauze (Fig. 5 — unfolded gauze). After ABO-g-gauze is removed post-hemostasis, re-bleeding occurs. However, the blood-stained area around wound is obviously less than that in the cotton gauze group (Fig. 5a), suggesting that the hemostatic performance of ABO-g-gauze is improved to some extent.

However, as in any country, not informing the institutions of our visit would be considered to be impolite and inappropriate. Furthermore, some health workers were interviewed before the wound dressing was observed, for practical reasons this was unavoidable. The second limitation of this study was that the pictures used were not validated beforehand by experts other than the study team, and the "yellow" and "black" pictures are not completely yellow and black, but present a mixed picture. However, these cases were representative of clinical practice, where there is often a mixture of colors in the wound. In addition, we did not assess to what degree any of the health workers or health facilities had been exposed to the WHO guidelines but these guidelines are based on basic principles of wound care that nurses in Ghana and Benin are indeed exposed to during their education. Nonetheless, when conducting a future study the use of validated cases is recommended and it should be considered to train all staff on wound care beforehand.

In summary, BU wound care practices in Ghana and Benin differed from the WHO guidelines in several key aspects. The standard of wound care differed greatly on a personal level, and between institutions. Dressing facilities at HCCs often appeared less well equipped, where basic materials such as gloves and sterile gauze were not always available. Pressure irrigation was rare, a large variety of topical solutions was reported to be used and the use of Vaseline gauze uncommon. On average, red wounds were approached somewhat differently from black and yellow wounds, which are encouraging, but this was contrasted by several respondents that appeared to apply a "one size fits all approach". Furthermore, a moist wound environment was often not maintained, wounds were exposed to trauma during dressing changes by removal of dry gauze from the wound bed and pain and bleeding were frequently observed during dressing procedures.

### Massive transfusion in trauma [^113dsTwz]. ACS (2014). Medium credibility.

Massive transfusion in trauma — blood product availability and damage control resuscitation principles include that "Universally compatible RBC (O Rh-negative and O Rh-positive) and thawed plasma should be immediately available and ideally stored in the emergency department (ED)", and "In areas where the transfusion service is unable to provide adequate stores of AB plasma, low (anti-B) titer A plasma may be utilized". Delivery guidance states that "damage control resuscitation (DCR) principles suggest that RBC and plasma should be delivered by a rapid transfuser and through a blood warmer", the "Initial rate of transfusion should restore perfusion but allow for permissive hypotension until the operation or angioembolization to stop the bleeding has begun", and "Platelets and cryoprecipitate should not be administered through a blood warmer"; additionally, "Universal blood products should be immediately available on patient arrival to support ratio-based transfusion", and centers using thawed plasma early "have seen reductions in blood product utilization and product wastage".

### Efficient, biosafe and tissue adhesive hemostatic cotton gauze with controlled balance of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity [^111cP2Rw]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Therefore, USO, a catechol compound with a side alkyl chain having 15 carbons is a good candidate compound for surface modification of fabric gauze (such as cotton gauze and chitosan nonwoven) to prepare highly efficient hemostatic gauzes. Certainly, other properties of USO-g-gauze such as its moisture management ability are also essential to the high hemostatic efficiency. The blood fluid movement in gauze and around the gauze/tissue contact surface governed by the unique wetting property and tissue/cell adhesiveness facilitates aggregation of massive erythrocytes, as shown in Fig. 8b. There are so many congested erythrocytes that they even fill the quadrilateral macropores among warp and weft yarns of the first two gauze layers (the layer directly contacts with tissue is the first layer), but none in the 3rd layer, which are consistent with the observation shown in Figs. 5 and 6 — unfloded gauze. The thickness of the erythrocyte layer accumulated on the 1st layer reaches as high as 220 μm. As well-known, erythrocytes are the key component of the primary blood clot. Thus, more erythrocytes are aggregated, bigger clot is formed, shorter bleeding time and less blood loss are attained. Therefore, the thick erythrocyte layers in the first two USO-g-gauze layers serve as clots for effectively controlling bleeding. However, the erythrocyte accumulation ability of cotton gauze is poor as suggested by its sparse distribution on cotton gauze yarns with none in the quadrilateral macropores of the whole four gauze layers (Fig. 8a). This is because erythrocytes move along with the fast blood wicking to everywhere in the cotton gauze patch, rather than group together to form a big erythrocyte plug. But such a movement is retarded in USO-g-gauze by the anchoring hydrophobic chain barriers at the contact surface of USO-g-gauze/tissue and among fibers and yarns.

### Topical hemostatic agents at time of obstetric and gynecologic surgery: ACOG committee opinion, number 812 [^113oqt3i]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are three broad categories of hemostatic agents: 1) caustic, 2) physical, and 3) biologic. Because of the paucity of data on the use of topical hemostatic agents in gynecologic and obstetric surgery, indications for use are extrapolated from data on the use of these agents in other types of surgeries and are based on expert opinion. Topical hemostatic agents can be a useful adjunct to assist in the management of intraoperative bleeding in select circumstances. Topical hemostatic agents most commonly are used in situations where the use of electrocautery or sutures for hemostatic control of surgical bleeding is not ideal or safe, including bleeding in areas with nearby vulnerable structures or in the presence of diffuse bleeding from peritoneal surfaces or cut surfaces of solid organs. When managing intraoperative bleeding, there is no substitute for meticulous surgical technique. When possible, the surgeon should attempt to control intraoperative bleeding with sutures, clips, or electrosurgery before the use of hemostatic agents. It is essential for surgeons to understand the appropriate use, contraindications, and cost of these agents in order to make the most informed decision for patient care.

### Emergent management of postpartum hemorrhage for the general and acute care surgeon [^115ipqe6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A successful tamponade demonstrates decreased or minimal bleeding after balloon inflation, thus terminating the need for surgical treatment. To help maintain the placement of the balloon, the upper vagina is packed with roller gauze. The previously placed Foley catheter should be kept in place to facilitate bladder drainage. Additionally, the previously started oxytocin infusion should be maintained for 12–24 hours and broad spectrum antibiotics are continued for three days to decrease the patient's risk for sepsis. After 24 hours of monitoring without subsequent bleeding, hemostatic interventions are removed in a step-wise manner. First the balloon is deflated but left in place. If no bleeding is seen after 30 minutes of observation, the oxytocin infusion is stopped and the patient is again monitored for 30 minutes. The balloon and vaginal packing may be removed if all bleeding has ceased.

### A novel sodium polyacrylate-based stasis dressing to treat lethal hemorrhage in a penetrating trauma swine model [^116wPyYW]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To treat hemorrhagic wounds that are unresponsive to tourniquets or other traditional hemostatic dressings that need external compression, much effort has been put into developing and deploying an efficient hemostatic dressing. Despite considerable progress, most of the current hemostatic dressings still require compression and are challenging to provide to penetrating wounds that are heavily bleeding. To our knowledge, only two commercial products (XStat and CELOX-A) have been reported that may be able to control bleeding at deep, narrow-track, penetrating wound sites. In addition, XStat and CELOX-A are not offered in many countries or medical facilities worldwide. Thus, there is a great need to develop innovative alternative hemostatic dressings for the treatment of hemorrhage in penetrating injuries.

The PAAs-based stasis dressing, PB, is designed to address the challenging issue of controlling massive hemorrhage from sites, wherein the bleeding vessels have a deep wound with a narrow entrance track. The dynamic arterial and venous bleeding created by the complex groin penetrating model demonstrated that the PB group was capable of halting lethal bleeding in all the six animals (100%) without requiring subsequent external compression to the wound, while five animals (80%) in CELOX-A group required a subsequent manual compression for 3 minutes. Considering the speed and ease of application and the absence of any external compression in the PB treatment group, the performance of PB is encouraging. Consequently, PBs achieved an almost immediate hemostatic without any additional compression, which was favorable for transporting the injured patient, avoiding additional damage caused by the excessive external pressure. The differences in survival rate and survival time between the groups were not statistically significant (Table 2), probably due to the short observation time. Unlike animals in PB and CELOX-A that sustained a normal MAP at 1 hour (the termination of the observation period), those treated with standard gauze had a low MAP (28.9 ± 12.3 mm Hg) at the termination (Table 2), which indicated severe hemorrhagic shock and the animals might die.

### Superporous sponge prepared by secondary network compaction with enhanced permeability and mechanical properties for non-compressible hemostasis in pigs [^1132i6J4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A-spCS exhibits good pro-coagulant abilities in vitro

The adhesion and aggregation of RBCs and platelets play a key role in blood clotting and hemostasis, which are also associated with platelet activation. We first employed the Blood Clotting Index (BCI) test to quantitatively evaluate the pro-coagulant ability of spCS and A-spCS sponges, in which a lower BCI value indicates superior pro-coagulant properties (Fig. 4c). CS, pCS and commercially available gauze, gelatin sponge (GS), CELOX, CELOX-E, were set as controls. CELOX and CELOX-E are FDA-approved hemostatic chitosan powder and chitosan-based gauze for medical emergencies, respectively. A-spCS sponges exhibited the lowest BCI values, indicating the superior and effective pro-coagulant performance of the A-spCS. We further evaluated the adhesion of RBCs and platelets on different hemostatic materials, which showed that A-spCS had the highest number of adhering RBCs and platelets than gauze, GS, CELOX, CELOX-E, CS, and pCS, while the adhesion abilities of RBCs and platelets on the spCS are second only to A-spCS group and better than other control groups (Fig. 4d, e). Consistently, SEM images confirmed that spCS and A-spCS exhibited the densest RBCs aggregation, compared with other controls (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of chitosan sponges to promote coagulation in the situation of non-compressible wound bleeding with higher-volumes blood loss, we conducted BCI test, blood cell adhesion test, and platelet adhesion tests by using three times the normal blood volume (Supplementary Fig. 21). The results indicate that due to the higher blood absorption rate and volume of spCS, it demonstrated superior in vitro procoagulant ability compared to pCS. Therefore, we believe that the highly-interconnected superporous structures of spCS/A-spCS can promote the rapid absorption of blood and concentrate blood cells, which facilitate platelets activation and blood coagulation. Moreover, alkylated chitosan is known to enhance RBCs and platelets adhesion via electrostatic interaction and alkylation, further inducing platelets activation and promoting blood clotting. Therefore, the pro-coagulant ability of A-spCS can be attributed to the synergistic effect of highly-interconnected superporous structures, electrostatic interaction of chitosan, and modification of alkyl chains.

Extremity trauma — pain management and stabilization of suspected fractures/dislocations emphasize early analgesia and limb protection. Pain management should be strongly considered for patients with tourniquets and suspected fractures, and do not loosen tourniquet to relieve pain. For suspected fractures/dislocations, strongly consider pain management before attempting to move a suspected fracture; if distal vascular function is compromised, gently attempt to restore normal anatomic position and reassess perfusion status; use splints as appropriate to limit movement; elevate extremity fractures above heart level whenever possible to limit swelling; apply ice/cold packs to limit swelling in suspected fractures or soft tissue injury, but do not apply ice directly to bare skin; reassess distal neurovascular status after any manipulation or splinting; and dress open wounds associated with fractures with saline-moistened gauze. Additional measures include removing wet or blood-soaked clothing and using measures to prevent heat loss, removing jewelry and potentially constricting clothing from the injured limb, and not removing impaled foreign bodies.

### Pulmonary artery injury during mediastinoscopy controlled without gauze packing [^114pM3k7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The definition of major hemorrhage is unclear, though it generally includes bleeding greater than 500 mL, bleeding that requires a blood transfusion, or bleeding that requires exploration through a sternotomy or thoracotomy for control. Park et al. defined major hemorrhage as any bleeding that requires an additional surgical incision for definitive control and reported several cases of bleeding from the pulmonary artery. In the present case, an injury to the pulmonary artery did not require additional exploration. However, it was not minor, as a whole arterial wall layer was punched out during a biopsy procedure.

Some reports have recommended gauze packing for massive bleeding from large vessels, including the superior vena cava and right pulmonary artery, each of which are considered to be low pressure circulating system components. If the site of bleeding adjoins the pleura, such as bleeding from the azygos vein or segmental pulmonary artery, bleeding may result in hemothorax and hemorrhagic shock. On the other hand, such bleeding will cease development into a hematoma when it occurs in the mediastinum and the bleeding site does not adjoin the pleura, because of the increased internal pressure.

### Efficacy of a novel polyoxazoline-based hemostatic patch in liver and spleen surgery [^114pUcJm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NHS-POx-based hemostatic patches demonstrate similar or better hemostatic efficacy as compared with common commercial surgical hemostatic patches in moderate bleedings of abdominal parenchymal organs in a surgically relevant porcine injury model. Hemostatic success seemed slightly less after partial liver and spleen resection, particularly after heparinization and compared to the best performing active control patch. However, a challenge test for short application and pressure time of 10s demonstrated superior hemostatic efficacy for the optimized GFC-NHS-POx:NU-POx patch to the best performing control patch. All experimental and control patches gradually degraded within six weeks, with signs of progressive wound healing and without related adverse events. Rapid and effective hemostasis combined with good surgical handling characteristics of this biodegradable 'GATT-Patch' holds promise for clinical application in liver and spleen bleedings under normal and compromised coagulant conditions.

Some of the prototype patches unexpectedly failed in severe bleedings, causing success differences between NHS-POx-based patches. The failure seemed to be caused by blood drenching the gauze through the patch. Blood penetrated the patch and accumulated in the gauze used for pressure, possibly reacted with the polymer inside the patch, causing adherence and rebleeding upon gauze removal. The GFC-NHS-POx better adhered to the organ surface and did not demonstrate this problem. The GFC-NHS-POx was therefore taken for further development. This resulted in a hemostatic patch that not only strongly adhered to parenchymal organ surfaces but outperformed both commercial patches regarding speed in hemostatic efficacy. Rapid hemostasis is much desired by surgeons to facilitate safe continuation of an operation and minimizing blood loss, especially in emergency situations.

A fair number of patches have been approved as an adjunct to hemostasis, but often require a long application time or are not effective on more severe bleedings. TachoSil ® is frequently being referred to as the standard of care in challenging bleedings. More recent synthetic hemostatic NHS-PEG-based patches, such as Veriset™, are reportedly superior to TachoSil ®, supporting the choice of active control patches in our experiments. TachoSil ® failed in about 75 percent of moderate bleedings, which does not correspond with clinical experiences. This may be due to the strict definition of hemostatic efficacy after three minutes with gauze pressure. Clinically a surgeon would continue pressure beyond this time until complete hemostasis, corresponding with the instructions for use. While in the current study hemostatic success may have been underestimated, others found comparable moderate efficacy, particularly after heparinization.

### An effective pressure pack for severe pelvic hemorrhage [^114T68Yi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate our experience with the "pelvic pressure pack", a surgical technique for controlling posthysterectomy bleeding.

Methods

This is an observational descriptive report of cases collected by the authors during the years 1968–2006. Packs were constructed of various materials (eg, pillow cases, gauze sheets, plastic X-ray cassette drapes, or orthopedic stockings) filled with gauze rolls introduced abdominally and exiting the vagina.

Results

We report 11 new cases (10 obstetric and one gynecologic). Massive red blood cell transfusion and coagulopathy occurred in all cases. The pelvic pressure pack successfully controlled bleeding in 82% (9 of 11) of cases. Postoperative febrile morbidity occurred in most cases. There were no maternal deaths.

Conclusion

In the contemporary management of posthysterectomy bleeding, the pelvic pressure pack appears to be a valuable surgical option, affording correction of coagulopathy and further stabilization. Given near-universal postoperative febrile morbidity in our series, prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be strongly considered. We believe all obstetrician-gynecologists should be familiar with this simple, potentially life-saving technique.

### How should clinical wound care and management translate to effective engineering standard testing requirements from foam dressings? Mapping the existing gaps and needs [^113VUrtk]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, in the second illustrative case (Fig. 4b), a male patient older than 60 years underwent a left knee repair procedure and was at risk of postoperative bleeding. A conventional postoperative dressing was applied in the latter case, but it failed because the dressing had to handle a relatively large amount of whole blood, which is substantially more viscous than plasma exudation (by approximately fivefold).

While appreciating that ideally, hemostasis of the wound should be achieved before applying a dressing, and therefore, bleeding into a dressing presents a considerable challenge for its fluid management and handling performance, in the above two documented cases, the rate of absorption into the dressing was too slow and the rate of the incoming blood flow was too high, resulting in an accumulation of blood under the dressing.

This stands in contrast to the fundamental clinical requirement that a dressing should achieve absorption and retention in all cases — both for aqueous and viscous exudates. Another similar clinical case of a dressing that had failed to absorb a viscous exudate, this time in the context of care of chronic wounds, is shown in Fig. 4c. This latter case is an 82-year-old male patient with multiple venous leg ulcers on the same leg that released exudates with different viscosities. The applied dressing clearly failed to absorb the more viscous discharge.

All of these clinical cases of dressing failures described above, together with the human factors that were involved in each case (Figs. 3 and 4), led to medical device-related adverse events. Unfortunately, however, in clinical practice, such dressing failure events are often left unreported or are considered minor issues, which prevents or delays regulatory actions (contrarily, for example, to problems observed with implantable devices that are promptly reported to regulatory bodies through a Medical Device Reporting process).

### Topical hemostasis: a valuable adjunct to control bleeding in the operating room, with a special focus on thrombin and fibrin sealants [^115cTB4H]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Achieving surgical hemostasis plays a major role in the operating room. Occasionally, classical surgical techniques are ill suited or fail to achieve the desired control at the site of bleeding. Topical hemostasis may be seen as a useful addition to assist the surgeon in controlling surgical bleeding.

Objective

To provide a brief overview of available topical hemostatic agents with a focus on the different formulations of thrombin.

Methods

The scope of the review was limited to a keyword search on PubMed and Ovid (surgical hemostasis, thrombin, tissue adhesives).

Conclusion

Proven as adjuncts to surgical hemostasis, topical hemostatic agents have become quite valuable to bridge or to achieve permanent hemostasis.

5.1	Thrombosis

Thrombosis can occur if TachoSil is applied intravascularly. Ensure that TachoSil is applied to the surface of cardiac, vascular, or hepatic tissue only.

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity or allergic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur with TachoSil. Symptoms associated with allergic anaphylactic reactions include: flush, urticaria, pruritus, nausea, drop in blood pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, dyspnea, severe hypotension and anaphylactic shock. These reactions may occur in patients receiving TachoSil for the first time or may increase with repetitive applications of TachoSil.

5.3	Infection

Avoid application to contaminated or infected areas of the body, or in the presence of active infection.

5.4	Adhesions

TachoSil contains collagen, which may adhere to bleeding surfaces.

To prevent the development of tissue adhesions at undesired sites, ensure tissue areas outside the desired application area are adequately cleansed before administration of TachoSil [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Events of adhesions to gastrointestinal tissues leading to gastrointestinal obstruction have been reported with use in abdominal surgery carried out in proximity to the bowel.

5.5	Compression

When placing TachoSil into cavities or closed spaces, avoid packing because this may cause compression of underlying tissue.

5.6 Non-Adherence or Dislodged Material

Non-adherence has occurred after TachoSil application [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)]. Follow proper handling, preparation, and application procedures to reduce the risk of non-adherence of TachoSil [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Theoretically, excess patch material can become dislodged and migrate to other areas of the body. Use only minimum amount of TachoSil patches necessary to achieve hemostasis. Remove unattached pieces of TachoSil; if medically necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
