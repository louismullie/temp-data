## Question

What would be the complications of transient ischemic attack secondary to hyperglycemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the complications of transient ischemic attack (TIA) secondary to hyperglycemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causal relationship between hyperglycemia and TIA. Then, I should verify the immediate and early complications after TIA, especially recurrent stroke risk. Next, I will examine the pathophysiological mechanisms by which hyperglycemia worsens outcomes. After that, I should review longer-term complications, including vascular events and mortality. Finally, I will consider management implications and synthesize a clinically useful conclusion with risk quantification where possible.

> Let me first confirm the causal relationship so I don't jump to conclusions. Hyperglycemia is not typically a primary cause of TIA; rather, it is a risk factor and a prognostic amplifier after TIA, with diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism increasing the risk of first and recurrent ischemic stroke and TIA, and hyperglycemia at presentation worsening outcomes after cerebrovascular ischemia [^116dfqKG] [^111zFHoR] [^115B5gm8].

> I will now examine the immediate and early complications after TIA in the context of hyperglycemia. Wait, let me verify the early stroke risk window. The 90-day stroke risk after TIA is about 10–20%, with roughly half of those strokes occurring within 48 hours, and hyperglycemia at presentation is associated with a higher hazard of subsequent ischemic stroke within 90 days after high-risk TIA or minor stroke, with an adjusted hazard ratio around 1.5 in POINT analyses [^111P9Yi8] [^112zDJaE] [^112dbZ3M]. Hold on, I should also check stress hyperglycemia metrics. The glucose/glycated albumin ratio, a marker of stress hyperglycemia, independently predicts new stroke at 90 days after TIA or minor stroke, reinforcing the prognostic significance of acute glycemic derangement beyond diabetes status alone [^114E55Ui].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiological mechanisms by which hyperglycemia worsens outcomes after TIA. Hyperglycemia promotes endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, blood–brain barrier disruption, and a prothrombotic state, and it amplifies ischemic injury by accelerating anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acidosis, and inflammatory cascades, all of which can convert penumbral tissue to infarction and increase infarct volume and edema [^111zFHoR] [^115tS4fi] [^111bZ3V1]. Let me consider reperfusion contexts too. In the setting of thrombolysis or spontaneous reperfusion, hyperglycemia increases hemorrhagic transformation risk and early neurological deterioration, partly via matrix metalloproteinase activation and barrier breakdown, which is clinically relevant even when overt hemorrhage does not occur [^111bZ3V1] [^116N2Y87].

> I need to check longer-term vascular complications and mortality. Diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism after ischemic stroke or TIA are associated with higher risks of recurrent stroke, cardiac events, and all-cause mortality, with pooled hazard ratios for recurrent stroke around 1.4–1.6 and for mortality around 1.5–1.6 in meta-analyses, indicating a substantial residual cardiovascular risk burden even after the index event [^1116wHd6] [^116Fp7HD]. But wait, what if the patient has prediabetes rather than diabetes. Prediabetes itself confers increased risk of composite vascular events and recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke or TIA, supporting the concept of a continuous risk spectrum across dysglycemia [^1116wHd6] [^115F1P8i].

> Let me think about functional and cognitive outcomes because these often drive long-term disability. Persistent hyperglycemia after cerebrovascular ischemia correlates with worse functional recovery, larger infarct volumes, and higher risks of early neurological deterioration, and chronic dysglycemia is linked to small vessel disease and vascular cognitive impairment, which can compound disability over time [^111zFHoR] [^111ZVnzT]. Hold on, I should verify whether stress hyperglycemia specifically worsens outcomes beyond chronic glycemic control. Multiple analyses suggest that stress hyperglycemia, particularly when captured by relative metrics like the glucose/HbA1c ratio, independently associates with worse short-term outcomes and neurological deterioration, even after adjustment for baseline severity, highlighting its prognostic value [^116N2Y87] [^114E55Ui].

> Next, I should review management implications because complications are partly modifiable. I need to ensure I align with guidelines. For acute management, treat hyperglycemia to a target of 140–180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia, and do not pursue tight glycemic control with IV insulin routinely, as trials like SHINE show no outcome benefit and more hypoglycemia with intensive targets [^111rp2v8] [^115HomTH] [^113PhkPT]. For secondary prevention, use glucose-lowering agents with proven cardiovascular benefit, individualize HbA1c targets with a typical goal around 7% for most adults while allowing less stringent targets in older or comorbid patients to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, and implement multidimensional diabetes care including lifestyle, education, and risk factor control [^113hGHJi] [^112oP8Qq] [^113vtonB] [^113Axyp9]. Wait, I should double-check the evidence on intensive control for stroke prevention. Intensive glycemic control has not been shown to reduce stroke risk compared with standard targets, so stroke prevention should prioritize comprehensive risk factor management rather than aggressive HbA1c lowering alone [^112HYwFH] [^114iDSiA].

> Let me synthesize the complications succinctly so the clinical message is clear. In patients with TIA who present with hyperglycemia, the principal complications include a markedly increased and front-loaded risk of early recurrent ischemic stroke, higher likelihood of early neurological deterioration with worse functional outcomes, greater risk of hemorrhagic transformation if reperfusion occurs, and elevated risks of subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality over the longer term, with the severity of hyperglycemia and stress hyperglycemia indices correlating with worse trajectories [^111P9Yi8] [^112zDJaE] [^114E55Ui] [^1116wHd6] [^111zFHoR]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality versus epiphenomenon. Even after adjustment for stroke severity, hyperglycemia retains independent associations with adverse outcomes, supporting a modifiable risk amplifier that warrants careful screening for diabetes, structured glycemic management, and aggressive secondary prevention rather than viewing it as merely a marker of illness severity [^111zFHoR] [^115tS4fi].

Hyperglycemia after TIA is associated with **early stroke recurrence** [^112zDJaE] and **early neurological deterioration** [^notfound], with a 50% higher 90-day stroke risk when admission glucose is ≥ 180 mg/dL [^112zDJaE]. It also increases **hemorrhagic transformation** [^111bZ3V1] and **infarct expansion** [^115tS4fi], worsening functional outcomes and mortality [^115tS4fi]. Hyperglycemia promotes a prothrombotic, proinflammatory state [^111bZ3V1] and endothelial dysfunction [^111bZ3V1], and is linked to higher risks of infection, longer hospital stay, and cognitive decline [^1129U88b] [^1169YCno]. Management should target 140–180 mg/dL [^111rp2v8], avoid hypoglycemia [^113c617Y], and use guideline-directed secondary prevention [^112oP8Qq] to reduce these risks.

## Early neurological complications

### Early stroke recurrence

- **Increased risk**: Hyperglycemia at presentation is independently associated with a higher risk of early stroke recurrence after TIA, with a 50% increase in 90-day stroke risk when admission glucose is ≥ 180 mg/dL [^112zDJaE].
- **Timing**: The risk is front-loaded, with nearly half of recurrent strokes occurring within the first 48 hours after TIA [^111P9Yi8].
- **Mechanisms**: Hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic injury, promotes infarct expansion [^112jXg3E], and increases hemorrhagic transformation risk, particularly in the context of reperfusion therapies [^111bZ3V1].

---

### Early neurological deterioration

Early neurological deterioration (END) is more likely with hyperglycemia [^112oSJHH], reflecting infarct growth and worsening neurological status [^112VAPeM]. Hyperglycemia drives **infarct expansion** by increasing anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acidosis, oxidative stress, and blood–brain barrier disruption, which together accelerate conversion of the ischemic penumbra to irreversible infarction [^115tS4fi] [^111bZ3V1].

---

## Hemorrhagic complications

Hyperglycemia increases **hemorrhagic transformation** risk, including symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, especially after thrombolysis or reperfusion [^111bZ3V1] [^113dGGQ9]. It also worsens reperfusion injury by amplifying oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and blood–brain barrier breakdown, leading to edema and hemorrhage [^115tS4fi].

---

## Functional and cognitive outcomes

Hyperglycemia is consistently linked to worse **functional outcomes**, including higher disability, longer hospital stay, and lower likelihood of independent living [^111zFHoR] [^1169YCno]. It is also associated with **cognitive decline**, including vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, due to its effects on cerebral small vessels and white matter integrity [^111ZVnzT].

---

## Cardiovascular complications

Hyperglycemia after TIA is associated with higher rates of **myocardial infarction**, **heart failure**, and other major adverse cardiovascular events, reflecting shared atherothrombotic risk [^notfound]. It also promotes a **prothrombotic state** with increased platelet activation, coagulation, and impaired fibrinolysis, further elevating vascular risk [^111bZ3V1].

---

## Infection and other systemic complications

Hyperglycemia increases **infection risk**, particularly pneumonia and urinary tract infections, which are common after stroke and TIA and worsen outcomes [^1129U88b]. It is also associated with longer **hospital stay**, higher healthcare costs, and greater resource utilization [^1169YCno].

---

## Long-term complications

Hyperglycemia is associated with higher long-term risks of **recurrent stroke**, cardiovascular events, and mortality [^1116wHd6]. Persistent hyperglycemia accelerates **microvascular complications**, including nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy, further increasing morbidity [^116PRsJX].

---

## Clinical management implications

- **Glycemic targets**: Guidelines recommend treating hyperglycemia to maintain glucose levels between 140–180 mg/dL, avoiding both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia [^111rp2v8] [^115B1PKC].
- **Individualized care**: Glycemic targets should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and risk of hypoglycemia [^112oP8Qq].
- **Secondary prevention**: Aggressive risk factor management, including antiplatelet therapy, statins, blood pressure control, and lifestyle interventions, is essential to reduce recurrence and improve outcomes [^113YwziS].

---

Hyperglycemia after TIA is associated with **early stroke recurrence**, neurological deterioration, hemorrhagic complications, worse functional and cognitive outcomes, cardiovascular events, infections, and higher long-term morbidity and mortality. Management should focus on **individualized glycemic control** and **comprehensive secondary prevention** to mitigate these risks.

Intensive glycemic control and targets — evidence and thresholds indicate that intensive control of blood sugar for patients with both type 1 diabetes and T2D reduces microvascular complications, with DCCT enrolling patients between 13 and 39 years of age and showing after a mean of 6.5 years delayed onset or progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, although intensive control was associated with increased risk for hypoglycemia. For most adults, the American Diabetes Association recommends a target HbA1c < 7%, while it advocates less stringent goals (eg, 7%–8%) in patients with limited life expectancy, history of hypoglycemia, long-standing disease, or advanced macrovascular or microvascular disease when the risk and inconvenience of intensive control outweigh the potential benefit.

Glucose — ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) with diabetes: In patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA who also have diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be individualized based on the risk for adverse events, patient characteristics and preferences, and achieving a goal of HbA1c ≤ 7% is recommended to reduce risk for microvascular complications; treatment of diabetes should include glucose-lowering agents with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce the risk for future major adverse cardiovascular events; in patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA who also have diabetes, multidimensional care is indicated to achieve glycemic goals and to improve stroke risk factors. In patients with prediabetes and ischemic stroke or TIA, lifestyle optimization can be beneficial for the prevention of progression to diabetes. In patients with TIA or ischemic stroke, it is reasonable to screen for prediabetes/diabetes using HbA1c, which has the advantage of convenience because it does not require fasting and is measured in a single blood sample. In patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA who also have diabetes, the usefulness of achieving intensive glucose control (ie, HbA1c < 7%) beyond the acute phase of the ischemic event for prevention of recurrent stroke is unknown. In patients with prediabetes and ischemic stroke or TIA, particularly those with a high body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m², ≥ 25 kg/m² in those < 60 years of age, or women with a history of gestational diabetes, metformin may be beneficial to control blood sugar and to prevent progression to diabetes. In patients < 6 months after TIA or ischemic stroke with insulin resistance, HbA1c < 7.0%, and without heart failure or bladder cancer, treatment with pioglitazone may be considered to prevent recurrent stroke.

Secondary stroke prevention — knowledge gaps and future research emphasizes that having T2D is one of the most prevalent risk factors for future stroke after an initial acute ischemic stroke or TIA; diabetes remission can be achieved through weight management and vascular protection can be achieved by newer glucose-lowering agents; diabetes is also associated with CNS small vessel disease and vascular dementia; and it is plausible that interventions for prediabetes, established diabetes, and glucose management will reduce risk for neurocognitive outcomes and subclinical ischemic damage and discrete stroke events.

Secondary stroke prevention — intensive glucose control and macrovascular outcomes indicates less evidence for a benefit of intensive glucose control on stroke; initial major trials did not show macrovascular benefit, although long-term follow-up of the DCCT and the UKPDS showed benefit, and meta-analyses reported benefits for some cardiovascular outcomes but not for stroke; no trials or meta-analyses have assessed patients with a history of stroke; experts view any macrovascular benefit as likely limited to younger patients with recent-onset diabetes and no established vascular disease, and some professional organizations recommended targeting an HbA1c of 7% to 8% or even 8% to 9% in elderly individuals with limited life expectancy or significant comorbid illness to reduce hypoglycemia risk.

### The role of hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke [^112jXg3E]. Neurocritical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the developed world. Reperfusion and anti-thrombotic therapies are of limited benefit for the majority of patients following acute ischemic stroke, and increasing interest has focused on therapeutic approaches that seek to modulate infarct evolution. Animal and human studies have linked hyperglycemia in the acute phase of ischemic stroke to worse clinical outcomes regardless of the presence of pre-existing diabetes mellitus. Experimental data suggest that elevated blood glucose may directly contribute to infarct expansion through a number of maladaptive metabolic pathways, and that treatment with insulin may attenuate these adverse effects. In this review, we analyze the relationship between elevated serum glucose and acute cerebrovascular ischemia, and critically appraise the potential of a clinical strategy that targets euglycemia in all acute stroke patients.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^114fQYxr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Every ischemic stroke represents a critical opportunity to prevent another, potentially more severe, stroke. The risk of subsequent stroke is as high as 17% in the 90 days following the index event, but this risk is front‐loaded within the first 7 days. For this reason, there is a need to incorporate dynamic physiological metrics into risk stratification schemes, and not simply long‐term risk factors. Serum glucose is an intriguing potential predictor of recurrent stroke risk, because it is already assessed in the majority of patients with acute stroke using widely available, low‐cost assays.

Hyperglycemia, an elevation in serum glucose, is associated with an increase in lesion volume, and worse functional outcomes, after acute ischemic stroke. Several studies, have shown that a history of diabetes is associated with subsequent stroke after transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke. One prior studysuggested that stress hyperglycemia (serum glucose indexed against glycosylated albumin) was associated with subsequent stroke. However, it is not known whether serum glucose itself is associated with subsequent stroke risk.

The objective of this study was to determine whether serum glucose measured on presentation to the emergency department is associated with the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke within 90 days after a high‐risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that elevated admission serum glucose is associated with a higher risk of subsequent stroke.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to management of diabetes, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to offer multidimensional care (lifestyle counseling, medical nutritional therapy, diabetes self-management education, support, and medication) to achieve glycemic goals and to improve stroke risk factors in patients with a TIA and diabetes.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116dfqKG]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes — epidemiology, stroke associations, and cardiometabolic therapy signals are as follows: The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among US adults is 9%, and prediabetes and diabetes are associated with increased risk for first ischemic stroke (RR, 1.5%–3.7% for diabetes). Prediabetes is present in ≈30% of patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with increased risk for recurrence, and T2D is also present in ≈30% of patients with ischemic stroke with recurrence risk (RR, ≈1.6). Recent trials show at least one drug in each of three glucose-lowering classes — thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor — can reduce risk for MACEs in T2D with established atherosclerotic vascular disease, while cardiovascular outcome trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors do not suggest a specific effect on stroke but rather on cardiovascular death, MI, and heart failure.

Secondary stroke prevention — diabetes screening after ischemic stroke states that available methods include fasting blood sugar, oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c; among these, HbA1c is more convenient because it does not require fasting, has less day-to-day variability, and is less likely to be affected by medications, stress, or illness, may be more accurate than other screening tests in the immediate postevent period, and is probably the preferred diagnostic method for patients hospitalized with an acute stroke, underscoring the importance of identifying all patients with diabetes after an ischemic stroke so that they can be offered appropriate therapy.

### Stress hyperglycemia and prognosis of minor ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack: the CHANCE study (clopidogrel in high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular events) [^114E55Ui]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We aimed to determine the association between stress hyperglycemia and risk of new stroke in patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Methods

A subgroup of 3026 consecutive patients from 73 prespecified sites of the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) were analyzed. Stress hyperglycemia was measured by glucose/glycated albumin (GA) ratio. Glucose/GA ratio was calculated by fasting plasma glucose divided by GA and categorized into 4 even groups according to the quartiles. The primary outcome was a new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) at 90 days. We assessed the association between glucose/GA ratio and risk of stroke by multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for potential covariates.

Results

Among 3026 patients included, a total of 299 (9.9%) new stroke occurred at 3 months. Compared with patients with the lowest quartile, patients with the highest quartile of glucose/GA ratio was associated with an increased risk of stroke at 3 months after adjusted for potential covariates (12.0% versus 9.2%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–2.01). Similar results were observed after further adjusted for fasting plasma glucose. We also observed that higher level of glucose/GA ratio was associated with an increased risk of stroke with a threshold of 0.29 using a Cox regression model with restricted cubic spline.

Conclusions

Stress hyperglycemia, measured by glucose/GA ratio, was associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^112VAPeM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Complications following a stroke significantly contribute to elevated morbidity and mortality rates, with approximately 5.5 million stroke-related deaths reported globally each year. END, characterized by the worsening of neurological status within the first few hours or days post-stroke, affects approximately 10–20% of patients. END is linked to poorer functional outcomes, increased disability, and higher mortality rates. Preventive strategies for END emphasize maintaining hemodynamic stability, rigorous blood glucose control, and close monitoring for any signs of deterioration. The variability in the incidence of END underscores the necessity for personalized care and highlights the need for continued research to identify high-risk individuals and develop targeted interventions.

The pathophysiology of END in ischemic stroke is multifaceted and not fully understood. END can arise from various mechanisms, including the expansion of the initial infarct due to ongoing ischemia, unstable atherosclerotic plaques, cerebral edema leading to increased intracranial pressure, hemorrhagic transformation within the infarcted area, and secondary embolic events. Additionally, post-ischemic inflammatory responses can exacerbate tissue damage, significantly contributing to the onset of END. Despite extensive research, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the specific triggers and underlying mechanisms of END. The heterogeneity of stroke pathology, along with the influence of comorbidities and pre-existing conditions, complicates the identification of consistent predictors or therapeutic targets for END. Moreover, the variability in the timing of neurological decline among patients presents challenges in determining optimal intervention windows.

### Transient ischemic attack overview: defining the challenges for improving outcomes [^111P9Yi8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attacks are reversible neurologic events that herald potentially catastrophic strokes. Well designed studies have documented that approximately 10% of patients who have a transient ischemic attack will have a stroke within the succeeding 90 days; half of these strokes occur within 48 hours of the transient ischemic attack. Improved outcomes from transient ischemic attacks require a heightened awareness of the clinical features of transient ischemic attacks on the part of both patients and physicians. The significant potential for stroke in the immediate days after the transient ischemic attack imposes an urgency in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients. A review of the literature suggests that there is a need for pathways to promote facilitated evaluations of transient ischemic attack patients in order to identify underlying correctable pathologies, and to direct medical and surgical management strategies.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to individualize the goal of glycemic control based on the risk for adverse events, patient characteristics, and preferences in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and diabetes. Target HbA1c ≤ 7% in most patients, especially < 65 years of age and without life-limiting comorbid illness, to reduce the risk for microvascular complications.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113YwziS]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — laboratory and metabolic assessment. Control of hypertension, blood glucose, and lipids has been proven effective in reducing ischemic stroke risk; fasting is not routinely required for lipid testing except for patients with nonfasting triglycerides of > 440 mg/dL, who should have fasting levels drawn. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing can detect new type 2 diabetes in ≈11.5% and prediabetes in 36.2% of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. In lacunar infarction, chronic kidney disease is associated with a 50% increase in risk of recurrent stroke. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time testing screens for relevant clotting and bleeding disorders; an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time can be seen with heparin use, lupus anticoagulant, or clotting factor deficiencies.

### Prognostic significance of diabetes and stress hyperglycemia in acute stroke patients [^115XT4Gs]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

What causes hyperglycemia in Group 1?

The most probable cause of hyperglycemia, generally transient, characterizing Group 1, was probably the marked acute phase, witnessed by the increase in the indices of inflammation, in turn an expression of the severity and extent of cerebral lesions. There are various mechanisms by which hyperglycemia can follow the acute phase. It has already been mentioned that inflammatory cytokines, by binding to insulin receptors, may cause hyperglycemia. The main mechanism seems to be reduced tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Another important mechanism linking the acute phase with hyperglycemia is the secretion of adrenal stress hormones. In this regard, if in acute stroke patients van Kooten et al. found no correlation between norepinephrine levels and blood glucose, Tracey et al. found a correlation between cortisol levels and cerebral lesion volume, so that the relationship between blood glucose and mortality disappeared by adjusting the analysis for cortisol levels. Finally, a further possible cause of hyperglycemia is the presence, among non-diabetic patients, of high risk prediabetic patients (about 50% in Group 1), who may be particularly likely to develop hyperglycemia in stressful conditions. In this regard, in a group of 106 patients with ischemic stroke, Vancheri et al. found that more than two-thirds of them had impaired glucose tolerance, even 3 months after the acute stroke.

The presence, in Group 1, of high risk prediabetic patients, could also explain the higher prevalence, compared to Group 0, of atherosclerotic lesions of large vessels, as documented by the significant higher frequency of arterial revascularizations and (although not significantly) of carotid stenosis, previous myocardial infarct and previous stroke. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was also significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 0 (in the TOAST classification, strokes classified as cardioembolic were less numerous than the cases of atrial fibrillation, because some cases of atrial fibrillation had been classified as undetermined, being associated with other possible causes of stroke).

Thus, Group 1 included many strokes associated with atrial fibrillation and large vessel atherosclerosis, all conditions that tend to generate large ischemic cerebral lesions, thus determining an important acute stress condition. Transient hyperglycemia, accentuated by the possible presence of prediabetes, could be the consequence and the indicator of this stress condition.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^112zDJaE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

One‐quarter of all strokes are subsequent events. It is not known whether higher levels of blood glucose are associated with an increased risk of subsequent stroke after high‐risk transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke.

Methods and Results

We performed a secondary analysis of the POINT (Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) trial to evaluate the relationship between serum glucose hyperglycemia (≥ 180 mg/dL) versus normoglycemia (< 180 mg/dL) before enrollment in the trial and outcomes at 90 days. The primary end point was subsequent ischemic stroke modeled by a multivariable Cox model with adjustment for age, sex, race, ethnicity, study treatment assignment, index event, and key comorbidities. Of 4878 patients included in this study, 267 had a recurrent stroke. There was a higher hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia compared with normoglycemia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% CI, 1.05–2.14]). Treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy was not associated with a reduced hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.69–2.03]), though the wide confidence interval does not exclude a treatment effect. When modeled as a continuous variable, there was evidence of a nonlinear association between serum glucose and the hazard of subsequent stroke (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia on presentation is associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke after high‐risk transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. A rapid, simple assay of serum glucose may be a useful biomarker to identify patients at particularly high risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.

There was a higher hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia compared with normoglycemia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% CI, 1.05–2.14]). Treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy was not associated with a reduced hazard of subsequent stroke in patients with hyperglycemia (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.69–2.03]), though the wide confidence interval does not exclude a treatment effect. When modeled as a continuous variable, there was evidence of a nonlinear association between serum glucose and the hazard of subsequent stroke (P < 0.001). Conclusions Hyperglycemia on presentation is associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke after high-risk transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. A rapid, simple assay of serum glucose may be a useful biomarker to identify patients at particularly high risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.

### Diabetes, hyperglycaemia, and acute ischaemic stroke [^111zFHoR]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and ischaemic stroke often arise together. People with diabetes have more than double the risk of ischaemic stroke after correction for other risk factors, relative to individuals without diabetes. Multifactorial treatment of risk factors for stroke-in particular, lifestyle factors, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia-will prevent a substantial number of these disabling strokes. Hyperglycaemia occurs in 30–40% of patients with acute ischaemic stroke, also in individuals without a known history of diabetes. Admission hyperglycaemia is associated with poor functional outcome, possibly through aggravation of ischaemic damage by disturbing recanalisation and increasing reperfusion injury. Uncertainty surrounds the question of whether glucose-lowering treatment for early stroke can improve clinical outcome. Achievement of normoglycaemia in the early stage of stroke can be difficult, and the possibility of hypoglycaemia remains a concern. Phase 3 studies of glucose-lowering therapy in acute ischaemic stroke are underway.

### Effect of hyperglycemia on stroke outcomes [^1169YCno]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review published data about the relationship between hyperglycemia and the outcome of patients with stroke.

Results

Stroke is the most frequent cause of permanent disability in the Western world and the third leading cause of death among Americans. Each year, more than 500,000 Americans have a cerebrovascular accident. In the medical literature, numerous reports have discussed how hyperglycemia during acute stroke, regardless of a patient's prior diabetes status, has been associated with significantly higher morbidity, higher mortality, longer hospital stays, reduced long-term recovery, and diminished ability to return to work. In the United States alone, an estimated $300 million in additional health-care costs are incurred among hospitalized patients with stroke who also have high blood glucose levels. Treatment of hyperglycemia has safely, successfully, and effectively yielded glucose levels in the normal range in the hospital setting under the direction of specialty physicians and should be implemented in patients with stroke.

Conclusion

Until convincing randomized prospective trials prove that tight glycemic control does not improve stroke outcomes, the overwhelming preponderance of data suggests that aggressive glucose management should be the standard care in all patients with stroke and hyperglycemia.

### Relationship between glycated hemoglobin and stroke risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UNgP4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Strokes represent a heterogeneous group of vascular pathologies that collectively act as a major global burden of mortality and lifelong morbidity. Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of stroke, particularly ischemic stroke, with type 2 diabetes mellitus alone known to increase stroke risk 1.5 to 4 fold. 1 Macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus (ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) represent a major cause of diabetes mellitus related mortality and health‐related expenditure. 2, 3

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA₁c) is a validated marker of 2 to 3 month glycemic control used within routine diabetes mellitus care. Current American Diabetes Association (ADA) diabetes mellitus management guidelines recommend a base target of HbA₁c < 7.0% within routine diabetes mellitus care of non‐pregnant adults. 4 This target is most validated for microvascular complication risk reduction and has unclear implications for optimal macrovascular risk reductions. Long‐term follow‐up studies of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated beneficial effects on long‐term macrovascular outcomes with more intensive glycemic control, thereby suggesting a metabolic memory effect for hyperglycemia. 5, 6

Up to one half of all patients presenting with acute stroke have previously unknown abnormalities of glucose tolerance, with 20% to 40% of patients presenting with hyperglycemia at hospital admission. 7 Chronic hyperglycemia has been linked with several stroke risk factors including accelerated atherosclerosis, increased carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), cardiomyocyte dysfunction, atrial fibrillation (AF), and ischemic heart disease. 8, 9, 10, 11 In non–diabetes mellitus patients with insulin resistance and recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, long‐term treatment with pioglitazone reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 12 The outcomes of this trial suggested that in the ischemic stroke subgroup, anti‐hyperglycemic medication may need to start at lower HbA₁c thresholds than currently accepted levels. 12

No systematic review and meta‐analysis has generated consensus regarding the specific relationship between rising HbA 1c level and stroke risk. 13, 14 We therefore aimed to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational studies to examine and determine a quantifiable risk relationship for the association between rising HbA 1c level and stroke risk, stratified by diabetes mellitus status, stroke temporality, and stroke subtype.

### Transient ischemic attacks: part I. diagnosis and evaluation [^112VRDW3]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Transient ischemic attack is no longer considered a benign event but, rather, a critical harbinger of impending stroke. Failure to quickly recognize and evaluate this warning sign could mean missing an opportunity to prevent permanent disability or death. The 90-day risk of stroke after a transient ischemic attack has been estimated to be approximately 10 percent, with one half of strokes occurring within the first two days of the attack. The 90-day stroke risk is even higher when a transient ischemic attack results from internal carotid artery stenosis. Most patients reporting symptoms of transient ischemic attack should be sent to an emergency department. Patients who arrive at the emergency department within 180 minutes of symptom onset should undergo an expedited history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory tests, to determine if they are candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Initial testing should include complete blood count with platelet count, prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and electrolyte and glucose levels. Computed tomographic scanning of the head should be performed immediately to ensure that there is no evidence of brain hemorrhage or mass. A transient ischemic attack can be misdiagnosed as migraine, seizure, peripheral neuropathy, or anxiety.

### Influence of prestroke glycemic status on outcomes by age in patients with acute ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus [^1174abDC]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for stroke in the general population and for vascular events after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes, admission HbA1c levels have been linked to 1‐year vascular events and 3‐month functional outcomes. However, clinical trials have not demonstrated a benefit of intensive glucose control on early recurrent stroke or functional outcomes in these patients.

The European or American stroke guidelines suggest maintaining HbA1c below 7.0% in patients with ischemic stroke, but emphasize that targets should be individualized based on age and patient‐specific factors. However, age‐specific HbA1c targets for stroke patients are not well‐defined, and research in this area remains limited. Guidelines for diabetes management generally recommend an HbA1c target of 7%–8%, or even 8%–9% for elderly individuals with limited life expectancy or significant comorbidities, to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Notably, the risk of vascular events associated with diabetes is higher in younger adults than in older adults. Previous studies have often categorized age groups simply as < 65 years versus ≥ 65 years, lacking detailed granularity. Given that ischemic stroke and TIA patients are typically older and have preexisting vascular conditions, the impact of prestroke glycemic control on stroke prognosis may vary by age.

This study aims to explore the association between admission HbA1c levels and the risk of subsequent vascular events, stratified by age, in patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes. By classifying patients into more specific age and HbA1c groups, we seek to identify potential variations in outcomes across different age groups.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — IV alteplase general principles state that in patients eligible for IV alteplase, benefit of therapy is time dependent, and treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible (I A). In patients undergoing fibrinolytic therapy, physicians should be prepared to treat potential emergent adverse effects, including bleeding complications and angioedema that may cause partial airway obstruction (I B-NR). The potential risks should be discussed during IV alteplase eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision-making (I C-EO). Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation, and IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions (III: No Benefit B-NR). Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement (III: Harm C-EO).

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to patients with stroke, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to individualize the goal of glycemic control based on the risk for adverse events, patient characteristics, and preferences in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and diabetes. Target HbA1c ≤ 7% in most patients, especially < 65 years of age and without life-limiting comorbid illness, to reduce the risk for microvascular complications.

### Admission hyperglycemia predicts a worse outcome in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis [^117MYQWS]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

What remains unclear is whether hyperglycemia is merely an epiphenomenon of underlying stroke severity or if it is itself directly harmful to ischemic brain tissue. After adjustment for clinical stroke severity, a dose-response relationship between baseline glucose and unfavorable outcome is still suggested by our results and those of others. There is ample animal literature suggesting plausible mechanisms by which glucose may exert a deleterious effect on ischemic brain, including cellular acidosis caused by anaerobic glycolysis, enhanced free radical production, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, impaired mitochondrial function, influx of intracellular Ca²⁺, and cellular edema.

However, noncausal explanations have also been proposed. Baseline hyperglycemia may represent an acute stress response from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis causing a rise in cortisol and catecholamines and, therefore, may simply be indicative of underlying stroke severity. Furthermore, it may also be a result of injury or irritation of brain areas involved in glucose regulation, a theory supported by the association of hyperglycemia with strokes involving the insula. Finally, hyperglycemia may reflect previously undiagnosed diabetes.

Lifestyle and behavioral interventions in type 2 diabetes — optimal management is multidimensional, including medical nutritional therapy, lifestyle counseling, diabetes self-management education and support, and medication therapy; for patients with overweight or obesity, it can be helpful to include intensive behavioral counseling for weight loss, and weight loss can result in diabetes remission for some patients and reduced medication use in most; among patients with impaired glucose tolerance, multifactorial interventions reduce risk for progression to diabetes by 43% to 58% during 3 to 5 years of treatment, with benefit proportional to the achievement of lifestyle goals.

### Impaired glucose tolerance increases stroke risk in nondiabetic patients with transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke [^114Z3PKb]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Impaired glucose tolerance, an intermediate metabolic state between normal glucose and diabetes characterized by nonfasting glucose levels between 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L, is associated with an increased stroke risk in patients with coronary heart disease. Whether impaired glucose tolerance increases the risk of stroke in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke is unknown.

Methods

In total, 3127 patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke participated in the Dutch TIA Trial, testing 2 different doses of aspirin and atenolol versus placebo. We estimated the risk of stroke and the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death in relation to baseline nonfasting glucose levels (mean 6.0, SD 2.2 mmol/L) with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

During 2.6 years follow-up, 272 patients (9%) experienced a stroke and 200 (6%) a myocardial infarction or cardiac death. We found a J-shaped relationship between baseline nonfasting glucose levels and stroke risk. Stroke risk was nearly doubled in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (glucose 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) compared with those with normal glucose levels (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0) and nearly tripled in diabetic patients (glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L; HR 2.8, 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1). Patients with low glucose levels (< 4.6 mmol/L) had a 50% increased stroke risk (HR 1.5, 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.2) compared with those with normal glucose levels. There was no association between glucose levels and risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death.

Conclusions

Impaired glucose tolerance is an independent risk factor for future stroke in nondiabetic patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke.

### Impact of glycemic treatment and blood glucose monitoring on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke without prior diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study [^114ANxcB]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke, or central nervous system infarction, disrupts brain blood supply, leading to potential cell death and significant neurological deficits. Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) often face deteriorating cognitive, autonomic, and executive functions. Stroke recurrence is frequent and increases over time, with rates from 5.4% to 10.4% within one year and from 12.9% to 14.2% within ten years post-stroke, significantly impacting mortality and functional disability.

Hyperglycemia, present in 40–60% of AIS cases, responds to the acute stress of brain damage and varies across patients with no diabetes, established, or newly diagnosed diabetes, leading to what is known as poststroke hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia initially serves as an essential survival response that typically subsides shortly after an AIS. However, persistent hyperglycemia beyond the acute phase significantly exacerbates morbidity and mortality risks. While hyperglycemia is generally defined as a blood glucose level exceeding 108 mg/dL, the specific threshold for clinical intervention may vary depending on the healthcare setting and the patient's condition.

Hyperglycemia within 48 h of AIS predicts stroke recurrence. The acute-to-chronic glycemic ratio, defined as the admission glucose level divided by chronic glucose levels, has been shown to correlate positively with poor prognosis and increased mortality at a 3-month follow-up in AIS. Additionally, a two-year cohort study in China identified diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor for recurrence after the first ischemic stroke, and a systematic review indicated that patients with poststroke hyperglycemia have a higher relative risk of in-hospital or 30-day mortality compared to those with normoglycemia — 1.30 times higher for those previously diagnosed with DM and 3.07 times higher for those without. Both admission hyperglycemia and the combination of hyperglycemia with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are risk factors for short-term mortality (3 months to 1-year post-stroke) in AIS patients, particularly those without prior diabetes. Although poststroke hyperglycemia is a modifiable risk factor for brain damage, and glucose-lowering therapies can reduce such risks, tight glycemic control has not significantly improved survival or functional outcomes and may heighten hypoglycemia risk. Current ischemic stroke management guidelines emphasize glucose monitoring but do not specify glucose level thresholds for intervention or recommend specific insulin treatment regimens, nor do they recommend a specific frequency for blood glucose monitoring (BGM).

### Hyperglycemia in acute ischemic stroke: pathophysiology and clinical management [^115kBmqE]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute ischemic stroke frequently test positive for hyperglycemia, which is associated with a poor clinical outcome. This association between poor glycemic control and an unfavorable prognosis is particularly evident in patients with persistent hyperglycemia, patients without a known history of diabetes mellitus, and patients with cortical infarction. To date, however, only one large clinical trial has specifically investigated the effect of glycemic control on stroke outcome. This trial failed to show a clinical benefit, but had several limitations. Despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting the use of glycemic control in the treatment of patients with stroke, international guidelines recommend treating this subset of critically ill patients for hyperglycemia in the hospital setting. This treatment regime is, however, particularly challenging in patients with stroke, and is associated with an increased risk of the patient developing hypoglycemia. Here we review the available evidence linking hyperglycemia to a poor clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke. We highlight the pathophysiological mechanisms that might underlie the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia on acute stroke prognosis and systematically review the literature concerning tight glycemic control after stroke. Finally, we provide directions on the use of insulin treatment strategies to control hyperglycemia in this patient group.

### Management of poststroke hyperglycemia: results of the TEXAIS randomized clinical trial [^111bZ3V1]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute elevations in blood glucose are associated with adverse outcomes in many conditions, including myocardial infarction, critical illness, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. Hyperglycemia promotes cellular acidosis and oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and a procoagulation/proinflammatory state. Many of these effects are exacerbated by fluctuating raised glucose levels, rather than chronic hyperglycemia per se.

Poststroke hyperglycemia (PSH) is reported in ≈30% to 40% of patients at admission, more in those with diabetes. – The timing of PSH is also variable — up to 30% of patients with normal blood glucose on admission may go on to develop PSH within 48 hours (or later) of stroke onset. PSH can lead to accelerated brain infarction (penumbra-into-infarction conversion) and is an independent risk factor for reduced tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) recanalization, with reduced plasma fibrinolytic activity, decreased reperfusion via collateral vessels, and increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage after tPA thrombolysis.–

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1132KnLc]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Ischemic stroke subtype definitions and ESUS evaluation — Cerebral cortical involvement or brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction are described, with cortical and cerebellar lesions and brainstem or subcortical lesions > 1.5 cm considered potentially caused by large artery atherosclerosis, and diagnostic studies should exclude potential sources of cardioembolic embolism. ESUS (embolic stroke of undetermined source) is described as a stroke that appears nonlacunar on neuroimaging without an obvious source after a minimum standard evaluation including arterial imaging, echocardiography, extended rhythm monitoring, and key laboratory studies such as a lipid profile and HbA1c to rule out known stroke etiologies such as cardioembolic sources and atherosclerosis proximal to the stroke. A diagnosis of ESUS implies the stroke is embolic in origin given the nonlacunar location, but the source of the embolus is unknown despite a minimal standard evaluation, and although cryptogenic stroke similarly implies that the cause of the origin is unknown, the stroke is not necessarily embolic; individuals with ESUS have cryptogenic stroke, but the converse is not always the case.

IV alteplase pretreatment deliberation and timing — The potential risks should be discussed during thrombolysis eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision making. It is reasonable that urgent IV alteplase treatment not be delayed while waiting for hematologic or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test. Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation. IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions. Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement.

Acute ischemic stroke — glucose management: Evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia, and thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS.

### Impaired glucose metabolism and the risk of vascular events and mortality after ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116wHd6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM), prediabetes, and insulin resistance are highly prevalent in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). DM is associated with higher risk for poor outcomes after IS.

Objective

Investigate the risk of recurrent vascular events and mortality associated with impaired glucose metabolism compared to normoglycemia in patients with IS and transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Methods

Systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library on 21st March 2024 and via citation searching. Studies that comprised IS or TIA patients and exposures of impaired glucose metabolism were eligible. Study Quality Assessment Tool was used for risk of bias assessment. Covariate adjusted outcomes were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes

Recurrent stroke, cardiac events, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and composite of vascular outcomes.

Results

Of 10,974 identified studies 159 were eligible. 67% had low risk of bias. DM was associated with an increased risk for composite events (pooled HR (pHR) including 445,808 patients: 1.58, 95% CI 1.34–1.85, I² = 88%), recurrent stroke (pHR including 1.161.527 patients: 1.42 (1.29–1.56, I² = 92%), cardiac events (pHR including 443,863 patients: 1.55, 1.50–1.61, I² = 0%), and all-cause mortality (pHR including 1.031.472 patients: 1.56, 1.34–1.82, I² = 99%). Prediabetes was associated with an increased risk for composite events (pHR including 8,262 patients: 1.50, 1.15–1.96, I² = 0%) and recurrent stroke (pHR including 10,429 patients: 1.50, 1.18–1.91, I² = 0), however, not with mortality (pHR including 9,378 patients, 1.82, 0.73–4.57, I² = 78%). Insulin resistance was associated with recurrent stroke (pHR including 21,363 patients: 1.56, 1.19–2.05, I² = 55%), but not with mortality (pHR including 21,363 patients: 1.31, 0.66–2.59, I² = 85%).

Discussion

DM is associated with a 56% increased relative risk of death after IS and TIA. Risk estimates regarding recurrent events are similarly high between prediabetes and DM, indicating high cardiovascular risk burden already in precursor stages of DM. There was a high heterogeneity across most outcomes.

### The neuroprotection of prodromal transient ischaemic attack on cerebral infarction [^114EMBxm]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To evaluate the potential neuroprotection against subsequent cerebral infarction conferred by a prodromal transient ischaemic attack (TIA).

Methods

Various measures, including blood pressure, blood serum glucose, serum lipids, cardiovascular imaging and changes to NIHSS scores were evaluated upon admission and discharge for patients presenting with ischaemic stroke with or without prodromal TIA (n = 60 per group).

Results

When all patients from each group were considered together, no significant group effects emerged. However, when the NIHSS difference scores from the prodromal TIA group were subdivided based on (i) prodromal TIA lasting up to 4 min; (ii) two prodromal TIA attacks and/or; (iii) prodromal TIA-stroke interval within 7 days separately, patients in subgroups 1 and 2 exhibited significantly better outcome on discharge. There was no significant effect found in subgroup three although this TIA group did show better outcome in considering the NIHSS changes.

Conclusions

Prodromal TIA prior to cerebral infarction may result in an ischaemic tolerance effect. Moreover, the neuroprotection conferred by the TIA may be associated with the duration and the frequency of the TIA, although the relationship between the TIA-stroke interval and prognosis is not clear.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^112oSJHH]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms linking an elevated SHR to adverse cardiovascular outcomes are complex and multifaceted. Stress-induced hyperglycemia can exacerbate oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to endothelial dysfunction and plaque instability. Additionally, acute hyperglycemia may negatively impact myocardial function by altering myocardial metabolism and increasing the susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to ischemic injury. Elevated stress-related hyperglycemia is often associated with increased levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and catecholamines, which can further exacerbate cardiovascular instability and contribute to poor outcomes.

The SHR has been extensively examined in the context of AIS and transient ischemic attacks (TIA). However, the influence of SHR on stroke prognosis remains debatable. Previous research has often focused on absolute hyperglycemia as a determinant of stroke outcomes, overlooking variations in patients' baseline blood glucose levels. This oversight could confound the analysis of hyperglycemia's impact on prognosis. To address this, SHR incorporates baseline glycemia into analyses, emphasizing the relative increase in blood glucose levels. Several studies have underscored the importance of SHR in predicting both short-term and long-term outcomes for AIS patients. Elevated SHR has been linked to more severe initial neurological deficits, a higher incidence of END, and poorer functional outcomes at discharge and follow-up. Despite its prognostic value, the use of SHR in ischemic cerebrovascular disease is still debated. A major point of contention is the variability in threshold values used to define elevated SHR, which differs widely across studies and populations. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate about whether adverse outcomes in AIS patients are primarily driven by hyperglycemia itself or by the underlying stress response. Some experts advocate targeting hyperglycemia to improve patient outcomes, while others suggest that focusing on the overall stress response might be more beneficial.

### Hyperglycemia, insulin, and acute ischemic stroke: a mechanistic justification for a trial of insulin infusion therapy [^111JAzQr]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in acute ischemic stroke.

Summary Of Review

Hyperglycemia induces a pro-oxidative and proinflammatory state that can cause direct neuronal toxicity. Hyperglycemia-mediated increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 can cause neuronal damage by an increase in cerebral edema. Moreover, hyperglycemia may be responsible for a procoagulant state that can further compromise blood supply to the penumbral areas in acute ischemic stroke. Insulin infusion has an effect that is opposite to that of hyperglycemia. It not only lowers blood glucose levels but also exerts an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. Insulin also improves NO production and results in improved blood circulation to the ischemic areas. This article focuses on the potential mechanisms underlying the injurious effects of glucose and the beneficial effects of insulin.

Conclusions

In the absence of other potential beneficial therapies, there is an urgency to institute trials with insulin infusion in acute ischemic stroke.

### Homonymous hemianopia: challenges and solutions [^115skJ49]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Etiology

The potential causes of HH are dependent on the age of the patient. The most common cause of HH in adults is stroke. Approximately 8%–10% of stroke patients have permanent HH, and 52%–70% of hemianopias are caused by stroke. As the population ages and stroke patients live longer, the incidence of stroke and resultant HH is likely to increase.

Other common causes of HH include traumatic brain injury (14% of HH cases) and tumors (11% of HH cases). Less common causes of HH are shown in Table 1.–

Temporary HH with spontaneous recovery may occur due to migraine; occipital, parietal, or temporal lobe seizures; or transient ischemic attack. Nonketotic hyperglycemia can cause HH that resolves with normalization of the blood sugar.

The most common causes of HH in children aged ≤ 18 years are tumors (27%–39%), brain injury (19%–34%), infarction (11%–23%), and cerebral hemorrhage (7%–11%).

### Association between stress hyperglycemia and pneumonia in patients with stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129U88b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the second primary cause of death and the third leading cause of disease burden around the world. Pneumonia is the most frequent complication following the stroke. A large systematic review shows that the pooled frequency of pneumonia after stroke is 12.3% and the incidence of pneumonia is significantly higher among stroke patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, reaching 40%, which markedly affects their rehabilitation. Recently, some researchers found that patients with stress hyperglycemia are more likely to develop pneumonia. Stress hyperglycemia (SH) is a neuroendocrine response to acute illness, typically manifesting as transient hyperglycemia that resolves following the alleviation of the acute condition. The incidence of SH is 24% (21%−27%) in ischemic stroke and 32.3% in hemorrhagic stroke, relating to mortality and impaired functionality after stroke. However, studies on SH in stroke patients have so far focused on outcomes such as mortality and poor functional outcome, without giving sufficient attention to other early factors, such as pneumonia, that may influence mortality. And the potential link between SH and pneumonia development has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the association between SH and pneumonia, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation for future studies.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on glycaemia management in acute stroke [^115rhRW3]. European Stroke Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycaemia is a frequent complication in acute stroke that has been shown to be independently associated with larger infarct size, haematoma growth, poor clinical outcome and mortality. This Guideline Document presents the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) Guidelines for the management of blood glucose levels in patients with acute ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke.

Methods

The working group identified related questions and developed its recommendations based on evidence from randomised controlled trials following the standard operating procedure of the ESO. This Guideline Document was reviewed and approved by the European Stroke Organisation Guidelines Committee and the European Stroke Organisation Executive Committee.

Results

We found low-quality evidence from clinical trials in ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke exploring the use of intravenous insulin aimed to achieve a tight glycaemic control with different glucose level targets and several other sources of heterogeneity. None of these trials neither the meta-analysis of them have demonstrated any significant benefit of tight glycaemic control with intravenous insulin in acute ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke patients on functional outcome or in survival and they have shown an increased risk for hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

We suggest against the routine use of tight glycaemic control with intravenous insulin as a means to improve outcomes. The currently available data about the management of glycaemia in patients with acute stroke are limited and the strengths of the recommendations are therefore weak. Nevertheless, this does not prevent that hyperglycaemia in acute stroke patients could be treated as any other hospitalised patient.

### Prognostic significance of diabetes and stress hyperglycemia in acute stroke patients [^111yE6ZW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no doubt about the importance of diabetes as a stroke risk factor. Instead, what is still controversial is the role played by diabetes and hyperglycemia on the outcome of acute stroke. From the 90 s to present days, the subject has been treated in numerous publications, without reaching definitive conclusions. The most interesting and intriguing result is the almost generalized finding of a worse prognosis in hyperglycemic non-diabetic patients than in diabetic patients.

These observations led to the definition of "stress hyperglycemia" as a possible important factor worsening the prognosis of stroke patients. In fact, experimental studies suggest that an excess of glucose may be detrimental to brain structures and metabolism. In particular, as illustrated in an excellent review by Li et al. hyperglycemia intensifies the inflammatory response, resulting in increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier, edema and hemorrhage. In addition, under conditions of ischemic anaerobiosis, glycemic excess intensifies anaerobic glycolysis, and consequently lactic acidosis. Finally, neuronal damage can result from the accumulation of calcium and reactive oxygen species, and from the vasoconstrictor effect caused by a lower availability of nitric oxide.

Despite these documented harmful effects of hyperglycemia, uncertainty remains as to whether the hyperglycemia associated with severe strokes is a contributing factor to such severity, or just an epiphenomenon of severity. This distinction is of considerable practical relevance: in fact, in the first case it would be important to try to control, even aggressively, hyperglycemia even in non-diabetic patients, while in the second case such control would be unnecessary, if not potentially harmful. To shed light on this topic, it is important to correct the statistical analysis for all the main confounding factors: age, sex, acute phase markers, stroke severity and cerebral lesion size. These factors have not always been considered in the various studies and, in particular, the extent of brain injury has almost never been considered.

The present study aims to bring a new contribution to the understanding of the relationships between diabetes, stress hyperglycemia and acute stroke outcomes. The analysis was corrected for the main confounding factors associated with stroke severity and inflammatory status, also considering, in particular, cerebral lesion diameter.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend achieving intensive glucose control (HbA1c ≤ 7%) beyond the acute phase of the ischemic event for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and diabetes.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114iDSiA]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Diabetes and stroke prevention — intensive glycemic control evidence: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have not demonstrated that intensive glycemic control (targeting hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.5%) reduces stroke risk more than looser glycemic control (targeting hemoglobin A1c of 7%–8%) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A review of intensive versus conventional glycemic targets in type 1 diabetes, including 12 trials and 2230 patients, found low-quality evidence for stroke with small numbers of the outcome, and the authors concluded that the evidence of the effect of intensive glycemic control on stroke was insufficient. Furthermore, tight glycemic control increases treatment burden, costs, and side-effect risks and might cause patient harm (eg, severe hypoglycemia). In summary, for individuals with diabetes, both the potential benefit of more intensive control (eg, to hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.5%) for prevention of microvascular disease and the potential risk of hypoglycemia should be considered in decision-making.

### Transient ischemic attack [^115B5gm8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on transient ischemic attack:

- **Definition**: A TIA is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than 1 hour but can persist for up to 24 hours, and without evidence of acute infarction.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of TIA involves a temporary disruption in blood flow to a specific area of the brain, often due to emboli or thrombi. This leads to ischemia in the affected area, causing transient neurological symptoms. Common conditions causing a TIA include cerebrovascular disorders such as large artery atherosclerosis, carotid or vertebral artery stenosis, and cervical artery dissection; cardiovascular disorders such as AF, valvular heart disease, and infective endocarditis; hypercoagulable conditions such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, cancer, hyperhomocysteinemia, and sickle cell disease; and inflammatory vascular conditions such as FMD, giant cell arteritis, and primary angiitis of the CNS.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of TIA in the US is estimated at 0.7–1.19 per 1,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for TIA include advanced age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, tobacco smoking, high sodium intake, high stress, CVDs, and a family history of cerebrovascular accidents.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of a TIA is characterized by sudden onset of symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. Symptoms can include motor weakness, dysphasia, altered consciousness, syncope, dizziness, amnesia, confusion, hemianopia, monocular visual loss, isolated diplopia, bilateral visual disturbance, vertigo, ataxia, sensory symptoms, and gait difficulties.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with TIA have an increased risk of subsequent stroke, with a 10–20% risk within the first 90 days after the event, and an increased risk of cardiovascular events for the following 5 years.

### Heterogeneity affecting outcome from acute stroke therapy: making reperfusion worse [^115smCGn]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke patients are heterogeneous not only with respect to etiology but also in terms of preexisting clinical conditions. Approximately one fifth of patients with acute stroke are hyperglycemic and/or have had a recent infectious or inflammatory condition. Summary of Review — Experimental research indicates that these factors can alter and accelerate the evolution of stroke and reperfusion injury, although these effects are complex and some may have a favorable impact. Both conditions involve activation of inflammatory and reactive oxygen mechanisms. In addition, hyperglycemia has concomitant deleterious vascular and metabolic effects that worsen infarct size and encourage hemorrhagic transformation in reperfusion models. Clinical data are less extensive but in general support an adverse impact on outcome.

Conclusions

After examining these data in detail, we concluded that the presence of these clinical conditions could assist in identification of those at increased risk for complications of reperfusion therapy. Furthermore, consideration of these factors may provide a rational basis for combination therapy and improve the clinical relevance of experimental stroke models.

### Hyperglycemia, risk of subsequent stroke, and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^115HomTH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The SHINE trialrandomized 1151 patients with hyperglycemia on presentation to either intensive therapy via continuous intravenous insulin infusion (target glucose 80–130 mg/dL) or standard therapy (target glucose 80–179 mg/dL) via an insulin sliding scale administered subcutaneously. There was no difference in the primary outcome (proportion of patients with a favorable score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days) between the 2 groups and more episodes of hypoglycemia in the intensive versus standard therapy groups (11.2% versus 3.2%). Subsequent ischemic stroke was not ascertained as a secondary outcome in this trial, but there were an equivalent number of ischemic strokes (16) reported across each arm as a serious adverse event. Although not specifically designed to test the hypothesis that control of serum glucose reduced the risk of subsequent stroke, the results suggest that elevated serum glucose may be a marker of overall sickness/illness severity and not a target for therapy itself.

There are limitations inherent in this study. First, because this is a secondary analysis of data already collected from a well‐phenotyped clinical trial population with high‐risk TIA or acute minor ischemic stroke, our results should be used for hypothesis generation only. Second, the subgroup of patients with hyperglycemia was small (12.2% of the study sample), which limits our power to observe true effects. In particular, our finding that dual antiplatelet therapy was not associated with a reduced risk of subsequent stroke should be interpreted with caution and should not be evoked as a reason to deviate from guideline‐based care in this population (the most recent American Heart Association stroke secondary prevention guidelines advocate for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 to 90 days for patients with noncardioembolic minor ischemic stroke or high‐risk TIA). Third, the POINT excluded patients who received IV tissue‐type plasminogen activator, underwent mechanical thrombectomy, had an indication for anticoagulation, or were planned for a revascularization procedure, and so our results may not apply to these groups of patients. Fourth, hypo‐ or hyperglycemia can cause acute, focal neurological deficits. Although abnormalities in serum glucose were not listed as exclusion criteria for POINT, the trial protocol did require that the study investigator believed the primary reason for the presenting neurological deficit to be focal brain ischemia. Thus, it is possible that some patients with hypo‐ or hyperglycemia and concurrent stroke were erroneously excluded from the trial. Finally, glucose levels were not taken with reference to the time of a patient's last meal and thus are classified as random levels.

### Impact of glycemic treatment and blood glucose monitoring on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke without prior diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study [^1158eczi]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Appropriate glycemic management, especially when combining glycemic treatment with intensive BGM, is crucial for the acute care of patients with FIS and hyperglycemia who have not previously been diagnosed with DM. While this study highlights the potential benefits of BGM and glycemic management in reducing the risk of stroke recurrence within one year and improving short- and long-term mortality rates among patients with AIS, it does not determine the optimal glucose threshold for initiating treatment. The risk associated with hyperglycemia during acute stroke is well-recognized; however, the optimal strategy for glycemic treatment and the specific benefits of insulin are still under active debate. Thus, BGM is essential for optimal glycemic management during the acute phase of FIS in patients with hyperglycemia who have not previously been diagnosed with DM.

Algorithm for evaluating patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke — Ancillary notes specify that basic laboratory tests include complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, and fasting or nonfasting lipid profile. Abbreviations are defined (e.g. CT indicates computed tomography; CTA, computed tomography angiogram; ECG, electrocardiogram; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography; US, ultrasound). When a patient has a transient neurological deficit clinically characteristic of transient ischemic attack, the patient should be evaluated in the same manner as a patient who has an ischemic stroke with a corresponding cerebral infarct on imaging. Confirmation of stroke diagnosis may require follow-up head imaging because of poor sensitivity of noncontrast CT for small or hyperacute infarcts. Some conditions associated with stroke and with specific therapies are common whereas others are relatively rare, and the variable yield of testing means that treating physicians need to exercise judgment on the likelihood that a test will alter management in a given clinical situation.

### Diabetes, hyperglycemia and the management of cerebrovascular disease [^112yszxC]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperglycemia is frequent in patients with cerebrovascular disease. This review article aims to summarize the recent evidence from observational studies that examined the adverse cerebrovascular effects of dysglycemic states as well as interventional studies assessing intensive management strategies for hyperglycemia.

Recent Findings

In recent years, diabetes, prediabetic states and insulin resistance and their association with cerebrovascular disease were an important focus of research. The cerebrovascular consequences of these metabolic abnormalities were found to extend beyond ischemic stroke to covert brain infarcts, other structural brain changes and to cognitive impairment with and without dementia. Interventional studies did not reveal that more intensive management of chronic hyperglycemia and of hyperglycemia in the setting of acute stroke improves outcome. There is clear evidence, however, that the overall management of multiple risk factors and behavior modification in patients with dysglycemia may reduce the burden of cerebrovascular disease.

Summary

Observational studies reveal the growing burden and adverse cerebrovascular effects of dysglycemic states. Currently available interventional studies assessing more intensive strategies for the management of hyperglycemia did not prove, however, to be effective. We discuss the current evidence, pathophysiological considerations and management implications.

### Validation and refinement of the ABCD2 score: a population-based analysis [^1176ZWMg]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Transient ischemic attacks are a frequent diagnosis in the emergency department setting, yet expert opinion as to the proper follow-up and need for hospitalization differs widely. Recently, an effort has been made to risk-stratify patients presenting with transient ischemic attacks through scoring systems such as the ABCD and ABCD2 scales. The aim of our study was to independently validate these scores using a population-based cohort.

Methods

Using the data from the Rochester Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack Registry and resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, medical records of all residents of Rochester, Minn, with a diagnosis of incident transient ischemic attack from 1985 through 1994 were examined (N = 284). Patients were scored on the ABCD and ABCD2 scales and new scores were created by adding hyperglycemia and a history of hypertension. The end points of stroke and death were collected previously and were verified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project data.

Results

Although our study did find that scores > 4 had a statistically significant predictive value for future stroke, a substantial proportion of strokes within 7 days (9 of 36 cases [25%]) occurred in patients with low or intermediate risk scores (≤ 4) on the ABCD2 scale. Including history of hypertension and hyperglycemia on presentation increased the sensitivity of the score to identify patients who had a stroke within 7 days.

Conclusions

Reliance on the ABCD and ABCD2 scores misses some patients who will have a stroke within 7 days of a transient ischemic attack. Adding hyperglycemia and a history of hypertension to the predictive model could be useful, but the value of these additions need to be evaluated further.

Management of abnormal glucose metabolism

Recommendations

The prognosis of persistent hyperglycaemia in patients with AIS within 24 hours after onset is worse than that of normal blood glucose. So, it is reasonable to control blood glucose to the range between 140~180 mg/dL. At the same time, blood sugar should be closely monitored to prevent hypoglycaemia (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Treatment should be given to patients with AIS with hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) (class I, level of evidence C).
It is recommended that patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with diabetes should be evaluated and given the best management guideline (class I, level of evidence A).
For all inpatients/outpatients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, rapid blood glucose, 2 hours postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin or 75 g oral glucose tolerance test are recommended for screening of diabetes mellitus (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Lifestyle and/or drug intervention in patients with diabetes or prediabetes can reduce ischaemic stroke or TIA events. The recommended treatment target for glycosylated haemoglobin is ≤ 7% (class I, level of evidence B).
The hypoglycaemic regimen should consider the clinical characteristics of patients and the safety of drugs. To set up individual blood glucose control targets, one should be on guard against the harm caused by hypoglycemia (class IIa, level of evidence B).

### Association of acute and chronic hyperglycemia with acute ischemic stroke outcomes post-thrombolysis: findings from get with the guidelines-stroke [^113dGGQ9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The exact threshold at which elevated blood glucose levels are associated with elevated risk has not been well established. Previous studies suggested that a blood glucose level of 160 mg/dL or more may be a cutoff for poor outcomes. 20, 24 One study reported a linear relation between admission glucose and an increase in the odds of sICH (OR 1.75 per 100 mg/dL increase in admission glucose). 5 Admission blood glucose levels were identified as a risk factor for sICH after intravenous tPA in several risk models for sICH post‐tPA. 11, 25, 26, 27, 28 Although blood glucose is one of the potential modifiable factor in these risk scores, further studies are required to evaluate whether treatment of hyperglycemia reduces risk of sICH post‐tPA. Furthermore, these studies were designed to identify patients at increased risk of sICH and do not conclude benefit or harm of tPA in patients with higher predicted risk. Our study supports the previous observations that worsening of acute or chronic plasma glucose control is associated with increasing mortality, but that the effects are nonlinear and plateau above modest levels of hyperglycemia. Whereas early studies suggested that there may be a role of tight glucose control for reducing MI and coronary heart disease events, randomized, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate measurable benefits for strict acute or chronic glycemic control, and some have suggested increased harm. 29 The potential benefit of strict glucose control with aggressive insulin titration in acute stroke is unclear, 30 and this hypothesis is currently being tested in a large, randomized, clinical trial. 31 To avoid the risk of adverse effects related to hypoglycemia, guidelines recommend to maintain blood glucose in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL. 32 Whereas our retrospective study suggests that better blood glucose regulation measured at admission is associated with better short‐term clinical outcomes, we did not test or measure any interventions that were given in response to these glucose measurements, and thus these findings require prospective, randomized, clinical trials to evaluate the potential benefits and potential risks of any treatment in this patient population.

### Reducing the risk of stroke in type 2 diabetes: pathophysiological and therapeutic perspectives [^1124SEKC]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Reducing the excess cerebrovascular burden in patients with type 2 diabetes remains a major therapeutic challenge, especially with respect to the high risk of recurrent events. Targeting the traditional metabolic risk factors of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia has failed to remove this excess risk, and agents targeting thrombotic risk (i.e., antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs) remain poorly studied in the context of stroke in diabetes. This may relate to the accumulation of risk factors in type 2 diabetes as well as to diabetes-specific pathophysiologic factors. Regrettably, there is a lack of prospective evidence to support the efficacy of interventions in the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular events in type 2 diabetes, particularly recurrent stroke events. Overall, there is a need for rigorous evaluations of new therapeutic approaches in both primary and secondary prevention of stroke and management of acute stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes. This systematic review of the published literature summarizes the evidence regarding current therapeutic interventions and their impact on the risk of stroke in people with type 2 diabetes, and highlights potential strategies for improving outcomes.

### Hyperglycaemia monitoring and management in stroke care: policy vs. practice [^116M1BP3]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the extent to which hyperglycaemia was monitored and managed among patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving a review of the records of 112 patients consecutively admitted with acute stroke or transient ischaemic attack to all three district general hospitals in one Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland from 1 January to 15 April 2008. Glucose results for each of the first 5 days of hospital admission were ascertained. We compared interventions, clinical outcome and discharge planning between patients who experienced glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol/l in the first 5 days, and patients with lower glucose results.

Results

The daily prevalence rate of hyperglycaemia > 7.8 mmol/l across the first 5 days ranged from 24 to 34%. A total of 41 (37%) patients experienced hyperglycaemia on at least one occasion during the first 5 days. A history of diabetes mellitus prompted near patient glucose testing, but, among patients without diagnosed diabetes, glycaemia was under-monitored. Hyperglycaemia was a persisting trend, was under-treated and under-reported to general practitioners. Elevated glucose results failed to influence higher rates of fasting plasma glucose tests and BMI assessment.

Conclusions

There is a need for greater vigilance in the detection of hyperglycaemia and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus among patients admitted to hospital with stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an episode of reversible neurologic deficit caused by temporary focal central nervous system hypoperfusion. TIA is a medical emergency. Because patients with TIA in the emergency department (ED) have a high risk for stroke within the next 48 hours, it is imperative for the clinician to recognize this golden opportunity to prevent a disabling stroke.

### Impact of glycemic treatment and blood glucose monitoring on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke without prior diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study [^111MMPWd]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms linking poststroke hyperglycemia to poor stroke outcomes are not fully understood. Poststroke hyperglycemia may result from neurohormonal dysfunction and inflammatory responses to ischemic brain damage. Additionally, a complex interplay among catecholamines, cortisol, and cytokines may elevate hepatic glucose output. Hyperglycemia can worsen stroke outcomes through various neurotoxic effects, including calcium imbalance, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, increased lactic acidosis, reduced nitric oxide, and enhanced inflammatory responses. Insulin resistance and β -cell dysfunction cause relative insulin deficiency in hyperglycemia, potentially worsening outcomes for nondiabetic patients with ischemic stroke. These pathophysiological effects can enhance lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, and accumulation of intracellular calcium, which may contribute to cell lysis in the umbra and penumbra regions, thereby exacerbating ischemic injury. A magnetic resonance imaging study has demonstrated that hyperglycemia is influenced by the size of the initial brain infarct and its subsequent expansion. This interaction suggests that hyperglycemia may exacerbate infarct growth, with prolonged post-stroke hyperglycemia linked to worsened neuronal damage, disrupted blood–brain barrier function, and increased infarct volume Additionally, acute and chronic hyperglycemia significantly alters cerebral blood flow, influencing computed tomography perfusion (CTP) underestimation error in AIS patients with large vessel occlusion. These findings underscore the critical need to consider glycemic status for accurate CTP interpretation and effective treatment planning in ischemic stroke patients.

In light of the adverse outcomes of patients with poststroke hyperglycemia, guidelines recommend early glucose management to achieve blood glucose levels of 140–180 mg/dL. Additionally, intensive BGM is essential to mitigate further brain damage and improve patient outcomes. Using insulin to control blood glucose level in glycemic treatment can trigger a neuroprotective effect by augmenting astrocytic glycogen phosphorylase. Brain reperfusion after an ischemic stroke may lead to significant reperfusion-induced glycogen accumulation in the ischemic penumbra; this accumulation is strongly associated with the development of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which exacerbates conditions such as glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium overload, free radical formation, and inflammation. Evidence over the past decade underscores insulin's critical role in neuroprotection, particularly through maintaining calcium homeostasis, inhibiting inflammation, reducing free radicals in the heart, and modulating glucose metabolism to prevent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Consequently, insulin treatment emerges as a promising intervention for ischemic stroke, particularly targeting glycogenolysis. However, the effectiveness of such strategies may vary depending on the timing of ischemia, underscoring the need for precise application.

### Abnormal glucose regulation increases stroke risk in minor ischemic stroke or TIA [^113vEMGm]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether abnormal glucose regulation contributes to a new stroke in patients with a minor ischemic stroke or TIA.

Methods

We derived data from the Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events trial. Patients with a minor stroke or TIA were categorized into 3 groups: patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and normal fasting plasma glucose. The primary outcome was a new stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) at 90 days. We assessed the association between glucose regulation status and risk of stroke by multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for potential covariates.

Results

Among 5,135 included patients, 1,587 (30.9%), 409 (8.0%), and 3,139 (61.1%) patients were identified as DM, IFG, and normal glucose, respectively. Compared with normal glucose, IFG (11.0% vs 6.9%; adjusted hazard ratio [adj HR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–2.19) and DM (15.8% vs 6.9%; adj HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.97–2.88) were associated with increased risk of stroke at 3 months after a minor stroke or TIA after adjusted for potential covariates. We found a weak J-shaped association between fasting plasma glucose and risk of stroke with a nadir of 4.9 mmol/L.

Conclusions

Both IFG and DM were associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with a minor stroke or TIA.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^112vvAtM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study also found that Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) can serve as a predictor of neurological deterioration following thrombolysis in patients with AIS. HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin covalently bonded to glucose, reflecting average blood glucose levels over the preceding two to three months, which corresponds to the lifespan of red blood cells. This biomarker is commonly used in clinical settings to monitor long-term glycemic control in diabetic patients. Elevated HbA1c levels have been associated with the occurrence, progression, and prognosis of ischemic stroke. Specifically, high HbA1c levels correlate with an increased risk of both developing ischemic stroke and experiencing poorer outcomes after a stroke event. The mechanisms by which HbA1c could predict END in AIS patients are complex. Elevated HbA1c levels indicate chronic hyperglycemia, which may exacerbate ischemic injury through several pathways. Chronic hyperglycemia can lead to endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and elevated levels of inflammatory markers. These factors collectively contribute to increased vulnerability of cerebral vasculature and neural tissue during an ischemic event. Furthermore, high HbA1c levels can promote a prothrombotic state, raising the risk of thrombus formation and extension, which may result in more extensive brain damage and poorer recovery outcomes. Elevated HbA1c may also reflect poor pre-stroke glycemic control, indicating underlying vascular pathology that predisposes patients to ischemic damage and its complications. Additionally, pre-existing hyperglycemia might impair the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy by increasing blood-brain barrier permeability, thereby raising the risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

However, HbA1c measurement is not without limitations. Its reliability as a marker can be compromised under various conditions, including significant anemia, hemoglobinopathies, recent blood transfusions, and chronic kidney disease. These conditions can affect the lifespan of red blood cells or alter hemoglobin structure, potentially leading to misleading HbA1c levels. Therefore, while HbA1c is a convenient and widely accessible marker, clinicians must be aware of these potential confounders when interpreting results.

This study had several limitations. It is a retrospective observational study with a modest sample size and was conducted at a single center. Additionally, patients who received endovascular therapy after intravenous thrombolysis (IV-rtPA) were excluded, which may have introduced selection bias. The study relied on admission blood glucose levels to calculate the SHR without considering glycemic changes and control at other time points. Furthermore, diabetes diagnosis was based on past medical history and HbA1c levels, without a detailed assessment of the patients' prior glycemic status. Despite these limitations, the study's strengths include a rigorous selection process and the inclusion of patients from a well-defined center.

### Transient hyperglycemia in ischemic stroke patients [^112ruwCb]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate glucose derangement and its short- and long-term prognostic significance in nondiabetic ischemic stroke patients. The study involved 262 consecutive patients, mean age: 70.1 ± 12.4 years, with a supratentorial ischemic stroke. The following data were collected: patients characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, and stroke severity assessed by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS). Serum glucose levels were measured on admission, on the next, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 14th day after stroke onset. The outcome measures on day 30 were mortality and capacity to perform daily activities: the Barthel Index and Rankin Scale. The 1-year survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess predictors of 1-year mortality in nondiabetics. Diabetes mellitus was found in 24.8% of patients and transient hyperglycemia in 36.3% of patients. Patients with transient hyperglycemia scored lower on SSS in the subsequent days of assessment than patients with either diabetes mellitus or normoglycemia. They had larger ischemic lesions on computer tomography (CT) than diabetics and had higher 30-day mortality than normoglycemics (p < 0.05). One-year mortality was similar in transient hyperglycemics and diabetics, and both were significantly higher than in normoglycemics (p < 0.05). A proportional hazards model analysis showed that transient hyperglycemia is not an independent predictor of death within a year after stroke.

Subgroup Analyses

In the 2327 patients whose index event was a TIA, there was a higher hazard of subsequent stroke in an unadjusted model (HR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.28–4.31]) but a nonsignificant association in a fully adjusted model (HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.83–3.35]). In the 2304 patients whose index event was an acute minor ischemic stroke, there was a higher hazard of subsequent stroke in an unadjusted model (HR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.05–2.15]) but not in a fully adjusted model (HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 0.95–2.29]).

### Are patients with acutely recovered cerebral ischemia more unstable? [^113BiRkz]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recent studies suggest that the short-term risk of stroke may be greater after transient ischemic attack (TIA) than after stroke.

Methods

We compared risks of neurological deterioration in those with and without TIA in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) trial, a randomized trial of intravenous tPA given within 3 hours of onset of cerebral ischemia, after excluding those with cerebral hemorrhage and those dying before 90 days of causes other than new ischemic stroke. TIA was defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of zero at 24 hours. We chose subsequent deterioration as our outcome, defined as a worsening on the NIHSS at 90 days compared with 24 hours, so that episodes of new ischemia that may have been attributed to other causes would be included.

Results

Of 498 subjects meeting entry criteria, 40 (8%) had TIA. Subsequent deterioration occurred in 30% of those with TIA and 10% of others (P = 0.001, Fisher exact test). In multivariable models with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, 24-hour NIHSS score, tPA administration, presumed stroke subtype, and baseline systolic blood pressure, temperature, and glucose, TIA was an independent predictor of subsequent deterioration (odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.0 to 12.5; P = 0.001). Subsequent deterioration was not associated with tPA treatment, and there was no interaction between tPA administration, TIA, and subsequent deterioration. Lesser degrees of substantial acute recovery were also associated with greater risk of subsequent deterioration.

Conclusions

Patients with TIA may be a greater risk of subsequent neurological deterioration from causes other than hemorrhage. Substantial acute recovery may be an indicator of greater instability more broadly.

### Stress hyperglycemia is associated with early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke after intravenous thrombolysis without hemorrhagic transformation [^116N2Y87]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we found that the SHR was independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes, even after adjusting for other clinical risk factors. Both hyperglycemia at presentation and the increase in glucose levels, as indicated by SHR, were linked to poor functional outcomes. A high SHR may contribute to dysregulated inflammatory responses, which can lead to cerebral vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral blood flow, thereby impairing functional recovery. This response is triggered by a surge in catecholamines, cortisol, and other inflammatory mediators, which promotes rapid glycogenolysis and the release of glucose from hepatic glycogen stores into the bloodstream. Consequently, it appears that acute fluctuations in glucose concentration, rather than persistently high blood glucose levels, are responsible for the observed adverse clinical outcomes.

The exact mechanisms by which the SHR influences outcomes in ischemic cerebrovascular disease remain under investigation, but several pathways are believed to be involved. Firstly, stress-induced hyperglycemia is associated with heightened inflammatory and neurohormonal responses, increased endothelial cell apoptosis, and elevated oxidative stress. This oxidative stress activates matrix metalloproteinase gelatinase B (MMP-9), compromising the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and leading to increased BBB permeability, which heightens the risk of brain edema and hemorrhage following reperfusion. It has been shown that stress hyperglycemia predicts hemorrhagic transformation in AIS patients. Secondly, stress hormones stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis while inhibiting glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can enhance the expression and membrane localization of glucose transporters GLUT-1 and GLUT-3, which promotes glucose uptake by insulin-independent tissues, including the central nervous system. Excessive cellular glucose leads to increased brain lactate production, which may transform asymptomatic tissue into symptomatic tissue. Thirdly, both acute and chronic hyperglycemia contribute to a prothrombotic state and may promote thrombus extension, which is closely linked to END. This involves hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia elevating the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), thereby reducing rt-PA activity. Additionally, hyperglycemia can disrupt the endothelial glycocalyx layer, release coagulation factors, and increase platelet-endothelial adhesion. The mechanisms underlying hyperglycemia-induced hypercoagulability are complex and warrant further investigation. Furthermore, stress hyperglycemia may reflect transient glycemic variability, which specifically induces oxidative stress. Previous research has demonstrated that greater glycemic variability in AIS patients is associated with lower rates of neurological improvement during hospitalization, potentially due to increased oxidative stress. Finally, the extent of stress hyperglycemia may serve as an indicator of disease severity; in AIS patients, it can reflect the degree of ischemic injury, with severe neurological impairment closely related to endothelial dysfunction.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Glucose after acute ischemic stroke — after AIS, it is reasonable to screen all patients for diabetes mellitus with testing of fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test; choice of test and timing should be guided by clinical judgment and recognition that acute illness may temporarily perturb measures of plasma glucose, and in general, hemoglobin A1c may be more accurate than other screening tests in the immediate postevent period.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to assess blood glucose levels before administering IV alteplase since hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations.

### Hyperglycemia independently increases the risk of perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, and death after carotid endarterectomy [^114Fsojb]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that hyperglycemia lowers the neuronal ischemic threshold, potentiates stroke volume in focal ischemia, and is associated with morbidity and mortality in the surgical critical care setting. It remains unknown whether hyperglycemia during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) predisposes patients to perioperative stroke and operative related morbidity and mortality.

Methods

The clinical and radiological records of all patients undergoing CEA and operative day glucose measurement from 1994 to 2004 at an academic institution were reviewed and 30-day outcomes were assessed. The independent association of operative day glucose before CEA and perioperative morbidity and mortality were assessed via multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

One thousand two hundred and one patients with a mean age of 72 ± 10 years (748 men, 453 women) underwent CEA (676 asymptomatic, 525 symptomatic). Overall, stroke occurred in 46 (3.8%) patients, transient ischemic attack occurred in 19 (1.6%), myocardial infarction occurred in 19 (1.6%), and death occurred in 17 (1.4%). Increasing operative day glucose was independently associated with perioperative stroke or transient ischemic attack (Odds ratio [OR], 1.005; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.01; P = 0.03), myocardial infarction (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.004–1.016; P = 0.017), and death (OR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.00–1.015; P = 0.04). Patients with operative day glucose greater than 200 mg/dl were 2.8-fold, 4.3-fold, and 3.3-fold more likely to experience perioperative stroke or transient ischemic attack (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.37–5.67; P = 0.005), myocardial infarction (OR, 4.29; 95% CI, 1.28–14.4; P = 0.018), or death (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.07–10.1; P = 0.037), respectively. Median and interquartile range length of hospitalization was greater for patients with operative day glucose greater than 200 mg/dl (4 d [interquartile range, 2–15 d] versus 3 d [interquartile range, 2–7 d]; P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Independent of previous cardiac disease, diabetes, or other comorbidities, hyperglycemia at the time of CEA was associated with an increased risk of perioperative stroke or transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, and death. Strict glucose control should be attempted before surgery to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality after CEA.

Statistical Analysis

Contingency tables were generated to explore the relationship between important covariates, including demographics, clinical variables, medical history, and hospital‐level characteristics, by presence of acute hyperglycemia in AIS patients treated with tPA. Primary outcomes of interest were complications of tPA thrombolytic therapy (symptomatic hemorrhage [sICH] and life‐threatening systemic hemorrhage) and all‐cause in‐hospital mortality. Other outcomes of interest were length of stay and ambulatory status at discharge. Chi‐square for categorical variables or Wilcoxon test for continuous data were used as tests for statistical associations.

Outcomes among stroke patients receiving tPA were compared between acute hyperglycemic and nonhyperglycemic patients using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to account for within‐site clustering. Each outcome was modeled using a tiered approach. First, the unadjusted odds ratios were calculated. Next, patient characteristics were added to the model (age, gender, race [white vs other], medical history of atrial fib/flutter, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack [TIA], coronary artery disease [CAD]/previous myocardial infarction [MI], carotid stenosis, DM, peripheral vascular disease [PVD], hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and NIHSS). Finally, hospital characteristics (region, academic/teaching hospital, number of beds, rural location, TJC primary stroke center status, annual ischemic stroke volume, and annual tPA volume) were added to the model. Blood glucose and HbA1c were not included in the multivariable models. Single imputations were used to reduce missingness in the models. Blood glucose and HbA1c as continuous variables were modeled with linear splines to analyze relationships with outcomes of in‐hospital mortality and sICH. A knot point of 200 mg/dL provided the best fit. There was no evidence of further association above blood glucose 200 mg/dL. Next, blood glucose was modeled from 40 to 200 mg/dL with a linear spline. HbA1c was modeled from 0% to 20%.

### Impact of glycemic treatment and blood glucose monitoring on outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke without prior diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study [^115oKPhp]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

To assess the impact of hyperglycemia classification on study outcomes, we conducted sensitivity analyses on patients categorized by hyperglycemia status at FIS hospitalization. These analyses confirmed that the benefits of integrating BGM with glycemic treatment are consistent, regardless of diabetes status at the time of hospitalization. This consistency underscores the need for comprehensive glycemic management strategies that encompass both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes at stroke onset. Future research should aim to develop targeted interventions that more effectively tailor and refine treatment approaches for this diverse patient population. As anticipated, our study confirmed that integrating BGM with glycemic treatment significantly reduces the risks of stroke recurrence within one year and reduces mortality at each subsequent time point in patients with AIS.

### The role of hyperglycemia in acute stroke… [^115tS4fi]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Most human studies have shown that in acute stroke, admission hyperglycemia in patients with or without diabetes is associated with a worse clinical outcome than in patients without hyperglycemia. This association is more consistent in the nonlacunar type of stroke. Animal studies support these findings by showing both in global and in focal postischemic models that hyperglycemia exaggerates the following damaging processes: intracellular acidosis, accumulation of extracellular glutamate, brain edema formation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and tendency for hemorrhagic transformation., stress hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes was found to be associated with increased in-hospital mortality after MI. 6 The Diabetes and Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study has recently provided compelling evidence that achieving euglycemia during acute MI resulted in a significant reduction of long-term mortality.

7 These results have revolutionized the standard care of patients with diabetes and acute MI. Several studies9–12 showed that patients with diabetes who develop stroke have a less favorable outcome than those without; however, a few other studies did not confirm these findings. 13, 14 Interestingly, most studies, including large trials, have shown that admission hyperglycemia is a risk factor for poor outcome following focal and global cerebral ischemia. 15–19 Weir et al17 performed a long-term follow-up of 750 nondiabetic patients with acute stroke and, after adjusting for age, sex, type of stroke, smoking, and blood pressure, admission hyperglycemia remained a significant independent predictor of long-term higher mortality and morbidity. These data suggest that the detrimental influence of hyperglycemia is initially mediated by an action on the vascular endothelium leading to widespread foci of infarction and neuronal loss.

31 In animals with focal ischemia, the results are less consistent; however, hyperglycemia has been shown to increase brain damage in models with temporary ischemia and reperfusion. 32, 33. Hyperglycemia in animal models of brain ischemia was found to exaggerate edema formation, 30, 43 blood-brain barrier injury, 44 and hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. In a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, a 5-fold increase in hemorrhagic infarct and a 25-fold increase in extensive hemorrhages were observed in hyperglycemic cats compared with the normoglycemic animals. 45.

### Transient ischemic attack: part II. risk factor modification… [^112w2gva]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Initial Management The risk of stroke within 90 days after a TIA has been reported at 10 to 20 percent, with approximately one-half of these strokes occurring within the first 48 hours after initial presentation. 35, 36 Early initiation of treatment after a TIA, including medication and surgical intervention, can significantly reduce the risk of early stroke. 37 This may suggest that hospitalization is beneficial in patients at high risk. Advantages of admission include the opportunity for complete diagnostic evaluation, confirmation of the diagnosis, and early treatment to reduce the risk of stroke. 38 The potential administration of tissue plasminogen activator may be optimized if an early stroke occurs while the patient is hospitalized and should be considered in any patients with lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. 1 Urgent access to tissue plasminogen activator and management of TIA can reduce subsequent stroke risk.

Of those presenting with TIA or minor stroke, 50 to 80 percent have elevated blood pressure on initial evaluation. 39 Patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg are at higher risk of stroke after TIA. 39 Blood pressure reduction should be individualized based on comorbidities, age, and risk of hypotension. For patients who have a history of TIA or stroke, statin therapy lowers the five-year absolute risk of stroke by 2. 2 percent. The EVA-3S trial demonstrated that the incidence of stroke or death at 30 days in symptomatic patients was 3. 9 percent following carotid endarterectomy and was
9. 6 percent following carotid artery stenting. 46 At six months, the risk of stroke or death was 6.

1 percent for carotid endarterectomy and was
11. 7 percent for carotid artery stenting. 46 In the CREST, the four-year risk of stroke or death was 4. 7 percent following carotid endarterectomy and was
6. 4 percent following carotid artery stenting; however, the rates of myocardial infarction were higher after carotid endarterectomy. 47.

### Risk of stroke and cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome… [^116Fp7HD]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Results Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus had increased risks of stroke, major cardiovascular events, and revascularization procedures compared with the reference group. Conclusions The SPARCL subjects with type 2 diabetes were at higher risk for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events. This exploratory analysis found no difference in the effect of statin treatment in reducing these events in subjects with or without type 2 diabetes or MetS. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00147602. Transient ischemic attack was defined by the loss of cerebral or ocular function for less than 24 hours of presumed ischemic cause.

Patients had to be ambulatory with a modified Rankin score of 3 or less and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 100 to 190 mg/dL. The SPARCL primary outcome was the time from randomization after an ischemic stroke or TIA to the occurrence of a nonfatal or fatal stroke. The SPARCL trial included several secondary composite outcomes, including major coronary events, major cardiovascular events, any CHD event, and any revascularization procedure. 17 Subjects were followed up until the end of the study or death; only 0.

5% of enrolled subjects were lost to follow-up. In this post hoc analysis, we found that SPARCL subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were at higher risk for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events but that there was no difference in the effect of statin treatment in reducing these events in subjects with or without type 2 diabetes or MetS.
