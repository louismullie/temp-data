## Question

How long after a laceration can you give tetanus booster?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long after a laceration a tetanus booster can be given. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether tetanus prophylaxis is indicated at all. Then, I should verify the wound classification and how that changes thresholds for booster timing. Next, I will review the patient's immunization history to determine if a booster is needed now. After that, I need to check whether tetanus immune globulin is indicated in addition to the vaccine. Finally, I will consider special populations, especially pregnancy, and clarify the timing of administration relative to injury and any prior recent tetanus-containing vaccine dose.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: tetanus prophylaxis is indicated for traumatic wounds, including lacerations, based on wound characteristics and the patient's vaccination history, and the goal is to administer indicated vaccines and TIG as soon as feasible rather than waiting, because tetanus incubation can be as short as 1–3 days and averages about 7–10 days, so delays increase risk [^116JrtfT] [^112xCc8i].

> I need to classify the wound next. Clean and minor wounds are low risk, whereas dirty or major wounds — contaminated with dirt, feces, saliva, puncture wounds, avulsions, crush injuries, burns, frostbite, or wounds with devitalized tissue — carry higher tetanus risk and change the booster threshold, so I should confirm which category the laceration falls into before deciding on timing [^112xCc8i] [^notfound].

> Now, I should review the patient's tetanus immunization history. If the patient has never received a tetanus-containing vaccine or has an incomplete primary series, a booster is indicated regardless of wound type, and TIG is added for dirty or major wounds. If the primary series is complete, the timing depends on wound class: for clean and minor wounds, give a booster if more than 10 years have elapsed since the last dose; for dirty or major wounds, give a booster if more than 5 years have elapsed since the last dose. Wait, let me verify the 5-year rule — yes, ACIP explicitly uses > 5 years for dirty wounds and > 10 years for clean wounds in patients with a complete primary series [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo] [^112xCc8i].

> Hold on, I should verify the product choice. For patients aged 11 years and older who have never received Tdap or whose Tdap status is unknown, Tdap is preferred over Td when a tetanus booster is indicated for wound management. For children under 7 years, DTaP is used. For pregnant patients, Tdap is indicated for wound management when a booster is due, irrespective of gestational age, and this does not preclude the routine pregnancy Tdap dose at 27–36 weeks if still needed [^116BqhED] [^114hmV4y] [^114Jg5UE].

> Next, I should review whether tetanus immune globulin is indicated. TIG is indicated for dirty or major wounds when the patient is unvaccinated, has an incomplete primary series, or is immunocompromised, and it should be given with the vaccine using separate syringes at different anatomical sites. I should double-check the dose — CDC wound prophylaxis guidance lists 250 IU IM for adults and children, whereas treatment of established tetanus typically uses 3,000–6,000 IU, so I need to ensure I'm not mixing these contexts [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo] [^1116e68F].

> But wait, what if the patient just had a tetanus-containing vaccine recently? I initially thought a minimum interval of 5 years was required before any wound-related booster, but hold on, I should verify that — ACIP explicitly states that when Tdap is indicated for wound management, it should not be delayed regardless of the interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine, so prior recent dosing does not contraindicate giving a booster now if otherwise indicated by wound type and history. I need to ensure I correct that misconception and document the rationale [^111Sb5Xe] [^115eiH3G].

> I will now examine special populations. In pregnancy, if a tetanus booster is indicated for wound management, Tdap should be administered regardless of gestational age, and this wound-related dose does not replace the routine pregnancy Tdap dose at 27–36 weeks if still indicated. For immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV or severe immunodeficiency, TIG is indicated for dirty or major wounds regardless of vaccination history, so I should not rely on vaccine alone in that scenario [^116BqhED] [^114Jg5UE] [^113ofiLX].

> Let me consider the practical timing relative to injury. Even though tetanus incubation can be days to months, prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible after the wound occurs, and if the patient presents late, it is still reasonable to give indicated vaccine and TIG because disease can develop after longer incubations; I should confirm that there is no absolute upper limit for prophylaxis, and indeed guidelines emphasize administering indicated prophylaxis promptly rather than withholding due to delay, even though earlier is better [^116JrtfT] [^112xCc8i] [^113bW8z8].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the wound class, verify the vaccination history, and then act: for a clean, minor laceration with a complete primary series, give a booster if more than 10 years have passed; for a dirty or major laceration with a complete primary series, give a booster if more than 5 years have passed; for unknown or incomplete histories, give a booster and add TIG if the wound is dirty or major; and if Tdap is indicated, do not delay it due to a recent tetanus-containing vaccine — administer it now and, in pregnancy, coordinate with the routine 27–36 week Tdap if still needed [^112xCc8i] [^113BmGCo] [^114hmV4y] [^111Sb5Xe].

Give a tetanus booster for a laceration **as soon as possible** if indicated by wound type and vaccination history [^112xCc8i]. For clean, minor wounds, give a booster if the last tetanus dose was > 10 years ago; for dirty or major wounds, give a booster if the last dose was > 5 years ago [^114hmV4y]. If the patient is unvaccinated or has an incomplete series, give both a tetanus-containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) [^113ofiLX]. Do not delay indicated prophylaxis; even if presentation is late, administer the vaccine and TIG if indicated, as tetanus can develop after prolonged incubation [^113bW8z8].

## Indications for tetanus prophylaxis

Tetanus prophylaxis is determined by **wound characteristics** and the patient's **vaccination history** [^112xCc8i]:

| **Wound type** | **Indication for tetanus booster** |
|-|-|
| Clean, minor wounds | Booster if > 10 years since last tetanus dose |
| Dirty, major, or puncture wounds | Booster if > 5 years since last tetanus dose |
| Unknown or incomplete vaccination history | - Tetanus-containing vaccine <br/> - Plus TIG if wound is dirty or major |

---

## Timing of tetanus booster administration

The tetanus booster should be administered **as soon as possible** after the injury [^112xCc8i]. If the patient presents late, do not withhold prophylaxis; tetanus can develop after prolonged incubation, so administer the vaccine and TIG if indicated [^113bW8z8].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Tdap is preferred for wound management in pregnant patients if indicated, regardless of gestational age [^112nnZET].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: TIG is indicated for dirty or major wounds regardless of vaccination history [^113ofiLX].
- **Previous severe reaction**: If there is a history of a severe allergic reaction to a tetanus-containing vaccine, TIG may be considered as an alternative [^116M9vot].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Clean, minor wounds**: Booster if > 10 years since last dose.
- **Dirty, major, or puncture wounds**: Booster if > 5 years since last dose.
- **Unknown or incomplete vaccination**: Tetanus-containing vaccine plus TIG if wound is dirty or major.
- **Do not delay**: Administer prophylaxis as soon as possible, even if presentation is late [^113bW8z8].

---

Tetanus prophylaxis should be administered **promptly** based on wound type and vaccination history, with no undue delay even if the patient presents late [^112xCc8i].

### Common questions about wound care [^112htkzw]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Lacerations, abrasions, burns, and puncture wounds are common in the outpatient setting. Because wounds can quickly become infected, the most important aspect of treating a minor wound is irrigation and cleaning. There is no evidence that antiseptic irrigation is superior to sterile saline or tap water. Occlusion of the wound is key to preventing contamination. Suturing, if required, can be completed up to 24 hours after the trauma occurs, depending on the wound site. Tissue adhesives are equally effective for low-tension wounds with linear edges that can be evenly approximated. Although patients are often instructed to keep their wounds covered and dry after suturing, they can get wet within the first 24 to 48 hours without increasing the risk of infection. There is no evidence that prophylactic antibiotics improve outcomes for most simple wounds. Tetanus toxoid should be administered as soon as possible to patients who have not received a booster in the past 10 years. Superficial mild wound infections can be treated with topical agents, whereas deeper mild and moderate infections should be treated with oral antibiotics. Most severe infections, and moderate infections in high-risk patients, require initial parenteral antibiotics. Severe burns and wounds that cover large areas of the body or involve the face, joints, bone, tendons, or nerves should generally be referred to wound care specialists.

Open fractures — tetanus prophylaxis and operative timing/soft-tissue management: Tetanus toxoid should be administered if the patient had an incomplete primary immunization, if it has been > 10 years since his or her last booster dose, or if the immunization history is unknown or unclear, and tetanus immunoglobulin should be administered if it has been > 10 years since the patient's last booster dose or if he or she has a history of incomplete primary immunization. Patients with open fractures should be taken to the operating room for irrigation and debridement within 24 hours of initial presentation whenever possible, with severe fractures associated with gross wound contamination brought to the operating room more quickly and as soon as clinically feasible based on the patient's condition and resources available. Whenever possible, skin defects overlying open fractures should be closed at the time of initial debridement. Soft tissue coverage should be completed within seven days of injury for open fractures associated with wounds requiring skin grafting or soft tissue transfers.

### Are current UK tetanus prophylaxis procedures for wound management optimal? [^117UvUJY]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a potentially fatal disease that occurs after contamination of a wound with Clostridium tetani spores. The introduction of comprehensive infant vaccination programmes in the 1960s dramatically reduced the incidence of tetanus in the UK. To achieve comprehensive protection against tetanus, the World Health Organization guidelines recommend the administration of the five-dose childhood immunisation regimen and an additional sixth dose, after approximately 10 years, to ensure long-lasting immunity. To supplement these measures, tetanus prophylaxis with human tetanus immunoglobulin is considered essential for incompletely immunised individuals presenting with dirty wounds. However, identifying those individuals who are not fully immunised has, until recently, been problematical. The use of a new rapid, point-of-care immunoassay to assess tetanus immune status may facilitate the optimal management of patients with wounds.

Background

Tetanus, though a vaccine preventable disease, is still a significant public health problem throughout the world and it is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate, particularly in the developing world. The global incidence of tetanus is still estimated at one million cases annually, with a case fatality ratio ranging from 6% to 72% depending on the availability of well equipped intensive care unit. The incidence of tetanus in the developed world is markedly low and is no longer responsible for significant mortality, this has been attributed to high level of health awareness in terms of vaccination and availability of human and material resources to manage the disease. In developed countries tetanus occurs mainly in elderly due to decline in protective antibodies and in developing countries tetanus is common in the young due to lack of effective immunization program and appropriate treatment of injuries.

Tetanus is caused by Clostridium Tetani, a gram positive, anaerobic and spore forming bacterium which is found in soil and in animal and human faeces and the usual mode of entry is through a punctured wounds or lacerations, although tetanus may follow surgery, burns, gangrene, chronic ulcers, dog bites, injections such as with drug users, dental infection, abortion and childbirth. In some patients no portal of entry for the organism can be identified.

Tetanus occurs sporadically and almost always affects non-immunized, partially immunized, or fully immunized persons who fail to maintain adequate immunity with booster doses of vaccine. It is therefore very important, in order to have protection against tetanus, that all age groups have the universal primary immunization with subsequent maintenance of adequate antitoxin levels by means of appropriately timed boosters.

STATEMENT 3 Antibiotic prophylaxis (i.e. a preventive administration of an antibiotic before the emergence of an infection with the aim to prevent it). It is desirable to implement prophylactic antibiotics in selected cases of wounds at high risk of infection. 3A. Avoid antibiotic prophylaxis in a not macroscopically contaminated wound, well vascularized, at low risk of infection (according to statements 2). 3B. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in grossly contaminated wounds and in cases at high risk of infection (according to statement 2) depending on the epidemiological criteria of antibiotic resistance in the area. In high risk wounds (all three variables considered) the EP should explain clearly the reason for avoiding the antibiotic administration.

STATEMENT 4 The assessment of tetanus immunization status in every traumatic wounded patient who arrive in the ED is desirable. 5A. All traumatic wounds are potentially at risk for tetanus infection 5B. The assessment of tetanus immunization status of patients should be performed through a thorough history and consultation of documentation confirming vaccination/booster, and eventually using a diagnostic quick test in doubtful cases. 5C. The following items should be considered as "doubtful" (i.e. cases for which it is not possible to determine the immunization status of the patient): Patient who does not remember the date of the last booster; Patient unconscious, intoxicated or cognitively impaired; Patient who does not understand your language; Patient who, presumably, has never carried out a complete vaccination course. 5D. Access to vaccination data and the availability of a rapid diagnostic test for assessing the status of tetanus immunization permit to streamline costs and to act with greater appropriateness.

Open fracture tetanus prophylaxis — vaccination and immunoglobulin: In addition to intravenous antibiotics, all patients with open fractures should be evaluated for the potential need for tetanus vaccination. The immunization history of the patient should be obtained, and tetanus toxoid should be administered if the last booster dose was given more than 10 years prior to evaluation or if the vaccination history is unknown or unclear. Tetanus immunoglobulin should also be given when it has been longer than 10 years since the last booster dose or when the patient had an incomplete primary immunization.

Immunization — tetanus in traumatic wounds — Tetanus is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious but not contagious. Tetanus immunization status should be evaluated for all patients with a traumatic wound and treated appropriately based on the patient's history and risk of infection. Tetanus immunization, if indicated based on a patient's history and exposure, should be given to all patients with a traumatic wound. Recommendation grade: 1C. Development of clinical tetanus can probably be delayed with oral antibiotics (penicillin and likely others) and should be used if evacuation of an unimmunized patient with a tetanus-prone wound will be delayed or is logistically complicated; this technique is often used in patients claiming an allergy to tetanus toxoid.

### Vaccines for women age 50 and older [^116EVodp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td) Toxoid Boosters

Tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid are excellent immunogens. The primary vaccination series in childhood provides high-level protection and induces long-lasting immunologic memory, as evidenced by an anamnestic antibody response to Td after intervals of > 30 years. High levels of primary vaccination and appropriate wound care (including Td boosters) are the cornerstones of tetanus prevention in the United States. The current recommendation that all adults in the United States receive Td boosters every 10 years has been poorly implemented, as evidenced by serosurveys showing that most adults > 50 years of age lack protective levels of antibodies to either tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or both. Despite this high level of serosusceptibility, tetanus (≈30 cases/y) and diphtheria (0–3 cases/y) are rare diseases and almost always occur in persons who never completed the full schedule of childhood vaccinations. Cost and benefit studies favor a policy of a single mid-life Td booster for persons who have completed the full pediatric series, and several advisory groups have recommended a booster at 50 years of age as an alternative to the current standard of decennial boosters. Consideration of reducing the frequency of Td boosters will be complicated by the proposed addition of the acellular pertussis vaccine to the adult Td formulation, as it is more costly and induces a shorter duration of antibody response than Td.

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults (1,2). After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines (3).

### Clinical guidance for wound management to prevent tetanus… [^112xCc8i]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The best ways to prevent tetanus are vaccination and wound management.
- There are steps healthcare providers can take during wound care to minimize the risk of tetanus.
- Antibiotics aren't recommended during wound care to protect against tetanus. Recommendations Healthcare providers should take the following steps to prevent tetanus:

- Provide appropriate wound care
- Evaluate the patient's tetanus vaccination status
- Assess the need for prophylactic tetanus immune globulin. Wound assessment and care Appropriate wound care consists of
- Assessing the type of wound
- Observing for signs of infection
- Properly treating infected wounds.
- Penetrating or puncture wounds
- Wounds containing dirt, soil, feces, or saliva
- **Wounds containing devitalized tissue**:
- Burns
- Compound fractures
- Crush injuries
- Frostbite
- Necrotic or gangrenous wounds
- **Burns Care Healthcare providers should**:
- Clean all wounds
- Remove dirt or foreign material
- Remove or debride necrotic material. Vaccination recommended For all wounds
- People with an unknown vaccine history
- Unvaccinated people
- People with an incomplete tetanus primary series For clean and minor wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 10 or more years ago. For dirty or major wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 5 or more years ago. TIG assessment TIG contains antibodies against tetanus toxin and functions as an antitoxin. TIG can provide temporary protection against tetanus by directly binding and neutralizing circulating toxin.

TIG cannot neutralize toxin that's already bound to nerve endings. TIG prophylaxis indications For clean and minor wounds TIG is never indicated for clean and minor wounds. For dirty or major wounds
- People with an unknown tetanus vaccine history
- People who have never received tetanus vaccines
- People with an incomplete tetanus vaccine primary series
- People with HIV
- People with a severe immunodeficiency. Care If indicated, administer 250 international units of TIG intramuscularly. TIG is commercially available for purchase. CDC doesn't stockpile or supply TIG.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^1121mYfn]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults. After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines.

### Accuracy of parental-reported tetanus vaccination status for children with lacerations [^115GmQ7p]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether emergency department (ED) providers are able to accurately assess whether a child with a laceration needs tetanus prophylaxis.

Methods

We conducted an 8-month prospective cross-sectional study of children presenting with a laceration to a pediatric ED. We asked ED providers whether tetanus prophylaxis was necessary. An ED pharmacist accessed the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System (USIIS), and we assessed the accuracy of the ED provider's determination of necessary tetanus prophylaxis compared with USIIS records.

Results

Among 375 patients aged 5 months to 17 years, ED providers made an inaccurate assessment of necessary tetanus prophylaxis in 33 cases (8.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3%-12.1%). Emergency department providers would have inappropriately administered tetanus prophylaxis in 5 cases (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.5%-3.2%) and would have missed the need for tetanus prophylaxis in 28 cases (7.5%; 95% CI, 5.2%-10.6%). Emergency department providers were more likely to provide an inaccurate recommendation in older children (8.3 vs 4.8 years; P < 0.001), in patients with a dirty wound (45.5% vs 11.7%; P < 0.001), and in children who had fewer than 3 vaccines recorded in the USIIS (54.5% vs 1.2%; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Emergency department providers may inaccurately assess the need for tetanus prophylaxis in children. Special attention should be paid to cases of dirty wounds and cases in which fewer than 3 tetanus-containing vaccines have been given.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116BqhED]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention of Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus

Pregnant women who have completed the childhood immunization schedule and were last vaccinated more than ten years previously should receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine to prevent neonatal tetanus. The risk of neonatal tetanus is minimal if a previously unimmunized woman has received at least 2 properly spaced doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine during pregnancy; one of the doses administered during pregnancy should be Tdap, administered according to the current guidance. She should complete the 3-dose primary series at the recommended intervals.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management

ACIP has recommended administering tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) when indicated as part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus (Table 6). A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated as part of wound management if more than five years has passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous vaccination with Tdap, Td should be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated and Td is unavailable, Tdap may be administered.

TABLE 6
Guide to tetanus prophylaxis in routine wound management

Abbreviations: DTaP = diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine; Tdap = tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis; Td = tetanus and diphtheria toxoids; TIG = tetanus immune globulin.

* Such as, but not limited to, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, and saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, and frostbite.

† DTaP is recommended for children aged < 7 years. Tdap is preferred to Td for persons aged ≥ 11 years who have not previously received Tdap. Persons aged ≥ 7 years who are not fully immunized against pertussis, tetanus or diphtheria should receive one dose of Tdap for wound management and as part of the catch-up series.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^112o323B]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is added by this report?

During January 2008–March 2014 in California, a total of 21 tetanus patients were reported. All were hospitalized, including 19 in intensive care units; five (24%) died. Of 16 patients with an acute injury prior to illness, only nine had sought medical care, and only two of the nine received appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. In addition, some patients with tetanus were not administered the recommended dosage of tetanus immune globulin.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Routine vaccination of patients every 10 years is important to prevent tetanus, particularly in settings where patients do not seek medical care following an injury, where no injury is evident to the patient, or where appropriate postexposure prophylaxis is not provided following an injury. Efforts to educate health care providers might lead to better tetanus postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds and better use of therapeutic tetanus immune globulin for patients with tetanus.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (wound management), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a dose of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis if a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is indicated in non-pregnant individuals with documentation of previous tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccination.

### Notes from the field: tetanus in an unvaccinated child-Oregon, 2017 [^11678fLJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

The boy required 57 days of inpatient acute care, including 47 days in the intensive care unit. The inpatient charges totaled $811,929 (excluding air transportation, inpatient rehabilitation, and ambulatory follow-up costs). One month after inpatient rehabilitation, he returned to all normal activities, including running and bicycling. Despite extensive review of the risks and benefits of tetanus vaccination by physicians, the family declined the second dose of DTaP and any other recommended immunizations.

This is the first pediatric tetanus case in > 30 years in Oregon (unpublished data, Oregon Health Authority, 2018). The diagnosis of tetanus is made based on clinical findings because the bacterium C. tetani is difficult to grow from wounds. A wound culture from the child's laceration did not grow C. tetani. However, a negative wound culture does not rule out disease. The health care costs to treat this child's preventable disease were approximately 72 times the mean (2012) cost of $11,143 for a U.S. pediatric hospitalization. A recent report describing adult tetanus cases included hospital charges ranging from $22,229 to $1,024,672.

Widespread use of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines (tetanus toxoid inactivated vaccine or a combination vaccine that contains tetanus toxoid) and tetanus immune globulin for wound management has led to a 95% decline in the number of tetanus cases and a 99% decrease in the number of tetanus-related deaths since the 1940s. From 2009 to 2015, 197 tetanus cases and 16 tetanus-associated deaths were reported in the United States. Unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated persons are at risk for tetanus, irrespective of age, and recovery from tetanus disease does not confer immunity.

Routine administration of a 5-dose DTaP series is recommended for all eligible children at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, then a dose at 15–18 months of age, and a fifth dose at 4–6 years of age. Booster doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are recommended every 10 years throughout life. Uninsured or underinsured eligible children may receive vaccines at no cost through the Vaccine For Children program. Resources to assist health care providers in discussing vaccination with their patients, including how to address questions, are available online.

### Tetanus vaccine recommendations… [^113bnVzb]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- CDC recommends tetanus vaccines for people across the lifespan, including for wound management.
- Follow the recommended immunization schedule to ensure that your patients get the tetanus vaccines that they need.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure that your patients are protected from tetanus. The following summarizes CDC's current age-based recommendations for DTaP, Tdap, and Td. Access the official, full text of CDC's current and historical DTaP/Tdap/Td vaccine recommendations. Keep ReadingTetanus vaccination during wound care. Infants and children CDC recommends routine DTaP vaccination for all infants and children younger than 7 years old. Administer a 5-dose DTaP series, 1 dose at each of the following ages:

- 2 months
- 4 months
- 6 months
- 15 through 18 months
- 4 through 6 years. Adolescents CDC recommends routine Tdap vaccination for all adolescents. Administer a single dose of Tdap at 11 to 12 years of age.

Catch-up guidance Vaccinate children who miss their shots or start the series later than recommended. Depending on the child's age when vaccination begins, the recommendation varies for
- Type of vaccine
- Number of doses
- Interval between doses Job aids for simplifying catch-up guidance Use the following job aids to help interpret table 2 of the child and adolescent immunization schedule. Adults CDC recommends vaccination every 10 years for all adults to maintain protection against tetanus. Once an adult has received a dose of Tdap, administer Td or Tdap for their booster doses. Keep ReadingTdap products for adults 65 years or older. Patients with a contraindication A history of a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose is a contraindication to further doses. For patients with a contraindication specific to pertussis-containing vaccines, follow these age-based recommendations.

Children < 7 years of age: See About young children with a contraindication to pertussis-containing vaccines. Persons ≥ 7 years of age: Use Td instead of Tdap. Find more resources below about contraindications.

§ Persons with HIV infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunization.

¶ Yes, if > 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

 Yes, if ≥ 5 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

Persons who have completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series and have received a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine < 5 years earlier are protected against tetanus and do not require a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine or TIG as part of wound management. An attempt should be made to determine whether a patient has completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. Persons who have not completed the primary series might require tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management (Table 6). When both TIG and a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine are indicated, the products should be administered using separate syringes at different anatomical sites. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunizations.

Persons with a history of an Arthus reaction following a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine until > 10 years after the most recent dose; this interval is recommended regardless of the wound condition (e.g. even if contaminated or severe). In all circumstances, the decision to administer TIG should be based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus (Table 6).

Discussion

Although rates of tetanus have declined, sporadic cases continue to occur, particularly in adults who are not up-to-date with TT. Vaccination coverage among children is higher; in 2012, an estimated 82.5% of U.S. children aged 19–35 months and 84.6% of U.S. children aged 13–17 years had received ≥ 4 doses of diphtheria toxoid-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) and ≥ 1 dose of tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), respectively. In contrast, only 62% of adults aged ≥ 19 years had received TT during the preceding 10 years; coverage for adults aged ≥ 65 years was 55%. All of the tetanus patients reported in California during January 2008–March 2014 were adults aged ≥ 21 years. Among the 12 patients with verified vaccination histories, none recalled receiving TT during the preceding 10 years. Health care providers should assess patient vaccination status during routine visits to determine whether TT is needed. ACIP recommends that after receiving a primary childhood series, a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) dose should be given during adolescence and every 10 years thereafter. For added protection against pertussis, one of the Td booster doses should be Tdap if it was not previously administered.

Even minor wounds or abrasions can result in tetanus, highlighting the importance of ensuring that patients are up to date for TT. Providers should assess vaccination status in patients with wounds and in particular older adults, injection-drug users, patients with diabetes, and those with chronic wounds, all of whom are considered at increased risk for tetanus. Patients who have completed the 3-dose primary TT series need a booster dose as part of wound management if they have a clean, minor wound and received their last TT dose more than 10 years prior to injury, or if they have any other type of wound and received their last TT dose more than 5 years prior to injury. ACIP recommends that persons with unknown or incomplete histories receive TT as part of routine wound management; patients with wounds that are neither clean nor minor should receive TIG in addition to TT. Although the dosage of TIG for PEP is not specified in the recommendations, dosage information is provided in the product insert. §

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management Recommendations

A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for wound management when > 5 years have passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous Tdap vaccination, either Td or Tdap may be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. Complete information on tetanus prophylaxis and the use of tetanus immunoglobulin when indicated for wound management is available at.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1149uFWC]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

Tetanus remains a severe disease with substantial mortality and global burden. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with trismus, dysphagia, rigidity or spasms. High CFRs in resource-limited settings underscore the need for early diagnosis and access to high-quality critical care sustained over long periods. Tetanus can be prevented with timely wound care and by strengthening vaccination programmes. Further research is needed to optimise antitoxin dosage and routes of administration; identify tractable biomarkers to assist in early diagnosis and prognostication; and rehabilitate critical care survivors.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^111EHLuZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2013, ACIP reviewed the most recent safety and immunogenicity data available at that time to inform their recommendations regarding a second routine dose of Tdap. ACIP concluded that a second dose of Tdap would be safe and immunogenic at 5- or 10-year intervals. However, antipertussis antibodies decline rapidly after the first year (,–), and vaccine effectiveness studies indicated that pertussis protection begins to wane within 2–4 years after receipt of a single Tdap dose. This likely limits the impact of a second dose of Tdap on the overall burden of pertussis in the United States. In addition, Tdap vaccines have an uncertain role in prevention of transmission and in herd protection. ACIP concluded that the data did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap, given the likely limited public health impact.

In January 2019, FDA approved Adacel for a second Tdap dose if administered ≥ 8 years after the first Tdap dose and for use for tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management if ≥ 5 years have elapsed since the previous receipt of any tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. In light of the new indication for a second dose of Adacel and evidence of Tdap being used frequently in place of Td, ACIP reassessed current Tdap recommendations. In October 2019, ACIP recommended that either Tdap or Td vaccines could be used in situations where only Td vaccine had been recommended previously. This report provides recommendations for the use of Td or Tdap for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management, and catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history.

Results

Definitions

At the end of the work the panel and the referees have reached an agreement on the following definitions of traumatic wounds:
Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin with no evidence of macroscopic contamination or signs of active infection (and likely low probability of infection).
Dirty Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin macroscopically contaminated. Among these wounds we include those with simultaneous perforation of a viscus; with presence of devitalized tissues; with foreign bodies; those that occurred in a contaminated environment (dung, marshes); animal bites; puncture wounds; wounds with a delayed treatment.
Infected Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin with signs of infection (secretions).

After completed that step, the panel reached consensus on a series of statements concerning the management of traumatic wounds. For each statement, selected references are provided. The statements are as follows:
STATEMENT 1 All traumatic wounds are to be considered contaminated at presentation in ED.

STATEMENT 2 It is useful to provide an initial stratification of the risk of infection for all the traumatic wounds. The risk assessment should be based on both the following: i) type of wound; ii) location of the wound; iii) characteristics of the wounded patient. With the aim of simplifying and optimizing the management of patients in the ED, the following fields of stratification of the risk of infection was identified: type of wound, location of the wound, characteristics of the patients. In Tables 2, 3, 4 the suggested items for risk assessment are summarized. Table 2 Infection risk assessment based on type of wound Table 3 Infection risk assessment based on the location of the wound Table 4 Infection risk assessment based on the characteristics of the patient 2A. Avoid antibiotic administration in low risk wounds (for all three variables considered). 2B. Consider antibiotic administration when one or two high risk variables are present. 2C. If the decision to avoid antibiotic administration in high risk wounds is made the reason must always be clearly stated. 2D. In every wound consider the risk of tetanus according to the patient's immunization status.

Rationale for Recommendations

In 2013, ACIP did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap; the rationale was described in previously published guidance. In 2019, ACIP again concluded that in light of the higher cost of Tdap relative to Td and uncertainty about the impact that receipt of multiple Tdap doses would have on pertussis control and transmission, there continues to be insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend that Tdap replace Td. However, given the reassuring safety profile and evidence of widespread use of Tdap in place of Td, to allow providers more flexibility, either Tdap or Td was recommended for use in situations when previously only Td was recommended. ACIP recommends that either Td or Tdap be used for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and for additional required doses in the catch-up immunization schedule if a person has received at least 1 Tdap dose.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^1114uf3X]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

While the literature is inconclusive for low-energy wounds, there is support for prophylactic antibiotic usage when wounds are complex, are of higher energy, have anatomic location such as hands/feet, and/or have other high-risk features mentioned above. Higher energy GSWs are associated with increased infection rates, at least in part because the increased mass of devitalized tissue creates an excellent medium for bacterial growth without full host defenses. For high-energy wounds, 24–72 hours of systemic antibiotics have been recommended. However, previous studies have indicated that only in a fraction of cases could the type of weapon be accurately determined, so ultimately most of these judgments must rely on examination of the wound. This led to the axiom to treat 'the wound and not the weapon' from Lindsey. Even if the degree of tissue contamination and tissue destruction merit antibiotic prophylaxis, antibiotics alone, without adequate debridement, would be insufficient. When antibiotic prophylaxis is determined necessary for lower energy GSWs, a first-generation cephalosporin (or clindamycin in the setting of a penicillin allergy) generally is sufficient. Appropriate duration is unclear and likely needs to be determined based on the same considerations described above. Tetanus vaccination status should be addressed.

Methods

Beginning in September 2018, the ACIP Pertussis Vaccines Work Group participated in monthly telephone conferences to review Tdap vaccination recommendations. A search of clinical trials published during January 2013–June 2019 that examined Tdap vaccination in adolescents and adults who had previously received Tdap was performed, so the work group could review data that had not previously been reviewed by ACIP. Because of limited data on the use of > 1 Tdap dose in the catch-up immunization schedule, the work group also considered published and unpublished safety data on receipt of > 1 Tdap dose within a 12-month period in both pregnant women and nonpregnant adolescents and adults. Data from public sector orders (CDC, unpublished data, 2019), commercial insurance claims (Truven Health Analytics, unpublished data, 2019), and a published study from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) were analyzed to assess stakeholders' values attributed to perceived benefits and harms, acceptability, and implementation considerations regarding use of Tdap in place of Td.

Summaries of evidence, including the evidence to recommendations framework and assessment of programmatic considerations, were presented to ACIP at the October 2018, June 2019, and October 2019 meetings. Proposed recommendations were presented to the committee at the October 2019 meeting, and, after a public comment period, were approved by the voting members as follows: either Td or Tdap should be allowed for use in situations where only Td is currently recommended for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and catch-up vaccination, including in pregnant women (14 voted in favor, and none opposed).

Background

Two Tdap vaccines are licensed for use in the United States. Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline) is approved for a single dose in persons aged ≥ 10 years; Adacel (Sanofi Pasteur) is approved for persons aged 10–64 years. Since 2005, a single booster dose of Tdap has been recommended for children and adolescents aged 11–18 years and adults aged 19–64 years to increase protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Booster doses of Td have been recommended every 10 years (decennial vaccination) to ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria. These recommendations were expanded to include a single dose of Tdap for adults aged ≥ 65 years in 2012 (although only one Tdap product is approved for use in persons aged ≥ 65 years, either vaccine administered to a person aged ≥ 65 years is considered valid). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy to prevent pertussis in infants too young for routine vaccination (off-label use *). If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for wound management, Td has been recommended for nonpregnant persons aged ≥ 7 years who had previously received Tdap. For pregnant women, Tdap is recommended in this setting. For previously unvaccinated persons aged ≥ 7 years, a 3-dose catch-up immunization schedule included only 1 dose of Tdap, preferably as the first dose in the series (off-label use in children aged 7–9 years), and 2 subsequent Td doses at specified intervals. No further doses of Tdap were routinely recommended, with two exceptions: pregnant women should receive Tdap during each pregnancy (off-label use), and children aged 7–10 years who received Tdap as part of the catch-up schedule were recommended to receive the routine adolescent Tdap booster dose at age 11–12 years. In 2010, ACIP evaluated the safety of administering Tdap at intervals < 5 years after Td administration and recommended that the dose of Tdap, when indicated, should not be delayed and should be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^116M9vot]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Sixteen (76%) patients reported that an acute injury had occurred before illness onset; including punctures (seven), abrasions (four), linear lacerations (three), compound fracture (one) and animal bite (one). Of six patients with data on wound depth, two had wounds that were > 1 cm deep. Seven of 11 patients with available data had wounds that appeared infected, and two of seven patients with available data had wounds with devitalized, ischemic, or denervated tissue. Five patients reported no acute injuries before onset; of these, three were injection-drug users. The remaining two patients could not recall any acute injuries; however, one reported an insect bite, and the other reported chronic abrasions on the hands and feet and exposure to soil.

Of the 16 patients who reported acute injuries before illness onset, nine had sought medical care for their injuries (Table 2). Of the nine, only two received appropriate PEP before the onset of tetanus symptoms as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (Table 3). Of the seven patients who did not receive appropriate PEP, five had punctures or contaminated wounds and unknown TT vaccination histories, and should have received both TT and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) as recommended. However, four patients did not receive any PEP, and one received TT PEP only. Of the two remaining patients, one had a clean, minor wound and reported receiving at least one TT dose more than 10 years ago, but was not offered TT PEP as recommended; the other patient was contraindicated for TT because of a history of anaphylaxis, but was not offered TIG as an alternative.

Following their tetanus diagnoses, all 21 patients were treated with TIG; six were treated ≤ 1 day after symptom onset, eight ≤ 4 days, six ≤ 9 days, and one was treated > 2 weeks after onset. Among the five fatal cases, one patient was treated ≤ 1 day after symptom onset, two were treated ≤ 4 days, and two ≤ 9 days after onset. Of 15 patients for whom data on TIG dosage were available, five received less than the 3,000–6,000 U that is generally recommended for treatment; two received less than 500 U, and three received 500–1,000 U.

Off-Label Use of Vaccine

Off-label indications based on age and pregnancy status have not changed (Table). New off-label indications for Adacel would include any additional routine or catch-up Td dose beyond a second dose administered ≥ 8 years after an initial Tdap dose, if not given for wound prophylaxis within the specified guidance. Any additional doses of Boostrix administered beyond the single licensed dose are considered off-label. The work group did not find any reason to distinguish between these two products in making its recommendations.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^115uZV1E]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Soft tissue injury

Of note, the focus of this section is on civilian trauma, with the acknowledgment that military-grade (ie, higher energy) weapons are sometimes used in civilian trauma. Further, this review will focus on isolated soft tissue injuries that are not associated with underlying bony or hollow viscus injury.

Simple lacerations (other than face and scalp)

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of simple lacerations?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple soft tissue lacerations. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: There are no recent data to support prophylactic antibiotics for uncomplicated, traumatic soft tissue lacerations. Most high-quality evidence on this topic is over 20 years old, and supports avoiding antibiotics, while much of the recent literature is focused on soft tissue injury with underlying open fractures but does not address isolated soft tissue injury. Overall, the studies emphasize the importance of adequate irrigation, debridement, removal of foreign bodies, and appropriate closure technique as the major means of infection prevention. While the little data that exist generally support forgoing antibiotic prophylaxis, it is important to identify the cases that are more complex and thus may have different management considerations. Moran et al provide a useful approach, advising the consideration of both high-risk wounds and high-risk patients, which may affect a clinician's decision to give antibiotic prophylaxis. The WHO provides a similar framework for wound assessment that includes size, contamination, and other high-risk factors. Clinicians should work from a baseline understanding that in most simple, traumatic soft tissue wounds in civilian patients, prophylactic antibiotics are likely unnecessary, and then adjust only on the basis of specific patient-related or wound-related risk factors or concerns. Additionally, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

### Tetanus immunity and physician compliance with tetanus prophylaxis practices among emergency department patients presenting with wounds [^112gXgdB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine tetanus seroprotection rates and physician compliance with tetanus prophylaxis recommendations among patients presenting with wounds.

Methods

A prospective observational study of patients aged 18 years or older who presented to 5 university-affiliated emergency departments (EDs) because of wounds was conducted between March 1999 and August 2000. Serum antitoxin levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay with seroprotection defined as more than 0.15 IU/mL. Seroprotection rates, risk factors for lack of seroprotection, and rates of physician compliance with tetanus prophylaxis recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices were determined.

Results

The seroprotection rate among 1,988 patients was 90.2% (95% confidence interval 88.8% to 91.5%). Groups with significantly lower seroprotection rates were persons aged 70 years or older, 59.5% (risk ratio [RR] 5.2); immigrants from outside North America or Western Europe, 75.3% (RR 3.7); persons with a history of inadequate immunization, 86.3% (RR 2.9); and persons without education beyond grade school, 76.5% (RR 2.5). Despite a history of adequate immunization, 18% of immigrants lacked seroprotection. Overall, 60.9% of patients required tetanus immunization, of whom 57.6% did not receive indicated immunization. Among patients with tetanus-prone wounds, appropriate prophylaxis (ie, tetanus immunoglobulin and toxoid) was provided to none of 504 patients who gave a history of inadequate primary immunization (of whom 15.1% had nonprotective antibody titers) and to 218 (79%) of 276 patients who required only a toxoid booster.

Conclusion

Although seroprotection rates are generally high in the United States, the risk of tetanus persists in the elderly, immigrants, and persons without education beyond grade school. There is substantial underimmunization in the ED (particularly with regard to use of tetanus immunoglobulin), leaving many patients, especially those from high-risk groups, unprotected. Better awareness of tetanus prophylaxis recommendations is necessary, and future tetanus prophylaxis recommendations may be more effective if they are also based on demographic risk factors.

Stab wounds

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of stab wounds?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple stab wounds that involve only soft tissue. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: Stab wounds can range from small but deep lacerations to more shallow wounds akin to simple lacerations. They are caused by objects of variable cleanliness. Like all wounds, irrigation and debridement of any devitalized tissue are paramount for infection prevention. Adequate irrigation of the deepest portions of stab wounds can be challenging without extension of the skin defect, and opening the wound further may require sedation or a trip to the operating room. This added morbidity must be weighed against potential benefit. Deeper wounds are at higher risk of infection. The nature of the penetrating object, if known, as well as the extent and type of contamination, might sway a clinician's decision about antibiotics if there is a particular concern (eg, contamination with soil or aquatic microbes). Stab wounds that communicate with deeper body cavities or structures are generally managed based on the underlying injury. As mentioned above, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (adults), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis in individuals aged ≥ 19 years who have never received a dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, regardless of the interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. Administer booster doses of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis every 10 years throughout life to ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria.

### A 4-year review of human bite injuries presenting to emergency medicine and proposed evidence-based guidelines [^1169mWXG]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Human bite injuries are a common injury, roughly accounting for around 0.1% of attendances to Emergency Medicine departments. Morbidities associated with such injuries are legion. Of paramount importance is the potential for infection of the wound site, both bacterial and viral. A retrospective 4-year review of 3136 case notes was conducted, identifying 421 human bites. This amounts to one every 3 days! The majority of those bitten were young males (male:female ratio = 3:1; 44% comprising the age group 16–25 years). The management of these wounds was found to be poor. 17% of patients did not receive any antibiotic cover; 21% of patients either did not have tetanus prophylaxis administered when required or had a tetanus booster when they were already covered; 34% of patients either did not receive a hepatitis B booster when one was required or received one when they were already covered. This lack of effective documentation, along with errors in addressing prophylaxis of the infective agents, may have profound medico-legal consequences. The author believes that the findings will be reproduced in other centres and in view of the inadequacies highlighted by this work, it is necessary to introduce an evidence-based protocol for the comprehensive management of the human bite. Using United Kingdom Department of Health evidence-based guidelines, the author proposes such a pathway.

### Laceration repair: a practical approach [^1138Ptrx]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The goals of laceration repair are to achieve hemostasis and optimal cosmetic results without increasing the risk of infection. Many aspects of laceration repair have not changed over the years, but there is evidence to support some updates to standard management. Studies have been unable to define a "golden period" for which a wound can safely be repaired without increasing risk of infection. Depending on the type of wound, it may be reasonable to close even 18 or more hours after injury. The use of nonsterile gloves during laceration repair does not increase the risk of wound infection compared with sterile gloves. Irrigation with potable tap water rather than sterile saline also does not increase the risk of wound infection. Good evidence suggests that local anesthetic with epinephrine in a concentration of up to 1:100,000 is safe for use on digits. Local anesthetic with epinephrine in a concentration of 1:200,000 is safe for use on the nose and ears. Tissue adhesives and wound adhesive strips can be used effectively in low-tension skin areas. Wounds heal faster in a moist environment and therefore occlusive and semiocclusive dressings should be considered when available. Tetanus prophylaxis should be provided if indicated. Timing of suture removal depends on location and is based on expert opinion and experience.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^111Sim5c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Tetanus is an acute and sometimes fatal disease characterized by sudden muscle contractions. The number of tetanus cases reported annually in the United States has declined significantly since the 1930s and 1940s as a result of the introduction of tetanus vaccines. However, sporadic cases continue to occur in persons who are not up-to-date with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccinations (TT) and do not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). To assess the extent of these cases, the California Department of Public Health reviewed all tetanus cases reported during January 2008-March 2014. A total of 21 tetanus patients were reported; five (24%) died. An average of three cases were reported each year during 2008–2013; the average annual incidence among patients aged ≥ 65 years (0.23 cases per 1 million population) was twice that among patients aged 21–64 years (0.10 cases per 1 million population). Of 16 patients with an acute injury before illness and diagnosis, nine (56%) sought medical care, and two (22%) of the nine received appropriate PEP. Although tetanus is rare, it is a life-threatening disease that is preventable. Health care providers should ensure that their patients are up-to-date with TT vaccination and provide appropriate postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds.

### Audit of tetanus prevention knowledge and practices in accident and emergency departments in england [^117XopFA]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the knowledge and current tetanus prevention practices of various staff members in accident and emergency (A&E) departments.

Design, Setting and Participants

A structured questionnaire containing 16 questions on tetanus guidance, anti-tetanus practice, vaccination preparations and information on the population served by the department was sent to medical and nursing staff in A&E departments across England.

Results

366 completed questionnaires from 67 hospitals were returned. 48.9% of the questionnaires were completed by the medical staff and 39.9% by the nursing staff at various grades. 75% of respondents said that their department had a local tetanus guideline, but only 29% stated that the tetanus guidelines were always followed. 31.4% of respondents said that injecting drug users were managed as a high-risk group in their department. Many respondents did not follow the national policy; they tended to err on the side of caution when it came to defining and treating tetanus-prone wounds, with 22.1% stating that they would consider any wound tetanus prone. Contrary to current Department of Health guidelines, 46.2% of respondents said that they would give a booster dose if the fifth dose had been given > 10 years ago.

Conclusions

There are clear differences between the recommended guidelines for tetanus prevention and current practice in A&E departments. The changes announced in 2002 do not seem to have been widely implemented. As a result, the apparent success of the national tetanus vaccination programme may be the result of more cautious clinical practice than would be expected from the UK policy. If national recommendations for tetanus are implemented in clinical practice, then the impact on control of the disease should be monitored closely.

### Recommendations for burns care in mass casualty incidents: WHO emergency medical teams technical working group on burns (WHO TWGB) 2017–2020 [^116EzNAg]. Burns (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations 10b

At first receiving hospital: on arrival the following burn wound care is recommended:

- Cool burn wound if less than 3 h since injury with (running) potable/drinking water if available (avoid hypothermia).
- Provide analgesia to patient.
- Re-triage patient (on-arrival triage).
- Clean wound /scrub.
- Re-estimate TBSA.
- Determine burn depth.
- Confirm site of burn.
- Re-assess for other injuries including inhalational injury.
- Re-triage after wound clean/scrub (definitive triage).
- Confirm tetanus status (and give booster and/or Immunoglobulin if indicated).
- Determine appropriate dressing.

At the first receiving hospital: recommendations for:

the early management of inhalational injury include:

- Sit patient up if no suspicion of other trauma injuries (i.e. burn injuries only);
- Avoid excess fluid;
- Consider early intubation and ventilation.

Patients with < 20% TBSA and no 'special area' burns
- Consider early discharge with out-patient follow up if < 20% TBSA and superficial /partial thickness or non-special area burns.
- Ensure adequate out-patient support for those discharged (e.g. wound care, social and community support and clear care pathway communicated).

Patients with > 20% TBSA and/or deep dermal or 'special area' burns
- Patients should be reviewed by an experienced burn clinician.
- Such patients are likely to benefit from on-going in-patient care.
- Ensure comprehensive documentation of TBSA estimation, burn depth and burn site in addition to standard clinical history and examination.
- Patients with burns in 'special areas' such as across/near joints, hands, face or feet, and those with large burns to benefit from grafting and subsequent scar management, should be reviewed by a rehabilitation specialist.

Immediate first aid for burn injury influences the clinical course and severity of the burn. Basic first aid should include cooling, pain relief, cleaning and application of a simple clean dressing to the burn wound. Cooling of the burn wound should occur up to three hours after the injury was sustained and thus can be continued from scene into the first receiving hospital. Evidence has demonstrated benefit in burn care, and a reduction in future complications, from both good effective basic first aid delivered by first responders and in the cooling of a burn within this 3 hour time period.

First aid treatment should continue from scene to first receiving health facility.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116GATpn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

This report compiles and summarizes all previously published recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding prevention and control of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria in the United States, specifically after the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccines, and does not contain any new recommendations. A timeline of ACIP recommendations for DTaP and Tdap during 1991–2015 is available at. This report describes the process undertaken and the rationale used in support of these recommendations and is intended for use by clinicians and public health providers as a resource.

From the late 1940s through the 1990s, vaccination against pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus with a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine was recommended for infants and young children. Receipt of DTP was commonly associated with local adverse events (e.g. redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and less commonly with serious adverse events. Because of safety concerns about the whole-cell pertussis component of DTP, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines were developed and subsequently replaced doses of DTP in the 1990s. Since 1997, infants and young children have been recommended to receive a 5-dose series of DTaP. In 2005, ACIP recommended that adolescents and adults receive a single dose of a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. After receipt of Tdap, adolescents and adults are recommended to receive a booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. In 2012, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, ACIP recommended a dose of Tdap for women during each pregnancy.

Special Situations

Accelerated Schedule for Infants and Children Aged < 7 Years

For an infant or child aged < 7 years, circumstances such as travel, potential loss to follow-up or increased risk of exposure to pertussis might warrant an accelerated schedule to provide protection as early as possible. An accelerated schedule can be started as soon as the infant is aged 6 weeks, with the second and third DTaP doses administered no earlier than 4 weeks after each preceding dose. The fourth DTaP dose should not be administered before the infant is aged 12 months and should be separated from the third dose by at least 6 months. The fifth DTaP dose should not be administered before the child is aged 4 years. When considering an accelerated schedule, providers also should consider the timing of other recommended vaccines and well-child visits.

History of Pertussis

Persons who have a history of pertussis should receive a pertussis-containing vaccine (i.e. DTaP or Tdap) according to the routine recommendation. Although pertussis disease is likely to confer natural immunity against pertussis, the immune response might be suboptimal against subsequent pertussis disease and the duration of protection induced by an infection does not provide long-term immunity.

Persons Who Have Recovered from Tetanus or Diphtheria

Tetanus or diphtheria infection do not necessarily confer immunity against re-infection; therefore, active vaccination should be initiated at the time of recovery from the illness according to the schedule. Persons who have completed the primary tetanus vaccination series should receive a booster dose as soon as feasible during convalescence. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and should begin the 3-dose tetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccination series.

Vaccine Administration

A summary of dose schedules is provided (Tables 4 and 5).

All health care personnel administering vaccinations should be aware of the potential for syncope after vaccination, especially among adolescents and young adults, and should take appropriate measures to prevent potential injuries. Providers should strongly consider observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated. If syncope occurs, the vaccine recipient should be observed until symptoms resolve.

### Tetanus in the emergency department: a current review [^112CtfJB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of effective immunization to prevent tetanus, there are still up to one million cases per year worldwide. Although the majority of tetanus cases occur in third world countries, there are still significant numbers of cases occurring in countries such as the United States, where preventive immunization is easily accessible. The Emergency Physician has the opportunity to contribute to the decline of the incidence of tetanus through knowledge of those at greatest risk for inadequate immunization and through providing proper wound care and immunization prophylaxis.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116JrtfT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Epidemiology of Tetanus

Tetanus is a life-threatening but vaccine-preventable disease caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. The organism is a ubiquitous, spore-forming, motile Gram-positive bacillus found in high concentrations in soil and animal excrement. C. tetani spores enter the body through breaches in the skin or mucous membranes. Germination of C. tetani spores occurs under anaerobic conditions, such as in necrotic tissue that can result from deep puncture wounds or blunt trauma. C. tetani bacilli vegetate and produce tetanospasmin, a powerful exotoxin that binds irreversibly with neural tissue and causes spasms and rigidity of skeletal muscles. Direct person-to-person transmission of C. tetani does not occur.

The incubation period from injury to symptom onset varies from 3 to 21 days (median: 7 days), with extremes of 1 day to several months. The incubation period depends on the severity and site of the wound. Shorter incubation periods are associated with more severe disease and a poorer prognosis; longer incubation periods are associated with injuries furthest from the central nervous system. The course of disease is variable but is usually intense for ≥ 4 weeks before subsiding. The convalescent period is usually protracted and long-term neurologic sequelae and intellectual and behavioral abnormalities might follow recovery. The case-fatality ratio for tetanus is highest in infants and the elderly, and can be as high as 100% without high-quality medical care, but is approximately 10%–20% even in modern health care facilities.

Prevention of Neonatal and Obstetric Tetanus

Pregnant women who have completed the childhood immunization schedule and were last vaccinated > 10 years previously should receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine to prevent neonatal tetanus. The risk for neonatal tetanus is minimal if a previously unvaccinated woman has received at least 2 properly spaced doses of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine during pregnancy; at least 1 of the doses administered during pregnancy should be Tdap, administered according to published guidance. If > 1 dose is needed, either Td or Tdap may be used. The 3-dose primary series should be completed at the recommended intervals.

### Issues related to the decennial tetanus-diphtheria toxoid booster recommendations in adults [^112YgLrL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In terms of disease prevention, reduction of adverse reactions, and cost benefit studies, a strong case can be made for a policy that focuses on assuring high levels of primary immunization with tetanus and diphtheria (Td) toxoids and abandons the decennial Td booster in favor of a single midlife booster at age 50–65 years. The addition of acellular pertussis antigens to Td for routine use in adults has potential problems in terms of schedule, cost, and possible adverse reactions. Careful risk/benefit studies are necessary to evaluate its effectiveness and priority.

### Clinical guidance for wound management to prevent… [^113BmGCo]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The best ways to prevent tetanus are vaccination and wound management.
- Tetanus vaccination and TIG prophylaxis may be indicated depending on the wound type and patient's vaccination history.
- Antibiotics aren't recommended during wound care to protect against tetanus.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Wound assessment and care Appropriate wound care consists of
- Assessing the type of wound
- Observing for signs of infection
- Properly treating infected wounds. Assessment Wounds can be categorized based on their tetanus exposure risk. Clean and minor wounds don't pose a major risk. Dirty or major wounds pose an increased risk. For example, wounds containing devitalized tissue can allow Clostridium tetani to proliferate. The following are examples of dirty or major wounds:

Tetanus vaccination status evaluation Vaccination not recommended Regardless of wound type, no tetanus vaccination is needed if the patient meets both criteria below:

- Received last tetanus vaccination less than 5 years ago
- Completed the primary vaccine series. Vaccination recommended For all wounds
- People with an unknown vaccination history
- Unvaccinated people
- People with an incomplete tetanus primary series For clean and minor wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 10 or more years ago. For dirty or major wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 5 or more years ago. TIG assessment TIG contains antibodies against tetanus toxin and functions as an antitoxin. TIG can provide temporary protection against tetanus by directly binding and neutralizing circulating toxin. TIG cannot neutralize toxin that's already bound to nerve endings.

TIG prophylaxis indications For clean and minor wounds TIG is never indicated for clean and minor wounds. For dirty or major wounds
- People with an unknown tetanus vaccination history
- People who have never received tetanus vaccines
- People with an incomplete tetanus vaccine primary series
- People with HIV
- People with a severe immunodeficiency. Care If indicated, administer 250 international units of TIG intramuscularly. TIG is commercially available for purchase. CDC doesn't stockpile or supply TIG.

### Global epidemiology of diphtheria, 2000–2017 [^117HFTv2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Given a previous lack of global guidance on diphtheria-containing booster doses after the 3-dose primary series, a wide variety of schedules had been adopted by different countries as of 2018. Twenty-four percent of countries used the 3-dose series alone, and other countries offered 1–3 booster doses on varying schedules; 24% of countries also included > 1 adult booster doses, defined as a dose recommended at or after 18 of years of age (Figure 2). Although there are no global estimates of coverage for booster doses, available data suggest coverage is lower than that for the primary series in many countries.

Figure 2
Percentage (number) of countries reporting each diphtheria vaccination schedule, 2018. The number after the plus sign indicates the number of booster doses on the national schedule after the 3-dose primary series and before the age of 18 years.

In August 2017, WHO released revised recommendations for diphtheria vaccination. In addition to the 3-dose primary series in infancy, new recommendations include 3 diphtheria toxoid–containing booster doses given at 12–23 months of age, 4–7 years of age, and 9–15 years of age. These recommendations, which harmonize with the updated recommendations for tetanus boosters released in February 2017, emphasize the need for a life course vaccination approach and present new opportunities for synergies with other vaccines and healthcare activities, such as measles second dose, preventive care at school entry, and human papillomavirus vaccination. In addition, it is now recommended that the combined tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid vaccine be used during pregnancy and when tetanus prophylaxis is required because of injury, rather than using tetanus toxoid alone. The objective of this study was to review the epidemiology of diphtheria since 2000, including global aggregate surveillance data, vaccination coverage data, and available data regarding the age and vaccination status of infected persons.

### Managing snakebite [^114Zhu3h]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Other treatments

Neostigmine with atropine is a potentially useful adjunct in patients bitten by snakes such as some cobras with postsynaptic neurotoxins in their venom. Its use must never delay or preclude antivenom treatment or intubation.

Administer a tetanus toxoid booster in all patients except in those with coagulopathy, in which case injection is postponed until haemostasis is achieved. Aspirate large tense bullae to facilitate nursing the bitten limb, pre-empt spontaneous rupture, and prevent secondary infection. Broad spectrum antibiotics are indicated only if the wound has been incised or there are signs of necrosis, wound infection, or abscess formation. Surgical debridement or amputation of gangrenous digits or limbs and skin grafting may be needed. Fasciotomies are rarely justified since compartment pressures usually remain within normal limits.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (adults), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, preferably as the first dose in the catch-up series, in individuals aged ≥ 19 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria.

### Post-traumatic endophthalmitis involving Clostridium tetani and Bacillus spp [^117MLEgt]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of post-traumatic infectious endophthalmitis caused by Clostridium tetani and Bacillus spp.

Methods

Case report.

Results

A 25-year-old man developed endophthalmitis after a traumatic corneoscleral laceration of his right eye by a concrete reinforcement bar. He underwent pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy with aspiration of vitreous fluid and a conjunctival swab for cultures. Cultures from the conjunctival swab were negative for organisms. Cultures of the vitreous aspirate were positive for Bacillus species and C. tetani. He had received a tetanus toxoid booster at the emergency department. By the time the culture results became available, he had developed severe eye pain associated with marked orbital congestion, increased swelling and erythema of the lids, marked injection and chemosis of the conjunctiva, and subsequently underwent evisceration. The inflammation resolved after evisceration of the right eye, and he was discharged to home on doxycycline 100 mg orally two times daily for 10 days.

Conclusion

We are unaware of previous reports of endophthalmitis involving C tetani and could find none in a computerized MEDLINE search. Patients with penetrating eye injury should be assessed for tetanus immunization status, and early intervention with tetanus toxoid booster and/or tetanus immune globulin should be considered if cultures are positive.

### Committee opinion no. 718: update on immunization and pregnancy: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination [^116tawKP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Indicated tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination during pregnancy: If a Td booster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy (ie, more than 10 years since the previous Td vaccination) then obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care providers should administer the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy within the 27–36–weeks-of-gestation window; this recommendation is because of the nonurgent nature of this indication and the desire for maternal immunity and also will maximize antibody transfer to the newborn.

### Corneoscleral laceration and ocular burns caused by electronic cigarette explosions [^115go1BU]. Cornea (2016). Low credibility.

An otolaryngology consult was obtained for his facial and oral injuries; no acute surgical intervention was recommended. A computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for radio-opaque intraocular or orbital foreign bodies. The patient underwent an emergent repair of his open globe with partial iridectomy and repositing of the remaining prolapsed iris. Anterior chamber washout was not performed because of intraoperative concerns regarding wound integrity. He received moxifloxacin 400 mg intravenously and a tetanus booster. His left corneal burn was treated with a combined neomycin (3500 I.U./g), polymixin B (6000 I.U./g), and dexamethasone 0.1% ointment every 2 hours.

The next day, the patient's uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/500 PH 20/200 in the right eye and 20/200 PH 20/100 in the left eye with normal intraocular pressures bilaterally. In the right eye, the repaired corneoscleral laceration was Seidel-negative and the anterior chamber had a persistent 1-mm hyphema. Diffuse mild-to-moderate corneal edema was present bilaterally with near-complete epithelial defects and no limbal ischemia (Figs. 1, 2). He was administered levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily and combined steroid–antibiotic ointment every 2 hours in both eyes. At subsequent postoperative visits, his uncorrected distance vision continued to improve, eventually attaining 20/100 PH 20/40–2 in the right eye and 20/70 PH 20/25 in the left eye by the 2 months follow-up. The right hyphema resolved within the first week, and the bilateral corneal epithelial defects slowly healed over the first month. His corneal sutures were removed after 2 months. He will eventually undergo a rigid gas-permeable contact lens trial in the right eye. This incident was reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the FDA.

### Treatment recommendations… [^111Df2Sz]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires hospitalization.
- Tetanus treatment often involves several types of medications and supportive care.
- Complete recovery can take several months.
- Tetanus infection doesn't provide immunity, so vaccination is recommended during recovery.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Treatment recommendations Administer tetanus immune globulin Dose Medical experts recommend a single, 500 international unit dose of TIG for tetanus treatment. While the optimal therapeutic dose is uncertain, this dose appears as effective as higher doses. It also causes less discomfort. TIG helps remove unbound tetanus toxin from the body. It can't affect toxin already bound to nerve endings. Administration Administer TIG preparations intramuscularly.

TIG preparations available in the United States aren't licensed or formulated for intrathecal or intravenous use. Some medical experts recommend infiltration of part of the dose locally around the wound, although its efficacy hasn't been proven. Alternative treatment If TIG isn't available, healthcare providers can use immune globulin intravenous. Note, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't approved IGIV for this use. In addition, anti-tetanus antibody content varies by lot. Control muscle spasms Healthcare providers should use sedation and muscle relaxant drugs as indicated to control muscle spasms. Patients may require agents to control autonomic nervous system instability. Maintain an airway Healthcare providers should monitor for airway patency because associated muscle spasms can cause airway loss.

Depending on disease severity, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy and mechanically assisted respiration may be lifesaving. Manage wounds and treat infections Clean all wounds. Remove or debride necrotic tissue. Remove any foreign material. Observe wounds for signs of infection. Promptly treat infected wounds. Provide antibiotic therapy Appropriate antibiotic therapy is recommended to reduce the number of tetanus bacteria.

### Pharmacological management of tetanus: an evidence-based review [^112qCxnp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is becoming rarer in both industrialized and developing nations due to an effective vaccination program. In 2010, the World Health Organization estimated there was a 93% reduction in newborns dying from tetanus worldwide, compared to the situation in the late 1980s. Due to its rarity, many diagnostic delays occur as physicians may not consider the diagnosis until the manifestations become overt. Without timely diagnosis and proper treatment, severe tetanus is fatal (mortality is also influenced by the comorbidities of the patient). The principles of treating tetanus are: reducing muscle spasms, rigidity and autonomic instability (with ventilatory support when necessary); neutralization of tetanus toxin with human antitetanus immunoglobulin or equine antitetanus sera; wound debridement; and administration of antibiotics to eradicate locally proliferating bacteria at the wound site. It is difficult to conduct trials on different treatment modalities in tetanus due to both logistical and ethical reasons. However, it is imperative that physicians are aware of the best evidence-based treatment strategies currently available to improve the outcome of patients. This review concentrates on analyzing the current evidence on the pharmacological management of tetanus.

General Recommendations

Persons aged 11–18 years. These persons should receive a single dose of Tdap, preferably at a preventive care visit at age 11–12 years. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, 1 booster dose of either Td or Tdap should be administered every 10 years throughout life.

Persons aged ≥ 19 years. Regardless of the interval since their last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine, persons aged ≥ 19 years who have never received a dose of Tdap should receive 1 dose of Tdap. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, booster doses of either Td or Tdap should be administered every 10 years throughout life.

Pregnant women. No change has been made to the recommendations for routine Tdap immunization during pregnancy. Pregnant women should receive 1 dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of their history of receiving the vaccine. Tdap should be administered at 27–36 weeks' gestation, preferably during the earlier part of this period, although it may be administered at any time during pregnancy.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^114ZLqsH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Currently a rarity in high-income countries, tetanus is a diagnosis not to miss. Deaths from tetanus fell by almost 90% between 1990 and 2019, largely reflecting the success of WHO's Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination campaign. However, deaths among children and adults have plateaued, and tetanus remains an important vaccine-preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, notably in southern Asia, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Tetanus results from infections with spore-forming Clostridium tetani bacteria, usually acquired via contaminated wounds and burns. C tetani releases a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle spasms, rigidity, and dysautonomia. Important complications include laryngeal spasm and resultant airway obstruction and respiratory arrest, nosocomial infections, and sequelae of prolonged immobility. Tetanus is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, but microbiological tests can serve as useful adjuncts. Treatment is multifaceted, requiring source control, antibiotic therapy, and antitoxin administration. With prolonged, quality intensive care, many patients survive with good functional outcome. However, due to challenges in leveraging routinely-collected health-care data and performing high-quality trials in resource-constrained settings, several key questions remain unanswered and optimal treatment strategies are contested. In this Review, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of global tetanus epidemiology, its clinical features and differential diagnosis, principles of management, and prognosis.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^114JmhEQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (children, up to 6 years), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, preferably as the first dose in the catch-up series, in children aged 7–18 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria. Administer either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis if additional tetanus toxoid-containing doses are required. Do not restart the vaccination series in children with incomplete diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis history, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses.

### Human rabies prevention – United States, 2008: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^112gKEKz]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Rabies wound management — initial care of animal bite wounds emphasizes cleansing and selective closure. For many types of bite wounds, immediate gentle irrigation with water or a dilute povidone-iodine solution markedly decrease the risk for bacterial infection, and care should be taken not to damage skin or tissues. Wound cleansing is especially important in rabies prevention because thorough wound cleansing alone without other postexposure prophylaxis markedly reduced the likelihood of rabies in animal studies. Consideration should be given to the need for a booster dose of tetanus vaccine, while decisions regarding antibiotic prophylaxis and primary wound closure should be individualized based on animal species, wound characteristics, and time since the bite; suturing should be avoided, when possible.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^111hFLEF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Localised tetanus is rare, and presents with muscle spasms and rigidity localised to the area around the site of injury, usually a single limb. It is more common in partially immune individuals, such as those who have had primary childhood immunisation but no subsequent boosters. Diagnosis is challenging, but prognosis comparatively favourable, despite the risk of secondary generalisation.

Cephalic tetanus, a variant of localised tetanus, is confined to the head and neck. Such patients may present to stroke services, with facial palsies, dysphagia and dysarthria. Symptoms often fluctuate, leading to a misdiagnosis of transient ischaemic attack. Both flaccid and spastic paralysis can occur in cephalic tetanus, sometimes concurrently. This confusing presentation reflects dual sites of TeNT action. Historic electrophysiological studies and recent rodent experiments suggest that TeNT acts peripherally at facial neuromuscular junctions and centrally at the facial nucleus, giving rise to flaccid and spastic weakness, respectively, which may be uni- or bilateral. Neuroimaging will not identify acute parenchymal abnormalities, though the presence of gas locules may add weight to a probable diagnosis. Cephalic tetanus may generalise without prompt recognition, and it should be considered when patients present with one or more cranial nerve palsies alongside trismus and/or risus sardonicus. Careful examination of the scalp may reveal a contaminated wound.

### Current practice in the management of tetanus [^1163EM7Z]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The most important factor that determines the outcome in tetanus is undoubtedly the quality of supportive care and the rapidity of initiation of treatment after a diagnosis has been made. Rodrigo and colleagues' systematic narrative review on the pharmacological management of tetanus is a timely and exhaustive resource that will benefit clinicians, researchers and students, and will go a long way to ensuring that patients with tetanus get the benefit of optimal management and, hence, the best chance for intact survival.

### Point-of-care testing for tetanus immunity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112whykE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current standard of care for tetanus prophylaxis management in patients with open wounds likely results in overtreatment and unnecessary costs. Point-of-care immunochromatographic tests, known as Tetanus Quick Sticks (TQS), have been developed to qualitatively measure tetanus immunoglobulin levels. Multiple studies advocate their use in EDs. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of TQS to assess their relevance in frontline emergency care.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, The Health Management Information Consortium and The Cochrane Library. Studies were eligible if sensitivity, specificity or cost-efficacy of TQS was reported. At least two authors independently assessed and extracted data from each study. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for TQS.

Results

12 studies were suitable for inclusion (n = 1662865 participants): 1 modelling and 11 prospective observational cohort studies. Eight studies assessed diagnostic accuracy; the summary estimate for sensitivity was 90% (95% CI, 89% to 90%) with specificity 97% (95% CI, 95% to 100%). Six studies investigated cost-efficacy, reporting lower healthcare costs when using TQS instead of the current method of vaccination history, due to a decrease in unnecessary tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin administration. Based on the current NHS supply chain data, TQS use could save £173.05 per tetanus-prone patient.

Conclusion

TQS could confer the greatest cost savings if used in combination with vaccination history in patients with tetanus-prone wounds. A quality assurance process is recommended prior to implementation of TQS in EDs.

### Postexposure prophylaxis for common infectious diseases [^113bW8z8]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is effective in preventing illness after potential or documented exposure to a variety of microbial pathogens and in reducing the risk of secondary spread of infection. Guidelines have been published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for proper use of PEP for bloodborne pathogens, for microorganisms transmitted by either airborne or droplet spread or through direct contact, and for infections acquired after traumatic injuries. Depending on the type of exposure, different forms of PEP are available, including vaccines, immune globulins, antibiotics, and antiviral medications. Physicians should assess a patient's potential need for PEP based on several factors, including the type of exposure, the timing and severity of illness in the source patient, the exposed person's susceptibility to infectious diseases of concern, and the relative risks and benefits of the PEP regimen in an individual situation. Immunity to certain infectious diseases can be ensured with prior infection or vaccination, and by serologic testing in patients with a negative or uncertain history. PEP should be given to persons exposed to index cases of pertussis and invasive meningococcal infection regardless of immunization history, and should be given following rabies and tetanus exposure regardless of the length of delay. In general, PEP should be given as soon as possible following a high-risk exposure. Persons exposed to bloodborne pathogens should have baseline testing for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus antibodies, and follow-up testing at six weeks, three months, and six months postexposure.

### Updated recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) in pregnant women – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2012 [^114DNUbZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

ACIP Recommendations for Pregnant Women

ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal care implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. Health-care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving Tdap.

Guidance for Use

To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant, optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation although Tdap may be given at any time during pregnancy. For women not previously vaccinated with Tdap, if Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum.

Special Situations

Pregnant women due for tetanus booster

If a tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy (i.e. > 10 years since previous Td), then Tdap should be administered. Optimal timing is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Wound management for pregnant women

As part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus, a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine might be recommended for wound management in a pregnant woman if ≥ 5 years have elapsed since the previous Td booster. If a Td booster is recommended for a pregnant woman, health-care providers should administer Tdap.

Pregnant women with unknown or incomplete tetanus vaccination

To ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus, pregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus should receive three vaccinations containing tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids. The recommended schedule is 0, 4 weeks, and 6 through 12 months. Tdap should replace 1 dose of Td, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Cocooning

ACIP recommends that adolescents and adults (e.g. parents, siblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health-care personnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant aged < 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis if they have not received Tdap previously. Guidance will be forthcoming on revaccination of persons who anticipate close contact with an infant, including postpartum women who previously have received Tdap.

CDC Guidance

Catch-up immunization. For persons aged 7–9 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap dose should be administered at age 11–12 years. If a Tdap dose is administered at age ≥ 10 years, the Tdap dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^1116e68F]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

In this analysis, only nine of 16 patients with acute injuries had sought medical care before their tetanus illness onset and diagnosis, and only two of the nine received PEP with TT or TT plus TIG as recommended. Health care providers might fail to provide TIG PEP because of a lack of knowledge about current recommendations or because the assessment of wound severity and whether a patient should be managed with TIG according to ACIP recommendations can be subjective. All tetanus patients required considerable and costly medical care, including hospitalization, and almost all (90%) were admitted to intensive care. Among patients who received TIG as treatment, there was variability in the dose administered. In the United States, 3,000–6,000 U, given in a single intramuscular dose with part of the dose infiltrated around the wound if it can be identified, is generally recommended for treatment. However, the optimal therapeutic dose has not been established, and some experts contend that a dose of 500 U, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is as effective as higher doses and causes less discomfort. It is also possible that some providers treating tetanus patients inadvertently prescribed the PEP dosage of TIG rather than the treatment dosage. Among five treated patients who received < 3,000 U of TIG as treatment, three survived and two died. Among 10 treated patients who received ≥ 3,000 U of TIG, seven survived, and three died.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, although California health care providers are required to report tetanus cases, surveillance is passive, and underreporting is likely. Second, because there is no laboratory testing for tetanus and case identification depends solely on clinical assessment, some cases might be misclassified. Finally, some of the case reports were incomplete, particularly with regard to TT history.

Although significant progress has been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by tetanus, cases of this vaccine-preventable disease continue to be reported. Health care providers should assess the tetanus vaccination status of their patients during routine visits. All providers who provide care for patients with wounds should have protocols for tetanus PEP and ensure that appropriate PEP is provided for such patients.

What is already known on this topic?

The incidence of tetanus has declined significantly since the introduction of tetanus vaccines. However, sporadic cases continue to be reported, particularly in adults who are not up-to-date with tetanus vaccinations.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114w8t4J]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap/Td) — For adults and adolescents with HIV, administer one dose 0.5 mL IM Tdap (Adacel or Boostrix), followed by one dose of Td or Tdap at least 4 weeks after Tdap and another dose of Td or Tdap 6 months to 12 months later, then give Td or Tdap every 10 years (AII). For those who did not receive Tdap at age 11 years or older, give one dose 0.5 mL IM Tdap (Adacel or Boostrix), then Td or Tdap every 10 years (AII), and if indicated, give Tdap regardless of when the last dose of Td was given. In pregnancy, give Tdap preferably in early part of gestational weeks 27–36 (AIII) and one dose of Tdap is indicated for each pregnancy, with boosters to give Td or Tdap every 10 years after Tdap. Additional notes: ideally, dose should be given at least 14 days prior to delivery, and Tdap can be substituted for any Td dose and is always preferred as the first dose. ACIP alignment: no difference in recommendations.

### A 51-year-old woman crushed by an elephant trunk [^111udHj2]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Wild and exotic animal attacks are not common in the United States. Animal-related injuries in the United States are usually caused by dog bites, followed by cattle and horse injuries. Exotic animal attacks can occur when the animals are provoked, depressed, or housed improperly by owners. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman who sustained multiple systemic traumatic injuries after she was pinned to a fence by an elephant's trunk. Upon arrival in the emergency department, she was hypothermic with a temperature of 35.1ºC (95.1ºF), hypotensive to 94/60 mm Hg after 5 L crystalloid, tachycardic at 108 beats/min, and intubated with oxygen saturation of 100%. Tranexamic acid was administered in addition to starting a massive transfusion protocol. Injuries included bilateral multiple rib fractures, left abdominal wall degloving injury, right pneumothorax, right hemothorax, left chest wall puncture wound, grade IV splenic laceration, 3 grade III liver lacerations, retroperitoneal hematoma, and degloving injuries to bilateral posterior thighs requiring more than 30 operations. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Several factors need to be considered when evaluating animal-related injuries, including type, age, and sex of the animal. Multisystem traumatic injuries should be assumed when a large animal is involved. Prehospital care and transport time are vital to a patient's survival in both urban and rural settings. During the initial resuscitation, administering antibiotics tailored to the specific animal can greatly decrease risk of infection and morbidity. Additionally, tetanus immunoglobulin, tetanus toxoid, and rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine may be needed, unless the victim has been previously vaccinated.

Infections developing in damaged skin

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group including bite wounds (animal and human bites), pressure ulcers and burn wounds.

Bite wounds (animal and human bites)

Human bite microbiology generally includes Streptococcus spp, S. aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp and Eikinella spp.

Dog bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella multocida, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and S. aureus.

Cat bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella spp, Capnocytophaga spp, Bartonella henselae (Cat-scratch diseases should be treated with azithromycin 500 mg day 1, 250 mg/day for the next 4 days), S. aureus, Bacteroides spp and Fusobacterium spp.

If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated SSTIs.

Treatment
Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue
Antibiotic prophylaxis as principle is not recommended. It is recommended in selected patients.
Antibiotic therapy in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.
Tetanus prophylaxis in bite wounds

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in preventing infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Primary wound closure is not recommended for wounds, with the exception of those to the face, which should be managed with copious irrigation, cautious debridement, and pre-emptive antibiotics.

The comprehensive meta-analyses of Medeiros et al. in the Cochrane Database demonstrated no evidential basis for reducing the infection rate by prophylactic antibiotics, except for selected cases. Despite the poor state of the evidence wounds that are moderate to severe, have associated crush injury, have associated edema (either preexisting or subsequent), that are on the hands or in proximity to a bone or a joint, or that are in compromised hosts should receive 3–5 days of antibiotic therapy.

A broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is required, if systemic signs of infection or severe cellulitis arise.

Human bites that have broken the skin and drawn blood can theoretically transmit hepatitis B, C, and HIV. A patient who has sustained a bite should always confirm that their tetanus booster is up to date.

### Additional recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced-content diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) [^112gZXTZ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are amending previous recommendations and making additional recommendations for the use of tetanus toxoid, reduced-content diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Review of the results from clinical trials and other studies has revealed no excess reactogenicity when Tdap is given within a short interval after other tetanus- or diphtheria-containing toxoid products, and accrual of postmarketing adverse-events reports reveals an excellent safety record for Tdap. Thus, the recommendation for caution regarding Tdap use within any interval after a tetanus- or diphtheria-containing toxoid product is removed. Tdap should be given when it is indicated and when no contraindication exists. In further efforts to protect people who are susceptible to pertussis, the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a single dose of Tdap for children 7 through 10 years of age who were underimmunized with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP). Also, the age for recommendation for Tdap is extended to those aged 65 years and older who have or are likely to have contact with an infant younger than 12 months (eg, health care personnel, grandparents, and other caregivers).

### Committee opinion no. 718: update on immunization and pregnancy: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination [^111z9mhE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tdap vaccination during pregnancy — ACIP published its updated recommendation that a dose of Tdap should be administered during each pregnancy, and the recommended timing for maternal Tdap vaccination is between 27 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation; to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer and levels in the newborn, vaccination as early as possible in the 27–36-weeks-of-gestation window is recommended. If a pregnant woman is vaccinated early in her pregnancy before 27–36 weeks of gestation, she does not need to be vaccinated again during 27–36 weeks of gestation. However, the Tdap vaccine may safely be given at any time during pregnancy if needed in the case of wound management, pertussis outbreaks, or other extenuating circumstances. Additional data demonstrate that administration during the late second or early third trimester with at least 2 weeks from vaccination to delivery is highly effective, safety data remain reassuring including with successive immunizations and short-interval pregnancies, and immunizing early within the 27–36-weeks-of-gestation window maximizes maternal antibody response and passive transfer; therefore, giving Tdap as early as possible in this window appears to be the best strategy. Receipt of Tdap between 27 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation in each pregnancy is described as critical.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1156pidi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Over 90% of tetanus deaths occur in South/South East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, C. tetani is distributed worldwide, with 32–92 cases diagnosed each year in the European Union/European Economic Area; 17–33 in the USA; and 4–11 in the UK. Despite being notifiable, a study of hospital records from 2001–2014 suggested that cases in England were under-reported by 88%. There appears to be seasonality in Europe, with highest incidence in July, and a second peak in October. This likely reflects increased outdoor activity, which carries risks of skin breaks and wound contamination.

WHO has recommended universal childhood tetanus toxoid vaccination since 1974. Serial vaccination is key. This induces a potent IgG response; antibodies are transmitted transplacentally and vaccinating girls therefore prevents neonatal tetanus. Primary immunisation with a three-dose regimen provides near-total protection against clinical disease, maintained for at least 5 years. Children in Britain receive a primary course at 2, 3, and 4 months, with pre-school and teenage booster doses. This five-dose regimen is probably sufficient to confer lifelong immunity, though WHO recommends six, and global booster schedules vary.

As of 2022, 92% of children in the UK were fully vaccinated, similar to other high-income anglophone countries. However, there is no herd immunity, and with growing concerns about parental vaccine hesitancy, and interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, inquiring about childhood vaccination status is crucial. Conflict and natural disasters can also affect vaccination coverage, even in countries with historically robust programmes.

Major risk factors for tetanus include advanced age, injecting drug use, and diabetes mellitus. Sporadic tetanus outbreaks in the UK have been linked to contaminated heroin. Older individuals are at particular risk; they are more likely to have been born before the rollout of universal childhood vaccination, and vaccine-induced antibody levels diminish with age. Cases are more frequent in men, reflecting unsafe circumcision practices, and lower vaccination rates due to WHO's maternal vaccination focus.

### Committee opinion no. 718: update on immunization and pregnancy: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination [^112DMQmC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

The overwhelming majority of morbidity and mortality attributable to pertussis infection occurs in infants who are 3 months and younger. Infants do not begin their own vaccine series against pertussis until approximately 2 months of age. This leaves a window of significant vulnerability for newborns, many of whom contract serious pertussis infections from family members and caregivers, especially their mothers, or older siblings, or both. In 2013, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices published its updated recommendation that a dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) should be administered during each pregnancy, irrespective of the prior history of receiving Tdap. The recommended timing for maternal Tdap vaccination is between 27 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation. To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer and levels in the newborn, vaccination as early as possible in the 27-36-weeks-ofgestation window is recommended. However, the Tdap vaccine may be safely given at any time during pregnancy if needed for wound management, pertussis outbreaks, or other extenuating circumstances. There is no evidence of adverse fetal effects from vaccinating pregnant women with an inactivated virus or bacterial vaccine or toxoid, and a growing body of robust data demonstrate safety of such use. Adolescent and adult family members and caregivers who previously have not received the Tdap vaccine and who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant younger than 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis. Given the rapid evolution of data surrounding this topic, immunization guidelines are likely to change over time, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists will continue to issue updates accordingly.

Arthus Reactions

Arthus reactions (type III hypersensitivity reactions) are rarely reported after vaccination, but can occur after tetanus toxoid- or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines (CDC, unpublished data, 2005) (,–). An Arthus reaction is a local vasculitis associated with deposition of immune complexes and activation of complement. Immune complexes form in the setting of a high local concentration of vaccine antigens and high concentration of circulating antibody. Arthus reactions are characterized by severe pain, swelling, induration, edema, hemorrhage, and occasionally necrosis. These symptoms and signs usually occur 4–12 hours after vaccination; by contrast, anaphylaxis (an immediate type I hypersensitivity reaction) usually occurs within minutes of vaccination. As with extensive limb swelling, Arthus reactions usually resolve without sequelae. ACIP recommends that persons who have experienced an Arthus reaction following a dose of tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine more frequently than every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of wound management.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (adults), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines, including at least one tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis dose, in individuals aged ≥ 19 years who have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria. Administer vaccination series preferably according to the following schedule: one dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, followed by one dose of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis at least 4 weeks afterward, and one dose of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis 6–12 months later.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^111Sb5Xe]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Persons Aged ≥ 19 Years

Persons aged ≥ 19 years who previously have not received a dose of Tdap should receive a single dose of Tdap in place of a decennial Td booster dose. The dose of Tdap, when indicated, should not be delayed and should be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, booster doses of Td should be administered every 10 years throughout life.

Pregnant Women

ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal care implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. Health care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving the vaccine.

Guidance for Use

Tdap should be administered between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation, although it may be administered at any time during pregnancy. Available data suggest that vaccinating earlier in the 27–36 week time period will maximize passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Tdap may be simultaneously administered with an inactivated influenza vaccine to pregnant women.

If a woman did not receive Tdap during her current pregnancy and did not receive a prior dose of Tdap ever (i.e. during adolescence, adulthood, or a previous pregnancy), then Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum. If a woman did not receive Tdap during her current pregnancy but did receive a prior dose of Tdap, then she should not receive a dose of Tdap postpartum.

The recommended timing for maternal Tdap vaccination is between 27 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation. To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer and levels in the newborn, vaccination as early as possible in the 27-36-weeks-of-gestation window is recommended. However, the Tdap vaccine may be safely given at any time during pregnancy if needed for wound management, pertussis outbreaks, or other extenuating circumstances. There is no evidence of adverse fetal effects from vaccinating pregnant women with an inactivated virus or bacterial vaccine or toxoid, and a growing body of robust data demonstrate safety of such use. Adolescent and adult family members and caregivers who previously have not received the Tdap vaccine and who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant younger than 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis. Given the rapid evolution of data surrounding this topic, immunization guidelines are likely to change over time, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists will continue to issue updates accordingly.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^117VoWzM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (children, up to 6 years), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines, including at least one tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis dose in children aged 7–18 years who have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria. Administer vaccination series preferably according to the following schedule: one dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, followed by one dose of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis ≥ 4 weeks afterward, and one dose of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis 6–12 months later.

Summary

This report compiles and summarizes all recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding prevention and control of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis in the United States. As a comprehensive summary of previously published recommendations, this report does not contain any new recommendations and replaces all previously published reports and policy notes; it is intended for use by clinicians and public health providers as a resource. ACIP recommends routine vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Infants and young children are recommended to receive a 5-dose series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, with one adolescent booster dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. Adults who have never received Tdap also are recommended to receive a booster dose of Tdap. Women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, which should be administered from 27 through 36 weeks' gestation, regardless of previous receipt of Tdap. After receipt of Tdap, adolescents and adults are recommended to receive a booster tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine every 10 years to assure ongoing protection against tetanus and diphtheria.
