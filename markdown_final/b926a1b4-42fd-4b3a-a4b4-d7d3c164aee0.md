## Question

Which condition are vagal maneuvers used to treat?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition vagal maneuvers are used to treat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly counts as a "vagal maneuver" versus device-based vagus nerve stimulation. Then, I should verify the primary guideline-supported indication and the specific tachyarrhythmia phenotypes involved. Next, I will review the comparative efficacy of different techniques and confirm hemodynamic safety criteria. After that, I should examine any diagnostic roles and lower-credibility mentions in other conditions. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable conclusion with the most defensible citations [^114m4gYd] [^117SsMZz].

> Let me first confirm definitions so we don't conflate entities. By "vagal maneuvers", we mean bedside, non-pharmacologic techniques that transiently increase parasympathetic tone (standard or modified Valsalva, carotid sinus massage, ice-to-face/cold immersion), which are distinct from chronic or device-based vagus nerve stimulation used for epilepsy, cluster headache, or investigational cardiovascular indications; I should be clear that the question targets acute maneuvers, not implanted or transcutaneous VNS devices [^1177ERxL] [^113L3HDJ].

> Now, I should verify the core indication before jumping ahead. Guidelines are very consistent: vagal maneuvers are first-line for the acute management of hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), including regular narrow-QRS SVT and typical mechanisms such as AVNRT and orthodromic AVRT; some guidance also permits an initial attempt in stable broad-QRS tachycardia when the diagnosis is not yet established, recognizing their diagnostic utility and safety when performed correctly [^114m4gYd] [^114BcCth] [^114xf1Rt] [^117SsMZz] [^114QgpYr].

> Wait, let me verify the technique question because it affects success rates. Randomized trials show the modified Valsalva maneuver (performed supine with leg elevation after a standardized strain) roughly doubles reversion rates compared with the standard Valsalva or carotid sinus massage, and this has been incorporated into practice recommendations; the Cochrane review and subsequent ED trials align with this signal of superiority, which I should emphasize for bedside effectiveness [^117WE17Q] [^1177ERxL] [^111zeMbP] [^117SsMZz].

> Hold on, I need to ensure safety and context. These maneuvers are for hemodynamically stable patients; if unstable, immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated. Carotid sinus massage should be used with caution and is not routine therapy in syncope; rather, it is mainly a diagnostic tool in patients over 40 with suspected reflex syncope per ESC syncope guidance. Positioning for the modified Valsalva is important, and adherence to standardized strain pressure and timing enhances both efficacy and safety [^114m4gYd] [^117SsMZz] [^113j3Q8J].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications. Let me check: termination of tachycardia with a vagal maneuver (or adenosine) increases the likelihood that the rhythm is SVT, a finding replicated in contemporary electrophysiology cohorts; even non-responders to vagal maneuvers frequently respond to adenosine, suggesting insufficient vagal effect rather than a non-SVT mechanism in many cases [^111Ubj6t] [^113bRe5k].

> But wait, what about mentions outside SVT? I need to separate signal from noise. There are low-credibility case reports of vagal stimulation for hiccups and even intranasal swab termination of PSVT, which are intriguing but not practice-changing; pediatric right ventricular outflow tract VT vagal termination has also been described but remains exceptional. For cluster headache and other neurologic or cardiovascular conditions, evidence centers on noninvasive or implanted VNS devices rather than bedside maneuvers, so they don't redefine the indication for "vagal maneuvers" per se [^1148RcZg] [^116A3hsR] [^112Udu11] [^113WjgrG] [^113B1kBd].

> I should also cross-check real-world effectiveness outside controlled settings. In ambulatory PSVT trials, self-initiated vagal maneuvers often have modest success rates, which underscores the value of proper instruction and the modified technique in monitored care; nonetheless, guidelines still place these maneuvers first in the sequence for stable SVT given safety, speed, and diagnostic value [^1137QLWL] [^114m4gYd] [^117SsMZz].

> Let me consider age-specific nuances. Pediatric cases can respond to modified Valsalva as well, and case-based pediatric emergency literature reflects successful application of the REVERT-style technique; however, the bedrock indication remains the same: hemodynamically stable SVT, with attention to age-appropriate coaching and monitoring [^116GGwc7] [^114m4gYd].

> I should double-check that I'm not missing any competing "primary" indications. Syncope pathways use carotid sinus massage diagnostically, not as definitive therapy, and other organ-system applications rely on device-mediated VNS rather than bedside maneuvers; this reconfirms that the consistent, guideline-backed therapeutic target for vagal maneuvers is stable SVT, with the modified Valsalva favored for higher conversion rates [^113j3Q8J] [^113L3HDJ] [^117WE17Q] [^117SsMZz].

> Synthesis: The condition treated with vagal maneuvers is acute, hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), particularly AVNRT, orthodromic AVRT, and regular narrow-QRS SVT of undetermined mechanism; they are first-line before adenosine or electrical cardioversion, and the modified Valsalva maneuver is preferred for increased success, while unstable patients require immediate cardioversion [^114m4gYd] [^114BcCth] [^114xf1Rt] [^117SsMZz] [^1177ERxL].

Vagal maneuvers are the first-line, non-pharmacologic treatment for **hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)** [^114m4gYd], including AVNRT [^114BcCth] and orthodromic AVRT [^114xf1Rt]. They are also used for **diagnostic differentiation of wide-complex tachycardias** [^114QgpYr] and for acute management of narrow-complex tachycardias of uncertain mechanism [^117SsMZz]. Vagal maneuvers are not effective for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular tachycardia, and are contraindicated in patients with carotid artery disease, recent stroke, or hemodynamic instability.

---

## Clinical indications

### Primary indication: supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)

- **AVNRT**: Acute management of hemodynamically stable patients [^114m4gYd] [^114BcCth].
- **Orthodromic AVRT**: Acute management of hemodynamically stable patients [^114xf1Rt] [^115LdxeZ].
- **Narrow-complex tachycardias of uncertain mechanism**: Acute management in stable patients [^117SsMZz].

---

### Secondary indication: diagnostic differentiation

Vagal maneuvers can aid **diagnostic differentiation** of **wide-complex tachycardias**, distinguishing SVT with aberrancy from ventricular tachycardia [^114QgpYr].

---

## Mechanism of action

Vagal maneuvers increase parasympathetic tone, **slowing AV nodal conduction** and increasing refractoriness, thereby interrupting reentrant circuits and restoring sinus rhythm in AVNRT and orthodromic AVRT [^111zeMbP].

---

## Commonly used vagal maneuvers

| **Maneuver** | **Description** | **Clinical effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Valsalva maneuver | Forced expiration against closed glottis | - 19.4% success in standard form <br/> - Higher with modified technique [^1177ERxL] |
| Carotid sinus massage | Gentle massage of carotid sinus | - 9.1% success [^1177ERxL] <br/> - Caution in elderly or carotid disease |
| Diving reflex (cold face immersion) | Face immersion in ice water | - Useful in pediatric SVT <br/> - Limited adult data |

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Carotid artery disease**: Avoid carotid sinus massage.
- **Recent stroke or TIA**: Avoid carotid sinus massage.
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Avoid vagal maneuvers [^114m4gYd].
- **Severe coronary artery disease**: Use caution.

---

## Limitations and risks

Limitations include **limited effectiveness** [^111zeMbP], with success rates varying and often requiring pharmacologic or electrical therapy [^1137QLWL]. Potential risks include **bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, and neurological complications**.

---

## Alternative treatments

Alternative treatments include **pharmacologic therapy** (adenosine, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) and **electrical cardioversion** for unstable patients or refractory SVT [^114m4gYd].

---

Vagal maneuvers are the **first-line, non-pharmacologic treatment for hemodynamically stable SVT**, including AVNRT and orthodromic AVRT, and are also used for diagnostic differentiation of wide-complex tachycardias [^114QgpYr]. They are not effective for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular tachycardia, and are contraindicated in patients with carotid artery disease, recent stroke, or hemodynamic instability.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a key tool in the treatment of patients with medically refractory epilepsy. Although the mechanism of action of VNS remains poorly understood, this modality is now the most widely used nonpharmacological treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. The goal of this work is to review the history of VNS and provide information on recent advances and applications of this technology.

### Vagal termination of ventricular tachycardia in a pediatric patient [^112Udu11]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia is a rare clinical entity in pediatric patients and typically requires chemical and/or electrical intervention to convert into a sustained sinus rhythm. However, for certain forms originating from the right ventricular outflow tract, conversion with adenosine and vagal maneuvers has been demonstrated in adult patients. In this case, we suggest that pediatric patients with right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia who are hemodynamically stable may benefit from a trial of vagal maneuvers.

### Cardiac vagal nerve activity increases during exercise to enhance coronary blood flow [^1149kVWE]. Circulation Research (2023). High credibility.

The phrase "complete vagal withdrawal" is often used when discussing autonomic control of the heart during exercise. However, more recent studies have challenged this assumption. We hypothesized that cardiac vagal activity increases during exercise and maintains cardiac function via transmitters other than acetylcholine.

- **Methods**: Chronic direct recordings of cardiac vagal nerve activity, cardiac output, coronary artery blood flow, and heart rate were recorded in conscious adult sheep during whole-body treadmill exercise. Cardiac innervation of the left cardiac vagal branch was confirmed with lipophilic tracer dyes (DiO). Sheep were exercised with pharmacological blockers of acetylcholine (atropine, 250 mg), VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide; [4Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17]VIP 25 µg), or saline control, randomized on different days. In a subset of sheep, the left cardiac vagal branch was denervated.

- **Results**: Neural innervation from the cardiac vagal branch is seen at major cardiac ganglionic plexi and within the fat pads associated with the coronary arteries. Directly recorded cardiac vagal nerve activity increased during exercise. Left cardiac vagal branch denervation attenuated the maximum changes in coronary artery blood flow (maximum exercise, control: 63.5 ± 5.9 mL/min, n = 8; cardiac vagal denervated: 32.7 ± 5.6 mL/min, n = 6, P = 2.5×10^-7), cardiac output, and heart rate during exercise. Atropine did not affect any cardiac parameters during exercise, but VIP antagonism significantly reduced coronary artery blood flow during exercise to a similar level to vagal denervation.

### Micardis [^113tJX6v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

**Overdosage**: Limited data are available regarding overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with Micardis tablets include hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia. Bradycardia may occur due to parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension occurs, supportive treatment should be initiated. Telmisartan is not removed by hemofiltration and is not dialyzable.

### Enteric neuropathy and the vagus nerve: Therapeutic implications [^1146ETF3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Enteric neuropathies**: Enteric neuropathies are characterized by abnormalities in the innervation of the gut, which includes the enteric nervous system, inducing severe gut dysmotility.

- **The vagus nerve**: The vagus nerve is a key element of the autonomic nervous system, involved in the stress response, at the interface of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It has anti-inflammatory and prokinetic properties, modulates intestinal permeability, and has a significant capacity for plasticity and regeneration.

- **Therapeutic potential**: Based on its properties, vagus nerve stimulation, or non-stimulation/pharmacological methods, could be of interest in the treatment of enteric neuropathies.

### Atropine sulfate [^115bA2Gf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by the injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents, or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine may also lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally, a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm.

Atropine sulfate injection, USP, in clinical doses, counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when administered by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure. Systemic doses slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Occasionally, therapeutic doses dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly in the "blush" area (atropine flush), and may cause atropine "fever" due to the suppression of sweat gland activity in infants and small children.

The effects of intravenous atropine on heart rate (maximum heart rate) and saliva flow (minimum flow) after intravenous administration (rapid, constant infusion over 3 minutes) are delayed by 7 to 8 minutes after drug administration, and both effects are non-linear.

### Surgically implanted and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation: A review of efficacy, safety and tolerability [^113L3HDJ]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The vagus (tenth cranial) nerve is a mixed parasympathetic nerve, containing both afferent and efferent sensory fibers. An estimated 80% of vagus nerve fibers are afferent and convey visceral, somatic, and taste sensations [6, 7, 8, 9]. The vagus nerve is subdivided into five groups: (1) special visceral afferents, (2) general visceral afferents, (3) general somatic afferents, (4) special visceral efferents, and (5) general visceral efferents [10].

Thorough reviews of vagus nerve anatomy and function have been discussed previously [11, 12]. The vagus nerve connections allow it to modulate the function of higher brain centers, forming the basis for its potential use in many disorders.

### Vagus nerve modulation of inflammation: Cardiovascular implications [^114pX8zk]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The vagus nerve modulates inflammatory responses in various organ systems. Emerging evidence indicates that the vagus can have profound and complex effects on cardiovascular function, remodeling, arrhythmias, and mortality by several mechanisms. In heart failure and during ischemia, an adverse inflammatory response can occur. The vagus nerve may modulate cardiovascular disease and outcomes by affecting inflammatory responses. Here, evidence for and components of the vagus inflammatory reflex are reviewed, and evidence for and implications of effects of vagus activation on inflammation in the cardiovascular system are considered.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^111Ubj6t]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Patients whose tachycardia terminated with adenosine were more likely to have SVT induced at EPS than other patients (Figure 3B, Table 1B). Patients whose tachycardia did not respond to adenosine showed a nonsignificant trend towards being less likely to have SVT induced.

- **Preoperative factors predicting SVT induction and ablation**: Patients who exhibited each feature were compared to all patients who did not, including those with no data unless noted otherwise. The RR values, 95% confidence limits, and p values were calculated using Poisson regression.

	- **(A) An EKG showing regular and uninterrupted SVT**: Predicts SVT induction.
	- **(B) Termination with adenosine or vagal stimulation**: Predicts SVT induction. ND, No Data.
	- **(C) Regular SVT episodes on monitoring**: Predict SVT induction. Patients exhibiting each feature were compared to patients who had no episodes on monitoring.
	- **(D) Pre-excitation**: Predicts SVT induction after excluding other variables. (+) factor indicates typical SVT EKG, termination with adenosine or vagal stimulation, or monitored event ≥ 30 s. Note change in scale.
	- **(E) Preoperative factors that do not independently predict SVT induction**: (+) factor indicates typical SVT EKG, termination with adenosine or vagal stimulation, monitored event ≥ 30 s, or pre-excitation.
	- **(F) Negative predictive factors**: Are non-informative.
	- **(G) Features that predict SVT induction also predict SVT ablation**.

### Impact of a modified Valsalva manoeuvre in the termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^112HGg8i]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a relatively common problem presented to the emergency department. Most sources advocate the use of vagal manoeuvres as first-line management, including the Valsalva manoeuvre. Despite this, there is a lack of standardisation in how the technique is performed, and currently, there is no 'gold standard' Valsalva manoeuvre. We propose a modified Valsalva manoeuvre based on techniques described in small-scale electrophysiological studies, though no large clinical trials have been conducted.

- **Objective**: The study was designed to assess the impact of introducing this modified Valsalva manoeuvre as the departmental standard for non-pharmacological reversion of SVT.

- **Methods**: A retrospective audit reviewing the preceding 6-month presentations of SVT was performed. A questionnaire assessing techniques used and anticipated success rates was completed by a representative sample of emergency department doctors. Finally, a prospective trial of the impact of the modified Valsalva manoeuvre on patients presenting in SVT to the emergency department was conducted. After meeting the study criteria and giving consent, the patients were instructed to perform the modified Valsalva manoeuvre. Specifically, while lying supine on the bed in a Trendelenberg position, they forcefully expired into a section of suction tubing and pressure gauge for at least 15 seconds at a pressure of at least 40 mm Hg.

- **Results**: The retrospective 6-month audit revealed only one successful reversion with Valsalva from a sample of 19 patients. Thirty-two doctors completed the questionnaire.

### Vagus nerve stimulation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease: A state-of-the-art review [^114gVG3g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The antiarrhythmic and anti-inflammatory properties of low-level tragus stimulation have been studied in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Specifically, in patients with paroxysmal AF, after one hour of tragus stimulation or sham, the pacing-induced AF duration decreased significantly, while the AF cycle length increased from baseline in the intervention group but not in the control group. Furthermore, systemic (femoral vein) but not coronary sinus TNF-α and CRP levels decreased significantly only in the intervention group. The reduction of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral vein, but not in the coronary sinus, indicates that the anti-inflammatory action was achieved through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and not merely through a local cardiac vagal effect.

Low-level vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) also plays a role in attenuating postoperative AF and inflammation following cardiac surgery. Specifically, in a randomized study, the incidence of postoperative AF and serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group. According to these findings, the authors concluded that low-level VNS prevented postoperative AF by inhibiting the activity of the cardiac autonomic nervous system and suppressing inflammation.

A recent study investigated the effect of low-level tragus stimulation in postural tachycardia syndrome. In a rabbit model of M2R-AAb (M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-activating autoantibody)-induced postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, low-level tragus stimulation showed promising results.

### Novel vagal maneuver technique for termination of supraventricular tachycardias [^112KQUdH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Hemodynamically unstable patients with supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) should be treated with electrical cardioversion. If the patient is stable, acute termination of tachycardia can be achieved by vagal maneuvers or medical therapy. The Valsalva maneuver, carotid massage, and applying ice to the face are the most common vagal maneuvers. In our experience with patients, we observed that vagal stimulation increases when lying backward. Our suggested maneuver is based on quickly lying backward from a seated position. Then, a short and powerful vagal stimulation occurs, allowing SVT episodes to be terminated effectively. Here, we present our experience with a new maneuver for terminating SVT, supported by case observations.

### The potential for autonomic neuromodulation to reduce perioperative complications and pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gjmeD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). High credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction promotes organ injury after major surgery through numerous pathological mechanisms. Vagal withdrawal is a key feature of autonomic dysfunction, and it may increase the severity of pain. We systematically evaluated studies that examined whether vagal neuromodulation can reduce perioperative complications and pain.

- **Methods**: Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Clinical Trials for studies of vagal neuromodulation in humans. Risk of bias was assessed; I² index quantified heterogeneity. Primary outcomes were organ dysfunction (assessed by measures of cognition, cardiovascular function, and inflammation) and pain. Secondary outcomes were autonomic measures. Standardised mean difference (SMD) using the inverse variance random-effects model with 95% confidence interval (CI) summarized effect sizes for continuous outcomes.

- **Results**: From 1,258 records, 166 full-text articles were retrieved, of which 31 studies involving patients (n = 721) or volunteers (n = 679) met the inclusion criteria. Six studies involved interventional cardiology or surgical patients. Indirect stimulation modalities (auricular [n = 23] or cervical transcutaneous [n = 5]) were most common. Vagal neuromodulation reduced pain (n = 10 studies; SMD = 2.29 [95% CI, 1.08–3.50]; P = 0.0002; I² = 97%) and inflammation (n = 6 studies; SMD = 1.31 [0.45–2.18]; P = 0.003; I² = 91%), and improved cognition (n = 11 studies; SMD = 1.74 [0.96–2.52]; P < 0.0001; I² = 94%) and cardiovascular function (n = 6 studies; SMD = 3.28 [1.96–4.59]; P < 0.00001; I² = 96%).

### Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation and exercise capacity in healthy volunteers: A randomized trial [^115AfGgF]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Our findings complement data obtained in clinical and experimental animal studies, which support the hypothesis that vagal parasympathetic activity determines an individual's ability to exercise. Analysis of heart rate recovery (HRR) profiles after peak exercise in 1,293 participants demonstrated that vagal autonomic dysfunction is strongly associated with reduced exercise capacity. In experimental animal studies, it was shown that inhibition of vagal activity reduced exercise capacity, while selective stimulation of vagal neurons increased exercise tolerance, and this effect was associated with enhanced cardiac contractile response to sympathetic stimulation. Direct stimulation of vagal neurons was also found to maintain cardiac function and exercise capacity in an experimental model of heart failure. It has been suggested that parasympathetic activity modulates myocardial beta-adrenoceptor signaling and optimizes the responsiveness of the heart to sympathetic stimulation. In other words, vagal activity is required for the sympathetic nervous system to increase cardiac output sufficiently to support the metabolic demands of exercise. We hypothesize that the functional interactions between sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac control are modulated by transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), leading to the improvements in measures of cardiorespiratory fitness observed in this study.

### Benicar [^114JYZQm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

**Overdosage**: Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia, while bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurs. If symptomatic hypotension occurs, initiate supportive treatment. The dialyzability of olmesartan is unknown.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^113bRe5k]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

Patients whose tachycardia terminated with a vagal maneuver were also more likely to have SVT induced. However, patients who did not respond to vagal maneuvers were still more likely to have SVT induced than the rest of the population. Notably, almost all vagal non-responders who were subsequently given adenosine had their tachycardia terminate (53 of 58, 91%). This suggests that, in many cases, vagal stimulation was merely insufficient to terminate the arrhythmia. When patients whose tachycardia terminated with adenosine were excluded, vagal non-responders were no more likely to have SVT induced at EPS than others.

When patients with typical SVT EKGs were excluded from the analysis, adenosine- or vagal-responsive patients were still more likely to have SVT induced than others, indicating that these are independent predictors of SVT induction.

- **Cardiac monitors**: Unlike EKGs, which have a standardized format, various types of monitors differ in the duration of the recording, in the number and position of the leads, and in the type of information reported about each event. Because of this variability, it can be problematic to directly compare results obtained from different types of monitors. In general, we did not have complete information on every event, so we focused on the characteristics of the SVT episode with the longest duration, reasoning that this most likely reflected the patient's clinical tachycardia. The comparison (control) group was those whose monitors did not record any SVT episodes.

### Chronic vagal stimulation for the treatment of low ejection fraction heart failure: Results of the NEural Cardiac TherApy foR Heart Failure (NECTAR-HF) randomized controlled trial [^113rFsCv]. European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Increased sympathetic activation and reduced parasympathetic tone, as reflected by reduced baroreflex sensitivity and decreased heart rate variability, are potentially important pathophysiological contributors to the progression of heart failure (HF) irrespective of etiology, and are associated with poor outcomes. Experimental augmentation of parasympathetic tone has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to normalizing autonomic imbalance and inhibiting the progression of HF. The effect of enhancing parasympathetic tone via direct vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) was recently assessed in a non-randomized observational study of 32 HF patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, with results suggesting that vagal stimulation favorably influenced quality of life, exercise capacity, and LV remodeling.

The NECTAR-HF trial (NCT01385176) is the first randomized, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate whether right cervical VNS is safe and might attenuate cardiac remodeling, improve cardiac function, increase exercise capacity, enhance quality of life, and favorably impact circulating biomarkers in symptomatic HF patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction receiving guideline-recommended medical therapy.

### Effect of reversible intermittent intra-abdominal vagal nerve blockade on morbid obesity: The ReCharge randomized clinical trial [^1174azJN]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Although conventional bariatric surgery results in weight loss, it is associated with potential short-term and long-term morbidity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intermittent, reversible vagal nerve blockade therapy for obesity treatment. This research was designed as a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial involving 239 participants. These participants had a body mass index (BMI) of 40 to 45 or 35 to 40, along with one or more obesity-related conditions. The trial was conducted across 10 sites in the United States and Australia between May and December 2011. The 12-month blinded portion of the 5-year study concluded in January 2013.

Interventions included 162 participants receiving an active vagal nerve block device, while 77 participants received a sham device. All participants were provided with weight management education. The main outcomes and measures focused on coprimary efficacy objectives. These objectives aimed to determine whether the vagal nerve block was superior to the sham group in mean percentage excess weight loss by a 10-point margin. Additionally, at least 55% of patients in the vagal block group needed to achieve a 20% loss, and 45% needed to achieve a 25% loss. The primary safety objective was to ensure that the rate of serious adverse events related to the device, procedure, or therapy in the vagal block group was less than 15%.

In the intent-to-treat analysis, the results showed that the vagal nerve block group had a mean excess weight loss of 24.4% (representing a 9.2% initial body weight loss) compared to a 15.9% excess weight loss (6.0% initial body weight loss) in the sham group.

### Rationale and study design of the Neurocardiac Therapy for Heart Failure Study: NECTAR-HF [^111K37QP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

The investigational vagal cuff lead is implanted in all patients by exposing approximately 4–6 cm of the vagus nerve on the right side of the neck. The lead is then tunneled over the clavicle and connected to a pulse generator (Figure 2). The procedure can be performed under general or local anesthesia by an appropriately trained and experienced vascular/cardiovascular surgeon or neurosurgeon. Although the recommendation is to use general anesthesia, the surgical team may decide to use local anesthesia if there is concern about patient safety. Based upon the clinical experience of vagal nerve implants to treat epilepsy, the procedure will take 90 minutes or less to implant in most cases.

The NECTAR-HF (Neural Cardiac Therapy for Heart Failure) implant location involves placing the lead around the cervical vagus nerve and then tunneling it across the clavicle to connect it to the pulse generator, which is located in a pectoral pocket.

- **Stimulation testing and therapy titration**: Once implanted, the system is evaluated by checking the impedance of both electrodes and performing brief stimulation to look for evidence of proper system functioning and implant location. Indicators include activation of the larynx, an acute heart rate reduction of greater than 5 beats, or a respiratory response (breath reflex). For patients assigned to the active treatment group, therapy is delivered at 20 Hz for 10 seconds out of every minute. Titration is performed in all patients by slowly increasing the amplitude (mA) to allow for accommodation.

### Video EEG monitoring prior to vagal nerve stimulator implantation [^111CXrU9]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is a safe alternative therapy for epilepsy but may have rare significant complications. There is no consensus regarding the necessity of video-EEG monitoring to characterize events before the VNS implantation. The authors discuss four patients who were inappropriately referred for, or implanted with VNS without any previous video-EEG monitoring, in the context of their entire case experience.

### Hyperventilation facilitates induction of supraventricular tachycardia: A novel method and the possible mechanism [^113tKYYw]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperventilation has been demonstrated to alter autonomic function. Sympathomimetic drugs, such as isoproterenol, and parasympatholytic drugs like atropine may be needed to facilitate the induction of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The aim of this study was to test the clinical utility and mechanisms of hyperventilation in facilitating SVT initiation.

- **Methods and results**: Fourteen patients with clinically documented SVT (9 with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and 5 with AV reciprocating tachycardia) but non-inducible during baseline electrophysiologic study were included. Immediately after the hyperventilation test (at least 30 respirations/min for 2 minutes), systolic blood pressure, sinus cycle length, anterograde and retrograde 1:1 conduction, and induced SVT were measured. Additionally, arterial blood gas, pH, and heart rate variability before and after hyperventilation were assessed. Seven of nine patients with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and 3 of 5 patients with AV reciprocating tachycardia could be induced immediately after the hyperventilation test. After hyperventilation, anterograde AV and retrograde VA 1:1 conduction improved, sinus cycle length decreased, and heart rate variability decreased in both groups.

- **Conclusion**: Hyperventilation can facilitate the induction of SVT. Improvement in conduction properties and changes in autonomic function are the possible mechanisms.

### Novel insights into the physiology of nutrient sensing and gut-brain communication in surgical and experimental obesity therapy [^115jX7Lu]. Obesity Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Signaling through the vagal nerve may mediate some of the benefits of bariatric surgery (BS). In Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), only the dorsal and ventral gastric vagal branches supplying the stomach are severed while forming the gastric pouch, while the vagal branches traveling with the gastroduodenal and superior mesenteric arteries remain intact. Thus, vagal innervation of the intestine, liver, and pancreas can be mostly spared, except for some branches traveling along the lesser curvature of the stomach to reach the proximal duodenum and parts of the pancreas. Evidence from the rat model indicates that preservation of the celiac branches of the vagal nerve enhances weight loss after RYGB.

While gastrointestinal hormones can reach the brain via circulation to directly regulate feeding behavior, afferent vagal nerve endings contain receptors for many intestinal hormones, and signaling via the vagus nerve may partly account for their effects. Cholecystokinin (CCK), which is released by enteroendocrine cells after ingestion of protein or fat, binds to CCK-A receptors on vagal afferents to suppress further food intake. In rodent models, however, a complete transection of the abdominal vagus nerve has a negligible effect on body weight, although it leads to an increase in meal size, which is compensated by reduced meal frequency. Thus, humoral regulation may be sufficient for long-term control of body weight, with the vagus nerve being more important in the short-term regulation of feeding.

However, if a complete transection of all vagal afferents and efferents is performed, it is impossible to identify the consequences accurately.

### Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation and exercise capacity in healthy volunteers: a randomized trial [^1128j7na]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Vagal parasympathetic dysfunction is strongly associated with impaired exercise tolerance, indicating that coordinated autonomic control is essential for optimizing exercise performance. This study tested the hypothesis that autonomic neuromodulation by non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) can improve exercise capacity in humans.

- **Methods**: This single-centre, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover trial in 28 healthy volunteers evaluated the effect of bilateral transcutaneous stimulation of vagal auricular innervation, applied for 30 minutes daily for 7 days, on measures of cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak)) during progressive exercise to exhaustion. Secondary endpoints included peak work rate, cardiorespiratory measures, and the whole blood inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide ex vivo.

- **Results**: tVNS applied for 30 minutes daily over 7 consecutive days increased VO2peak by 1.04 mL/kg/min (95% CI: .34–1.73; p = 0.005), compared with no change after sham stimulation (-0.54 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: -1.52 to .45). No carry-over effect was observed following the 2-week washout period. tVNS increased work rate (by 6W; 95% CI: 2–10; p = 0.006), heart rate (by 4 bpm; 95% CI: 1–7; p = 0.011), and respiratory rate (by 4 breaths/min; 95% CI: 2–6; P < .001) at peak exercise. Analysis of the whole blood transcriptomic response to lipopolysaccharide in serial samples obtained from five participants showed that tVNS reduced the inflammatory response.

- **Conclusions**: Non-invasive vagal stimulation improves measures of cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the inflammatory response.

### Self-administered etripamil and emergency department visits in supraventricular tachycardia: A secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1137QLWL]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Vagal maneuvers were attempted by 370 patients during PSVT episodes before drug administration; only 17 patients (4.6%) experienced PSVT termination. The pooled cohort consisted of 340 patients (237 females [69.7%]; mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.2] years), with 206 receiving etripamil and 134 receiving a placebo. The mean (SD) number of PSVT episodes in the past year was 8.1 (12.9).

- **Patient characteristics**: One hundred nineteen patients (57.8%) achieved PSVT termination within 30 minutes of using etripamil compared with 43 patients (32.1%) using placebo (P < 0.001). Thirty-four patients (25.4%) assigned to placebo and 30 (14.6%) assigned to etripamil required additional intervention (oral or intravenous medications) (P = .01).

	- **Additional findings**: Twenty-eight out of 206 etripamil recipients (13.6%) needed an ED visit for ongoing PSVT compared to 30 out of 134 placebo recipients (22.4%), indicating an 8.8% absolute risk reduction and a 39% relative risk reduction (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38–0.97; p = 0.04). The most common adverse events were localized to the nasal administration site, with no serious adverse events associated with etripamil.

- **Trial details**: Part 1 of the NODE-301 trial included 49 patients in the placebo group and 107 in the etripamil group. The RAPID trial included 85 patients in the placebo group and 99 in the etripamil group. The pooled analysis included 13 patients.

### Comparing the success rates of standard and modified Valsalva maneuvers to terminate PSVT: A randomized controlled trial [^117WE17Q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The study aimed to detect whether the modified Valsalva maneuver (VM) is more effective than the standard VM in terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).

- **Methodology**: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the emergency department of a training and research hospital between December 1, 2015, and December 31, 2016. Participants were divided into two groups, randomly assigned to standard VM or modified VM, as the first treatment with two-dimensional permutation blocks, in the order of arrival of the patients. In both groups, the determined procedure for standard or modified VM was repeated up to three times in patients whose PSVT did not convert to sinus rhythm. If the maneuver was unsuccessful after three attempts, anti-arrhythmic medication was administered. The primary outcome was defined to compare the success rate of achieving sinus rhythm after standard VM or modified VM.

- **Results**: Fifty-six patients were randomized to modified or standard VM, with 28 patients in each treatment arm. Three of 28 patients (10.7%) in the standard VM group and 12 of 28 patients (42.9%) in the modified VM group returned to sinus rhythm after intervention (p = 0.007). The number of patients who required rescue treatment was lower in the modified VM group, with 16 (57.1%) out of 28, compared to 25 (89.3%) out of 28 in the standard VM group (p = 0.007).

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that modified VM therapy was more effective than standard VM for terminating PSVT. The modified VM therapy also indirectly reduced the need for anti-arrhythmic medication and resulted in fewer side effects.

### Modified carotid sinus massage using an ultrasonography for maximizing vagal tone: a crossover simulation study [^116XryPT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to ascertain if a modified carotid sinus massage (CSM) using ultrasonography is superior to the conventional CSM for vagal tone generation.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, crossover, clinical trial including 30 subjects with sinus rhythm. Participants were paired, and they performed two types of CSM on each other. To perform the conventional technique, pressure was exerted at the point where the maximal impulse of the carotid pulse was palpated. In the modified technique, participants localized the point of maximal diameter just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery using ultrasonography and applied pressure to that point. Mean differences between premaneuver and postmaneuver R-R intervals and heart rates were compared. The distance from the midline of the neck (x distance) to the angle of the mandible (y distance) was measured, and the mean distance between the two techniques was compared.

- **Results**: The baseline mean premaneuver R-R interval and heart rate did not differ significantly between the two techniques. The postmaneuver R-R interval and heart rate, as well as the mean R-R interval and heart rate differences, were significantly greater in the modified CSM. The mean location determined using the modified CSM was located 0.8 cm lateral and 0.8 cm superior to the mean location of the conventional CSM.

- **Conclusion**: The modified CSM using ultrasonography might be more useful than the conventional CSM in reverting episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and may be a suitable alternative for treating the same.

### Preventing acute asthmatic symptoms by targeting a neuronal mechanism involving carotid body lysophosphatidic acid receptors [^113fWVZf]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

To ensure the maintenance of vagal–vagal reflexes after carotid body denervation and to rule out the possibility of indirect effects, we tested whether carotid body denervation abolished bronchoconstriction induced by aerosolized capsaicin, a potent activator of C-fiber-mediated vagal–vagal reflexes. As expected, capsaicin-induced bronchoconstriction was abolished by vagotomy but was not affected by carotid body denervation (Fig. 6d, Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Similar results were observed in both naive and asthmatic animals. Additionally, to ensure that increased plasma LPA was not provoking increased airway resistance via a vagal–vagal reflex, we exposed asthmatic rats to nebulized LPA. LPA had no immediate effect on airway resistance. An increase in airway resistance occurred after 30 minutes, but this was abolished by carotid body denervation (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Together, these data suggest the increase in lung resistance with nebulized LPA is dependent on the carotid body.

### Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation and exercise capacity in healthy volunteers: A randomized trial [^1115Liyd]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The robust repeated crossover design, which separates time period effects from treatment effects, remains valid only if no treatment × period interaction exists; therefore, a comparison of data obtained during Visits 1 and 3 was undertaken. If neither carry-over nor period effects are found, the appropriate analysis of continuous data from a two-period, two-intervention crossover trial is a paired t-test.

As baseline readings did not differ between interventions, pairwise contrasts for sham-tVNS and tVNS were treated as independent groups. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made, as the study outcomes had been pre-specified in the analysis plan. All other outcomes were considered exploratory.

The statistical analyses were predefined in the protocol and the statistical analysis plan and finalized before unblinding (see Supplementary Data). There were no interim analyses or stopping rules. The sample size of 28 participants was calculated to allow detection of at least a 0.5 mL/kg/min difference in VO2 peak for the crossover design, with 90% power and a Type I error rate of 5%, assuming a standard deviation of 0.8 mL/kg/min for the difference between the two values for the same participant. For the age range of volunteers recruited, predicted VO2 peak values for below-average to average cardiorespiratory fitness levels are between 31 and 38 mL/kg/min for women and between 35 and 42 mL/kg/min for men. Sample size justification for the RNAseq analysis is provided in Supplementary Data.

### Rumination syndrome: Assessment of vagal tone during and after meals and during diaphragmatic breathing [^116eUBx9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology of rumination syndrome (RS) is not well understood. Treatment with diaphragmatic breathing improves rumination syndrome. The aim of the study was to characterize vagal tone in patients with rumination syndrome during and after meals and during diaphragmatic breathing.

- **Methods**: We prospectively recruited 10 healthy volunteers (HV) and 10 patients with RS. Subjects underwent measurement of vagal tone using heart rate variability. Vagal tone was measured during baseline, test meal, and intervention (diaphragmatic breathing (DiaB), slow deep breathing (SlowDB), and normal breathing). Vagal tone was assessed using mean values of root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and area under curves (AUC) were calculated for each period. We compared baseline RMSSD, the AUC, and meal-induced discomfort scores between HV and RS. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of respiratory exercises on symptom scores and number of rumination episodes.

- **Key results**: There was no significant difference in baseline vagal tone between HV and RS. During the postprandial period, there was a trend to higher vagal tone in RS, but not significantly (P > .2 for all). RS had higher total symptom scores than HV (P < .011). In RS, only DiaB decreased the number of rumination episodes during the intervention period (P = .028), while both DiaB and SlowDB increased vagal tone (P < .05 for both). The symptom scores with the three breathing exercises showed very similar trends.

- **Conclusions and inferences**: Patients with RS do not have decreased vagal tone related to meals. DiaB reduced the number of rumination episodes.

### Vagal nerve function in obesity: therapeutic implications [^1164TNLH]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The primal need for nutrients is satisfied by mechanisms for sensing internal stores and detecting food; ATP is the most primitive signal. With increasing density of sensory neurons and glia (the primordial brain) and the emergence of autonomic neural activity throughout the endoderm, transmitters and other signaling molecules enable alimentation before the appearance of innate storage functions. Memory and, ultimately, cognition are prerequisites for processing and producing food to facilitate assimilation and safeguard the supply of nutrients. The gut-brain-gut axis via the vagus nerve is the autonomic neurohumoral pathway integrating these elements of energy homeostasis.

Humans uniquely override obligate nutrient needs, eating in the absence of deprivation, resulting in pathological chronic overnutrition arising from dysautonomia. Obesity surgery circumvents powerful redundant mechanisms of alimentation and reduces excess stores of body fat from chronic overnutrition while preventing re-accumulation of fat. All bariatric operations, whether purely restrictive, maldigestive and malabsorptive, or combinations, rely on regulatory mechanisms related to autonomic nervous system function and the brain-gut axis. We review the functional anatomy and the importance of the vagus nerve for maintaining maladaptive chronic overnutrition and describe interventions to abrogate its effects.

In aggregate, the preponderance of evidence supported by laboratory and clinical mechanistic studies interrupting abdominal bi-directional vagal transmission demonstrates that the majority of patients benefit from these interventions.

### Effectiveness of the Valsalva manoeuvre for reversion of supraventricular tachycardia [^111zeMbP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

People with the cardiac arrhythmia supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) frequently present to clinicians in prehospital and emergency medicine settings. Restoring sinus rhythm by terminating the SVT involves increasing the refractoriness of atrioventricular nodal tissue within the myocardium through vagal manoeuvres, pharmacological agents, or electrical cardioversion. A commonly used first-line technique to restore normal sinus rhythm (reversion) is the Valsalva manoeuvre (VM). This is a non-invasive means of increasing myocardial refractoriness by increasing intrathoracic pressure for a brief period, thus stimulating baroreceptor activity in the aortic arch and carotid bodies, resulting in increased parasympathetic (vagus nerve) tone.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence of effectiveness of the VM in terminating SVT.

- **Search methods**: We updated the electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to August week 3, 2014), EMBASE Classic and EMBASE Ovid (1947 to 27 August 2014), Web of Science (1970 to 27 August 2014), and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 22 August 2014). We also checked trials registries, the Index to Theses, and the bibliographies of all relevant publications identified by these strategies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of VM in terminating SVT.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted the data using a standardised form. We assessed each trial for internal validity.

### Is successful electroconvulsive therapy related to stimulation of the vagal system [^113mTGAs]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been shown to exhibit strong beneficial effects in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). While the exact underlying mechanisms are under debate, a role for the sympathetic response upon ECT has been suggested. When assessing patients with MDD for autonomic function, however, a loss of vagal function is prominent.

- **Objective**: Here, we aimed to assess the immediate effects of ECT on vagal activity and to test the hypothesis that surrogates of the latter correlate with therapeutic outcome.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with MDD who underwent ECT treatment were assessed regarding their vagal function using electrophysiological measures and determination of pancreatic polypeptide (PP), which is known to be released upon vagal stimulation. Parameters were correlated to the improvement of disease severity upon ECT treatment.

- **Results**: Patients showed a significant increase of PP shortly after ECT, which correlated with clinical improvement. Furthermore, the described association with the sympathetic phase after ECT could be verified.

- **Conclusion**: ECT increases vagal activity, which might be associated with the beneficial effect seen following this treatment. PP elevation after administration of ECT might be a useful parameter to estimate the degree of such vagal stimulation after treatment.

### Vagus nerve stimulation dampens intestinal inflammation in a murine model of experimental food allergy [^111tSac9]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

These findings show that vagotomy does not significantly affect the severity of experimental food allergy in mice sensitized to OVA. Re-exposure to OVA triggers an inflammatory process in the gut that is usually potentiated with each challenge, leading to intestinal symptoms like diarrhea.

To explore the role of vagal tone in food allergy development, we assessed the impact of VGX on allergic diarrhea. Although VGX mice developed diarrhea more frequently (80%) compared to PP control mice (63%), this difference was not significant. Considering diarrhea is mediated by mast cells (MC), we examined the effects of VGX on serum levels of mMCP‐1, a marker of MC degranulation. The increase in mMCP‐1 levels induced by OVA challenges did not significantly differ between VGX and PP mice at any time point.

Moreover, VGX did not significantly change the duodenal expression of Th2 genes. These results suggest that an impaired vagal tone does not significantly impact the severity of experimental food allergy, indicating that basal vagal tone is redundant in these conditions.

### Vagus nerve stimulation for cardiovascular diseases: Is there light at the end of the tunnel [^114XeLvB]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction and chronic inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of several cardiovascular diseases (CVD), such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, atherosclerotic CVD, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. The vagus nerve provides parasympathetic innervation to the heart, vessels, and lungs and is also implicated in the neural control of inflammation through a neuroimmune pathway involving the spleen. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (VNS) can, in principle, restore autonomic balance and suppress inflammation, with potential therapeutic benefits in these diseases. Although VNS ameliorated CVD in several animal models, early human studies have demonstrated variable efficacy. The purpose of this review is to discuss the rationale behind the use of VNS in the treatment of CVD, critically review animal and human studies of VNS in CVD, and propose possible means to overcome the challenges in the clinical translation of VNS in CVD.

### BET 2: Trendelenburg position helps to cardiovert patients in SVT back to sinus rhythm [^113fK16g]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

There were numerous individual case studies and observational studies that appeared to support the use of the Trendelenburg maneuver. It is also worth mentioning a paper by Wong et al, "Vagal response varies with Valsalva manoeuvre technique: a repeated-measures clinical trial in healthy subjects". The study was conducted on healthy subjects in sinus rhythm rather than SVT, with ECG R-R intervals used as a proxy for measuring vagal tone. They found that supine positions gave the longest R-R intervals and the slowest mean pulse rates. However, extrapolating this to patients in SVT may not be accurate due to additional electrophysiological and hemodynamic variations; therefore, it was not included in Table 2. Other than the REVERT trial, there was a lack of high-level studies to use for this BET, demonstrating the need for further trials to be conducted in the future.

- **Clinical bottom line**: Using the modified Valsalva maneuver appears to increase the success rates of reverting patients in SVT back to sinus rhythm compared with the sitting/standing position.

### Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation and exercise capacity in healthy volunteers: A randomized trial [^117FJXmM]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Vagal parasympathetic dysfunction is strongly associated with impaired exercise tolerance, indicating that coordinated autonomic control is essential for optimizing exercise performance. This study tested the hypothesis that autonomic neuromodulation by non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) can improve exercise capacity in humans. This single-centre, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover trial in 28 healthy volunteers evaluated the effect of bilateral transcutaneous stimulation of vagal auricular innervation, applied for 30 minutes daily for seven days, on measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, specifically peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) during progressive exercise to exhaustion. Secondary endpoints included peak work rate, cardiorespiratory measures, and the whole blood inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide ex vivo.

tVNS applied for 30 minutes daily over seven consecutive days increased VO2 peak by 1.04 mL/kg/min (95% CI: 0.34–1.73; p = 0.005), compared with no change after sham stimulation (−0.54 mL/kg/min; 95% CI: −1.52 to 0.45). No carry-over effect was observed following the 2-week washout period. tVNS increased work rate (by 6 W; 95% CI: 2–10; p = 0.006), heart rate (by 4 bpm; 95% CI: 1–7; p = 0.011), and respiratory rate (by 4 breaths/min; 95% CI: 2–6; P < .001) at peak exercise. Analysis of the whole blood transcriptomic response to lipopolysaccharide in serial samples obtained from five participants showed that tVNS reduced the inflammatory response.

In conclusion, non-invasive vagal stimulation enhances exercise performance capacity and modulates inflammatory response in healthy individuals.

### Targeting primary afferent nerves for novel antitussive therapy [^113qQmFm]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

The best available data support the hypothesis that there are at least two types of vagal nerves responsible for initiating coughing reflexes. One type of nerve conducts action potentials in the A-range and is characterized by rapidly adapting responses to mechanical probing or acidification of the large airway epithelium. Stimulation of these nerves can evoke cough in unconscious experimental animals and humans. These nerves are important in immediate cough evoked by aspiration and, as such, perform a critical role in airway defense.

The other type of primary afferent nerve involved in cough is the vagal C-fiber. Inhalation of selective C-fiber stimulants leads to cough only in conscious animals. In clinical studies, inhalation of a low concentration of a C-fiber stimulant causes an irritating, itchy urge-to-cough sensation that mimics the urge-to-cough sensations associated with respiratory tract infection, post-infection, gastroesophageal reflux disorders, and inflammatory airway diseases.

Recent advances in sensory neurobiology allow for the targeting of vagal C-fibers for novel antitussive therapy. No attempts are made to be all-inclusive with respect to the numerous possible molecular targets being considered to accomplish this goal. Rather, two general strategies are discussed: decreasing generator potential amplitude and decreasing the efficiency by which a generator potential evokes action-potential discharge. For the first category, we focus on two targets, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and transient receptor potential A1.

### A prognostic index for the successful use of adenosine in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in emergency settings: a retrospective study [^1115dsUk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Use of adenosine upon failure of vagal maneuvers in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is recommended. The aim of the present study was to identify a possible prognostic index for the efficacy of adenosine in PSVT.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included 321 patients with PSVT, in whom vagal maneuvers failed to restore normal sinus rhythm and who received 6 mg adenosine, followed by 12 mg adenosine (repeated if necessary). A 2-step clustering algorithm was used to reveal nonapparent groupings. Various patients' characteristics were inserted into the model.

- **Results**: A straightforward index has been chosen that would aid the distinction of patients failing to respond to adenosine. The formula, (age / heart rate at admission) + number of past PSVT episodes, was chosen as the one that combined the highest sensitivity (96.2%) and specificity (71.2%).

- **Conclusions**: This prognostic index constitutes a useful and reliable bedside diagnostic tool to identify patients with PSVT who were less likely to respond to adenosine administration in the emergency setting.

### Plasticity of gastrointestinal vagal afferent satiety signals [^111XHVp1]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

The vagal link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (CNS) serves numerous vital functions for maintaining homeostasis. One such function attracting increasing attention is the regulation of energy balance, due to the potential to exploit peripheral hormonal targets as treatments for conditions such as obesity. While physiologically well-tuned, this system effectively regulates both local function and the promotion/termination of food intake. However, the neural connection is a vulnerable pathway susceptible to disruption in various disease states. Numerous studies have revealed that obesity, in particular, is associated with an array of modifications in vagal afferent function. These range from changes in the expression of signaling molecules to altered activation mechanics. Generally, these changes in vagal afferent function in obesity further promote food intake instead of achieving the more desirable reduction in food intake. It is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these detrimental effects before establishing more effective pharmacotherapies or lifestyle strategies for the treatment of obesity and maintenance of weight loss.

### Vagus nerve stimulation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease: A state-of-the-art review [^115wdjvB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

This review explores the impact of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on inflammation within the context of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of VNS to modulate inflammatory responses, which could provide therapeutic benefits for patients suffering from cardiovascular conditions. By targeting the autonomic nervous system, VNS may offer a novel approach for managing inflammation, thereby contributing to cardiovascular health improvements.

### Refractory status epilepticus treated with vagal nerve stimulation: case report [^114M39TY]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) refractory to medical treatment has a high mortality rate and few effective treatments. We describe the implantation of a vagal nerve stimulator to help terminate a case of refractory SE. A 23-year-old man was in SE for 3 weeks without being able to be weaned from intravenous anesthetic agents. After implantation of a vagal nerve stimulator, SE soon terminated, and the patient could be weaned from sedative agents and made a full recovery.

The vagal nerve stimulator should be considered in cases of refractory SE.

### Long-term CPAP treatment partially improves the link between cardiac vagal influence and delta sleep [^115t24kH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Numerous studies reveal that vagal predominance of the cardiac sympatho-vagal balance is induced by CPAP treatment in comparison to severely apneic patients before treatment, but these results are controversial. Moreover, only a few studies have compared their results to healthy controls. Our findings indicate that cardiac sympatho-vagal activity of CPAP-treated patients does not differ from that of healthy men. However, HF nu, which reflects cardiac vagal predominance, tends to be greater compared to healthy controls without reaching statistical significance. This trend is apparent whether we assess HRV within individual sleep states or assess the first three sleep cycles of the night as a whole.

During the first three NREM-REM cycles, the LF/HF ratio does not differ from one in CPAP-treated patients. This result indicates that neither the sympathetic nor vagal branches of cardiac sympatho-vagal activity predominates, in contrast to the relative sympatho-vagal influence in healthy controls. Moreover, the absence of relative sympathetic or vagal predominance is found during REM sleep and wakefulness in patients treated with CPAP. This could imply that CPAP treatment increases cardiac vagal activity in contrast to relative sympathetic activity. Indeed, CPAP treatment improves baroreflex sensitivity in SAHS. During SAHS, chemoreflex sensitivity is increased and is associated with increased relative sympathetic predominance, while CPAP treatment can normalize the sympathetic response by decreasing sensitivity and tonic activity of the chemoreflex.

### Vagal-sparing esophagectomy: A more physiologic alternative [^1125WpyA]. Annals of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the function of the vagal nerves and the gastric reservoir after vagal-sparing esophagectomy, esophagectomy typically includes the division of the vagal nerves and surgical alteration of the stomach, resulting in postoperative dumping, diarrhea, reduced meal capacity, and weight loss. Vagal-sparing esophagectomy has been introduced as a technique for removing the esophagus while preserving the vagal nerves and gastric reservoir. This procedure is noted for its low morbidity and is applicable to patients with end-stage benign or early malignant disease.

- **Methods**: A random sample of 15 patients, at a median of 20 months following a vagal-sparing esophagectomy, was compared to 23 asymptomatic normal subjects; 10 randomly selected patients, 29 months after esophagogastrectomy with colon interposition; and 10 randomly selected patients, 47 months after standard esophagectomy with gastric pull-up. Gastric mucosal acidification was assessed using Congo red staining. Vagal secretory function was measured by gastric acid output and pancreatic polypeptide response to sham feeding, while vagal motor function was evaluated using a technetium gastric emptying scan and a questionnaire to assess dumping and diarrhea. Gastric reservoir function was evaluated by measuring meal capacity and postoperative changes in body mass index.

- **Results**: Vagal-sparing esophagectomy preserved the function of the vagal nerves, as indicated by an increase in gastric acid output, a rise in serum pancreatic polypeptide following sham feeding, and the preservation of normal physiological function.

### Selective atrial vagal denervation guided by evoked vagal reflex to treat patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^1153mBWF]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether selective radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of the atrial sites where high-frequency stimulation induces vagal reflexes can prevent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Methods and results**: Ten patients with episodes suggestive of vagal-induced paroxysmal AF and no heart disease were selected for percutaneous epicardial and endocardial mapping of the atria to identify sites where high-frequency transcatheter stimulation (20 Hz) induced vagal reflexes. A vagal response defined as AV block of more than 2 seconds was elicited in 7 out of 10 patients (70%), with an average of 5 ± 2.4 sites per patient (range, 2 to 9). RF pulses (21.0 ± 12.0 per patient) were applied at those sites to eliminate all evoked vagal reflexes. The 3 patients without evoked vagal reflexes underwent circumferential pulmonary vein ablation, receiving an average of 58.0 ± 13.9 RF pulses per patient (P = 0.022). Autonomic evaluation was conducted before, and at 48 hours and 3 months after the procedure, showing consistent vagal withdrawal in all patients. Two of the 7 patients who underwent denervation remained asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic medication at a mean follow-up of 8.3 ± 2.8 months (range, 5 to 15 months); 4 experienced frequent recurrences and were referred for circumferential pulmonary vein ablation; and 1 had few AF episodes without antiarrhythmic medication. The 3 patients without evoked vagal reflexes who underwent circumferential pulmonary vein ablation remained asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic medication.

### Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation protects against stress-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in healthy adults [^114Y9VYe]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). High credibility.

- **The effect of transcutaneous vagal stimulation on intestinal permeability**: The effect of vagal nerve stimulation was determined by the paired comparison with biomarkers after sham stimulation. The lactulose:mannitol ratio was 0.062 (0.032–0.170) following sham stimulation, which was greater than 0.029 (0.025–0.050) following vagal nerve stimulation (p = 0.0092). This represented a difference of 53 (22–71)%. There was a significant reduction of fractional lactulose excretion in the vagal stimulation compared with the sham stimulation treatments; 0.1 (0.7–0.13)% vs 0.26 (0.09–0.6)% (p = 0.03), and no difference in the fractional excretion of mannitol (0.085 (0.06–0.12)% sham vs 0.097 (0.06–0.11)% with vagal stimulation; p = 0.98).

- **Comparison of barrier measures**: After corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation followed by sham vs. transcutaneous vagal stimulation, vagal stimulation was associated with a reduced lactulose:mannitol ratio compared with sham stimulation (p = 0.009; Wilcoxon matched‐pairs signed rank test). Plasma I-FABP concentrations showed no significant difference between sham and vagal stimulation (p = 0.90). The horizontal bars represent median values.

In contrast, I-FABP concentrations were not different after sham stimulation compared with those after vagal nerve stimulation (p = 0.90). The relative change from baseline was blunted by vagal stimulation with an increase of 25 (−14–60)% (p = 0.19), compared to the statistically significant changes observed with sham stimulation.

### Rationale and design of the VAST-AF trial: A randomized controlled, blinded, clinical trial to evaluate transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation for the prevention of persistent atrial fibrillation recurrence [^114iuaAc]. American Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and is linked to significant symptoms, as well as an elevated risk of heart failure, thromboembolism, and disabling stroke. Not only do patients suffer from AF and the concomitant complications, but it also poses a substantial economic burden for healthcare systems worldwide. Despite remarkable progress in the field of AF, the basic mechanisms of AF development remain unresolved. Data suggest that the cardiac autonomous nervous system (ANS) plays a significant role in AF. Recent studies have shown that stimulating the ANS could have a beneficial effect on paroxysmal and postoperative AF, indicating that this therapy could also be a viable target for treating persistent AF.

- **Methods**: The VAST-AF trial is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, and sham-controlled clinical trial. One hundred and twenty patients diagnosed with persistent AF and cardioversion in sinus rhythm (SR) will be randomly assigned to either transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) or sham treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective of this study is to examine whether daily tVNS reduces the recurrence rate of AF. Secondary endpoints include quality of life, time to first AF recurrence, and ECG parameters of the ANS. Follow-up is scheduled at 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months. After 3 months, stimulation is withdrawn, and patients are evaluated regarding any still detectable effect of tVNS.

- **Conclusion**: The VAST-AF trial represents the first randomized and sham-controlled study to investigate the potential benefits of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation for the prevention of persistent atrial fibrillation recurrence.

### Nasocardiac reflex-induced resolution of persistent hiccups via intranasal swab stimulation: A case report [^1148RcZg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Hiccups are a common respiratory reflex experienced by most individuals at some point in their lives and are typically self-limiting. In emergency department treatment, vagal maneuvers are usually the first-line approach; if unsuccessful, pharmacologic therapies are considered.

We present a case of persistent hiccups successfully resolved through vagal stimulation induced by the nasocardiac reflex following nasopharyngeal stimulation with an intranasal swab. A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 72-hour history of hiccups. Prior to arrival, she had attempted various vagal maneuvers without relief. Nasopharyngeal stimulation was performed via the right nostril using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab. The hiccups ceased approximately five seconds into the procedure. Additionally, the patient experienced a 28% decrease in heart rate and a 22% reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to pre-procedure values. The patient was contacted by phone at 48 hours, and no recurrence was reported.

Although various vagal maneuvers are utilized in the management of hiccups, the role of the nasocardiac reflex has not been clearly defined. Nasopharyngeal stimulation using a PCR swab may offer a simple and safe alternative for patients with persistent hiccups. This approach also raises the possibility that PCR-induced nasocardiac reflex stimulation could serve as an alternative method in other conditions where vagal maneuvers are used, such as supraventricular tachycardia. Moreover, this method may reduce patient discomfort and potentially decrease emergency department visits for persistent hiccups.

### The metabolic role of vagal afferent innervation [^1111uVtE]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The regulation of energy and glucose balance contributes to whole-body metabolic homeostasis, and such metabolic regulation is disrupted in obesity and diabetes. Metabolic homeostasis is orchestrated partly in response to nutrient and vagal-dependent gut-initiated functions. Specifically, the sensory and motor fibers of the vagus nerve transmit intestinal signals to the central nervous system and exert biological and physiological responses. In the past decade, the understanding of the regulation of vagal afferent signals and the associated metabolic effect on whole-body energy and glucose balance has progressed. This review highlights the contributions made to the understanding of the vagal afferent system and examines the integrative role of the vagal afferent in the gastrointestinal regulation of appetite and glucose homeostasis. Investigating the integrative and metabolic role of vagal afferent signaling represents a potential strategy to discover novel therapeutic targets to restore energy and glucose balance in diabetes and obesity.

### The reverse vagal manoeuvre: A new tool for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia [^112z7q2D]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia is a common cardiac arrhythmia characterized by rapid episodes. The rapid resolution of supraventricular tachycardia remains a challenge. Vagal manoeuvres are simple and non-invasive but yield positive results in less than half the cases. Currently, the modified Valsalva manoeuvre appears to be the most effective technique. We have tested the effectiveness of the reverse Valsalva manoeuvre, which does not require swallowing, as a new vagal manoeuvre for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. This new technique is easy to perform and can be carried out independently by the patient. In this series, we report 11 cases of supraventricular tachycardia, 10 of which were effectively reduced following the completion of the reverse Valsalva manoeuvre. The very encouraging results from this case series need to be quickly evaluated by a randomized controlled trial. This new technique, which is simple to learn and execute, could be easily taught worldwide, including in regions with limited healthcare resources.

### The cardiac autonomic nervous system: A target for modulation of atrial fibrillation [^112jjMBZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Low-level vagus nerve stimulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) has shown promise in modulating cardiac autonomic function. A previous study demonstrated that low-level vagus nerve stimulation (LL-VNS), with a stimulus strength at 1 volt below the threshold that immediately decelerates the sinus rate, was able to suppress stellate ganglion nerve activities and reduce incidences of paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias in ambulatory dogs, especially in the morning. It also decreased tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells in the left stellate ganglion one week after cessation of LL-VNS.

Other studies have indicated that LL-VNS at voltages substantially below the threshold for slowing the sinus rate or atrioventricular (AV) conduction significantly increased the effective refractory period (ERP) in the atria as well as the pulmonary vein (PV) myocardium. It suppressed AF inducibility and decreased the duration of acetylcholine-induced arrhythmias. In those experiments, LL-VNS was applied to both vagal trunks dissected in the neck.

Notably, the observation that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the tragus, the anterior protuberance of the outer ear where the auricular branch of the vagus nerve is located, produced an anti-arrhythmic effect similar to LL-VNS delivered to the cervical vagus nerve trunks. In a randomized clinical study, Stavrakis et al. demonstrated for the first time in humans that the duration and inducibility of AF, as well as inflammatory cytokines, were suppressed by low-level transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. This novel therapeutic approach leverages the plasticity of neural tissue to provide therapeutic benefits without damaging the nerves.

### Relation of fractionated atrial potentials with the vagal innervation evaluated by extracardiac vagal stimulation during cardioneuroablation [^114G4KNu]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). Low credibility.

Vagal hyperactivity is directly related to several clinical conditions, such as reflex/functional bradyarrhythmias and vagal atrial fibrillation (AF). Cardioneuroablation provides therapeutic vagal denervation through endocardial radiofrequency ablation for these cases. The main challenges are identifying the neuromyocardium interface and controlling and validating the denervation. The finding that the AF-Nest (AFN) ablation eliminates the atropine response and decreases RR variability suggests a relation to vagal innervation.

- **Method**: This was a prospective, controlled, longitudinal, nonrandomized study enrolling 62 patients in two groups. The AFN group consisted of 32 patients with functional or reflex bradyarrhythmias or vagal AF treated with AFN ablation. The control group had 30 patients with anomalous bundles, ventricular premature beats, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentry, and atrial tachycardia treated with conventional ablation (non-AFN ablation). In the AFN group, ablation was delivered at AFN detected by fragmentation/fractionation of the endocardial electrograms and by the three-dimensional anatomic location of the ganglionated plexus. Vagal response was evaluated before, during, and post-ablation by five-second noncontact vagal stimulation at the jugular foramen through the internal jugular veins (extracardiac vagal stimulation [ECVS]), analyzing the 15-second mean heart rate, longest RR, pauses, and atrioventricular block. All patients had guidelines for arrhythmia ablation indication.

- **Results**: Preablation ECVS induced sinus pauses, asystole, and transient atrioventricular block.

### Vagal nerve stimulation: Adjustments to reduce painful side effects [^113yCuNu]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Vagal nerve stimulation is an approved adjunctive treatment for medically intractable epilepsy. Although it is generally well tolerated, some patients experience pain, coughing, or hoarseness during stimulation. Lowering the pulse width in these patients alleviates pain and reduces voice alteration without loss of efficacy, allowing for more optimal programming of stimulation intensities.

### Termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by intranasal swab insertion [^116A3hsR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common emergency department presentation. Vagal maneuvers are commonly attempted to terminate SVT; however, they are often unsuccessful in alleviating the dysrhythmia. The use of adenosine, while frequently effective, is associated with a number of side effects and is often disliked by patients with recurring episodes of SVT.

We report on a 44-year-old woman with a past medical history of SVT who presented to the emergency department (ED) due to a recurrence of her SVT. The patient had no intravenous access and preferred not to receive adenosine. Intranasal stimulation with a nasopharyngeal swab used for COVID-19 testing was applied for 5–10 seconds. After less than 10 seconds, the patient converted to a sinus rhythm. She was successfully discharged from the ED after one hour of observation with no recurrence of her SVT.

### The prospects for poststroke neural repair with vagal nerve stimulation [^113NXvu7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

Vagal nerve stimulation is a new candidate for promoting neural repair after stroke, but there is work to do. Stroke is one of the major global healthcare problems, with over 100 million stroke survivors worldwide. It is no longer simply a disease of the elderly, with 63% of the one-in-four adults who will have a stroke being under the age of 70. Treatment to help recovery is often restricted to the first six months, despite stroke being a long-term condition from which recovery can be a lifelong process.

There are three key areas where advances will have a major impact:

- **Accept that higher doses of motor, language, and cognitive training are effective and determine ways of implementing them in a range of healthcare settings**.

- **Recognise that not all patients who have a stroke are the same**. We must 'rediagnose' our patients through fine-grained behavioural, anatomical, physiological, and biological phenotyping to understand likely recovery patterns and individual responses to treatments.

- **Develop a rational approach to drug or stimulation-induced neural repair**. This should be based on the underlying neurobiology of stroke recovery. Neural repair is a curious and confusing term that does not refer to restitution of damaged neural tissue but rather restitution of lost behaviors through manipulation of neural mechanisms, particularly those involving plasticity of some kind. Neural repair approaches have yet to have any clinical impact for one reason or another.

### Initial and sustained response effects of 3 vagal maneuvers in supraventricular tachycardia: A randomized, clinical trial [^1177ERxL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

For acute termination of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), vagal maneuvers, including the standard Valsalva maneuver (sVM), modified Valsalva (mVM) maneuver, and carotid sinus massage (CSM), are first-line interventions. There is no criterion standard technique.

- **Objective**: This prospective, randomized study was aimed at analyzing the success rates of these three vagal maneuvers, as measured by sustaining sinus rhythm at the fifth minute and SVT termination.

- **Methods**: We conducted this prospective, randomized controlled study in an emergency department (ED). We enrolled all the patients who were admitted to the ED and diagnosed with SVT. We randomly assigned them to three groups receiving sVM, mVM, and CSM and recorded the patients' responses to the vagal maneuvers and SVT recurrence after vagal maneuvers.

- **Results**: The study was completed with 98 patients. A total of 25 (25.5%) instances of SVT were initially treated successfully with vagal maneuvers. The success rate was 43.7% (14/32 cases) for mVM, 24.2% (8/33) for sVM, and 9.1% (3/33) for CSM (p < 0.05). At the end of the fifth minute, only 12.2% (12/98) of all patients had sinus rhythm. Sinus rhythm persisted in 28.1% (9/32) of patients in the mVM group, 6.1% (2/33) in the sVM group, and 3% (1/33) in the CSM group at the fifth minute (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: mVM is superior to the CSM maneuver in terminating SVT and maintaining rhythm. We conclude that it is beneficial to use mVM, which is more effective and lacks side effects.

### 2019 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with supraventricular tachycardia the Task Force for the management of patients with supraventricular tachycardia of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^115LdxeZ]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

The ESC 2020 guidelines recommend performing vagal maneuvers, preferably in the supine position with leg elevation, for the acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). These nonpharmacologic interventions are particularly emphasized for orthodromic AVRT.
