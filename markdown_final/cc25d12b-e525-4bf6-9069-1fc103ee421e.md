## Question

Atovaquone and prednisone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atovaquone and prednisone interact and how to manage them together in the context of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP/PCP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug–drug interaction between atovaquone and prednisone. Then, I should verify whether prednisone meaningfully alters atovaquone exposure or efficacy. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for atovaquone and for adjunctive corticosteroids in PJP, including timing and dosing. After that, I should consider special populations and safety nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with monitoring points and caveats, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the interaction question. DrugBank reports no known interaction between atovaquone and prednisone, which supports the absence of a clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between the two agents [^1112ni2G].

> Wait, let me verify whether prednisone could still affect atovaquone levels indirectly. Pediatric HIV guidance notes that atovaquone concentrations increase with coadministration of prednisone, but this is based on limited expert opinion rather than robust pharmacokinetic trials; importantly, this potential increase is not cited as a reason to avoid coadministration or to adjust atovaquone dosing, and it does not imply a contraindication to using prednisone with atovaquone in PJP care [^113eP7cy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the clinical contexts in which these drugs are used together. Atovaquone is indicated for prevention and for treatment of mild-to-moderate PJP, particularly when TMP-SMX is not tolerated or contraindicated, with adult treatment dosing of 750 mg orally twice daily with food for 21 days and prophylaxis dosing of 1,500 mg once daily with food, and it should always be administered with food to optimize absorption [^117BEDPk] [^114oYZjh] [^115xNTem].

> I need to check the role of prednisone as adjunctive therapy in PJP. For HIV-positive patients with moderate-to-severe PJP (PaO2 < 70 mmHg on room air or A–a gradient ≥ 35 mmHg), adjunctive corticosteroids are strongly recommended, ideally started within 72 hours of anti-Pneumocystis therapy, using prednisone 40 mg twice daily for 5 days, then 40 mg daily for 5 days, then 20 mg daily for 11 days; IV methylprednisolone can be used at about 80% of the prednisone dose if oral therapy is not feasible [^115G4MXo] [^111DXWgS] [^1156uvZb].

> But wait, what if the patient is HIV-negative? The evidence for routine adjunctive corticosteroids in non-HIV PJP is mixed; ATS suggests considering steroid regimens analogous to HIV in moderate-to-severe disease, whereas ECIL advises against routine corticosteroids in non-HIV patients and recommends individualized decisions, and a recent randomized trial in HIV-negative patients with severe PJP did not show a significant mortality benefit from early adjunctive corticosteroids, so I should be cautious and tailor steroid use to severity, timing, and patient-specific risks [^114T4Uj2] [^116tczop] [^115ketkF].

> Let me consider special populations and practicalities. In pediatrics, atovaquone is dosed by weight for prophylaxis and treatment, and adjunctive corticosteroids are recommended for moderate-to-severe PJP using weight-based prednisone regimens; in pregnancy, TMP-SMX remains first-line for treatment and prophylaxis, with adjunctive steroids for moderate-to-severe disease, and atovaquone is considered when TMP-SMX is not suitable; in renal impairment, atovaquone does not require dose adjustment, which can be advantageous when TMP-SMX is limited by nephrotoxicity risk [^112wv9Tu] [^1177KFP3] [^116eosMw] [^notfound].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring. Atovaquone is generally well tolerated; gastrointestinal upset is common, and it must be given with fatty food to ensure adequate absorption. Prednisone carries risks of hyperglycemia, secondary infections, and neuropsychiatric effects, so patients require close monitoring for clinical deterioration, new infections, and glucose control, especially in the ICU setting where co-infections are frequent and delays in therapy worsen outcomes [^117QXifc] [^111XzFbj] [^112hUNJn].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer. There is no clinically significant drug–drug interaction between atovaquone and prednisone, and they can be coadministered safely when clinically indicated. In HIV-positive patients with moderate-to-severe PJP, use atovaquone for mild-to-moderate disease or when TMP-SMX is not tolerated, and add prednisone per the 21-day taper starting within 72 hours if hypoxemia criteria are met. In HIV-negative patients, use atovaquone for mild-to-moderate disease and consider adjunctive corticosteroids selectively in moderate-to-severe cases, acknowledging uncertain benefit and balancing risks; always administer atovaquone with food and monitor closely for response and adverse effects [^1112ni2G] [^117BEDPk] [^115G4MXo] [^114T4Uj2] [^116tczop] [^115ketkF].

Atovaquone and prednisone do not have a **clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction** [^1112ni2G], so they can be coadministered safely when indicated [^1112ni2G]. Prednisone may slightly increase atovaquone exposure, but this is not usually clinically meaningful and does not require dose adjustment [^113eP7cy]. The main concern is **immunosuppression from prednisone**, which can increase infection risk, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) [^1175sLkp]; therefore, if prednisone is used at ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks, PJP prophylaxis should be considered, with TMP-SMX preferred and atovaquone as an alternative when TMP-SMX is not tolerated [^115a7d6f] [^117Voh6r] [^115KvHxu]. Monitor for infection and adverse effects, and coordinate care with the treating specialist.

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction

- **No significant interaction**: DrugBank reports no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between atovaquone and prednisone [^1112ni2G].

- **Minor exposure change**: Prednisone may slightly increase atovaquone plasma concentrations, but this is not considered clinically significant and does not require dose adjustment [^113eP7cy].

- **Administration with food**: Atovaquone should be taken with food to optimize absorption and minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^117QXifc].

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

### Indications for coadministration

Atovaquone is indicated for **prevention and treatment of mild-to-moderate PJP**, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX [^117BEDPk]. Prednisone is used as adjunctive therapy in **moderate-to-severe PJP** to reduce inflammation and improve oxygenation, particularly in HIV-positive patients [^115G4MXo].

---

### Risks associated with coadministration

The primary concern is **immunosuppression from prednisone**, which increases susceptibility to infections, including PJP [^1175sLkp]. Prednisone-related adverse effects include hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and increased infection risk [^notfound].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **PJP prophylaxis**: Patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) for ≥ 4 weeks should receive PJP prophylaxis, with TMP-SMX as first-line therapy and atovaquone as an alternative when TMP-SMX is contraindicated [^115a7d6f] [^117Voh6r].

- **Adjunctive corticosteroids**: In moderate-to-severe PJP, adjunctive corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) are recommended to improve oxygenation and reduce mortality, particularly in HIV-positive patients [^115G4MXo] [^114eEL7t].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring for infection, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and other corticosteroid-related adverse effects is essential [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Patient on prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks | Initiate PJP prophylaxis (TMP-SMX preferred; atovaquone alternative) [^115a7d6f] [^117Voh6r] |
| Patient with mild-to-moderate PJP | Atovaquone 750 mg orally twice daily with food for 21 days [^117QXifc] |
| Patient with moderate-to-severe PJP | TMP-SMX plus adjunctive prednisone (40 mg twice daily for 5 days, then taper) [^115G4MXo] [^111DXWgS] |
| Patient intolerant to TMP-SMX | Atovaquone 1,500 mg orally once daily with food for prophylaxis [^117QXifc] |

---

## Summary of key points

- **No significant interaction**: Atovaquone and prednisone do not have a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction [^1112ni2G].

- **Safe coadministration**: They can be coadministered safely when clinically indicated, with monitoring for adverse effects [^notfound].

- **PJP prophylaxis**: Prednisone-induced immunosuppression warrants PJP prophylaxis when prednisone is used at ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks [^115a7d6f] [^117Voh6r].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Prednisone is beneficial as adjunctive therapy in moderate-to-severe PJP, particularly in HIV-positive patients [^115G4MXo] [^114eEL7t].

---

Atovaquone and prednisone can be coadministered safely, as there is **no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction** [^1112ni2G]. The main concern is **prednisone-induced immunosuppression**, which may increase infection risk, including PJP; therefore, PJP prophylaxis is recommended when prednisone is used at ≥ 20 mg/day for ≥ 4 weeks [^115a7d6f] [^117Voh6r]. Close monitoring for infection and corticosteroid-related adverse effects is essential [^notfound].

### Risk factors and prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [^1175sLkp]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases (AIIDs) are prone to serious infectious complications such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). In non-HIV patients, the prognosis is poorer, and diagnostic tests are of lower sensitivity. Given the low incidence of PJP in AIIDs, with the exception of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and the non-negligible side effects of chemoprophylaxis, routine prescription of primary prophylaxis is still debated. Absolute peripheral lymphopenia, high doses of corticosteroids, combination with other immunosuppressive agents, and concomitant lung disease are strong predictors for the development of PJP and thus should warrant primary prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is considered first-line therapy and is the most extensively used drug for PJP prophylaxis. Nevertheless, it may expose patients to side effects. Effective alternative drugs such as atovaquone or aerosolized pentamidine could be used when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not tolerated or contraindicated. No standard guidelines are available to guide PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIIDs. This review covers the epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of pneumocystis in the context of AIIDs.

Definitions

In this prospective study, investigators were asked to include only patients with proven or probable PJP based on specific biological tests and concordant clinical and radiologic presentations, as per the European definition. In every case, PJP diagnosis was retained after diagnostic workup had ruled out alternative plausible diagnoses. Cases where P. jirovecii was detected through non-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in oral or lower respiratory tract samples, or via quantitative PCR with high cycle threshold values (determined by the clinician's judgment) and lacked corresponding clinical and radiological features, should not be included.

Investigators gathered data on prior or ongoing prophylaxis of PJP upon ICU admission or upon PJP diagnosis, through interviews with patients, family members, or their primary care providers. The prophylaxis included oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), atovaquone, dapsone, or aerosolized pentamidine, without specific differentiation in the data collection regarding the type of prophylaxis.

Data were gathered on the current or recent (within 4 weeks before ICU admission) use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications (including corticosteroid therapy) and the specific type of medication utilized. The criterion for defining corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression was established as a daily dosage of ≥ 15 mg of prednisone-equivalent for a period of ≥ 4 weeks, or the receipt of a bolus of ≥ 500 mg within the preceding 3 months.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116QEuE4]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia — treatment recommendations: TMP-SMX, administered IV, is the recommended treatment for PCP (AI). As the acute pneumonitis subsides, children with mild-to moderate disease who do not have malabsorption or diarrhea can be transitioned to oral treatment with the same total daily dose of TMP-SMX administered in 3 or 4 divided doses to complete a 21-day course (AII). IV pentamidine isethionate once daily is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX or who demonstrate clinical treatment failure after 5 to 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy (AI*). Atovaquone is an alternative for treatment of mild-to-moderately severe PCP (BI*), and dapsone/TMP is effective in treating mild-to-moderate PCP (BI*). Clindamycin/primaquine has been used to treat mild-to-moderate PCP; data in children are unavailable (BIII). A short course of corticosteroids is recommended in cases of moderate or severe PCP, starting within 72 hours of diagnosis (AI*).

Data Collection

Data were collected prospectively. Steroid treatment was either high dose (> 1 mg/kg for > 1 mo) or long term (> 3 mo at any dose). Mycologists and study investigators obtained missing and follow-up data by reviewing patients' medical charts and by interviewing the specialists who provided usual care to the patients. Bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections were diagnosed on the basis of criteria reported elsewhere. Information on PCP prophylaxis was recorded; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), aerosolized pentamidine (1×/mo), dapsone, and atovaquone were classified as effective prophylaxis options. Information on treatments used for PCP and the time from admission to treatment initiation were recorded; TMP-SMX, pentamidine, atovaquone, dapsone, and clindamycin-primaquine were considered acceptable options for PCP treatment. Shock was defined as persistent hypotension despite appropriate fluid load, requiring treatment with a vasopressive drug.

Steroids as adjunctive therapy were used on the basis of standard protocol recommendations for patients with AIDS at a dose that depended on patient location (e.g. medical unit). In deeply hypoxemic, critically ill patients, steroids were implemented at the dosage of 240 mg/day for 3 days, then at 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days, followed by tapering doses to be stopped before day 21. In patients who were less critically ill, the dose was 1 mg/kg/day followed by a tapering dose after day 7 to be stopped before day 21. Similar protocols were used for AIDS and non-AIDS patients.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prevention after kidney transplant — We agree that PCP prophylaxis is important for the first 3–6 months posttransplant; after the first month, every-other-day dosing of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or atovaquone is believed to be adequate prophylaxis; if neither agent can be used, an individual may be treated prophylactically with inhaled pentamidine, and patients who develop PCP should be transferred to the transplant center promptly for management and adjustments in immunosuppression.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113eP7cy]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-exposed or HIV-infected children — atovaquone alternate dosing and interactions: Some experts also use an alternate dosing regimen for children < 3 months and > 24 months to age 12 years of 15 to 20 mg/kg body weight/dose administered orally twice daily with food, and for children aged 2 to 24 months, a dose of 22.5 mg/kg body weight/dose twice daily with food (CIII). Food increases the bioavailability of atovaquone approximately threefold compared with that achieved with the fasting state, atovaquone concentration increases with co-administration of fluconazole and prednisone and decreases with co-administration of acyclovir, opiates, cephalosporins, rifampin, and benzodiazepines, and some experts suggest desensitizing the patient to allow for use of TMP-SMX.

### HIV: treating Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) [^114w6WD6]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a common AIDS-defining opportunistic illness in people with HIV infection, but its incidence has fallen with use of prophylactic treatment. Without treatment, PCP is likely to be fatal in people with AIDS, so placebo-controlled studies would be considered unethical.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of first-line antipneumocystis treatments for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people infected with HIV? What are the effects of adjuvant corticosteroids in people receiving first-line antipneumocystis treatments for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people infected with HIV? What are the effects of treatments for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people infected with HIV who have not responded to first-line antipneumocystis treatment? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adjuvant corticosteroids, aerosolised or intravenous pentamidine, atovaquone, clindamycin-primaquone, treatment after failure of first-line treatment, trimethoprim-dapsone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole).

### Pneumocystis pneumonia in children [^113zpwKY]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised children with quantitative and qualitative defects in T lymphocytes. At risk are children with lymphoid malignancies, HIV infection, corticosteroid therapy, transplantation and primary immunodeficiency states. Diagnosis is established through direct examination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from respiratory secretions. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole is used for initial therapy in most patients, while pentamidine, atovaquone, clindamycin plus primaquine, and dapsone plus trimethoprim are alternatives. Prophylaxis of high-risk patients reduces but does not eliminate the risk of PCP. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of PCP is important for future advances against this life-threatening infection.

Regarding preventative measures for Pneumocystis pneumonia, more specifically with respect to primary prophylaxis, indications, immunosuppressive therapy, AASLD/AST 2013 guidelines recommend to initiate PCP prophylaxis with TMP/SMX in all liver transplantation recipients for a minimum of 6–12 months after transplantation.
Initiate atovaquone or dapsone in patients with intolerance to TMP/SMX.

### A nomogram-based clinical prediction model for adverse clinical outcomes in non-HIV Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia patients [^112hUNJn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In non-HIV populations, PJP often progresses rapidly, and delayed treatment is strongly associated with increased risk of mortality and complications. Our analysis indicated that delayed initiation of TMP-SMX was associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. A prospective study has demonstrated that longer time from admission to initiation of PJP therapy is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.11 per additional day, 95% CI: 1.04–1.18). Several retrospective studies have similarly reported that treatment delays are associated with increased mortality risk. Notably, nearly one-quarter of patients in our cohort began anti-Pneumocystis treatment more than 96 h after admission. This highlights a gap between clinical guidelines, which consistently recommend early empirical treatment for high-risk immunocompromised patients and actual clinical practice. However, TMP-SMX often causes side effects, atovaquone is getting more attention as an alternative. Although atovaquone has not yet been approved for clinical use in our country, literature evidence suggests its potential as both a treatment and prophylactic agent in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. Case reports have demonstrated its successful use in patients with renal impairment or prior TMP-SMX-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis, and randomized trials have shown favorable safety profiles. Furthermore, recent studies in solid organ transplant, hematologic malignancy, and connective tissue disease populations support the utility of atovaquone as a well-tolerated alternative. These findings underscore the need to expand the therapeutic arsenal for PJP, particularly in high-risk patients where first-line therapy is not feasible.

### Estimation of treatment and prognostic factors of Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with connective tissue diseases [^111X7WYR]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a fatal complication that occurs in immunocompromised individuals, such as patients infected with HIV and those with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) receiving immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids (GCs) and/or immunosuppressants. The reported mortality rate of CTD-associated PCP (CTD-PCP) is higher than that of HIV-associated PCP (HIV-PCP). However, no large clinical studies to date have focused on CTD-PCP, and published reports on the clinical course and prognosis of CTD-PCP have been limited to observational studies in a small number of centres and to those including CTD-PCP as part of a larger cohort of non-HIV-PCP cases, including our previous reports, because of the number of cases of CTD-PCP is smaller than that of HIV-PCP. High doses of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST; trimethoprim dose, 15–20 mg/kg/day) generally comprise the first-line therapy for patients with moderate/severe PCP. However, the ST doses for PCP treatment are relatively high and often require reduction or discontinuation due to adverse effects. In patients with inadequate response to ST, second-line therapies such as atovaquone and pentamidine may be used. No randomised controlled trials have evaluated antibiotics in patients with CTD-PCP, and few studies have directly compared the efficacy and safety of specific antibiotics or outcomes of second-line therapeutic options such as those used in patients switching from ST. Therefore, we performed an observational study using a large, real-world database in Japan, a country with a relatively high incidence of CTD-PCP, to investigate the prognosis and prognostic factors in patients treated with specific antibiotics for CTD-PCP.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^1136bBS4]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 8.7 – KTR: pneumocystis jirovecii infection- treatment and prophylaxis

We suggest:
All patients with confirmation (microscopy or PCR) of Pneumocystis jirovecii in respiratory secretions should be treated for 14 to 21 days with co-trimoxazole orally or intravenously (15–20 mg/kg in three or four divided doses) (2B)
Patients with contraindications to treatment with co-trimoxazole should receive pentamidine (4 mg/kg/day intravenously) (2B)
Adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy may be considered in patients with severe disease (2D)
All patients should receive 3–6 months of treatment with co-trimoxazole 480 mg daily for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis following renal transplantation (1B)

Rationale

Diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) requires confirmation by microscopy or PCR from respiratory secretions (induced sputum after inhaled saline or bronchoalveolar lavage). In non-HIV infected individuals, co-trimoxazole has been shown to be effective. Co-trimoxazole has excellent bioavailability and enteral administration is preferred, although intravenous therapy may be necessary in acutely unwell patients. In patients with contraindications to co-trimoxazole, intravenous or aerosolised pentamidine is a suitable alternative although it is associated with a higher rate of side effects. Alternative agents against pneumocystis jirovecii include dapsone or atovaquone. The duration of therapy should be between 14 and 21 days. The use of additional glucocorticoid therapy is not associated with improved survival in non-HIV patients, although treatment with prednisolone has been associated with quicker recovery from severe PCP infection in one small observational study. As a result, PCP prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole is recommended and has shown to be beneficial in meta-analysis of 12 randomised studies in 1245 immunocompromised individuals.

Timing of antibiotic treatment of PJP

One patient had a documented allergy to TMP-SMX and received treatment with atovaquone. Among the remaining 157 patients initially treated with TMP-SMX, one patient was switched to pentamidine due to toxidermia, and another patient was switched to atovaquone due to bone marrow toxicity; both adverse events resolved subsequently without any lasting effects.

For the 112 patients whose curative treatment began in the ICU (while others started treatment on regular wards), initiation occurred at a median of 4 h (IQR 16–69) following ICU admission. Patients with immunosuppression classified as "other" (Table 1), mainly patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases (Table S5), had significantly delayed treatment initiation (23 h [IQR 6–85]) compared to those with solid-organ or hematologic malignancies (4 h [IQR 16–69]) (P = 0.040). All patients with HIV infection whose curative treatment commenced in the ICU (n = 21) were administered the first dose before the 96th hour. Decision of treatment withholding or withdrawing occurred in 8 (40%) patients treated late and in 22 (23.9%) patients treated earlier (P = 0.23). Terminal extubation occurred in two (10%) patients treated late and in eight (8.7%) patients treated earlier (P > 0.99). Lung co-infection was present during the first week of treatment of PJP for 10/20 (50%) patients treated late and for 42/92 (45.6%) patients treated earlier (P = 0.92).

### Adjunctive corticosteroids for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in patients with HIV infection [^114eEL7t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among patients with HIV infection and PCP the mortality rate is 10% to 20% during the initial infection and this increases substantially with the need for mechanical ventilation. It has been suggested that corticosteroids adjunctive to standard treatment for PCP could prevent the need for mechanical ventilation and decrease mortality in these patients.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adjunctive corticosteroids on overall mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in HIV-infected patients with PCP and substantial hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen partial pressure < 70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial gradient > 35 mmHg on room air).

Search Methods

For the original review we searched The Cochrane Library (2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1980 to December 2004) and EMBASE (January 1985 to December 2004) without language restrictions. We further reviewed the reference lists from previously published overviews, searched UptoDate version 2005 and Clinical Evidence Concise (Issue 12, 2004), contacted experts in the field and searched the reference lists of identified publications for citations of additional relevant articles. In this update of our review, we searched the above-mentioned databases in September 2010 and April 2014 for trials published since our original review. We also searched for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP). We searched for conference abstracts via AEGIS.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in HIV-infected patients with PCP in addition to baseline treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine or dapsone-trimethoprim, and reported mortality data. We excluded trials in patients with no or mild hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen partial pressure > 70 mmHg or an alveolar-arterial gradient < 35 mmHg on room air) and trials with a follow-up of less than 30 days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from each primary study. We pooled treatment effects across studies and calculated a weighted average risk ratio of overall mortality in the treatment and control groups using a random-effects model. In this update of our review, we used the GRADE methodology to assess evidence quality.

Main Results

Of 2029 screened records, we included seven studies in the review and six in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias varied: the randomisation and allocation process was often not clearly described, five of seven studies were double-blind and there was almost no missing data. The quality of the evidence for mortality was high. Risk ratios for overall mortality for adjunctive corticosteroids were 0.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.98) at one month and 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) at three to four months of follow-up. In adults, to prevent one death, numbers needed to treat are nine patients in a setting without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) available, and 23 patients with HAART available. The three largest trials provided moderate quality data on the need for mechanical ventilation, with a risk ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.73) in favour of adjunctive corticosteroids. One study was conducted in infants, suggesting a risk ratio for death in hospital of 0.81 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.29; moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The number and size of trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV-infected patients with PCP is small, but the evidence from this review suggests a beneficial effect for adult patients with substantial hypoxaemia. There is insufficient evidence on the effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on survival in infants.

Background

Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among patients with HIV infection and PCP the mortality rate is 10 to 20% during the initial infection and increases substantially with the need for mechanical ventilation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adjunctive corticosteroids on overall mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in HIV-infected patients with PCP and substantial hypoxemia (arterial oxygen partial pressure < 70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial gradient > 35 mmHg on room air).

Search Strategy

We searched Medline (January 1980-December 2004), EMBASE (January 1985-December 2004) and The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2004) without language restrictions to identify randomised controlled trials that compared adjunctive corticosteroids to control in HIV-infected patients with PCP. We further reviewed the reference lists from previously published overviews, we searched UptoDate version 2005 and Clinical Evidence Concise (Issue 12, 2004), contacted experts of the field, and searched reference lists of identified publications for citations of additional relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Trials were considered eligible for this review if they compared corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in HIV-infected patients with PCP in addition to baseline treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine or dapsone-trimethoprim, used random allocation, and reported mortality data. We excluded trials in patients with no or mild hypoxemia (arterial oxygen partial pressure > 70 mmHg or an alveolar-arterial gradient < 35 mmHg on room air) and trials with a follow-up of less than 30 days.

Data Collection and Analysis

To prevent 1 death, numbers needed to treat are 9 patients in a setting without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) available, and 23 patients with HAART available. Only the 3 largest trials provided data on the need for mechanical ventilation with a risk ratio of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.20–0.73) in favour of adjunctive corticosteroids.

Authors' Conclusions

The number and size of trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV-infected patients with PCP is small, but evidence from this review suggests a beneficial effect for patients with substantial hypoxemia.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^117Voh6r]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Consensus recommendations for infectious disease prophylaxis during chronic GC therapy — Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP): PJP prophylaxis should be used when the annual incidence of PJP for a given disease and treatment modality is ≥ 3.5%. For neuromuscular disease (NMD) receiving glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy where disease-specific incidence is unknown, prophylaxis may be offered to patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month; if a second immunosuppressive agent is added, prophylaxis should be offered for patients receiving ≥ 20 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month. Trimethoprim‑Sulfamethoxazole (TMP‑SMX) one single‑strength tablet daily or one double‑strength tablet three times a week is the recommended regimen for PJP prophylaxis in patients with normal renal function, adjusted for renal function. For TMP‑SMX allergy, alternative options include atovaquone 1.5g daily, dapsone 100 mg daily, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly.

### Adjunctive corticosteroids in non-AIDS patients with severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PIC): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^115ketkF]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in HIV-negative immunocompromised patients has a hospital mortality rate of 30–50%. Adjunctive corticosteroids improve outcomes of P jirovecii pneumonia in HIV-positive patients. The aim of this trial was to assess the effects of early adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for 21 days in HIV-negative patients with P jirovecii pneumonia responsible for acute hypoxaemia respiratory failure.

Methods

This multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at 27 hospitals in France. We included patients with acute respiratory failure, aged 18 years or older with mild-to-severe hypoxaemia, microbiological documentation of P jirovecii pneumonia, and anti-Pneumocystis treatment duration of less than 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the corticosteroid group (adjunctive corticosteroid therapy of methylprednisolone intravenously, 30 mg twice per day from days 1 to 5, 30 mg once per day from days 6 to 10, and 20 mg once per day until day 21) or placebo group (2 mL or 3 mL syringes of isotonic saline intravenously) using a web-based system. Permutation blocks of fixed size unknown to the local investigators were used. Stratification factors were centre, long-term corticosteroid treatment started more than 1 month before enrolling in the trial, underlying disease (malignancy vs other), and oxygen needs at randomisation (< 6 vs ≥ 6 L per min). The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day mortality defined as the proportion of patients who died within 28 days, analysed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02944045 (closed).

Findings

From Feb 23, 2017, to Feb 23, 2024, 466 patients with acute respiratory failure were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 240 were excluded and 226 patients were randomly assigned (114 assigned to the placebo group and 112 assigned to the corticosteroid group). The ITT population included 111 patients in the placebo group and 107 in the corticosteroid group. Median age was 67 years (IQR 59–73). 126 (58%) patients were male and 92 (42%) were female. Nearly all patients (208 [95%]) were in the ICU or intermediate care at randomisation. The median time from P jirovecii pneumonia diagnosis to corticosteroid therapy initiation was 3 days (IQR 2–5). Patients received trial treatment for 13 days (range 7–20). All-cause 28-day mortality occurred in 36 (32.4%) patients in the placebo group versus 23 (21.5%) in the corticosteroid group (mean difference 10.9% [95% CI -0.9 to 22.5]; p = 0.069). There were no significant differences in safety outcomes between groups, especially for all secondary infections (38 [34.2%; 95% CI 25.4 to 43.1] patients in the placebo group vs 25 [23.4%; 15.3 to 31.4] in the corticosteroid group) or insulin needs (25 [22.5%; 15.1 to 31.4] vs 33 [30.8%; 22.3 to 40.5]).

Interpretation

In immunocompromised HIV-negative patients with P jirovecii pneumonia, adjunctive corticosteroid treatment did not significantly decrease 28-day mortality.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis regimens for people living with HIV: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112HLYnc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a common opportunistic infection among people living with HIV (PWH), particularly among new and untreated cases. Several regimens are available for the prophylaxis of PCP, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), dapsone-based regimens (DBRs), aerosolized pentamidine (AP), and atovaquone.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of PCP prophylaxis regimens in PWH by network meta-analysis.

Methods

DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL from inception to June 21, 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

PWH.

Interventions

Regimens for PCP prophylaxis either compared head-to-head or versus no treatment/placebo.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs 2.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Title or abstract and full-text screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Data on PCP incidence, all-cause mortality, and discontinuation due to toxicity were pooled and ranked by network meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses of primary versus secondary prophylaxis, by year, and by dosage were performed.

Results

A total of 26 RCTs, comprising 55 treatment arms involving 7516 PWH were included. For the prevention of PCP, TMP-SMX was ranked the most favourable agent and was superior to DBRs (risk ratio [RR] = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.83) and AP (RR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36–0.77). TMP-SMX was also the only agent with a mortality benefit compared with no treatment/placebo (RR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.98). However, TMP-SMX was also ranked as the most toxic agent with a greater risk of discontinuation than DBRs (RR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54) and AP (7.20; 95% CI, 5.37–9.66). No significant differences in PCP prevention or mortality were detected among the other regimens. The findings remained consistent within subgroups.

Conclusions

TMP-SMX is the most effective agent for PCP prophylaxis in PWH and the only agent to confer a mortality benefit; consequently, it should continue to be recommended as the first-line agent. Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal dosing of TMP-SMX to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.

In the present nationwide study using the DPC database, we found that CTD-PCP remained a fatal complication with a mortality rate of more than 30% and that older age and concomitant ILD were poor prognostic factors. ST might be a reasonable first-line antibiotic in CTD-PCP as well as in HIV-PCP. In patients with inadequate response to ST, if available, treatment with atovaquone might achieve good prognosis comparable to that of ST.

### Diagnosis and management of complications from the treatment of primary central nervous system tumors in adults [^112mzM9D]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lymphopenia

Lymphopenia is a relatively frequent complication of temozolomide, and less so of other chemotherapy agents used in neuro-oncology. A very low CD4 count (< 200/µL), considered absolute lymphopenia, may be encountered, thus predisposing patients to opportunistic infections such as P. jirovecii pneumonia or viral infections such as cytomegalovirus. These risks are aggravated by the chronic use of steroids and the use of radiotherapy. Thus patients with primary brain tumors are prone to these infections and many centers use prophylactic trimethoprim (80–160 mg orally daily or 160 mg 3 times/week on alternate days)/sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) during radiotherapy (even if the absence of concomitant steroids). Alternatively, regular testing of CD4 counts may permit the use of this prophylaxis only when counts drop below 200/µL. The discontinuation of prophylaxis is dependent both on the counts and on other parameters such as the use and tapering of steroids. Clinician awareness of these complications is of paramount importance so that diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia is made and therapy is initiated promptly.

In patients with an allergy to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) deficiency, close observation can be used although an alternative is inhaled pentamidine or atovaquone.

Although some centers consider antiviral prophylaxis, there is no evidence for its activity so we do not recommend this. No measures can ensure that CD4 counts will rise, nor is dose adjustment advised for this complication. Since higher dose and dose-intense regimens of temozolomide cause more lymphopenia, their use is discouraged, as should be the use of corticosteroids without clear rationale.

### An analysis of the utilisation of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy at a cancer hospital [^112wmVP9]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Alternative agents

As demonstrated in HIV-infected patients, alternative prophylactic agents may be used, but are associated with higher rates of failure. Dapsone prophylaxis (50 mg three times per week) in allogeneic transplant recipients has a significantly higher incidence of failure when compared to TMP–SMX. Aerosolised pentamidine (150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg per month) used after bone marrow transplantation has been shown to be inferior to TMP–SMX for PCP prophylaxis and associated with an increased risk for developing toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients with antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. Safety and tolerability of atovaquone prophylaxis (1500 mg daily) has been demonstrated in autologous stem cell transplant recipients, but studies of efficacy in non-HIV-infected patients are lacking. Use of clindamycin (300 mg daily) and primaquine (15 mg daily) for prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients is associated with a higher risk for developing PCP than the TMP–SMX prophylaxis. Efficacy of clindamycin/primaquine for prophylaxis in patients with malignancy has not been reported.

Due to ease of administration and medical costs, we recommend that dapsone be used as second-line prophylaxis if TMP–SMX is contraindicated or not tolerated (Table 3). Nebulised pentamidine may also be used, and atovaquone may be considered in patients unable to tolerate TMP–SMX or dapsone.

Although some have recommended that prophylaxis continue for 1 month after discontinuation of corticosteroids, extended duration may be required with other concurrently administered immunosuppressive therapies. For example, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil and fludarabine have all been associated with development of PCP in the absence of corticosteroid treatment, although the absolute risk is unclear. We recommend continued primary prophylaxis or lifelong secondary prophylaxis in the setting of ongoing immunosuppression (Table 3).

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^115WMtwo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

Pneumocystis jirovecii

Efficacy of prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has mostly been examined in patients receiving treatment with glucocorticoids. The exact dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids cannot be defined based on the available data thus far. However, prophylaxis in patients with various AIIRD receiving prednisolone more than 15–30 mg/day for more than 2–4 weeks, has been found to reduce episodes of PCP and associated mortality(table 6). On the other hand, in a study enrolling 184 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (average starting dose of 47 mg of prednisone/day), no PCP cases were recorded, while prophylaxis for PCP was given in only 5 patients.

Table 6
Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP in patients treated with GC

Data for other antirheumatic treatments beyond glucocorticoids are very limited. Katsuyama et al found that patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, having also specific risk factors for PCP development, might benefit from prophylaxis for PCP. In 214patients with RA who received prophylaxis for PCP based on the presence of at least two risk factors (age ≥ 65 years, coexisting pulmonary disease and use of glucocorticoids), no PCP cases were reported, compared with the incidence observed (0.93/100 000) for patients with the same characteristics in whom prophylaxis for PCP was administered based on physician's discretion. In addition, in a small retrospective study, it was shown that annual incidence of PCP was lower in patients treated with cyclophosphamide who received PCP prophylaxis (5.33% (95% CI 0.65% to 19.24%)), compared with those who did not (9.50% (95% CI 1.15% to 34.33%)). Of note, in all but one of these patients, glucocorticoids were coadministered (mean maximum dose of prednisone: 39 mg/day). The most common prophylactic scheme in clinical practice and in published studies is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 480 mg/day or 960 mg three times a week. However, there are a handful of studies, including a RCT, suggesting that reduced dosing regimes (eg, 480 mg every other day) are equally effective and have fewer adverse effects(online supplemental table 5).

### Adjunctive corticosteroid use and clinical outcomes in non-HIV Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [^114wB1SE]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Adjunctive corticosteroids improve outcomes in HIV-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), but their role in non-HIV patients is uncertain. Prior evidence has largely been limited to binary treatment groups and has rarely accounted for daily or cumulative dose effects.

Research Question

What is the dose-response relationship between adjunctive corticosteroids and outcomes in non-HIV immunocompromised adults with PCP requiring supplemental oxygen?

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort analysis of 375 non-HIV immunocompromised adults with proven or probable PCP hospitalized between 2019–2025. All patients were hypoxemic at treatment initiation. Corticosteroid exposure was modeled as a continuous, cumulative time-varying dose over 21 days using marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for baseline covariates and time-varying illness severity.

Results

Of 375 patients, 351 (93.6%) received corticosteroids. The most common etiologies of immunosuppression were hematologic malignancy (30%), solid tumors on chemotherapy (30%), autoimmune disease (17%), and solid organ transplantation (14%); 56% required ICU admission and 44% died within 90 days. Greater cumulative steroid dose was associated with increased risk of 90-day mortality (weighted HR 1.01 per 100 mg prednisone-equivalent, 95% CI 1.00–1.02, p = 0.006). Steroid exposure was not associated with risk of intubation (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.02) or faster liberation from advanced respiratory support (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98–1.02).

Interpretation

In non-HIV PCP with hypoxemia, higher cumulative corticosteroid exposure was not associated with improved respiratory outcomes and was linked to increased mortality. Use of doses exceeding trial-tested regimens should be approached with caution.

Impact ofdose at discontinuing‐on the incidence of

Because the GC dose at TMP‐SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group, we further evaluated its impact on PJP occurrence. Using maximally selected rank statistics, the optimal cutoff GC dose that best distinguished the PJP from the control group was identified as 12.5 mg prednisone equivalent (P < 0.001). In fact, 90% (9 of 10) of the patients who developed PJP in the prophylaxis group were taking > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent dosage at the time of prophylaxis withdrawal, compared with only 35.1% (n = 451) in the control group. When the entire prophylactic episodes were divided into two groups based on the GC dose at the end of prophylaxis (> 12.5 mg vs ≤ 12.5 mg of prednisone equivalent), the episodes with higher GC dose (n = 460, 35.5%) at the time of prophylaxis withdrawal showed a significantly higher risk of PJP (HR, 18.55; 95% CI, 2.35–146.42; P = 0.006) (Figure 2). The result was consistent in the multivariable Cox regression analysis in which relevant risk factors for PJP were adjusted (adjusted HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 1.71–111.80; P = 0.014) (Table 3).

### Comparative efficacy and safety of treatment regimens for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in people living with HIV: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115dKgKg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a serious opportunistic infection in people living with HIV (PWH) who have low CD4 counts. Despite its side effects, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is currently considered the primary treatment for PCP.

Objectives

The objectives of this study are to compare the efficacy (treatment failure and mortality) and tolerability (treatment change) of PCP treatment regimens with a frequentist network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Data sources include Embase, Medline, and CENTRAL from inception to 3 February 2024.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Study eligibility criteria include comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least two PCP treatment regimens.

Participants

Participants include PWH.

Interventions

Interventions include treatment regimens for PCP compared head-to-head.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Assessment of risk of bias includes Cochrane Risk-of-bias tool for RCTs (Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2).

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Title, abstract, and full-text screening, along with data extraction, were conducted by two independent reviewers. Data on PCP treatment failure, all-cause mortality, and discontinuation because of toxicity were pooled and ranked.

Results

Fourteen RCTs conducted between 1983 and 1996 included 1788 participants across 27 treatment arms. No regimen showed statistically significant superiority over TMP-SMX in direct comparison. In the network meta-analysis, clindamycin/primaquine was ranked the best (surface under the cumulative ranking curve, 0.8), followed by intravenous pentamidine (0.8) and TMP-SMX (0.8) regarding treatment failure. Regarding all-cause mortality, TMP-SMX was superior to atovaquone in direct comparison, but no treatment was superior in the full network analysis. Dapsone-TMP (0.7) and intravenous pentamidine (0.8) were ranked the highest for mortality reduction. For safety and tolerability, comparator drugs consistently outperformed TMP-SMX, with significant reductions in toxicity observed for dapsone-TMP, inhaled pentamidine, and atovaquone. Inhaled pentamidine (0.9) was the best tolerated, followed by trimetrexate (0.8) and atovaquone (0.8).

Conclusions

We conclude that TMP-SMX should be reassessed as the standalone first-line therapy for PCP in PWH, given the better tolerability and comparable efficacy of other treatments. In places with access to alternative drugs for PCP treatment, our analysis suggests that alternative regimens may offer comparable effectiveness, providing flexibility to use alternative treatments when comorbidities necessitate it.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^115CDy9E]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although previous studies show that primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing for prophylaxis withdrawal. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for PJP despite prophylaxis and provide evidence for an optimal prophylaxis schedule.

Methods

This case‐control study included 1,294 prophylactic episodes in 1,148 patients with rheumatic disease who received immunosuppressants and prophylactic trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX). The primary outcome was a one‐year incidence of PJP. A Cox proportional hazards model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with outcomes.

Results

During 1,174 person‐years of observation, 10 cases of PJP were identified, with an incidence rate of 0.85 per 100 person‐years. The mean ± SD duration of TMP‐SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. Except in one case, PJP occurred after discontinuation of TMP‐SMX, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of 117.0 (86.0–161.0) days. The dose of glucocorticoids at the time of TMP‐SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group relative to the control group (median [IQR]: 22 [20–40] vs 10 [5–15] mg). Discontinuing TMP‐SMX while on a glucocorticoid dose > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP (adjusted hazard ratio: 13.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–111.80). There were 63 cases of adverse events during the observation period, and 10 (15.9%) were attributed to TMP‐SMX with probable causality.

Conclusion

Tapering glucocorticoids with 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent could be a reasonable timepoint to initiate the withdrawal of PJP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.

All patients received trimethoprim (20 mg/kg per day)-sulfamethoxazole. The time between the diagnosis of PCP and the start of appropriate treatment was not statistically different between HIV and non-HIV patients (0 [-4 to 5] days versus 0 [-2 to 3] days, respectively). In two HIV-positive patients, a skin rash was attributed to trimethoprim-sufamethoxazole and the treatment was replaced by atovaquone. Corticosteroid treatment was administered as an adjunctive therapy in all HIV-positive and HIV-negative cases (methylprednisolone 240 mg/day for 3 days, 120 mg/day for 3 days, 60 mg/day for 3 days, or until an antibacterial antibiotic was stopped). Two HIV-positive patients were receiving an active antiretroviral therapy at the time of admission. It was interrupted during the ICU stay. A significantly greater proportion of HIV-negative patients required renal replacement therapy (27% versus 8%).

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in pregnancy — women in their first trimester with PCP still should be treated with TMP-SMX because of its considerable benefit (AIII), and adjunctive corticosteroid therapy should be used for moderate-to-severe disease defined by room air PO2 < 70 mm Hg or PAO2 - PaO2 > 35 mm Hg, with corticosteroids given as early as possible. Folic acid supplementation at 0.4 mg/day is routinely recommended for all pregnant women, and although higher levels (e.g., 4 mg/day) lack trial evidence for reducing first-trimester TMP-SMX–associated risks in women with HIV, a large case-control study reported that among women receiving folic acid 6 mg/day the increased odds of congenital cardiovascular anomalies were not seen (odds ratio [OR] 1.24; 95% CI, 0.94–1.62), and for multiple congenital abnormalities the OR decreased from 6.4 without folic acid to 1.9 with folic acid. Based on these findings, clinicians can consider giving supplemental folic acid (> 0.4 mg/day routinely recommended) to women in their first trimester who are on TMP-SMX (BIII), but adding folinic acid to TMP-SMX treatment for PCP was associated with an increased risk of therapeutic failure and death, with case reports also describing failure of TMP-SMX prophylaxis with concurrent folinic acid. If supplemental folic acid (> 0.4 mg/day routinely recommended) is given, its use should be limited to the first trimester during the teratogenic window (AIII), and a follow-up ultrasound is recommended at 18 weeks to 20 weeks to assess fetal anatomy (BIII). Maternal glucose levels should be monitored closely in the third trimester because the risk of glucose intolerance is increased (AIII), and women receiving 20 mg/day of prednisone for > 3 weeks may have hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression such that use of stress-dose corticosteroids during delivery should be considered (BIII). For mild-to-moderate disease, alternative regimens include dapsone and TMP, primaquine plus clindamycin, atovaquone suspension, and IV pentamidine; dapsone appears to cross the placenta and, although used safely in pregnancy for other indications, long-term therapy is associated with a risk of mild maternal hemolysis and poses a potential risk (albeit extremely low) of acute hemolytic anemia to fetuses with G6PD deficiency, while clindamycin is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy Category B medication considered safe for use throughout pregnancy.

PCP prophylaxis

PCP prophylaxis includes either oral SMX–TMP at 80–560 mg/week, pentamidine 300 mg inhalation per visit or oral atovaquone 1500 mg once daily. The prophylaxis regimen was decided by the attending physician and tailored to the participant's clinical conditions, such as drug allergy, liver dysfunction, and chronic kidney disease. Strategic prophylaxis for PCP systemically placed the participants in cohort 2 if they fulfilled two or more of the following criteria: (i) age ≥ 65 years, (ii) presence of lung disease, (iii) concomitant use of oral glucocorticoids (GCs). Lung diseases were defined as interstitial pneumonitis, pleuritis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, old tuberculosis or inflammatory nodules detected on chest X-ray/CT. PCP prophylaxis was not applied for some participants, despite their fulfilling the above prophylaxis criteria (e.g. those who did not consent to receive prophylaxis).

Diagnosis of PCP

We used the PCP diagnostic approach described in detail previously. Briefly, participants with progressive hypoxaemia and interstitial pneumonia were diagnosed with PCP based on the presence of elevated serum β-D glucan and/or positivity for Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR in the sputum or broncho-alveolar lavage fluid.

Statistical analysis

JMP Pro 15 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics (mean, S.D. median, interquartile range, percentage) were used to examine differences at enrolment. The Student's t test or Mann–Whitney U test were used in the comparison of two groups. The χ² test was used for comparing categorical variables unless otherwise indicated. The Log rank test was used for comparison of the incidence of PCP between the two cohorts. The incidence of PCP was estimated by the Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression in an intention-to-treat analysis (with regard to PCP prophylaxis). Age, concomitant GC use, coexisting lung diseases, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration rate, peripheral blood neutrophil count, peripheral blood lymphocytes count, serum albumin, and serum IgG were tested as independent variables for univariable and multivariable analysis. Missing data was recovered by the low rank matrix approximation method. The bootstrapping technique was used for the internal validation of PCP incidence estimation for 1000 replications. All reported P values were two-sided and not adjusted for multiple testing. P values < 0.05 denoted the presence of statistically significant difference.

Treatment patterns and outcome

There were 224/240 patients (93.3%) initially treated with the gold standard, TMP-SMX. The remaining 16 patients had alternative regimens with chemotherapeutics from the second line, mostly due to side effects and intolerance of TMP/SMX (e.g. atovaquone and/or pentamidine, Fig. 1). Among the 224 patients treated with TMP-SMX, 159 (71%) were dosed in the recommended range above 15 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) per day, while 65 patients (29%) received a dose lower than 15 mg/kg BW (Additional file 1: Figure S5A). Of note, these patients had a higher mortality risk (HR 1.80 (95% CI 1.10–3.44), p = 0.02). Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients and patients with rheumatoid diseases were more likely to receive lower dosages (Additional file 1: Figure S5B). On the other side, we observed that under-dosed patients also had significantly lower eGFR (48.9 ± 43 ml/min vs. 104 ± 32 ml/min, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, the absolute dose of TMP-SMX was not different in survivors (16.9 ± 5.5 mg/kg) and non-survivors (15.6 ± 7.1 mg/kg, p = 0.93). Still, Kaplan–Meier survival curves revealed a significant difference when patients were grouped into those treated with < 15 mg/kg and those treated with ≥ 15 mg/kg TMP-SMX (Additional file 1: Figure S5C, p log-rang test = 0.02). However, TMP-SMX dose did not independently predict outcome in the multivariable regression analyses.

Corticosteroids (40–60 mg of prednisone or its equivalent) should be used in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy for patients with significant hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen < 70 mm Hg on room air). The minimal duration of antimicrobial therapy is 14 days, but more severe infections may merit longer courses of treatment.

### Estimation of treatment and prognostic factors of Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with connective tissue diseases [^113iGXa6]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Atovaquone has been reported to be a relatively well-tolerated antibiotic for PCP. In the present study, the 30-day and 60-day survival rates were comparable between the ST monotherapy (79.0% and 76.6%, respectively) and atovaquone (72.2% and 72.2%, respectively) groups. It is possible that, as an oral antibiotic, atovaquone might have been administered to patients in relatively good general condition in the current study. On the basis of the results, the efficacy of atovaquone may be comparable with that of ST for mild to moderate CTD-PCP cases that can be treated orally. Future studies with a larger number of cases are warranted for the assessment of patient background characteristics such as severity of pneumonia and renal dysfunction to further elucidate the role of atovaquone in outcomes of patients with CTD-PCP. This study was conducted using the DPC data encompassing a 2-year period starting in April 2014. The limited number of patients treated with atovaquone was due to its recent approval for use in Japan in 2012; atovaquone might not have been widely used for the treatment of PCP during the observation period. Nonetheless, the present study findings show for the first time that ST was a reasonable first-line treatment for CTD-PCP and that the prognosis with atovaquone was better than that with pentamidine in patients receiving second-line antibiotic treatment following inadequate response to ST. 'Consensus statements for medical practice: Biological agents and lung diseases', which includes a description of PCP, was published in 2014 in Japan. Although PCP has been described in patients using biologics, information is limited on treatment recommendations for patients using immunosuppressive drugs other than biologics and for second-line PCP treatments (atovaquone or pentamidine). Moreover, evidence for CTD-PCP is still insufficient. We used the DPC database to emphasise the coverage of cases, considering that CTD-PCP is a rare disease, and presented the treatment status and prognosis in this study. Owing to the limitation of having a small number of patients, we could not sufficiently adjust for patient background and confounding factors in each treatment group. Therefore, we must be careful in interpreting the results on survival rates; however, we would like to base the results of this study on clinical research in a future study to evaluate the effects of drug treatments.

Data from an older formulation of the CVD 103-HgR oral cholera vaccine suggest that the immune response to the vaccine might be diminished when given concomitantly with chloroquine. Administer live attenuated oral cholera vaccine ≥ 10 days before beginning antimalarial prophylaxis with chloroquine. Two studies showed administration of proguanil with CVD 103-HgR failed to diminish the vaccine's immunogenicity.

### The risk of opportunistic infections and the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients on checkpoint inhibitors requiring steroids [^115GMXfJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) often require treatment with high-dose systemic steroids (SS) and other immunosuppressive agents (ISAs). NCCN Guidelines recommend prophylactic antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) for patients receiving prolonged SS/ISAs. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs) and non-OIs and the role of prophylactic antibiotics in patients on SS/ISAs for irAEs.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients treated using immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy at 5 MedStar Health hospitals from January 2011 to April 2018. OIs were defined per the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the prevention and treatment of OIs in patients with HIV. The study cohort included patients who received ≥ 20 mg daily of a prednisone equivalent for ≥ 4 weeks to manage irAEs.

Results

The study cohort identified 112 (15%) of 758 total patients treated using ICIs. Baseline characteristics included the following: median age was 64 years, 74% (n = 82) of patients were White, 89% (n = 100) had an ECOG performance status ≤ 1, 61% (n = 68) had melanoma, 19% (n = 21) had non-small cell lung cancer, 45% (n = 50) were treated using an anti-PD-(L)1 ICI, and 33% (n = 37) were treated using an anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combination. The median starting SS dose was 100 mg of a prednisone equivalent, and 25% of patients required additional ISAs, with infliximab (n = 15) and mycophenolate mofetil (n = 9) being the most common. We found that 20% (n = 22) of patients developed any infection, including 7% (n = 8) with OIs (oral candidiasis [n = 4], nondisseminated varicella zoster infection [n = 2], PJP [n = 1], and Listeria monocytogenes endophthalmitis [n = 1]) and 13% (n = 14) with non-OIs (most common: Clostridium difficile and pneumonia [n = 5 each]). PJP prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was given to 13% (n = 14) patients, of whom 43% (n = 6) developed OIs/non-OIs.

Conclusions

Our study highlights the fundamental issues for patients on ICI therapy who require SS/ISAs for irAEs: the degree of immunosuppression and the relative risk of OI. We noted a low incidence of OIs overall and breakthrough infections despite PJP prophylaxis. We question whether PJP prophylaxis is efficacious or necessary. Prospective trials are required to answer these questions.

### How I treat cytopenias after CAR T-cell therapy [^1141skSb]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Early cytopenia interventions

Before initiation of LD, we start with a comprehensive review of medications and replace myelosuppressive agents with alternatives when possible. For early cytopenias, we use supportive treatment with PRBC and platelet transfusions when indicated by institutional thresholds.

Infections can commonly occur in the first 30 days and could cause further myelosuppression and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) exhaustion. Thorough evaluation and management of infections, including viral and fungal, are essential. Although there remains little prospective data on patients treated with CAR-T, our institutions have mirrored infectious prophylaxis to that used in patients undergoing blood or marrow transplantation (BMT). We begin bacterial and fungal prophylaxis on day 0, or at the time of first neutropenia, and continue until ANC count recovery. Antiviral prophylaxis is also initiated early after CAR-T infusion and continued for 6 to 12 months. Although Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) can present early in severely immunocompromised patients, we typically initiate anti-PJP prophylaxis at day 30 and advocate for a CD4 + count driven approach to its discontinuation when CD4 + T-cell counts are > 200, which can take from 1 to 2 years or longer. We commonly use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PJP prophylaxis, and consider pentamidine or atovaquone as acceptable alternatives if there are concerns for persistent cytopenias or drug allergy.

### Pneumocystis in metastatic lung cancer, a pragmatic approach in support of prophylaxis [^111rjsmX]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Human pneumocystosis is a fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, a cosmopolitan and opportunistic ubiquitous fungus. P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is potentially lethal, developing mainly in the lungs of profoundly immunocompromised patients. HIV infection, organ transplants and haematological malignancies are well-defined risk factors.

A review of the literature provided arguments to consider a pathophysiological association between P. jirovecii and the use of corticosteroids, and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommend prophylaxis when prednisone doses exceed 20 mg/day for longer than 1 month.

We present a case of a lethal PJP in a patient with metastatic lung cancer who received corticosteroids without prophylaxis.

Corticosteroid therapy

The proportion of patients who received corticosteroid therapy during their curative antibiotic treatment of PJP was 64.6% (102/158), with the highest proportion seen in patients with HIV infection (24/29 [82.8%]). In 71 (45.5%) cases, corticosteroids were given specifically for PJP (or for PJP but also other reason), as declared by investigators, at a median daily dose of 80 (IQR 60–95) mg prednisone-equivalent. When given exclusively for other reason (see details in Table S8), corticosteroids were administered at a median daily dose of 75 (IQR 50–131) mg prednisone-equivalent.

Decision of treatment withholding or withdrawing occurred in 32 (31.4%) patients treated with corticosteroids and in 14 (25.4%) not treated with corticosteroids (P = 0.60). Terminal extubation occurred in 10 (9.7%) patients of the corticosteroids group and in seven (12.7%) patients not receiving corticosteroids (P = 0.75). Lung co-infection was present during the first week of treatment of PJP for 46/102 (45.1%) and 23/54 (42.6%) patients of the corticosteroids and no corticosteroids groups, respectively (P = 0.90).

### Atovaquone suspension for treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients [^11695LX1]. AIDS (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe clinical experience with atovaquone suspension for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-infected patients.

Design

A retrospective chart review.

Methods

The medical records of 54 HIV-infected patients with PCP treated with atovaquone were examined. The outcomes of 34 patients treated with atovaquone suspension (750 mg twice a day) were compared with those of 20 patients treated with atovaquone tablets (750 mg three times a day).

Results

The proportion of patients successfully treated was similar with the suspension (74%) and tablet (70%) formulations of atovaquone. The proportion of patients with an inadequate response to therapy was lower for patients treated with atovaquone suspension (15%) than tablets (30%). Both formulations were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Atovaquone suspension is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of PCP.

### Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients: can we always follow the guidelines? [^1115NZr9]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening disease in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the preferred prophylaxis but has significant toxicity. We assessed 139 consecutive HCT patients for PCP prophylaxis in our center. According to our procedures, TMP-SMX should be given as first-line prophylaxis from engraftment. In case of intolerance, atovaquone (ATO) or aerosolized pentamidine may be given. Thirteen (9.3%) patients did not receive prophylaxis because they early died. Of the 126 prophylaxed patients, 113 (90%) received TMP-SMX and 13 (10%) received ATO as first-line regimen. However, only 51/113 (45%) patients received TMP-SMX as the sole prophylaxis: 60 patients were switched to ATO because of side effect. There were 18 PCP cases: 3 occurred before engraftment, 7 occurred under ATO, 3 occurred while prophylaxis was pending the resolution of side effects, and 5 occurred after stopping prophylaxis. No cases occurred under TMP-SMX while 7 (9.6%) cases occurred under first-(n = 13) or second (n = 60)-line ATO. There are many concerns about PCP prophylaxis after HCT: patients may develop PCP before engraftment or several months after stopping immunosuppressors, and half of them do not receive TMP-SMX all along the at-risk periods. New prophylactic drugs and strategies should be evaluated.

Table V
Summary of steroid side effects.

Deaths of DBA patients, especially infants, on steroid therapy have been attributed to Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) pneumonia. Therefore, Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis is indicated for patients receiving steroids at a dose of > 2 mg/kg, for those undergoing prolonged treatment with > 1 mg/kg and for those receiving any additional immunosuppressive therapy. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is the prophylactic treatment of choice at 5 mg/kg per day in two divided doses per day, on three consecutive days per week. Alternative treatment with Pentamidine, Dapsone or Atavoquone can be used for sulfa allergic patients or in patients with concurrent or intermittent neutropenia.

The initiation of high-dose steroid therapy in infancy, before the acquisition of immunity to live vaccines, also carries an additional potential risk. A prednisone (or equivalent) dose of < 2 mg/kg per day or < 20 mg/d for body weight greater than 10 kg is applied by the American Academy of Pediatrics as the cut-off limit for the safe administration of live vaccines. Varicella can be fatal in non-immune individuals on steroid therapy. Varicella immunization is recommended for non-immune individuals older than 12 months of age. Non-immune individuals being treated with steroids should be advised to seek urgent medical attention following exposure to chickenpox. A hepatitis B immunization program is also recommended.

Clinicians should wait 4 to 8 days before switching therapy for lack of clinical improvement (BIII), and in the absence of corticosteroid therapy, early and reversible deterioration within the first 3 to 5 days of therapy is typical. However, there are not any convincing clinical trial data on which to base recommendations for the management of PCP treatment failure due to lack of drug efficacy.

Discussion

The present observational study including 333 patients with CTD-PCP using the DPC database, a Japanese nationwide database, revealed that CTD-PCP remained a fatal complication and that older age and concomitant ILD were background factors associated with poor prognostic. Among patients with inadequate response to ST, the prognosis was better in those who received atovaquone compared with pentamidine as second-line treatment. The results of the present nationwide study with a larger cohort of patients provide stronger support to previous reports showing older age and concomitant ILD as risk and poor prognostic factors for PCP.

Because of the relatively good prognosis of patients treated with ST alone, ST might be considered as a reasonable first-line antibiotic for CTD-PCP as well as for HIV-PCP. However, patients treated with ST monotherapy might have been less likely to have complications such as chronic kidney disease, which is a prognostic factor for PCP and should be considered as a confounding factor. The present study results suggest that the prognosis might be relatively poor in patients treated with pentamidine-including regimens. Since low-dose ST with 4–10 mg/kg/day trimethoprim has also been suggested to be as effective as high-dose ST in patients with non-HIV-PCP, a reduction in ST dose might be considered as a next step in patients with inadequate response to ST. There are several potential reasons that might explain the poor prognosis observed in the pentamidine group. Pentamidine is administered intravenously and might have been used in patients with relatively poor general condition. In addition, pentamidine has a relatively high rate of side adverse effects such as renal dysfunction, cytopenia and abnormal glucose tolerance and it cannot be denied that patients treated with pentamidine might not have been treated with a sufficient dose for an adequate length of time. Studies suggest that pentamidine as first-line or second-line treatment is associated with high risk of death and may require a change in treatment in patients with HIV-PCP. Therefore, pentamidine should be used in carefully selected individuals, such as those with severe disease exhibiting inadequate response to ST and/or atovaquone.

### A nomogram-based clinical prediction model for adverse clinical outcomes in non-HIV Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia patients [^115mnhMy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As for adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in non-HIV PJP patients, current evidence remains mixed and inconclusive. One proposed mechanism suggests that in immunocompromised individuals with high fungal burden, antimicrobial-induced lysis of Pneumocystis organisms may release intracellular contents that trigger widespread inflammation. Corticosteroids may attenuate the inflammatory response by limiting further pathogen lysis. However, clinical outcomes have varied. Some studies have reported benefits of adjunctive corticosteroids in non-HIV immunocompromised PJP patients, while others — such as a multicenter study in solid organ transplant recipients — found no association between corticosteroid use and mortality. In our analysis, adjunctive corticosteroid use was also associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Collectively, these findings suggest that the role of corticosteroids in non-HIV PJP remains complex and context-dependent. For instance, in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, the majority are already receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, potentially limiting the added benefit of high-dose adjunctive regimens. Thus, further investigations are warranted to better delineate which patient subgroups may benefit from corticosteroid co-treatment and under what clinical circumstances.

This study developed and validated a predictive nomogram for identifying adverse clinical outcomes in non-HIV PJP patients, integrating key demographic, clinical, and laboratory predictors such as LDH, NLR, and CD4 + T cell counts. While the findings provide valuable insights, the study has some limitations. First, the single-center design may limit the generalizability of the results to other populations or healthcare settings; however, it ensured consistent data collection and clinical practices, enhancing internal validity. Second, the retrospective design limited access to precise corticosteroid dose and duration, and although pre-admission use was analyzed qualitatively, cumulative exposure could not be fully evaluated. Third, the use of composite outcomes may provide a comprehensive assessment of clinical deterioration but introduces potential challenges in interpreting the impact of individual endpoints due to overlapping events. Moreover, current therapeutic strategies for non-HIV PJP patients often lead to suboptimal outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need to develop and implement more effective treatment approaches. These considerations collectively highlight the importance of future prospective, multicenter studies not only to validate prognostic tools, but also to rigorously assess and refine therapeutic interventions for this high-risk population.

### Early corticosteroids for Pneumocystis pneumonia in adults without HIV are not associated with better outcome [^112D6DLL]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence supporting adjunctive corticosteroids during the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PcP) in adults without HIV is minimal and controversial.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included P jirovecii pneumonia-positive, hospitalized patients without HIV admitted to the Mayo Clinic from 2006 to 2016. Change from baseline in the respiratory component of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA resp) at day 5 was compared between early (within 48 h) steroid recipients and nonrecipients by using multivariable logistic regression and in a propensity-matched analysis.

Results

Among the 323 included patients (early steroids, n = 258; no steroids, n = 65), the median (interquartile range) age was 65 (53, 73) years, 63% were male, and 92% were white. Severity-adjusted regression and propensity-matched analyses found that early administration of steroids was associated with less improvement in SOFA resp at day 5 compared with no steroids (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively). No differences were observed in the odds of having at least a one-point improvement in SOFA resp at day 5 compared with baseline between groups (adjusted OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.24–2.28]; P = 0.61). Overall 30-day mortality was 22.9% (95% CI, 18.2–27.4). No differences in mortality, length of stay, admission to the ICU, or need for mechanical ventilation were found between early steroid recipients and nonrecipients.

Conclusions

The addition of early corticosteroids to anti-Pneumocystis therapy in patients without HIV was not associated with improved respiratory outcomes.

Interstitial pneumonia and pneumonitis

Dyspnea and hypoxemia belong to the leading indications for ICU admissions of cancer patients. Interstitial pneumonia and pneumonitis, both synonymous for lung diseases in which the inflammation process affects the interstitial lung parenchyma, have etiologies including a broad spectrum of infectious and non-infectious causes where the risk for acute lung injury is high.

Pneumocystis jirovecii and cytomegalovirus are the main infectious agents for pneumonia in immunocompromised patients; for these patients lymphoproliferative malignancies, long-term use of glucocorticoids, lymphocytopenia (CD4 < 200/μL), and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are known risk factors. Guidelines for the management of P. jirovecii pneumonia in non-HIV-infected hematological patients were recently updated by the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL). The authors emphasized the need for immediate treatment which should not be delayed by diagnostic procedures. The severity grading which categorizes HIV-positive P. jirovecii pneumonia patients into mild, moderate, or severe cases was recommended only for dichotomized use in the non-HIV population (mild versus moderate-to-severe; Fig. 2). This differentiation might be helpful in patient allocation between normal and ICUs as well as in deciding how to administer the antimicrobial agents (orally versus intravenously). High-dose cotrimoxazole (90–120 mg/kg/day, intravenously over ≥ 14 days) remains the treatment of choice for first-line therapy. An oral route from the beginning is an option only in stable patients with mild disease, which are rarely seen in hematology. Pentamidine (4 mg/kg/d i.v.) or the combination of primaquine (30 mg/d) and clindamycin (3× 600 mg/d) can be considered in patients with contraindications to, or relapsing after, cotrimoxazole. The ECIL authors pointed out that evidence from randomized clinical trials examining the role of adjunctive corticosteroids is available only for HIV-positive patients, but not for the non-HIV population. Therefore, the routine use of corticosteroids in this cohort was not recommended.

Regarding medical management for Pneumocystis pneumonia, more specifically with respect to first-line antimicrobial therapy, ATS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer TMP/SMX 15–20/75–100 mg/kg/day (in 4 divided doses) for 3 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe PCP (PaO2 on room air < 70 mmHg or an alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient > 35, or requiring hospitalization).

Prophylaxis in at-risk patients

In all, 73 patients receiving corticosteroid therapy of sufficient dose and duration were identified during the defined 6-month period. Of these, 22 (30%) had haematological malignancy and 51 (70%) had solid tumours. Table 2 lists the frequency of diseases in these populations. Figure 1 shows all patients who received ⩾25 mg prednisolone or ⩾4 mg dexamethasone daily for ⩾4 weeks, and the proportion who were also administered PCP prophylaxis. Significantly fewer at-risk patients with solid tumours received prophylaxis compared to patients with haematologic malignancy (3.9 vs 63.6%, P < 0.0001).

During this 6-month period, one case of PCP occurred in a patient not receiving chemoprophylaxis. Using the number of patients receiving corticosteroid therapy without PCP chemoprophylaxis as the denominator (57 patients in 6 months), the estimated crude incidence is 18 PCP cases per 1000 patients with malignancy receiving corticosteroid therapy for ⩾4 weeks.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE---------------- INDICATIONS AND USAGE --------------------

Atovaquone oral suspension is a quinone antimicrobial drug indicated for:

Prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in adults and adolescents aged 13 years and older who cannot tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). (1.1)
Treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP in adults and adolescents aged 13 years and older who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX. (1.2)

Limitations of Use (1.3):

Treatment of severe PCP (alveolar arterial oxygen diffusion gradient [(A-a)DO2] > 45 mm Hg) with atovaquone has not been studied.
The efficacy of atovaquone in subjects who are failing therapy with TMP-SMX has also not been studied.

1.1 Prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia

Atovaquone oral suspension is indicated for the prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in adults and adolescents (aged 13 years and older) who cannot tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).

### Efavirenz but not atazanavir / ritonavir significantly reduces atovaquone concentrations in HIV-infected subjects [^1157cp4A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The current study was conducted to determine if efavirenz (EFV) or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r)-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) impacted steady-state atovaquone plasma concentrations in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving treatment doses of atovaquone.

Methods

Thirty HIV-infected volunteers were recruited, 10 taking no cART and 10 each taking cART that included EFV or ATV/r. Subjects were randomly assigned to atovaquone 750 mg twice daily (BID) for 14 days followed by atovaquone 1500 mg BID for 14 days, or vice-versa, with a washout period in between. On day 14 of each phase, blood was sampled for pharmacokinetic studies, and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUCτ) and average concentration (C avg) were calculated and compared using an unpaired t test.

Results

Twenty-nine subjects completed both dosing cohorts. Subjects receiving EFV-based cART had 47% and 44% lower atovaquone AUCτ than subjects not receiving cART at atovaquone doses of 750 mg BID and 1500 mg BID, respectively (P ≤ .01). Only 5 of 10 subjects receiving EFV-based cART plus atovaquone 750 mg BID had an atovaquone C avg > 15 µg/mL, which has previously been associated with successful treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecipneumonia. AUCτ and Cavg did not significantly differ for concurrent ATV/r for 750 mg BID or 1500 mg BID when compared to the group not receiving cART. Nine of 10 subjects not receiving cART, 8 of 10 subjects receiving ATV/r, and 2 of 10 subjects receiving EFV in combination with atovaquone 750 mg BID achieved an atovaquone C avg > 18.5 µg/mL, a concentration that has previously been associated with successful treatment of Toxoplasmaencephalitis (TE).

Conclusions

These data suggest that the currently recommended dose of atovaquone 750 mg BID for treatment of mild to moderate PCP may not be adequate in patients receiving concurrent EFV. Furthermore, doses lower than the currently recommended dose of 1500 mg BID may achieve plasma concentrations adequate to treat TE in HIV-infected patients not receiving EFV.
