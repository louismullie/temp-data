## Question

Patient with UC has flare ups every time he gets sick with a cold, flu or Covid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a patient with ulcerative colitis flares with viral infections like colds, influenza, or COVID-19, and what the clinical implications and management should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline immune dysregulation in UC and how that predisposes to flares. Then, I should verify the mechanistic links between viral infections and UC activity, including ACE2, cytokine crosstalk, and medication effects. Next, I will review the evidence on COVID-19 specifically in UC, including outcomes and medication safety. After that, I should consider other respiratory viruses and the role of immunosuppression. Finally, I will translate this into practical management, including vaccination, medication adjustments, and monitoring strategies, while double-checking guideline consistency and correcting any outdated assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the baseline pathophysiology. UC is characterized by a dysregulated mucosal immune response with a TH2-skewed, IL-13–driven colonic inflammation, and many patients require immunosuppressive or biologic therapy, which can further modify infection risk and immune homeostasis, so the baseline milieu is primed for perturbation by systemic viral triggers [^1173H661] [^114nRDeZ].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic bridge between viral infection and UC flares. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 for cell entry, and ACE2 is highly expressed in the intestinal epithelium and upregulated in inflamed IBD mucosa, providing both a portal of entry and a potential amplifier of local inflammation during viral illness, which could plausibly trigger or worsen colitis activity [^112iDRAy]. I should also consider that viral infections drive systemic cytokine release, including IL-6 and TNF, which overlap with UC inflammatory pathways, thereby lowering the threshold for a flare during or after infection [^115ZdrMo] [^112WfPAk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about COVID-19 uniquely worsening UC outcomes; I need to check the clinical data. Large observational cohorts and meta-analyses indicate that IBD patients overall do not have substantially higher risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection or worse COVID-19 outcomes than the general population, but risk increases with active disease and corticosteroid exposure, and severe COVID-19 has been associated with numerically worse IBD outcomes in some studies, which aligns with the mechanistic concerns above [^112WfPAk] [^112PaPdi] [^114y2iLf]. I should double-check medication-specific signals: systemic corticosteroids consistently associate with worse COVID-19 outcomes in IBD cohorts, whereas anti-TNF monotherapy has not been linked to worse outcomes and may even be protective in some analyses, which is reassuring for ongoing biologic therapy during viral seasons [^115WAt4E] [^116gK5y9] [^116SDnUk].

> Let me consider other respiratory viruses too. Patients with IBD on immunomodulatory therapy have higher risks of serious infections, including pneumonia and herpes zoster, and viral respiratory infections can precipitate systemic inflammation that lowers the threshold for UC flares, particularly in the setting of corticosteroids or combination immunosuppression, so the pattern of viral-triggered flares is biologically coherent and clinically observed [^111gkwNd] [^115JqA3a]. I should confirm that active IBD itself increases susceptibility to infections even without overt immunosuppression, reinforcing the importance of maintaining remission to mitigate both infection and flare risk [^114Ws2HG].

> Next, I should review medication-specific nuances during viral illness. Systemic corticosteroids impair viral clearance and increase risks of secondary infection and worse COVID-19 outcomes, so minimizing or avoiding systemic steroids and favoring budesonide when steroids are unavoidable is prudent; conversely, continuing anti-TNF therapy is generally supported, with case-based and registry data suggesting no excess harm and potential benefit in the inflammatory phase of COVID-19, while vedolizumab and ustekinumab appear to carry low respiratory infection risk and can be continued in most scenarios [^116gK5y9] [^114q35x8] [^116SDnUk]. But wait, what if the patient is on thiopurines or JAK inhibitors during a viral illness? Guidelines advise holding thiopurines, methotrexate, tofacitinib, and delaying biologics during active COVID-19, with resumption after symptom resolution and appropriate testing, given infection risks and uncertain interactions, so I should tailor holds to illness severity and timing [^1138W2Pr] [^116bBk76].

> I will now examine the clinical implications for management. First, I need to ensure vaccinations are optimized: annual inactivated influenza, up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination with consideration of additional boosters, and avoidance of live intranasal vaccines are recommended, as vaccination reduces severe viral disease and likely reduces the inflammatory triggers for UC flares, even though antibody titers may be lower with some IBD therapies [^1121SPdb] [^111CkDM5] [^113C6WNf]. Second, I should confirm that effective maintenance therapy is continued whenever possible, avoiding unnecessary corticosteroids and favoring steroid-sparing strategies, because active IBD independently worsens infection risk and outcomes, and treatment interruptions increase flare risk without clear COVID-19 benefit [^117FyTVG] [^114Ws2HG] [^116YQYX7]. Third, during acute viral illness, I should double-check for COVID-19 or influenza with appropriate testing, assess for superimposed C. difficile or other enteric infections, and adjust immunosuppression temporarily if severe infection is present, resuming therapies promptly after recovery to prevent rebound flares [^116YH3mW] [^1138W2Pr].

> Let me think about flare management during or after viral illness. For mild-to-moderate UC flares, optimize 5-ASA, consider rectal therapy, and use budesonide MMX when systemic steroids are tempting, reserving short-course IV steroids for severe flares with close monitoring; for steroid-refractory cases, infliximab or calcineurin inhibitors remain appropriate rescue options even in the setting of viral infection, with multidisciplinary input for timing and infection control, and case reports suggest tacrolimus can be a useful bridge in select COVID-19–coinfected patients [^112y9V4j] [^111S65rv] [^115L3mkd]. Hold on, I should verify that delaying necessary rescue therapy for ASUC because of viral infection is not advised, as untreated severe UC carries high morbidity and mortality, and expert panels support proceeding with standard rescue algorithms with appropriate precautions [^111S65rv] [^114gktdB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "COVID-19 uniquely worsens UC outcomes", but I should correct that framing. While severe COVID-19 correlates with worse IBD outcomes in some cohorts, IBD per se is not consistently associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, and most patients with IBD have outcomes comparable to the general population; the consistent risk amplifiers are active disease and corticosteroids, so maintaining remission and minimizing steroids are the key modifiable levers to reduce viral-triggered flares and adverse outcomes [^112WfPAk] [^112PaPdi] [^116GC4KX].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal monitoring and patient counseling are in place. Telehealth-based disease monitoring can maintain outcomes comparable to usual care while reducing exposure during viral seasons, and structured follow-up after viral illnesses can catch early flares; patients should be counseled to report new or worsening GI symptoms promptly after viral infections, and clinicians should maintain a low threshold to test for infections and reassess therapy if flares occur, aligning with evolving guidance on IBD care during the COVID-19 era and beyond [^111oyyeM] [^113HASHr] [^117FyTVG].

Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) often flare during viral infections (cold, flu, COVID-19) due to **immune dysregulation** and **cytokine cross-talk** [^115ZdrMo], which amplify mucosal inflammation [^112WfPAk]. Systemic corticosteroids further increase infection risk and severity [^114q35x8] [^115WAt4E], while **biologics are generally safe** and may be protective [^116gK5y9] [^116SDnUk]. To reduce flares, maintain remission with appropriate therapy, optimize vaccination [^111CkDM5], and manage infections promptly; during acute viral illness, continue biologics, minimize or avoid systemic steroids, and use budesonide or rectal therapies when needed [^116gK5y9] [^116ytsCt].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking viral infections to UC flares

### Immune dysregulation and cytokine cross-talk

- **Immune dysregulation**: UC involves a dysregulated immune response [^114nRDeZ]; viral infections can further disrupt this balance, triggering flares [^115ZdrMo].
- **Cytokine cross-talk**: Viral infections elevate pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α) that overlap with UC pathways, amplifying inflammation [^112WfPAk] [^115ZdrMo].
- **ACE2 expression**: SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2, which is upregulated in inflamed gut, potentially worsening UC [^115ZdrMo] [^112iDRAy].

---

### Direct viral effects on the gastrointestinal tract

Direct viral effects include **viral replication** in the gut, which can damage the mucosa and provoke inflammation, and **microvascular injury**, wherein viral endothelial infection may impair perfusion and increase inflammation [^115ZdrMo].

---

### Medication-related factors

Medication-related factors include **immunosuppressive therapies**, which increase infection risk and may worsen viral illness; **systemic corticosteroids** heighten susceptibility to infection and are linked to worse COVID-19 outcomes [^115WAt4E] [^116gK5y9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Multiple studies and guidelines support the link between viral infections and UC flares:

| **Study/guideline** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| SECURE-IBD registry | Active UC and corticosteroids predict worse COVID-19 outcomes [^112FLUd7] [^116gK5y9] |
| Italian cohort | Active IBD increased COVID-19 pneumonia risk and hospitalization [^116cNWvA] |
| BSG guidance | Active IBD raises infection risk; control inflammation to reduce complications [^114Ws2HG] |
| AGA guidance | Maintain remission to lessen relapse and hospitalization risk [^117FyTVG] |

---

## Impact of specific viral infections on UC activity

### COVID-19

- **Increased flare risk**: COVID-19 can trigger UC flares via immune activation and cytokine release [^115ZdrMo].
- **Severity correlation**: Severe COVID-19 correlates with worse IBD outcomes, including hospitalization and surgery [^114y2iLf].
- **Medication effects**: Systemic corticosteroids worsen COVID-19; biologics are generally safe and may be protective [^116gK5y9] [^116SDnUk].

---

### Influenza and other respiratory viruses

Influenza and other respiratory viruses can precipitate UC flares through **immune activation** and systemic inflammation, and immunosuppression increases susceptibility and severity.

---

## Clinical management strategies

### Preventive measures

- **Vaccination**: Annual influenza, COVID-19, and other recommended vaccines reduce infection risk and flares [^111NH9GX] [^1121SPdb].
- **Infection prevention**: Hand hygiene, masking, and social distancing lower exposure risk [^notfound].
- **Medication adherence**: Maintaining remission therapy reduces flare risk during infections [^116YQYX7].

---

### Management during acute viral infections

- **Continue biologics**: Do not stop effective biologics; they are generally safe and may be protective [^116gK5y9] [^116SDnUk].
- **Minimize systemic steroids**: Avoid or taper systemic steroids; use budesonide or rectal therapies if needed [^116ytsCt] [^116bBk76].
- **Monitor closely**: Track symptoms, labs, and disease activity; escalate therapy if flare occurs [^116YH3mW].

---

### Post-infection management

Post-infection management includes reassessing **disease activity** and adjusting therapy to maintain remission, as well as monitoring for delayed flares or complications after the infection.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients with UC are prone to flares during viral infections due to immune dysregulation, cytokine cross-talk, and medication effects. Maintain remission therapy, optimize vaccination, and manage infections promptly to reduce flares. During acute viral illness, continue biologics, minimize systemic steroids, and use budesonide or rectal therapies when needed.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the largest outbreak involving humanity from about a century ago to today. Globally, on 15 June 2020, 7,553,182 cases have occurred worldwide, with 423,349 deaths. The pandemic started in China and Southeast Asia (439,343 cases with 12,126 deaths), but subsequently spread to Europe and America with a higher number of cases and deaths (3,638,525 with 196,440 deaths in America and 2,378,958 cases with 187,468 deaths in Europe). Although COVID-19 mainly causes respiratory symptoms, it is now well known that it is also characterized by less common symptoms such as: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Since SARS-CoV-2 may colonize the gastrointestinal tract, among gastroenterologists there is concern that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), may be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer COVID-19 course, due to the chronic nature of the disease and the medications used for their treatment. In fact, the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of IBD includes both steroids and immunosuppressants, which may predispose not only to opportunistic infections, but also to viral infections. In the last few months, several reassuring data have been accumulating on the prevalence rate of COVID-19 and its outcomes in patients with IBD. Interestingly, the impact of the different IBD-related therapies on the clinical course of COVID-19 is also better understood.

IBD management in patients with COVID-19

Medical management

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it an ever-changing climate, with new lessons constantly developing. Consequently, this state of flux provides a difficult context for providers to guide patients without a wealth of available data. The optimal medical management of IBD patients found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 must be personalized depending on a variety of factors. To accommodate a personalized approach, multiple societies and experts provided consensus recommendations regarding a framework to approach COVID-19 in the IBD patient. The IOIBD, AGA, and European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) have recommended that infusions and therapy should be continued, with the exception of corticosteroids. Ungaro et al. provided updated data from over 6000 patients finding biologics to have no association with an increased risk of worsened COVID-19 outcomes and are safe to continue during the pandemic. Switching from intravenous formulations of anti-TNF therapy to subcutaneous routes is not recommended. Systemic corticosteroids (especially prednisone > 20 mg/day) have steadily been associated with severe-COVID19 in the IBD population, and expert consensus suggests that when appropriate, patients should be tapered off or switched to budesonide. However, the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 includes high dose steroids to combat the progression to ARDS. The RECOVERY trial found patients treated with dexamethasone to have a lower mortality compared to standard care in mechanically ventilated patients (29.3% versus 41.4%; rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.51–0.81). The effect of steroids is most likely related to the phase of the COVID-19 disease course. Early in infection, during viral replication, steroids appear to be harmful compared to a potentially beneficial impact later in severe COVID-19 when a more inflammatory response is present. Patients who present with an acute severe UC (ASUC) flare are typically also treated with parenteral steroids.

Introduction

Over the last 2 years the lives of millions have changed because of the emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). After the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, lockdowns, restrictions, and changes to daily living began to take shape all over the globe. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal system that consists principally of two conditions, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), characterized by a dysregulated immune response in the intestine. As a result, the current mainstay of treatment for IBD is the use of immunosuppressive drugs aimed at targeting the immune system. It has been well established that these agents increase the risk for serious and opportunistic infections. The Centers for Disease Control considers immunocompromised individuals at higher risk of infection and complications from COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, the specific risks for IBD patients were unclear. Early guidance was based on expert opinion and was provided by national and international societies, such as the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), and the International Organization of the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) on the management of IBD during a COVID pandemic. However, much research on COVID-19 and IBD has been conducted since the early days of the pandemic. We aim to provide an overview of the current evidence on the risks of COVID-19 in IBD patients, safety of commonly used IBD medications in COVID-19, treating the IBD patient with COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccination.

### COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease-what to know [^114nRDeZ]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that arises from a complex interplay between a dysregulated immune response in genetically predisposed individuals. IBD can further be classified into its two main subtypes, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both subtypes have shown increasing prevalence and incidence rates worldwide, and IBD is now considered a global epidemic. About three million patients are estimated to suffer from this disease, both in the US and Europe, with most of them requiring maintenance treatment including immunosuppressive agents, putting them at risk for opportunistic infections. In 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hit the world with a long pandemic period resulting in dramatic numbers of hospitalizations, Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths. Patients with chronic illnesses, such as IBD, were rapidly considered to be at an increased risk for both infection and infection-related complications. For IBD and its treatment, however, evidence over the last few years showed no increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-related complications. In this review, we will discuss the latest insights about COVID-19 in IBD patients with a particular focus on the disease course of COVID-19 and on IBD-related adverse outcomes.

### Treatment of severe acute ulcerative colitis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: report of three cases and discussion of treatment options [^116cAqwp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is unclear how asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients who present with acute severe ulcerative colitis (UC) can be treated effectively and safely. Standard treatment regimens consist of steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and biological therapies, but therapeutic decision-making becomes challenging as there are uncertainties about how to deal with these drugs in patients with COVID-19 and active UC. Importantly, guidelines for this particular group of patients with UC are still lacking. To inform therapeutic decision-making, we describe three consecutive cases of patients with active UC and COVID-19 and discuss their treatments based on theoretical knowledge, currently available evidence and clinical observations. Three patients were identified through our national inflammatory bowel disease network [Initiative on Crohn's and Colitis (ICC)] for whom diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection was established by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in nasopharynx, stools, and/or biopsies. Acute severe UC was diagnosed by clinical parameters, endoscopy, and histopathology. Clinical guidelines for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients advocate the use of steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-antagonists as induction therapy, and experiences from the current three cases show that steroids and TNF-α-antagonists could also be used in patients with COVID-19. This could potentially be followed by TNF-α-antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab as maintenance therapy in these patients. Future research is warranted to investigate if, and which, immunomodulatory drugs should be used for COVID-19 patients that present with active UC. To answer this question, it is of utmost importance that future cases of patients with UC and COVID-19 are documented carefully in international registries, such as the SECURE-IBD registry.

Concluding remarks

In conclusion, based on our clinical experience, it is not recommended to delay treatment in patients with acute severe UC who simultaneously present with COVID-19, even in the absence of respiratory complaints. Taking into account currently available evidence, we do not dissuade the use of steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or TNF-α antagonists as induction therapy, and the use of TNF-α antagonists, vedolizumab or potentially ustekinumab as maintenance therapy in patients with acute severe UC and concurrent COVID-19 without respiratory complaints. Future research is warranted to investigate whether, and which, immunomodulatory and biological therapies should be used for symptomatic COVID-19 patients who clinically present with acute severe UC. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that future cases of patients with UC and COVID-19 are documented carefully in the worldwide SECURE-IBD registry.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a condition in which the gastrointestinal immune system responds inappropriately. IBD is therefore often treated with immunosuppressing medications to control inflammation and prevent 'flares', a worsening of symptoms, which may be unpredictable.

While it is known that 0.8% of people in the UK currently have IBD (approximately 524 000 patients), only 44% have been to a clinic in the past 3 years. There will be many patients who are worried about the effect of the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 disease) on their IBD and vice versa, many of whom will be unknown to secondary care.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, we will do everything we can to keep our IBD patients safe. The greatest risks relate not only to the infection itself, but also the emergency reorganisation of hospital and general practice services to deal with the pandemic. This will result in significant changes to routine IBD services. A combined approach covering both primary and secondary care is therefore required to keep vulnerable patients with IBD out of hospital as much as possible.

Insights from Hubei, China and from Italy suggest hospital attendance for non-COVID-19 illness may provide a reservoir for further spread of infection. However, alterations to the way we deliver IBD care in the UK must be balanced against the risks of under treated, active IBD. Importantly, patients with active IBD are likely to have a higher risk of infection both in the community and during inpatient care, even in the absence of immunosuppressive treatment. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to control intestinal inflammation in IBD to prevent adverse outcomes.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids systemically suppress the inflammatory response and may be beneficial in patients with both active IBD and COVID-19, as the latter may be accompanied by a systemic 'cytokine storm' aggravating the disease by inducing lung injury and widespread tissue damage. However, patients using corticosteroids are known to be notoriously prone to many opportunistic and respiratory infections, including influenza and coronavirus infections, such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections. – In addition, corticosteroid use is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality in patients with IBD, especially when higher dosages are administered. Several recommendations state that patients with IBD should avoid the use of corticosteroids or taper the use of corticosteroids as much as possible. Recently, preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial revealed that patients with severe COVID-19 benefited from receiving 6 mg dexamethasone once daily (n = 2104) as they had a significantly lower mortality rate compared with patients receiving standard of care (n = 4321). In this trial, dexamethasone was particularly beneficial for patients who were about to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, dexamethasone did not benefit patients with milder disease or those of older ages, and issues of optimal dosage, timing, or duration of therapy remained unaddressed. Likewise, it remains unclear whether patients with COVID-19 using corticosteroids for other medical conditions are at increased risk of adverse disease outcomes. Therefore, a potential, yet unknown, risk of developing an adverse outcome of COVID-19 should be balanced against the known efficacy of corticosteroids in treating disease exacerbations in patients with active UC. Based on the above, rapid tapering of corticosteroid treatment would be a preferred strategy as soon as disease activity decreases, considering the side-effects, increased risk of viral infections, and associations with higher hospitalization and mortality rates. If a patient with active UC and concomitant COVID-19 requires corticosteroid treatment, it is recommended to commence locally acting, high-dose corticosteroids (budesonide or beclomethasone) as these are characterized by fewer side effects.

### Treatment of severe acute ulcerative colitis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: report of three cases and discussion of treatment options [^1143wtyv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

To date, there are few evidence-based recommendations with regard to the use of immunosuppressive drugs in patients with IBD who are affected by COVID-19. Generally, it is advised that both adult and pediatric patients should not preemptively discontinue treatment as potential risks associated with pausing immunomodulation outweigh the risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing a severe outcome when infected with SARS-CoV-2. – Similarly, patients with IBD who are treated with TNF-α-antagonists or other compounds targeting cytokine pathways, do not automatically seem to be conferring an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. Although these medications may be considered immunosuppressive drugs, and therefore potentially harmful in the context of COVID-19, they specifically target individual pro-inflammatory cytokines or mediators and do not inhibit a broad range of immune system components. In addition, cytokine inhibitors are seriously considered as encouraging treatment options for COVID-19 as they are likely to attenuate the hyperinflammatory response associated with the disease. When evaluating the potential risks of biological therapies, it is important to examine which cytokine pathways are blocked as most of these substances are involved in the host inflammatory response and not mainly in viral clearance mechanisms.

Treatment recommendations for patients with acute severe UC and COVID-19

In the cases presented, several drugs could theoretically have been applied to influence the clinical course of patients with acute severe UC with COVID-19, including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), TNF-α antagonists (e.g. infliximab), and vedolizumab. Here, we aim to highlight these medical treatments by integrating their known efficacy in UC with the currently available evidence for potential effectiveness in COVID-19 (Table 1).

### The complex relationship between viruses and inflammatory bowel disease-review and practical advices for the daily clinical decision-making during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^115JqA3a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak emerged in December 2019 in China and rapidly spread worldwide. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are likely to be more susceptible to viral infections, and this is significantly influenced by the type of therapy they receive. Thus, issues specifically concerning the medical treatment of IBD patients were shortly addressed at the beginning of the pandemic. However, recently available data on the occurrence and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients does not address the concerns raised at the beginning of the pandemic. Growing evidence and the rapid changes happening over the past few weeks have helped elucidate the current situation, contribute to our understanding of the disease, and many previously raised questions could now be answered. We hereby summarise available evidence regarding viral infections and IBD, focusing on SARS-CoV infections, and we provide practical recommendations related to patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic era.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^115FrLTS]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

While national and international registries continue to collate data regarding patients with IBD with COVID-19, very few cases relate to the management of ASUC. The PREPARE IBD (physician response to disease flares and patient adaptation in response to events in IBD during theCOVID-19 pandemic) study is collecting data from patients with IBD who are admitted to hospital during the pandemic, as well as from those who develop confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of 8 May 2020, 19 patients with severe active UC including four with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 had been identified (S Sebastian, personal communication, 2020). The Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion-IBD registry is collating data on patients with IBD with confirmed coronavirus, with 1074 patients included to date, the majority of whom have Crohn's disease; details of how many in the cohort have ASUC are not yet available. Finally, in case series from Italy and Spain, 4 of 79 and 1 of 40 patients, respectively, had COVID-19 in conjunction with ASUC(the number of patients with ASUC in the Italian case series was provided on request from authors).

Treatment of ASUC during the COVID-19 pandemic presents substantial management dilemmas in the absence of a high-quality evidence base to guide clinicians. We therefore aimed to address this deficit of informed guidance by convening a RAND appropriateness panel. Current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines were used as a reference point to highlight differences to current management.

Discussion

General considerations

The recent International Organisation For the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease RAND appropriateness panel addressing the use of medications to treat IBD in the COVID-19 era did not specifically address the management of patients with ASUC. To date, there has been no consensus on how to manage this condition during the COVID-19 pandemic; in the context of a limited, although rapidly evolving evidence base, this is perhaps unsurprising. Thus, there is an urgent need for guidance on how best to manage ASUC in the current setting. Several areas need consideration in this regard including: the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the activity and course of IBD; the effect of IBD and its activity on the risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the progression to COVID-19; the interaction of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 with the drugs used to treat IBD; and the possible effects of treatments for COVID-19 on IBD.

SARS-CoV-2 is found in the gut and RNA is measurable in the stool significantly longer than in serum or respiratory samplesalthough the significance of this is unclear. The effects of the virus on the intestinal mucosa remain undefined, as does its interaction with inflamed tissue. Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea occur in around 30% of patients and have been associated with worse outcome, and a single report describes a possible case of COVID-19 colitis.

Currently, it is not clear whether IBD-specific factors lead to worse outcomes in patients who develop COVID-19. In the Italian series of 79 patients with IBD and COVID-19, active disease was associated with the risk of COVID-19 pneumonia even after controlling for other risk factors. Furthermore, active IBD was also significantly associated with increased hospitalisation, the need for respiratory support and death. In contrast, in Bergamo, Northern Italy, an observational study reported no cases of COVID-19 in 522 patients with IBD. While there are data that suggest that active IBD increases the risk of some viral infections, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infection given the limited data available.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected more than 390 million people worldwide as of 1 February 2022 and continues to remain a global health crisis. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) of the gastrointestinal tract that often require long-term immunosuppressive therapy for management.

Early in the onset of the pandemic there was concern that IBD, chronic immune dysregulation, and associated immunosuppression may represent a potential risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe outcomes. Subsequent studies have largely shown that IBD does not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or worse COVID-19 outcomes. – Data have also confirmed that biologic and novel small molecule therapies are not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are effective in reducing symptomatic or severe COVID-19, and early data have shown that in patients with IBD, vaccine efficacy is comparable with that in the general population.

While these data are reassuring, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the course of IBD remains largely unknown. Studies from the previous SARS epidemic of 2003 have shown a durable impact of infection with the SARS-CoV-1 virus on long-term pulmonary function, exercise capacity, psychiatric comorbidities, and chronic fatigue. Similarly, data suggest that COVID-19 is associated with long-term respiratory, neurologic, and psychiatric sequelae. Long-haul COVID-19 results in immune dysfunction that can persist up to 8 months after infection, and in the gastrointestinal tract, where angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression is increased and SARS-CoV-2 antigen can persist, it is associated with chronic abdominal pain, altered bowel motility, and irritable bowel syndrome. – Furthermore, the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 results in elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-2, and IL-17, that are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Given these reported associations, the possible consequence of COVID-19 is an alteration of the inflammatory milieu with a downstream deleterious impact on IBD outcomes.

In this multicenter, case–control study, we aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 on long-term outcomes of IBD.

### The complex relationship between viruses and inflammatory bowel disease-review and practical advices for the daily clinical decision-making during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^112FLUd7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

As mentioned above, Brenner et al. developed an IBD registry to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SECURE Registry aimed to define the impact of COVID-19 on patients with IBD and to evaluate how certain factors might impact on COVID outcomes. However, the registry has some limitations. For instance, some cases with mild symptoms may be lost because of restricted COVID testing, and some cases of IBD-related hospitalisation would incorrectly be associated with COVID-19 if the patient incidentally tested positive for the virus. By the time that this article was written, 701 IBD patients were registered with positive test results, 414 patients with CD and 287 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Hospitalisation was required for 28% of CD and 38% of UC patients, whereas 4% and 6% were admitted to intensive care units; the mortality turned out to be 2% and 6%, respectively (Figure 1). Severe complications appeared to be associated with disease activity, and there was a clear correlation with older age (Figures 2 and 3). Death was most common amongst patients receiving steroid therapy (13%) (Figures 4 and 5). The surprisingly high death rate in patients administered mesalazine (8%) could be explained at least in part by the age of these patients [79 years (data coming from 9 April)]. However, the safety of mesalazine use is still a controversial issue without any exact (statistical bias?) reason. From another viewpoint, since the registry collects data from all over the world, the high proportion of patients receiving 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) may reflect countries with poor access to advanced treatments, such as biological therapy; hence, the use of 5-ASAs should be much higher even in CD as well.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^111S65rv]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in December 2019 and its spread led to the declaration of a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Infection varies in severity from asymptomatic carriage to an acute respiratory illness which, at its most severe, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome. By mid-May 2020, there have been nearly 5 million cases reported worldwide with over 300 000 deaths. Risk factors associated with more severe COVID-19 include older age, male sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, renal failure and ethnicity. Neither an effective medical therapy nor a vaccine has yet been described, although numerous candidates are under evaluation.

Acute severe UC (ASUC) occurs in up to 25% of patients with UC and is associated with a mortality of approximately 1%. The management of ASUC is particularly challenging in the context of SARS-CoV-2 as the typical presenting features of ASUC, namely diarrhoea with raised inflammatory markers, often in association with a fever, may mimic those of COVID-19. ASUC is managed with high-dose parenteral corticosteroids, progressing to rescue therapy and/or surgery in those who fail to respond adequately. The safety of all these interventions in the context of COVID-19 is unclear. For example, there are concerns that corticosteroids may increase the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or worsen the severity of COVID-19. In addition, the commonly used rescue therapies, infliximab and ciclosporin are associated with an increased risk of infection, particularly if used in combination with immunomodulators such as thiopurines or steroids. Finally, individuals in whom corticosteroids and rescue therapy fail require urgent colectomy which is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, withholding treatment in ASUC is clearly not an option in view of the high mortality (in excess of 20%) associated with such an approach.

### COVID-19 vaccination in adults with inflammatory bowel disease [^117D33Kw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To date, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to over 6 million deaths worldwide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been concern that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 as well as suffering severe COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or death, whether from factors related to IBD itself or as a result of immune modifying therapies used to treat IBD. Furthermore, while effective COVID-19 vaccine development was swift, patients with IBD were excluded from the original clinical trials which demonstrated vaccine efficacy, leading to additional uncertainty in this population. Since that time however, much data has been collected which has shown that most patients with IBD are not at increased risk for severe COVID-19 infection and that vaccines are both safe and effective in this population. This review summarizes these findings including relevant articles identified in PubMed ® using search terms 'COVID-19 vaccine and IBD' published between March 2020 and December 2022.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: expert commentary [^117FyTVG]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk is discussed by noting that control of chronic inflammation often relies on immunosuppressive or immune-modifying therapies and that visits to medical facilities for infusions or endoscopic procedures may increase exposure; nevertheless, the authors state that "the limited available data and expert opinion suggest that patients with IBD do not appear to have a baseline increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or development of COVID-19", and add, "It is unclear whether inflammation of the bowel per se is a risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, but it is sensible that patients with IBD should maintain remission in order to reduce the risk of relapse and need for more intense medical therapy or hospitalization".

### COVID-19 and immunomodulation in IBD [^112374tu]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The current coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing global health crisis due to COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although COVID-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome. This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of COVID-19. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation. Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed.

### The natural history of COVID-19 in vaccinated inflammatory bowel disease patients [^1167SGXi]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Assess the characteristics of break through COVID-19 in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients, despite complete vaccination.

Methods

Patients who reported a COVID-19 at least 3 weeks after complete vaccination were asked to answer an on-line anonymous questionnaire which included patient and disease characteristics, vaccination history, and the evolution of COVID-19.

Results

Among 3240 IBD patients who reported complete vaccination between 1st May 2021 and 30thJune 2022, 402 (12.4%) were infected by SARS Cov-2 [223 male, 216 Crohn's disease (CD), 186 Ulcerative Colitis (UC), mean (SD) age 42.3 (14.9) years, mean (SD) IBD duration 10.1 (9.7) years]. Three hundred and sixty-nine patients (91.8%) were infected once and 33 (8.2%) twice. The mean (SD) time between last vaccination and infection was 4.1 (1.6) months. Overall, 351 (87.3%) patients reported mild constitutional and/or respiratory symptoms, 34 (8.4%) were asymptomatic and only 17 patients (4.2%) required hospitalization. Of hospitalized patients, 2 UC patients died of COVID-19 pneumonia. The remaining hospitalized patients did not need high flow oxygen supply or ICU admission.

Conclusions

A minority of completely vaccinated IBD patients developed COVID-19 which evolved with mild symptoms and a favorable outcome. These results reinforce the importance of vaccination especially in vulnerable populations.

Active IBD symptoms with mild COVID-19

In patients with active GI symptoms suggestive of IBD flare-up, the workup should be targeted to find the cause for the relapse. The stool should be tested for C. difficile and other enteric pathogens. The presence of active inflammation can be assessed by testing C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin or cross-sectional imaging. According to Joint GI society recommendations, endoscopic procedures should be reserved only for urgent and emergent indications during the COVID-19 pandemic. For mildly active disease, non-immunosuppressive medications can be used. For moderate to severe disease, the risks and benefits of escalating IBD therapy must be carefully weighed against the severity of the COVID-19. If the patient has only mild COVID-19, then the IBD flare-up should be treated similarly to the treatment that would have been considered before the pandemic. However, it is still essential to avoid or limit the use of corticosteroids, given their association with poor outcomes. In patients hospitalized for severe IBD who have mild COVID-19, intravenous steroids should be limited to 3 days, and consideration should be given to the use of either infliximab or a calcineurin inhibitor for induction of remission.

### Managing IBD in the COVID-19 era [^113Cmvwq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years the lives of millions have changed because of the emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent a sizable population with their own sets of challenges to providers in the wake of so much uncertainty. The Centers for Disease Control considers immunocompromised individuals at higher risk of infection and complications from COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, the specific risks for IBD patients were unclear as guidance was based on expert opinion regarding the management of IBD during a COVID-19 era. Fortunately, after considerable work in the field, the overwhelming evidence suggests that IBD patients as a whole do not appear to be at increased risk for more severe disease from COVID-19. Certain risk factors such as age, steroids, comorbidities, combination immunomodulatory therapy, and IBD disease activity have been associated with worse outcomes. Most IBD medications are low risk, with the exception of immunomodulator monotherapy and combination therapy with thiopurine and anti-TNF. Vaccination remains safe and effective for all IBD patients, although additional booster doses may be necessary, particularly in patients taking anti-TNF agents.

### Inflammatory bowel disease clinical service recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112wpzt7]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The risk of patients with IBD acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19 will depend on their inherent personal risk factors and modifiable factors such as active IBD and immunosuppression. Fortunately, we will be able to refine the risk profile for each individual patient iteratively as more data become available. We recommend that effective treatment for IBD should not be postponed idefinately until patients have received the COVID-19 vaccine Three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been approved and the BSG and other organisations are in favour of patients with IBD to accept the first vaccine offered.

Healthcare services and patients have rapidly adjusted to new working practices stimulated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our next challenge is to truly transform our services using data-driven clinical decision-making, proactively monitoring disease and supporting patient engagement as the pandemic evolves.

Testing and resumption principles in IBD during COVID-19 include: "For patients with COVID-19 symptoms/findings who tested negative, consider re-testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus or obtain serologies in two weeks" and "Resume therapies after symptom resolution or when SARS-CoV-2 re-testing is negative or when entering convalescent phase of immunity". Footnotes add that "Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 may enable resumption of IBD therapy; role of serologic antibody testing unclear at the current time". and that "Viral clearance testing may or may not be possible or appropriate, given local testing capabilities and health system–approved epidemiological testing strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic".

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents an unprecedented global health crisis. Safe and effective vaccines were rapidly developed and deployed that reduced COVID-19-related severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are not at increased risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19, and data from large cohorts of patients with inflammatory bowel disease demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination is safe and effective. Ongoing research is clarifying the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with inflammatory bowel disease, long-term immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination, and optimal timing for repeated COVID-19 vaccination doses.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^111CkDM5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 vaccination in adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — we suggest vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in accordance with national guidelines (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients with IBD are susceptible to acquiring COVID-19 at rates similar to or perhaps even lower than the general population, and IBD is not associated with worse outcomes relative to those without IBD in the absence of general risk factors such as older age, obesity, and chronic corticosteroid use. Observational cohorts show generally robust humoral responses to vaccination regardless of IBD treatment, although anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies or corticosteroids at vaccination may be associated with lower postvaccination titers, and titers are lower with adenovirus vector vaccines than with mRNA vaccines. Postvaccination symptoms seem less frequent than in healthy controls, are generally mild and limited in duration, and there is no appreciable risk of IBD disease flare after mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

IBD biologic dosing timing during COVID-19 concerns — monoclonal antibody therapies (anti-TNF therapies, ustekinumab, or vedolizumab) should have their dosing delayed for 2 weeks with monitoring for COVID-19, and restarting therapy after 2 weeks if the patient has not developed manifestations of COVID-19 is reasonable; serial stool testing for SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to be adopted and its clinical significance remains to be seen.

### Implications of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks for IBD management [^116wsmrh]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The initial phases of the global SARS-CoV2 pandemic had significant implications for the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This impact is likely to be sustained and far-reaching across all models of care. Initial questions about the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection, and COVID-19 complications, in patients taking maintenance anti-TNFs, JAK inhibitors and other immune modulators have preliminary data. Current models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission predict intermittent outbreaks until 2022, which could disrupt clinical care and negatively affect outcomes for many patients across the globe. This review summarises changes in IBD clinical practice that will be required during the 'post-peak' phase of viral pandemics.

### Recent advances in clinical practice: management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114rNVsA]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with IBD are at greater risk of developing serious infections and pneumonia, particularly those treated with biological drugs which are known to be associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections. At the beginning of the pandemic, concerns were raised as to whether patients with IBD may develop worse health outcomes. It also remained uncertain whether patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs have reduced vaccine response, as has been demonstrated previously for other vaccine-preventable infections. Until recently, patients with IMIDs, including IBD, were excluded from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical development programmes. Since the roll-out of novel vaccine platforms internationally, many of which have not previously been studied in patients with IBD, many questions regarding the safety and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in these patients have emerged. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview on the latest evidence in the management of COVID-19 and IBD, in particular the risk of and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD, impact of IBD medications on risk of COVID-19 outcomes, whether COVID-19 impacts IBD disease activity, and new data and guidance on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with IBD, to inform current clinical practice and future research directions.

### COVID-19 vaccination in adults with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Rp6U7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Providers and patients should be aware that there is not a greater risk of COVID-19 in patients with IBD, and most patients are not at increased risk of severe disease. Vaccination remains important however as, similar to the general population, severe disease is more common in the unvaccinated, as well as, in those treated with systemic corticosteroids. Thus, efforts should be made to taper corticosteroids as much as possible, but there is otherwise no reason to change effective non-steroid IBD therapies. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and extremely effective, including in patients on immunosuppression. Gastroenterology providers should take an active role in ensuring their patients with IBD are vaccinated against COVID-19.

### Systematic review on inflammatory bowel disease patients with coronavirus disease 2019: It is time to take stock [^1138tAEA]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Data on the clinical characteristics of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19.

Results

Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes.

Conclusions

Diarrhea occurs more frequently in IBD patients with COVID-19 than in the non-IBD population. Further studies are needed to define the optimal diagnostic-therapeutic approach in IBD patients with COVID-19.

### Recent advances in clinical practice: management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112PaPdi]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) did not have an increased risk of COVID-19, and had largely similar outcomes, including hospitalisation, intensive care admission and mortality, compared with the general population.
Risk factors for adverse outcomes to COVID-19 in patients with IBD include advanced age, increasing number of comorbidities, corticosteroid use and increased IBD activity.
Biological-treated patients with IBD who do not have COVID-19 should continue with their pre-pandemic IBD therapies and not be switched electively.
There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of de novo, or delayed, IBD diagnoses, however, an overall decrease in endoscopy procedures during the pandemic has led to a rise in the number of missed endoscopic-detected cancers.
Patients with IBD should be encouraged to receive a complete course of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, at any point during their treatment cycle, and be counselled that vaccine response may be attenuated when receiving systemic corticosteroids, antitumour necrosis factor monotherapy or combination therapy, and Janus kinase inhibitors.
More intensive immunisation strategies may be required for patients receiving multiple immunosuppressive medications, however, data reporting vaccine response following multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses are awaited and will inform future policy recommendations.

### COVID-19 vaccination in adults with inflammatory bowel disease [^113C6WNf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the general population, and most are not at increased risk for severe disease. COVID-19 is nonetheless common, and vaccination is critical. Four safe and efficacious vaccines are now available for the prevention of COVID-19, with most data available for mRNA vaccines. Patients with IBD have a robust humoral response to vaccination with rates of seroconversion exceeding 95% following a two-dose mRNA vaccine series and 99% following a three-dose mRNA series, although those on certain therapies including anti-tumor necrosis factor α agents may have lower antibody concentrations and waning of antibodies over time. Additionally, rates of cell-mediated immune response, even in those patients with IBD who did not have evidence of humoral immunity, are high. Vaccines are safe and have not been associated with flares in disease activity. Gastroenterology providers should take an active role in ensuring patients with IBD are appropriately vaccinated against COVID-19.

### COVID-19 is not associated with worse long-term inflammatory bowel disease outcomes: a multicenter case-control study [^114y2iLf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not associated with worse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. However, data are lacking regarding the long-term impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on the disease course of IBD.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on long-term outcomes of IBD.

Design

We performed a multicenter case-control study of patients with IBD and COVID-19 between February 2020 and December 2020.

Methods

Cases and controls were individuals with IBD with presence or absence, respectively, of COVID-19-related symptoms and confirmatory testing. The primary composite outcome was IBD-related hospitalization or surgery.

Results

We identified 251 cases [ulcerative colitis (n = 111, 45%), Crohn's disease (n = 139, 55%)] and 251 controls, with a median follow-up of 394days. The primary composite outcome of IBD-related hospitalization or surgery occurred in 29 (12%) cases versus 38 (15%) controls (p = 0.24) and on multivariate Cox regression, COVID-19 was not associated with increased risk of adverse IBD outcomes [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44–1.42]. When stratified by infection severity, severe COVID-19 was associated with a numerically increased risk of adverse IBD outcomes (aHR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.00–5.86), whereas mild-to-moderate COVID-19 was not (aHR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.38–1.23).

Conclusion

In this case-control study, COVID-19 did not have a long-term impact on the disease course of IBD. However, severe COVID-19 was numerically associated with worse IBD outcomes, underscoring the continued importance of risk mitigation and prevention strategies for patients with IBD during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

### Ambulatory care management of 69 patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis in comparison to 695 inpatients: insights from a multicentre UK cohort study [^1111qSWZ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing and remitting disease whose aetiology is thought to involve an intricate interplay between host genetics, environment, gut microbiome and immune system. Approximately 15%–30% of UC patients require admission with acute severe UC (ASUC) in their lifetime; for 10%–15% this is the first manifestation of their disease. ASUC is a medical emergency and associated with a mortality of approximately 1%. Traditionally, patients are admitted to hospital to facilitate endoscopic assessment, exclude concomitant infective complications, monitor response to first-line corticosteroid treatment and determine the need for and timing of rescue therapy and/or colectomy. Patients with ASUC can deteriorate rapidly and hence require close monitoring of vital signs with correlation to clinical, biochemical and radiological investigations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed considerable strain on UK inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) services, necessitating the adoption of measures to facilitate the safe administration of drug infusions, deliver outpatient consultations and avoid nosocomial infections. Ambulatory care pathways, which use outpatient monitoring and drug delivery, have been shown to deliver safe and effective treatment for conditions which have historically mandated hospitalisation, for example, pulmonary embolus. To date, there are a paucity of data regarding the use of ambulatory pathways in ASUC cohorts.

PROTECT-ASUC (Assessment, endoscopy and treatment in patients with ASUC during the COVID-19 pandemic) is a multicentre UK observational study comparing ASUC treatment strategies in patients from a pre-COVID-19 pandemic period with those from the COVID-19 era. It is one of the largest series of ASUC patients ever collected and has relevance to the contemporary management of UC beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. We previously reported an increase in the use of ambulatory ASUC pathways in COVID-19 era as compared with the historic pre-COVID-19 period, although notably several UK centres had already adopted such practices prior to the pandemic. We sought to use data from this study to report the extent, safety and effectiveness of ASUC treatment among patients receiving care in ambulatory and traditional inpatient settings.

TNF-α antagonists

TNF-α antagonists are known to convey an increased risk of serious respiratory viral infections, which further increases when combined with other immunosuppressive agents, especially corticosteroids. However, it is uncertain what the potential risks or benefits are of TNF-α antagonists in developing severe COVID-19 in patients with UC. Currently, there is no evidence for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD. A report from the SECURE-IBD registry indicated that monotherapy with TNF-α antagonists does not appear to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and it may even have a protective effect against severe COVID-19. A recent study demonstrated increased serum TNF-α levels in patients with severe COVID-19, which may partially occur through increased ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 expression in the inflamed intestinal epithelium. In contrast, however, TNF-α antagonist therapy has also been associated with restoration of intestinal ACE2 levels, particularly in TNF-α antagonist responders, suggesting a potential modulatory role of TNF-α antagonists in patients with IBD and concurrent COVID-19. In this way, TNF-blockade could foster ACE2 activity and thereby contribute to the resolution of inflammation associated with active IBD, as well as the exaggerated inflammatory response as is observed in some patients with COVID-19.

Vedolizumab

Long-term follow-up studies of patients with IBD receiving vedolizumab treatment have demonstrated that there is no increased risk of severe respiratory viral infections or severe (opportunistic) infections in general. – In this respect, the use of vedolizumab in active IBD seems to be relatively safe. Previously, it has been demonstrated that COVID-19 is associated with endotheliitis in various organs, including the GI tract. It is suggested that direct infection of intestinal endothelium, resulting in endothelial dysfunction and perivascular inflammation, may culminate in intestinal microvascular pathology. Vedolizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody targeting α4β7-integrin, blocks leukocyte trafficking to the intestinal mucosa, and may limit transendothelial passage of immune cells in the context of endothelial dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. However, the administration of vedolizumab is usually performed in cases with more subacute manifestations of active UC or as a next treatment step after successful rescue therapy of acute severe UC.

Severe COVID-19

In patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, the priority should be given to the treatment of the COVID-19. In patients presenting with severe COVID-19 along with severe IBD flare-up, the management becomes challenging. Severe IBD, such as acute severe UC (ASUC), is typically managed with high-dose parenteral corticosteroids. If these patients fail to respond adequately, then they are treated with rescue therapy, such as infliximab, along with steroids. According to the RAND appropriateness panel on the management of ASUC in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, there was uncertainty among the panel regarding the first-line therapy. However, among all the suggested treatments, intravenous steroids were given the highest score by the panel. At that time, the results from the RECOVERY trial were not available. In the RECOVERY trial, the dexamethasone group had a lower mortality rate compared with the usual care group in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio 0.64, 95%CI 0.51–0.81) and among those on supplemental oxygen (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio 0.82, 95%CI 0.72–0.94). The dose of dexamethasone used in the RECOVERY trial was 6 mg q.d. for 10 days. The usual intravenous steroids used in ASUC include methylprednisolone (20 mg t.i.d.) or hydrocortisone (100 mg t.i.d.). Dexamethasone at a 6 mg dose is equivalent to 32 mg of methylprednisolone or 160 mg of hydrocortisone. In addition, dexamethasone is long-acting (26–72 h), whereas methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone last for 8–12 h. Finally, if the patient fails to improve despite rescue therapy or develops complications, then surgical intervention should be undertaken. It was deemed inappropriate to delay surgery, even in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Optimal inflammatory bowel disease management during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic [^115nKGF8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to summarize the current evidence regarding the risks and implications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and discuss optimal management of IBD during this pandemic.

Recent Findings

Patients with IBD are not at increased risk of COVID-19 but several risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) have been identified, such as active IBD, obesity, and corticosteroid use. COVID-19 outcomes are similar among patients with IBD and the overall population. Although biologics have not been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, several risk factors have been associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD, including older age, obesity, the presence of comorbidities, active disease, and corticosteroid use. IBD therapy should, therefore, be continued with the aim of attaining or maintaining remission, except for corticosteroids, which should be held or reduced to the minimal effective dose. Although it has been recommended that immunosuppressive therapy be held during a case of COVID-19, the half-lives of these drugs and data on the timing of restarting therapy limit the strength of these recommendations. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination for IBD patients whenever available, as benefits to the individual and to society outweigh the risks.

Summary

As our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are learning more about its impact in patients with IBD and how to better manage patients in this setting. Managing IBD during this pandemic has also highlighted the importance of restructuring services in order to adapt to current and potential future outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed IBD care through the expansion of telemedicine and development of novel approaches to remote monitoring.

### Recent advances in clinical practice: management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1129Mwg3]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised considerable concerns that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those treated with immunosuppressive therapies, may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, develop worse outcomes following COVID-19, and have suboptimal vaccine response compared with the general population. In this review, we summarise data on the risk of COVID-19 and associated outcomes, and latest guidance on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with IBD. Emerging evidence suggests that commonly used medications for IBD, such as corticosteroids but not biologicals, were associated with adverse outcomes to COVID-19. There has been no increased risk of de novo, or delayed, IBD diagnoses, however, an overall decrease in endoscopy procedures has led to a rise in the number of missed endoscopic-detected cancers during the pandemic. The impact of IBD medication on vaccine response has been a research priority recently. Data suggest that patients with IBD treated with antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications had attenuated humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and more rapid antibody decay, compared with non-anti-TNF-treated patients. Reassuringly, rates of breakthrough infections and hospitalisations in all patients who received vaccines, irrespective of IBD treatment, remained low. International guidelines recommend that all patients with IBD treated with immunosuppressive therapies should receive, at any point during their treatment cycle, three primary doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with a further booster dose as soon as possible. Future research should focus on our understanding of the rate of antibody decay in biological-treated patients, which patients require additional doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the long-term risks of COVID-19 on IBD disease course and activity, and the potential risk of long COVID-19 in patients with IBD.

### Immunogenicity and safety of a three-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases on immunosuppressive therapy [^113nUL8c]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Efficient vaccines against COVID-19, as seen in the general population, are pivotal in the management of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The degree of protection against COVID-19 correlates with the humoral vaccine response assessed by anti-Spike antibody levels, and patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) on immunosuppressive therapies have demonstrated an impaired humoral response after standard two-dose vaccination. Concerns have thus been raised regarding how to optimise the protection from severe COVID-19 disease in vulnerable patients.

IMIDs comprises several prevalent chronic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Although this is a heterogeneous group, these diseases have similar disease features and are treated with many of the same immunosuppressive medications such as tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), non-TNFi biologics, metabolite inhibitors and targeted small molecule drugs. Due to a dysregulated immune system, use of immunosuppressive therapies and increased frequency of several comorbidities, these patients are vulnerable to severe outcomes of infectious diseases as well as adverse events (AEs) to vaccines including the risk of disease flare.

Neutralising antibodies can efficiently block viral entry into host cells. Exact cut-offs have not been established, but high antibody levels are needed for efficient prevention of symptomatic disease. Protection against novel virus strains probably requires higher levels. It has become clear that the vaccine response is highly attenuated over time, with declining anti-Spike antibody levels corresponding to a reduction in protection against symptomatic disease. Thus, a need for additional vaccine doses to reactivate antibody production and keep this population protected has been argued.

Two-dose primary vaccination with an additional booster dose administrated after some months is at present the most common vaccination strategy, but many countries recommend a three-dose primary vaccination regimen for immunocompromised patients. It is still not clear whether repeated vaccine delivery sufficiently can augment immunity in patients with an impaired humoral response, or whether the vaccine type plays a role. The efficacy and safety of repeated vaccinations in this large patient group remains largely unknown.

The main aim of this study was to assess whether repeated vaccination by a three-dose primary vaccination strategy could raise serological responses in patients with IMIDs on immunosuppressive therapy, and also to assess the safety of repeated vaccination in relation to potential increases in disease flares and AEs. To this end, we compared the three-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy in patients with IMID on immunosuppressive therapy with standard two-dose vaccination of healthy controls.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^115yijh8]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Of concern to most clinicians caring for patients with IBD is the possible risk of the drugs used to manage ASUC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Intravenous corticosteroids remain the most widely used induction therapy in ASUC, but it is uncertain how they may influence outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Corticosteroids are known to increase the risk of sepsis and respiratory tract infections and may also increase viral replication and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. There is also evidence that steroids may increase morbidity and/or mortality from some respiratory viruses such as influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome and SARS-CoV, although steroids have an established role in the management of ARDS. Beyond corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as thiopurines, biologics and tofacitinib are frequently used at various stages of the management of ASUC and there is also a lack of data regarding their safety in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Finally, it is important to consider the possible effects of drugs used to manage COVID-19 on IBD. For example, interleukin 6 inhibitors are being tested in patients with COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04315298) but have been associated with intestinal perforation in IBD.

We used an established methodology, a RAND appropriateness panel, to produce guidance in this challenging clinical area. Regarding initial management, there was agreement that all patients with ASUC should be managed as inpatients. Ambulatory care was considered inappropriate, since patients with ASUC need regular monitoring and involvement of a multidisciplinary team, this type of complex care being difficult to deliver in the outpatient setting. While there was some support for ambulatory management to avoid patients being admitted, thereby decreasing the risk of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, the risks of managing ASUC as an outpatient were considered to outweigh this possible benefit. Furthermore, in scenarios in which patients had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, no such benefit existed. Nevertheless, in view of the acknowledged risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital, it is perhaps unsurprising that the panel considered it appropriate to isolate patients with ASUC in a side room wherever possible.

Management of IBD during COVID-19 pandemic

International and national guidelines on management of patients with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic closely aligned with pre-pandemic practice recommendations, in particular with respect to minimisation of systemic corticosteroid use. Although they have largely been based on expert opinion, clinical recommendations have been regularly updated as new data emerged. As new data accumulated during the multiple COVID-19 waves worldwide, the belief that patients with IBD may be adversely affected by COVID-19, and conversely, that COVID-19 may worsen IBD-related disease activity, has largely abated. A summary of lessons learnt from the conduct of research studies and guideline development during the COVID-19 pandemic is outlined in Box 1.

Box 1
Lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic

Patients with a known diagnosis of IBD

Most international groups recommended that patients with an established diagnosis of IBD should remain on their pre-pandemic IBD therapy that was successful in inducing and maintaining remission. Patients with a new diagnosis of IBD, or who have an established diagnosis and are experiencing a flare of symptoms, should be managed according to pre-pandemic standard of care. These measures include continuation of immunomodulators, biologicals, JAKi and with a consideration to reduce the use corticosteroid therapy where possible and commencement of newly-initiated subcutaneous therapy to minimise hospital visits.

At the beginning of the pandemic, patients and healthcare providers raised concerns related to risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection when attending hospital for maintenance biological therapy and the impact of attendance on healthcare resources. Switching between biologicals, for example, from intravenous infliximab to subcutaneous adalimumab was not recommended by most guidelines targeting patients with IBDunlike those targeting patients with rheumatological conditions. This is, in part, because recapture of disease remission with a second biological agent, following established remission with a first biological agent, is less durable and more likely to be associated with development of anti-drug antibodies thereby limiting future therapeutic options in IBD. In some jurisdictions, there have been successful pandemic-related programmes reporting elective switching between alternative delivery routes of the same molecule, specifically from intravenous infliximab to subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13) in patients with IBD.

### The complex relationship between viruses and inflammatory bowel disease-review and practical advices for the daily clinical decision-making during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^112wkqN4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study focuses on the treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), considering the above-mentioned issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also review the current knowledge on the relationship between viral infections and IBD.

It is well known that genetic, environmental and immunological factors also contribute to the development of IBD. In the case of Crohn's disease (CD), it has been hypothesised that viral infections may trigger an unbalanced immune response.

Viral pandemics with different mortality rates have long been a part of human history (Table 1), but almost no information is available on their association with IBD. Looking at these pandemics through the lens of a gastroenterologist, each can cause gastrointestinal (GI) complaints with predominantly atypical abdominal symptoms.

Table 1.
Deadliest epidemics ever recorded.

In the current situation, it is necessary to be aware of the nature and mortality potential of the Coronaviridae. This family features enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses classified into four genera. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are the members of the β genus, which, together with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are the human-infecting species causing respiratory and GI symptoms, (Table 2). An outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in 2012. The mortality rate was 2.5–7.5%, and GI symptoms were present in approximately 25% of the patients. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea were most commonly observed and, in some patients, GI symptoms developed even prior to respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing and pneumonia). Furthermore, measurable faecal levels of viral RNA were present in 14.6% of the examined stool samples.

Therefore, the prescribed use of immunomodulatory therapy, as well as the altered use of medication during an episode of COVID-19, rather than the disease itself, may be the primary contributor to poor outcomes following COVID-19. It is important to understand how the disease and disease therapy may impact responses to COVID-19 vaccination or underlying disease flaring in this population to better guide vaccination schedules.

### Preliminary considerations regarding the risk of COVID-19 and disease severity in chronic gastrointestinal conditions [^111SVsmE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Chronic gastrointestinal comorbidities in COVID-19 patients

As far as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is concerned, there are no data to suggest a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a higher severity of related diseases in these patients, compared to the general population. To date, only one of the IBD patients in the 7 largest IBD referral centers of China has tested positive for COVID-19. Current data from the SECURE IBD database show that worldwide barely 700 cases of around 2,400,000 identified COVID-19 patients had underlying IBD.

Notably, in vitro studies suggest that a soluble form of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, over-expressed in both inflamed intestine and blood of IBD patients, may be a competitive ligand for SARS-CoV-2, reducing full-length virus binding to cell surface and possibly limiting infection spread in these subjects. However, a fatal case of COVID-19 pneumonia has recently been reported in an 80-year-old Italian female patient, admitted during recovery from left-side ulcerative colitis reactivation treated with systemic steroid therapy. World Health Organization recommendations discourage steroid use in COVID-19, because of the risk of viral spreading, but rapid steroid tapering or discontinuation is notoriously dangerous in IBD patients with active, severe disease. Therefore, in the absence of clear SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms, it is reasonable to maintain the scheduled steroid treatment until its ending.

With regard to pediatric IBD patients, only 8 children have had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection and no need for hospitalization, despite therapy with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea, but in 79 pediatric patients biological treatment was preventively delayed, and 17 (22%) of them showed IBD reactivation. At present, there is no evidence that would justify stopping biological and immunosuppressive treatments in epidemic areas, taking into account the high risk of IBD reactivation and hospitalization, especially in a pediatric setting. However, starting a new treatment with these drugs is not recommended in epidemic areas. Based on these considerations, accurate surveillance is required in IBD patients receiving steroid, immunosuppressive or biological therapy, including strict social isolation. As suggested by Chinese and European IBD associations, patients need to be remotely managed with telephone contacts and minimal access to the hospital structure, whenever possible.

### Is vaccination against COVID-19 associated with inflammatory bowel disease flare? Self-controlled case series analysis using the UK CPRD [^114gyMnj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To investigate the association between vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare.

Methods

Patients with IBD vaccinated against COVID-19 who consulted for disease flare between December 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, were ascertained from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. IBD flares were identified using consultation and corticosteroid prescription records. Vaccinations were identified using product codes and vaccination dates. The study period was partitioned into vaccine-exposed (vaccination date and 21 days immediately after), prevaccination (7 days immediately before vaccination), and the remaining vaccine-unexposed periods. Participants contributed data with multiple vaccinations and IBD flares. Season-adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using self-controlled case series analysis.

Results

Data for 1911 cases with IBD were included; 52% of them were female, and their mean age was 49 years. Approximately 63% of participants had ulcerative colitis (UC). COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with increased IBD flares in the vaccine-exposed period when all vaccinations were considered (aIRR [95% CI] 0.89 [0.77–1.02], 0.79 [0.66–0.95], and 1.00 [0.79–1.27] in IBD overall, UC, and Crohn's disease, respectively). Analyses stratified to include only first, second, or third COVID-19 vaccinations found no significant association between vaccination and IBD flares in the vaccine-exposed period (aIRR [95% CI] 0.87 [0.71–1.06], 0.93 [0.75–1.15], and 0.86 [0.63–1.17], respectively). Similarly, stratification by COVID-19 before vaccination and by vaccination with vectored DNA or messenger RNA vaccine did not reveal an increased risk of flare in any of these subgroups.

Discussion

Vaccination against COVID-19 was not associated with IBD flares regardless of prior COVID-19 infection and whether messenger RNA or DNA vaccines were used.

### COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease crosstalk: from emerging association to clinical proposal [^115ZdrMo]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory inflammation that has emerged worldwide since December 2019, and it quickly became a global epidemic. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory diseases whose etiology has not been elucidated. The two have many overlapping symptoms in clinical presentation, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, pneumonia, etc. Imbalance of the autoimmune system in IBD patients and long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs may increase the risk of infection; and systemic symptoms caused by COVID-19 may also induce or exacerbate intestinal inflammation. It has been found that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is highly expressed in the lung and intestine, is an inflammatory protective factor, and is downregulated and upregulated in COVID-19 and IBD, respectively, suggesting that there may be a coregulatory pathway. In addition, the immune activation pattern of COVID-19 and the cytokine storm in the inflammatory response have similar roles in IBD, indicating that the two diseases may influence each other. Therefore, this review aimed to address the following research questions: whether SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the progression of IBD; whether IBD increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and poor prognosis; possible common mechanisms and genetic cross-linking between the two diseases; new treatment and care strategies for IBD patients, and the feasibility and risk of vaccination in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^114gktdB]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

First-line therapy

It was considered appropriate to follow the BSG guidelines on the initial management of ASUC in patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 swab results. Only in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was there uncertainty among the panel regarding the appropriateness of conventional therapy with intravenous corticosteroids, largely driven by concerns of possible harm. However, it should be noted that in this challenging condition in which there is scant experience and almost no published data in relation to COVID-19, of all suggested treatments, intravenous corticosteroids were given the highest median score by the panel. Regarding the ongoing uncertainty about the benefits or harms of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the inconclusive data emerging from the current coronavirus pandemic, the results of the adaptive trial, RECOVERY, which includes a dexamethasone arm, are eagerly awaited. Nevertheless, leaving ASUC untreated is associated with a high risk of death, mortality being at least 24% in the days before the use of corticosteroids. The expert advisers supported the WHO position that steroid use should not be avoided because of theoretical risks in patients with COVID-19.

The panel was uncertain whether infliximab, without concurrent corticosteroids, should be used as a first-line therapy in patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive, regardless of whether they had COVID-19. As with corticosteroids, the risk of anti-TNF in the context of the pandemic is unknown. In addition, there is no high-quality evidence for infliximab in ASUC other than as a rescue therapy following corticosteroid failure. Anti-TNF agents are known to increase the risk of respiratory tract and other opportunistic infections, particularly when used in association with thiopurines and corticosteroids. However, anti-TNF therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trialsas a potential treatment for COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. In view of the uncertainty of the effects of corticosteroids and infliximab on SARS-CoV-2 infection, it was considered appropriate that all patients with a positive swab should be discussed with a COVID-19 specialist to guide decision-making.

### Inflammatory bowel disease amid the COVID-19 pandemic: impact, management strategies, and lessons learned [^112JvXD5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors

Tofacitinib is an FDA-approved JAK inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC in patients who are refractory to biologic agents. JAK inhibitors are smaller sized molecules, with a rapid onset of action, that cause immunosuppression by blocking multiple pathways of inflammation to control the inflammation of the intestines. In a New York-based study on COVID-19 patients receiving JAK inhibitors for underlying inflammatory disorders, there was no increase in the rate of hospitalizations. However, it is important to consider the higher risk of blood clots in patients on tofacitinib treatment, since COVID-19 infection is strongly associated with hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism in up to one third of patients with severe infection. Interestingly, another JAK inhibitor, baricitinib, is being explored as a potential medication in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection through its inhibitory action on Numb-associated kinase (NAK), involved in the endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2. Tofacitinib does not inhibit NAK.

Cyclosporine

Cyclosporine A is used in severe steroid-refractory UC patients. It is a polypeptide that suppresses T cell by inhibiting transcription of genes encoding IL-2. The primary molecular target of cyclosporine is a cytosolic binding protein called cyclophilin, also required by many viruses for replication, including the coronaviruses. It has been speculated that patients on cyclosporine treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic may experience a beneficial effect. So far, no study has reported any benefits or risks of cyclosporine with COVID-19.

Therapy specific considerations

Given the paucity of data regarding the effects of IBD medications on the course of COVID-19, contributing confirmed cases to the international registry (SECURE-IBD,) is encouraged.

Corticosteroids Should be avoided if possible but will still be necessary for some who should then observe 'shielding' while prednisolone dose is ≥ 20 mg daily. High dose steroids are an established risk factor for respiratory tract infection and opportunistic infection in IBD and septicaemia. Rapid tapering (10 mg/week) should be considered where possible. This must be balanced against the risks of extending steroid exposure overall by decreasing dose too quickly. Should not be stopped suddenly without advice. Consider using budesonide MMX (9 mg/day 8 weeks) or beclometasone (5 mg/day 4 weeks) for patients with flaring UC (important to assess after 2 weeks). Consider using exclusive enteral nutrition for patients with flaring CD. Consider budesonide (Entocort, Budenofalk, 9 mg/day 8 weeks) for active small bowel and ileo-caecal CD.
Immunomodulators (azathioprine, mercaptopurine, tioguanine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Initiation of monotherapy may not be appropriate. Combination therapy with biologics should be made on careful discussion of risk and benefit on a case by case basis. Older patients (> 60 years) or those with significant comorbidity who are in sustained remission on thiopurines may wish to consider stopping after appropriate discussion with their IBD team.
Anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Consider initiation with monotherapy (therefore consider adalimumab to promote home care and lower risk of immunogenicity relative to infliximab). Use early therapeutic drug monitoring where possible, highlighting those appropriate for later combination immunosuppression where necessary. Enforced intravenous to subcutaneous switching is not recommended.
Anti-interleukin-12/23p40 therapy (ustekinumab) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. One advantage of ustekinumab is a one off intravenous induction dose followed by subcutaneous maintenance dosing (minimal impact on infusion suite).
Anti-α4β7 integrin therapy (vedolizumab) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Unlikely to increase the risk of COVID-19 complications, although caution should be exercised in applying existing trial data to COVID-19.
Janus kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection.
5-Aminosalicylic acid derivatives (mesalazine) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In UC patients with uncontrolled symptoms, oral 5-aminosalicylic acid dose should be optimised with or without the addition of topical (rectal) 5-aminosalicylic acid.

### Induction of remission with tacrolimus in a patient with severe acute, cortisone refractory ulcerative colitis and severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a case report [^115L3mkd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the important role of the cytokine TNF-α in the pathogenesis of IBD on the one hand and in the inflammatory phase of Covid-19 pneumonia on the other hand has to be considered. Recently published studies suggested that monotherapy with TNF-α antagonists could have a protective effect against severe Covid-19 infection. In analogy to an already published case report discussing treatment with anti-TNF-α in a patient suffering from active ulcerative colitis and simultaneous Covid-19, the activity of both diseases could be suppressed sustainably in the here presented case of a 68-year-old male patient. Two weeks after infliximab was first administered, the SARS-CoV-2 virus could no longer be detected in the nasopharyngeal swab.

To further examine the optimal treatment, more data from more cases still need to be collected. It is yet too early to derive reliable evidence from it. Over time and with a larger patient collective, it will become clearer whether immunosuppressive therapy in IBD patients is more of a "blessing" or a "curse" concerning the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there are reasons to assume that immunomodulatory treatment could be justifiable for mild to moderate and even severe Covid-19 disease.

In the case discussed above, it can be concluded that the patient had a good benefit regarding his ulcerative colitis and no aggravation of his Covid-19 infection. Therefore, short-term tacrolimus therapy under controlled conditions could represent an alternative therapeutic regimen for patients with severe acute flare of cortisone refractory ulcerative colitis and simultaneous Covid-19 pneumonia.

### Induction of remission with tacrolimus in a patient with severe acute, cortisone refractory ulcerative colitis and severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a case report [^113gQyLi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Therapy regimens used in patients with inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have been associated with enhanced risk of viral infections or viral reactivation. Moreover, it is uncertain whether IBD patients have increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or infected patients may have an increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Managing severe acute flare in ulcerative colitis during the Covid-19 pandemic is a challenge for clinicians and their patients. The results of the published studies mainly report on the role of the prior medication, but not how to treat severe acute flare of IBD patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia.

Case Presentation

We report the case of a 68-year-old patient with a long history of ulcerative colitis. He was initially admitted to an external hospital because of severe acute flare. The initiation of a high-dose oral cortisone therapy did not improve the clinical symptoms. During the inpatient treatment, he was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. At admission to our hospital the patient showed severe flare of his ulcerative colitis and increased Covid-19 symptoms. A cortisone-refractory course was noticed. After detailed multidisciplinary risk-benefit assessment, we initiated an intravenous tacrolimus therapy and dose of prednisolone was tapered gradually. After clinical response, the therapy was adjusted to infliximab. Additionally, the Covid-19 pneumonia was kept under control despite immunosuppression and the patient could be discharged in clinical remission.

Conclusions

This case suggest the use of tacrolimus as a bridging therapeutic option for severe acute, cortisone refractory ulcerative colitis in Covid-19 patients. Nevertheless, the best treatment strategy for IBD patients presenting a flare during the outbreak has yet to be defined. Further data for IBD patients under calcineurin inhibitor therapy are urgently needed.

IBD

IBD, consisting mainly of two conditions, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, complex, and costly immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Although most IBD patients are diagnosed in early adulthood, it is estimated that some 15% of all patients are diagnosed during childhood. The global incidence of childhood-onset IBD has increased significantly over the past few decades, with the highest IBD risks reported in Northern Europe and Canada. While genetic susceptibility plays a role in IBD, this rapid rise of childhood-onset IBD also suggests an important role of early environmental elements, where one candidate risk factor for IBD is infections. – Moreover, a significant risk of disease- and treatment-associated infectious complications has also been observed in the modern immunomodulatory IBD treatment era.

IBD and risk of COVID-19

Children and adults with IBD have an increased risk of serious infections. Opportunistic, skin, and GI infections are among those that may pose problems for patients with IBD. There are numerous factors contributing to the infection susceptibility of IBD. First, vast immunological and genetic data have linked IBD development to an aberrant immune response (including the innate and adaptive immune systems), which alterations may also predispose to infections. Second, IBD-related bowel surgery and medical therapies for IBD, which suppress the immune system, are risk factors for severe infections. The highest risks of serious infections have been observed in IBD patients exposed to combinations of immunomodulatory drugs, especially those including corticosteroids.

Early in the pandemic, concerns of an increased risk of COVID-19 and a more severe disease course in patients with IBD were raised. Part of that concern related to the immunosuppressive effect of many IBD-related drugs, but was also grounded in the fact that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells via the ACE2 receptor, expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells of the GI tract, and up-regulated during inflammation. Hence, longitudinal studies have examined whether IBD patients are at risk of COVID-19 or severe COVID-19.

### Induction of remission with tacrolimus in a patient with severe acute, cortisone refractory ulcerative colitis and severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a case report [^114dQvv5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with severe acute ulcerative colitis suffer of diarrhea with bloody stools (≥ 6 per day) and markers of systemic toxicity as defined by the Truelove and Witts criteria. These patients require admission to hospital for their acute severe flare. Before the coronavirus disease of 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic severe acute ulcerative colitis was associated with a mortality rate of 1.0–2.9%.

During the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic results of small cohort studies suggested that disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients might be a predictor for adverse Covid-19 outcomes. Regarding nosocomial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, especially in those thought to be vulnerable to severe Covid-19 outcomes, physicians might have used a higher clinical threshold to determine which patients required emergency hospital admission. Moreover, early endoscopic assessment may have been affected by uncertainty and delays regarding preendoscopic viral screening, staffing shortages, endoscopic capacity and availability of personal protective equipment.

Inconsistent study results regarding the effect of high-dose steroids in SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 required conventional steroid treatment dosing strategies. Data are emerging for discussion and decision concerning the risk to benefit ratio of drugs used as rescue therapy, i.e. infliximab, ciclosporin A or tacrolimus.

The impact of possible changes to conventional treatment options for acute severe ulcerative colitis outcome are currently unknown. Several of the current recommendations relating to IBD care during the Covid-19 pandemic, including acute severe ulcerative colitis, are only based on expert consensus supported by rare published data. Normally, the treatment of choice in patients with severe acute flare of ulcerative colitis is administration of an intravenous corticosteroid. In the case of corticosteroid refractory course a switch in the treatment regimen is needed, i.e. the application of infliximab or a calcineurin inhibitor and an approach for colectomy.

The growing number of Covid-19 infections is leading to an overlap with other diseases and can cause difficulties in finding therapies. Therefore, this case report describes the diagnosis and successful treatment with tacrolimus followed by infliximab of a patient with cortisone refractory severe acute ulcerative colitis and simultaneous symptomatic Covid-19 infection.

### Epidemiologic assessment of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease presentation in NYC during COVID-19 [^113TtkzR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis is thought to be induced by a mix of genetic susceptibility, microbial populations, and immune triggers such as infections. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-nCoV2) may have increased capacity to generate autoimmune disease as evidenced by known spikes in diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. Public health interventions like masking and closures additionally created remarkable drops in typical viral infections, with remarkable shifts in influenza-like illness reporting in 2020. This study aims to evaluate the impact of SARS-nCoV2 and associated interventions on pediatric IBD presentation in New York City using records of new diagnoses at a consortium of 4 institutions between 2016 and June 2022. We fit time series model (autoregressive integrated moving average model) to monthly and quarterly number of cases of each disease for January 2016-March 2020 and forecast the period between April 2020 and June 2022. We note no decrease in ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn disease (CD) in the aftermath of historic low levels of overall viral illness, and statistically significant increases in CD diagnoses and elevation in UC diagnoses creating a trend suggesting overall increase in IBD diagnoses exceeding the baseline rate of increase. These data suggest a possible linkage between SARS-nCoV2 infection rates and subsequent pediatric IBD presentation.

### Risk of common infections in people with inflammatory bowel disease in primary care: a population-based cohort study [^111gkwNd]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic inflammatory conditions collectively termed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both conditions can follow a relapsing-remitting course or be continuously active. The disease spectrum ranges from a quiescent state with few or no symptoms to potentially fatal disease. Medical intervention is often required over decades of disease and may include surgery. With the global burden of IBD rising, calls for improved treatment optionshave resulted in the development of several immunomodulatory and biologic therapies.

Current treatment strategies for many people with IBD focus on immunomodulation. Though frequently effective for disease control, such treatments increase infection risk, including common and atypical pathogens. Understanding the infection risk in a community-based population with IBD has been brought into sharp focus recently with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to protect vulnerable individuals led to recommendations from the British Society of Gastroenterology for people with IBD that was, in part, driven by medication use. However, decisions around which individuals required shielding were generally opinion based, largely due to the lack of data around the risks of common infections in people with IBD and their relationship with common comorbidities and medication use. It is notable that coding of comorbidity, the biggest risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, is more complete in primary than secondary care, and that medications and common infections are not systematically coded in secondary care, thus reinforcing the importance of studying infection risk in the primary care setting. Despite this, existing literature on infection rates in IBD has focused predominantly on secondary care populations. Although an increased risk of specific infections including herpes zoster and pneumonia has been observed in primary care, the total burden of common infection in individuals with IBD in primary care remains unknown. Similarly, while lymphopenia and neutropenia are known markers of infection risk in the general population, their utility as risk factors for common infections in people with IBD in the primary care setting has not previously been evaluated.

This study aimed to describe the risk of common infections, in a primary care population of individuals with UC and CD, compared with a matched control population. Risk factors for common infections in IBD, with a focus on comorbidity, medication, lymphopenia and neutropenia, were explored.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^111nSyb3]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Panellists rated the appropriateness of management options at five different time points during the course of admission for ASUC (admission, first-line therapy, rescue therapy, continued medical therapy and surgery) in the context of absence of, or varying severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They were asked to grade the appropriateness of specific interventions on a scale of 1–9 (where 1–3 is inappropriate, 4–6 is uncertain and 7–9 is appropriate). The responses were summarised and anonymised before being presented at a virtual meeting in May 2020 with the aim of allowing discussion which ensured a common understanding of the questions and which focused on areas of disagreement, without trying to force consensus. Also present at the meeting were non-voting specialists who provided expert opinion with regards to IBD surgery (PT, LH), rheumatology (JG), intensive care (MG), respiratory medicine (FC) and infectious diseases (AU). In practice, several specialities may provide expert opinion in COVID-19 management, including intensivists, respiratory physicians and infectious disease physicians. We, therefore, used the encompassing term 'COVID-19 specialist' to represent this group. Finally, the Chairs of the BSG IBD Section Committee (IA) and the BSG IBD CRG (CAL) were also present. The moderators (PMI, MAS) neither expressed opinions on management nor voted, but were experts both in RAND panels and in the management of IBD. After the meeting, a second online survey comprising 91 questions, which had been slightly modified from the initial questionnaire following discussion at the meeting, was circulated for completion.

### Immunogenicity and safety of standard and third-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy [^114d1j87]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic is a global health emergency. Vaccines are important in resolving this crisis, having been proven to be efficacious and safe in the general population. Vaccines, however, rely on a functional immune system. Patients with immune‐mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), including inflammatory joint and bowel diseases, have impaired immune systems due to treatment with immunosuppressive medications. There is a concern that immune responses to SARS–CoV‐2 vaccines are attenuated in this large patient population, which is also at risk of severe COVID‐19. Patients with IMIDs were prioritized for vaccination to mitigate their COVID‐19 risk, but because they were excluded from initial vaccine trials, there is a paucity of data on the efficacy and safety of SARS–CoV‐2 vaccines in this population, as well as concerns regarding the risk of disease flares.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are different IMIDs, but they share several key features and are treated with many of the same immunosuppressive medications, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), non‐TNFi biologics, metabolite inhibitors, and targeted small molecule drugs. It is important to identify which patients are at risk of a reduced vaccine response, due to either immunosuppression or underlying disease, yet it is still unclear whether the serologic response to vaccine among IMID patients should be monitored. In addition, no consensus currently exists on whether it would be beneficial to delay specific treatments in patients receiving vaccination. Observational studies of response to SARS–CoV‐2 vaccine among IMID patients have been published recently, but they have generally involved few patients within each medication group.

### Recent advances in clinical practice: management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112R7BgM]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Janus kinase inhibitor

Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) approved for the treatment of UC, has been associated with a higher risk of thrombosis and infections, and in particular, herpes zoster. Available data on its safety during COVID-19 have been limited. In a subgroup analysis of SECURE-IBD, which included only 37 tofacitinib-treated patients with IBD, tofacitinib use was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death when compared with other treatment regimens. No thrombotic events were reported. However, in a more recent community-based study from the United States of a larger number of patients with IMIDs including IBD, 31% of patients treated with JAKi had an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (RR 3.35) compared with patients treated with other biologics. Reassuringly, recent data showed that tofacitinib was associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation and death (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.76). Tofacitinib has also been shown to be an effective treatment to reduce the risk of death or respiratory failure from COVID-19.

### The complex relationship between viruses and inflammatory bowel disease-review and practical advices for the daily clinical decision-making during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^11162HSj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

With these relationships in mind, IBD patients should be regarded as a high-risk group in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, growing evidence suggests that IBD per se does not increase the risk of coronavirus infection – exemplified by responses coming from different questionnaire surveys, – though the first two publications on IBD patients during the pandemic did not report any patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, neither from China nor from Italy. On the basis of the most recent data (Spain, Italy and SECURE-IBD Registry), we may infer that diarrhoea occurs more frequently amongst SARS-CoV-2-infected IBD patients (21%) than in the general population. The predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia and mortality, however, remain the same as in the general population (i.e. age > 65 years, comorbidity), although the risk is further increased by active IBD and corticosteroid therapy. However, the role of corticosteroid therapy is controversial in the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion-IBD database, evidence of greater prevalence of milder COVID-19 cases was reported in patients treated with anti-TNF-α than in patients undergoing steroid treatments. As of 15 May 2020, 19% of patients treated with anti-TNF-α agents required hospitalisation and only a minority (3%) experienced unfavourable outcomes, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, or death. Conversely, 66% of patients taking oral or parenteral steroids needed hospitalisation, with 26% experiencing unfavourable outcomes. Further support to this theory comes from the results of the Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease study, which reported 60% reduction in mortality among patients receiving anti-TNF-α antibodies (although not statistically significant); however, corticosteroid use was associated with a trend toward statistical significance, with COVID-19-related pneumonia (p = 0.05) and death (p = 0.064). On the other hand, steroid use should be avoided, if possible, or rapid steroid tapering should be considered owing to the risk of respiratory or opportunistic infection that could complicate the course of COVID-19. Glucocorticoids presumably have various effects in the different phases of the cytokine storm; therefore, they can be recommended as an ultimate last resource if needed. However, in the early phase of the infection, steroids may aggravate the outcome of the disease – as seen in case of many other infections.

### AGA clinical practice update on noncolorectal cancer screening and vaccinations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^1137GeRC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) inactivated vaccine safety indicates that multiple studies have evaluated the safety of inactivated vaccines, including those with adjuvants such as recombinant herpes zoster, and have found they are safe and not associated with exacerbation of IBD activity; a meta-analysis found that postvaccination adverse events are mainly local or mild systemic and do not significantly differ from those seen in the general population; furthermore, inactivated messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 primary vaccine series or boosters have not been associated with disease flares or increased adverse events compared with the general population.

### Effect of inflammatory bowel disease and related medications on COVID-19 incidence, disease severity, and outcome: the Israeli experience [^116YQYX7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised concerns among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients fearing an increased risk of infection and poor outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 among IBD patients; its influence on disease severity and outcome; its relationship to medication use and how the pandemic affected IBD management.

Methods

An anonymous questionnaire was posted online to members of the Israel Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Foundation (November 2020-January 2021). The questionnaire addressed the course of IBD disease and COVID-19 infection over the past year.

Results

Total 2152 IBD patients completed the questionnaire. Of which 104 (4.8%) had been infected with COVID-19, significantly lower than the 'expected' infected cases among the Israeli population (P = 0.033). The median age of participants was 39years; 60.5% were female. Most patients (75.6%) had no comorbidities other than IBD. No correlation was found between IBD type or disease severity and COVID-19 infection. Most IBD patients reported mild COVID-19 disease, regardless of the type of IBD medications. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, elevated BMI and diabetes were independent risk factors for COVID-19 infection. IBD treatment methods including 5-aminosalicylic acid, smoking and hypertension were protective factors. In total 25.2% of COVID-19 patients discontinued their IBD treatment, compared to 8.5% of non-COVID-19-infected patients. IBD flares were significantly higher in those who discontinued treatment (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

IBD patients do not have an increased risk for COVID-19, regardless of IBD activity or treatment. Patients should be encouraged to continue effective IBD therapy, including biologics and steroids, to minimize active IBD.

### Long-term safety of mirikizumab in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis: an integrated 2-year safety analysis [^116tx5ck]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic immune-mediated disease requiring ongoing treatment to maintain remission. This report presents the 2-year safety outcomes of mirikizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 anti-interleukin-23p19 monoclonal antibody, in moderately to severely active UC from phase 3 studies LUCENT-1 (NCT03518086), LUCENT-2 (NCT03524092), and LUCENT-3 (NCT03519945).

Methods

Patients who underwent induction (LUCENT-1) and maintenance (LUCENT-2), and entered long-term maintenance (LUCENT-3) were assessed in 2 cohorts: induction responders and extended-induction responders. Both cohorts underwent up to 104 weeks of continuous treatment with mirikizumab. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed in these 2 cohorts and within subsets of patients aged 60 years or older and patients using corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or both at baseline.

Results

Safety was generally consistent across induction responders (N = 333) and extended-induction responders (N = 149) and across patient subsets. Nasopharyngitis, COVID-19, arthralgia, UC (worsening/reoccurrence of symptoms), and headache were the most common AEs. Serious AEs were reported in less than 10% of both cohorts. Infections (mostly mild), cerebrocardiovascular events, and malignancies occurred in 47.4% and 49.7%, 0.9% and 1.3%, and 0% and 3.4% of induction responders and extended-induction responders, respectively. Injection-site reactions (induction responders: 10.2% and extended-induction responders: 8.1%) declined over time. Safety profiles in patient subsets and in the whole population were similar, except for hypertension, which was more frequent in patients aged 60 years or older.

Discussion

The mirikizumab 2-year integrated safety profile in patients with moderately to severely active UC was consistent across subgroups and with previous findings, without new significant safety concerns.

Background

We aimed to characterize patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

We performed a case series of patients with IBD and confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 to assess rates of severe outcomes.

Results

We identified 83 patients with IBD with confirmed (54%) or highly suspected (46%) COVID-19. The overall hospitalization rate was 6%, generally comprising patients with active Crohn's disease or older men with comorbidities, and 1 patient expired.

Discussion

In this series of patients with IBD, severe outcomes of COVID-19 were rare and comparable to similarly aged individuals in the general population.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^112S8qR4]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel deemed it uncertain whether a CT chest should be performed in all patients on admission. While a CT chest is more sensitive than a chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting signs of early or limited infection, the COVID-19 specialists advised that a CXR would suffice in asymptomatic patients on admission. However, the Royal College of Radiologists has advised a low-dose CT chest should be performed in patients who are having a CT abdomen as part of the investigation of an abdominal emergency.

It was considered appropriate to involve a COVID-19 specialist in all scenarios in the presence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab, regardless of signs or symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. The panel was uncertain whether this was required in patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 swab who required rescue therapy. During the meeting, concern was expressed by some panellists about the possible effects of corticosteroids and rescue therapies on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pneumonia driving the need to seek clarification from COVID-19 experts and highlighting the need for further research.

### Impact of medical therapies for inflammatory bowel disease on the severity of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WAt4E]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

This study is the first to include summary data on individual biological therapies, anti-TNF combination therapy, and small molecule inhibitors. The current study summarises significantly increased available data overall and for individual medications. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis earlier in the pandemic, which included studies up to July 2020, also found that both 5-ASA and corticosteroids, but not immunomodulators, increased the risk of severe disease in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. With a larger sample size, our study found that corticosteroids were associated with ICU admission, but not mortality. Furthermore, the inclusion of more than 10 000 patients with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 gives more precise estimation of the risk of severe COVID-19 in this patient population. Our study limitations include the observational nature of included studies with risk of confounding and selection bias. Furthermore, the majority of patients included in our study were extracted from the SECURE-IBD database. Even though the validity of the data is reinforced by the physician-reported nature of this database, it is still subject to reporting bias, which may lead to documentation of the more severe cases that come to the attention of healthcare providers, while the milder cases may remain undiagnosed or underreported. In addition, patient-level data were lacking, and insufficient data existed for meta-regression analyses to adjust for confounding. Larger prospective studies are necessary to validate the findings of our study, to ascertain which risk factors play significant roles in causing severe COVID-19 outcomes, and to stratify patients by different factors, including age, disease activity, and socio-economic assessments of the patients.

### SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NH9GX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an attenuated serologic response to COVID-19 vaccination. It is unclear whether an impaired immune response in vaccinated IBD patients impacts the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and occurrence of severe COVID-19.

Objectives

To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection rates and the disease course of COVID-19 in vaccinated IBD patients.

Design

A systematic literature search and meta-analysis was performed.

Data Sources and Methods

The search was performed in Embase, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINAHIL. The articles were independently screened and selected by two reviewers. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled relative risk for breakthrough infections in vaccinated IBD patients and controls.

Results

A total of 16 studies were included, with study periods ranging from January 2020 to October 2021 and follow-up time from 3weeks to 6months. The breakthrough infection rates range from 0 to 37.4% in vaccinated IBD patients. The disease course of COVID-19 was generally mild, with low hospitalization and mortality rates (0–8.7% and 0–4.3%, respectively). Vaccinated IBD patients had a significantly lower relative risk of breakthrough infection rate compared to unvaccinated controls (risk ratio: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03–0.18). No difference was observed between IBD patients and non-IBD controls, and between partially and fully vaccinated IBD patients. The impact of immunosuppressive therapy on breakthrough infection rates differs between studies. Most studies showed no impact from immunosuppressive treatment, anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha or corticosteroids and other biologics; one study reported higher rates for patients treated with infliximab versus vedolizumab.

Conclusion

Vaccination is effective to prevent COVID-19 infections in patients with IBD. Breakthrough infections do occur, but the disease course is generally mild. Available data seem to suggest a declining trend of breakthrough infections during calendar time.

Registration

The protocol was published in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021292853).

Inflammatory bowel disease — influenza and other seasonal vaccinations (Best Practice Advice 8) advises that all adult patients with IBD should receive an annual inactivated influenza vaccine; patients receiving anti-TNF monotherapy or who have undergone a solid organ transplant recipients can benefit from an HD influenza vaccine; adults 65 years of age and older should receive an HD, recombinant, or adjuvanted influenza vaccine; and live attenuated intranasal vaccines should be avoided. In addition, annual seasonal vaccinations such as influenza or COVID-19 boosters should be offered to patients regardless of their treatment regimen, even if they are receiving high doses (HDs) of corticosteroids, and vaccines should be provided irrespective of the biologic dosing schedule.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: comparison between the first and second pandemic waves [^111zw7C7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In Italy, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection peaked in April and November 2020, defining two pandemic waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and SARS-CoV-2 infections between pandemic waves.

Methods

Observational longitudinal study of IBD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with established diagnoses of IBD and of SARS-CoV-2 infection were consecutively enrolled in two periods: (i) first wave, from 1 March 2020 to 31 May 2020; and (ii) second wave, from 15 September to 15 December 2020.

Results

We enrolled 937 IBD patients (219 in the first wave, 718 in the second wave). Patients of the first wave were older (mean ± SD: 46.3 ± 16.2 vs. 44.1 ± 15.4 years, p = 0.06), more likely to have ulcerative colitis (58.0% vs. 44.4%, p < 0.001) and comorbidities (48.9% vs. 38.9%; p < 0.01), and more frequently residing in Northern Italy (73.1% vs. 46.0%, p < 0.001) than patients of the second wave. There were no significant differences between pandemic waves in sex (male: 54.3% vs. 53.3%, p = 0.82) or frequency of active IBD (44.3% vs. 39.0%, p = 0.18). The rates of negative outcomes were significantly higher in the first than second wave: pneumonia (27.8% vs. 11.7%, p < 0.001), hospital admission (27.4% vs. 9.7%, p < 0.001), ventilatory support (11.9% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.003) and death (5.5% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.007).

Conclusion

Between the first and second SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves, demographic, clinical and geographical features of IBD patients were different as were the symptoms and outcomes of infection. These differences are likely due to the different epidemiological situations and diagnostic possibilities between the two waves.

### Long-term effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccination among patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^116ZTV7x]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

COVID-19 vaccination prevents severe disease in most patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but immunosuppressive medications can blunt serologic response. We followed adults with IBD for > 1 year post-COVID-19 vaccination to describe factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination, evaluate for a protective SARS-CoV-2 antibody level, characterize SARS-CoV-2 antibody persistence, and identify factors associated with humoral immune response durability.

Methods

Using a prospective cohort of COVID-19 immunized adults with IBD, we analyzed factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination. We evaluated for an association between SARS-CoV-2 antibody level 12 weeks postvaccination and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed for a threshold of protection using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. We then conducted a separate analysis evaluating factors associated with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 52 weeks postimmunization.

Results

Almost half (43%) of 1869 participants developed COVID-19 after vaccination, but most infections were mild, and < 1% required hospitalization. Older age and corticosteroid use were associated with a decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection postvaccination (50–59 years of age vs 18–29 years of age: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–0.74; steroid users vs nonusers: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.39–0.87). Most (98%) participants had detectable antibody levels at 52 weeks postvaccination. Antibody levels at 12 weeks and number of vaccine doses were positively associated with higher antibody levels at 52 weeks, while anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy was negatively associated.

Conclusions

COVID-19 vaccination generates an effective and durable protective response for the vast majority of adults with IBD, including vulnerable populations such as corticosteroid users and older individuals. Patients with IBD benefit from COVID-19 booster vaccination.

### SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Nqabb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the start of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, multiple vaccination programmes with both messenger RNA (mRNA) and viral vector vaccines were implemented. Initial concerns on an increased risk of COVID-19 infections and a more severe course for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been refuted. – The overall incidence as well as the incidence of severe COVID-19 infections in patients with IBD is comparable to the general population. –

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in IBD patients comprise a higher age, comorbidity and corticosteroid use. No association between severe COVID-19 and IBD medication, including biologicals, has been observed. On the contrary, a beneficial effect of anti-inflammatory drugs has been suggested. Hypothetically these drugs protect patients from a cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, thereby reducing the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors necessary for viral entry of COVID-19, which influences both the incidence and severity of COVID-19. Contradictory to this hypothesis, the serologic response to infection was shown to be attenuated in patients with anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) treatment when compared with vedolizumab.

An impaired immune response following hepatitis A and B, pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations was demonstrated in IBD patients on immunosuppressive therapy. – Given a reduced serologic response following COVID-19 infection, a reduced vaccination response following COVID-19 vaccination might be expected. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that vaccinated IBD patients had slightly lower seroconversion rates after COVID-19 vaccination than healthy controls. Most importantly, a fast decay in antibody response to vaccination after 4 weeks was demonstrated, which was most pronounced in patients treated with anti-TNF-α, immunomodulators or combination therapy.

Although an impaired immune response has been demonstrated following COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients, it is unclear whether this impacts the rate of (severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to assess the rate of (severe) SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections after vaccination for patients with IBD. In addition, we describe the course of the breakthrough infections after COVID-19 vaccination and evaluate epidemiological and disease-specific risk factors.

Risk and control periods

The SCCS design requires the partitioning of an individual's observation period into control and post-vaccination risk periods to compare the incidence of events within risk and control periods (Fig. 1). The pre-vaccination baseline control period was defined as the 6 months prior to the first COVID-19 dose but exclusive of the 14 days prior to the first dose (washout period) given concerns around the 'healthy vaccinee effect' (e.g. patients may choose to wait until they are in relatively good health before receiving a vaccine). Control periods in between doses started on day 22 from the last dose and ended 14 days prior to the next dose. A final control period commenced after the final dose risk period (up to a maximum of 6 months). AESI, hospitalizations and ED visits all required a 21-day risk period (the minimum time interval allowed before further COVID-19 vaccination doses) and a sensitivity analysis was performed to extend the risk period up to 42 days. If there were overlapping periods with subsequent vaccinations given < 42 days apart, the risk period would terminate the day before the next COVID-19 vaccine and the washout period is removed. For gastroenterologist or IBD-related outpatient visits, a 30-day risk period was used for the primary analysis, with an alternate 3-month (90 day) risk window used in the sensitivity analysis. This risk period after exposure is based on the concept that an IBD patient may flare after exposure but may experience delays in accessing their gastroenterologist due to pandemic-related restrictions.

Description of risk and control periods for SCCS analysis

In this example, a patient with IBD received a COVID-19 vaccine three times in the follow-up period. The risk and control periods were similarly derived for non-IBD comparators

PRA023

Tumour-necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A (TL1A) is an upstream regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis signals. PRA023 is an anti-TL1A monoclonal antibody currently in development for multiple inflammatory/fibrotic diseases. A phase 2 induction study (ARTEMIS-UC) assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous PRA023 (1000 mg on day 1 and 500 mg at weeks 2, 6 and 10) in moderately to severely active UC. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at week 12 with secondary endpoints being endoscopic and histological improvement and patient-reported outcome measures. Forty-eight per cent of patients in the treatment group had been exposed to at least one advanced therapy, which included biologics and/or JAK inhibitors/S1P modulators. A significantly greater proportion of patients who received PRA023 achieved clinical remission at week 12 compared with placebo (26.5% vs 1.5%, respectively; p < 0.0001) and endoscopic improvement in 36.8% vs 6%, respectively; p < 0.0001. No serious adverse events, opportunistic infections or infusion reactions were reported in the treatment group. The treatment group, however, did report a higher number of COVID-19 infections.

A similar phase 2a study for patients with CD (APOLLO-CD) demonstrated clinical remission rates at week 12 of 49% in the treatment group vs 16% in placebo group (p < 0.001) and an endoscopic response of 26% vs 12%, respectively (p < 0.001). At least 70.9% of patients were previously treated with at least one biological therapy and over 50% had two or more biological therapies. Phase 3 studies for both UC and CD are now ongoing.

### Severe activity of inflammatory bowel disease is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 [^116GC4KX]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Data from the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic suggested that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at higher risk of being infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than the general population and that a worse prognosis is not associated with immunomodulatory drugs, with the possible exception of systemic steroids.

Methods

This retrospective, observational study included consecutive IBD patients from the Sicilian Network for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SN-IBD) cohort who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis (polymerase chain reaction-confirmed presence of the viral genome in a nasopharyngeal swab) during the second COVID-19 pandemic wave (September 2020 to December 2020). Data regarding demographics, IBD features and treatments, and comorbidities were analyzed in correlation with COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

Results

Data on 122 patients (mean age, 43.9 ± 16.7 years; males, 50.0%; Crohn's disease, 62.3%; ulcerative colitis, 37.7%) were reported. Twelve patients developed COVID-19-related pneumonia (9.8%), 4 (3.3%) required respiratory assistance (nonmechanical ventilation or orotracheal intubation), and 4 died (case fatality rate, 3.3%). In a multivariable analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.034; 95% CI, 1.006–1.147; p = 0.032) and severe IBD activity (OR, 13.465; 95% CI, 1.104–164.182; p = 0.042) were independent predictors of COVID-19-related pneumonia, while severe IBD activity (OR, 15.359; 95% CI, 1.320–178.677; p = 0.030) was the only independent predictor of severe COVID-19, a composite endpoint defined as the need for respiratory assistance or death. A trend towards a protective role of tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors on pneumonia development was reported (P = 0.076).

Conclusions

In this cohort of patients with IBD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe IBD activity was the only independent risk factor for severe COVID-19.

### The complex relationship between viruses and inflammatory bowel disease-review and practical advices for the daily clinical decision-making during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^114PUY48]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Historical synopsis

The first case of respiratory failure proved to be associated with a new coronavirus species was presented in December 2019, diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. In the following 3 months, this virus proved able not only to cross the borders of the country but also to spread across the world, becoming a pandemic. By 12 February 2020, the virus was named 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2), causing the disease referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

A pandemic takes a vast toll on the global economy, on social life and on medical services and supplies. In such a situation, we must recognise the most vulnerable points in medical care and identify the potentially modifiable parts of patient management to avoid unnecessary health damage. New standards for treatment options should be developed that aim towards decreasing susceptibility to the infectious disease. Patients with chronic diseases and those receiving immunosuppressive or biological therapy may be at higher risk of contracting infectious diseases, and the expected consequences and outcomes of a SARS-CoV-2 infection or even a manifest COVID-19 in such patients should be explored. It might prove necessary to implement reasonable therapeutic changes into the daily clinical practice during the current pandemic situation in order to provide the most beneficial outcome.

### Adverse events after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination among patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115HHsDw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on immunosuppressive and biologic therapies were largely excluded from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA vaccine trials.

Methods

We evaluated adverse events (AE) after messenger RNA vaccination in 246 adults with IBD participating in a longitudinal vaccine registry.

Results

In general, AE frequency was similar to that reported in the general population. AEs were more common among younger patients and those with previous COVID-19. AEs were less common in individuals receiving advanced therapies with biologics or small-molecule inhibitors.

Discussion

Those with IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases can be reassured that the AE risk is likely not increased, and may be reduced, while on advanced therapies.

### Remote care through telehealth for people with inflammatory bowel disease [^111oyyeM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require intensive follow-up with frequent consultations after diagnosis. IBD telehealth management includes consulting by phone, instant messenger, video, text message, or web-based services. Telehealth can be beneficial for people with IBD, but may have its own set of challenges. It is important to systematically review the evidence on the types of remote or telehealth approaches that can be deployed in IBD. This is particularly relevant following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which led to increased self- and remote-management.

Objectives

To identify the communication technologies used to achieve remote healthcare for people with inflammatory bowel disease and to assess their effectiveness.

Search Methods

On 13 January 2022, we searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, three other databases, and three trials registries with no limitations on language, date, document type, or publication status.

Selection Criteria

All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated telehealth interventions targeted at people with IBD versus any other type of intervention or no intervention. We did not include studies based on digital patient information resources or education resources, unless they formed part of a wider package including an element of telehealth. We excluded studies where remote monitoring of blood or faecal tests was the only form of monitoring.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies and assessed their risk of bias. We analysed studies on adult and paediatric populations separately. We expressed the effects of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and the effects of continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), each with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs with a total of 3489 randomised participants, aged eight to 95 years. Three studies examined only people with ulcerative colitis (UC), two studies examined only people with Crohn's disease (CD), and the remaining studies examined a mix of IBD patients. Studies considered a range of disease activity states. The length of the interventions ranged from six months to two years. The telehealth interventions were web-based and telephone-based. Web-based monitoring versus usual care Twelve studies compared web-based disease monitoring to usual care. Three studies, all in adults, provided data on disease activity. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 254) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 174) in reducing disease activity in people with IBD (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.29). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. Five studies on adults provided dichotomous data that we could use for a meta-analysis on flare-ups. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 207/496) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 150/372) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with IBD (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.27). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided continuous data. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 465) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 444) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in adults with CD (MD 0.00 events, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. One study provided dichotomous data on flare-ups in a paediatric population. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 28/84) may be equivalent to usual care (n = 29/86) for the occurrence of flare-ups or relapses in children with IBD (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.51). The certainty of the evidence is low. Four studies, all in adults, provided data on quality of life. Web-based disease monitoring (n = 594) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 505) for quality of life in adults with IBD (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.20). The certainty of the evidence is moderate. Based on continuous data from one study in adults, we found that web-based disease monitoring probably leads to slightly higher medication adherence compared to usual care (MD 0.24 points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47). The results are of moderate certainty. Based on continuous data from one paediatric study, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63), although the evidence is very uncertain. When we meta-analysed dichotomous data from two studies on adults, we found no difference between web-based disease monitoring and usual care in terms of their effect on medication adherence (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21), although the evidence is very uncertain. We were unable to draw any conclusions on the effects of web-based disease monitoring compared to usual care on healthcare access, participant engagement, attendance rate, interactions with healthcare professionals, and cost- or time-effectiveness. The certainty of the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence in this review suggests that web-based disease monitoring is probably no different to standard care in adults when considering disease activity, occurrence of flare-ups or relapse, and quality of life. There may be no difference in these outcomes in children, but the evidence is limited. Web-based monitoring probably increases medication adherence slightly compared to usual care. We are uncertain about the effects of web-based monitoring versus usual care on our other secondary outcomes, and about the effects of the other telehealth interventions included in our review, because the evidence is limited. Further studies comparing web-based disease monitoring to standard care for the clinical outcomes reported in adults are unlikely to change our conclusions, unless they have longer follow-up or investigate under-reported outcomes or populations. Studies with a clearer definition of web-based monitoring would enhance applicability, enable practical dissemination and replication, and enable alignment with areas identified as important by stakeholders and people affected by IBD.

### Clinical and endoscopic outcomes through 78 weeks of tofacitinib therapy for ulcerative colitis in a US cohort [^113gJjHN]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We assessed outcomes through 78 weeks of tofacitinib therapy for UC in a real-world setting.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adults initiating tofacitinib for UC from May 1, 2018, to April 1, 2021, at a large academic center in the United States. The primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission at 78 (± 4) weeks (SFCR 78; simple clinical colitis activity index ≤ 2 with no corticosteroid use within 30 days). The secondary outcome was tofacitinib discontinuation due to nonresponse (treatment persistence). Additional outcomes were endoscopic response/remission and adverse events (AEs).

Results

Seventy-three patients initiated tofacitinib, with a median follow-up of 88 weeks. Among patients with available data, 31 of 60 (51.7%) achieved SFCR 78, 21 of 47 (44.7%) achieved endoscopic remission during follow-up, and 25 of 73 (34.2%) discontinued tofacitinib during follow-up due to nonresponse (including 11 patients who required colectomy). Nineteen AEs were reported among 15 patients during follow-up: shingles (n = 4, all without documented vaccinations), deep venous thrombosis (n = 2), elevated liver enzymes (n = 2), skin abscess (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), possible miscarriage (n = 2), norovirus (n = 1), COVID-19 (n = 1), lymphopenia (n = 1), Clostridioides difficile infection (n = 1), and heart block (n = 1). One patient discontinued therapy due to an AE (elevated liver enzymes), and no deaths occurred.

Conclusion

Tofacitinib treatment was effective in achieving SFCR for the majority of patients with UC through 78 weeks. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of tofacitinib, and AEs requiring discontinuation were rare. Due to limitations regarding sample size, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^115RMFLv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Immune-modifying therapies in inflammatory bowel disease — vaccine immunogenicity evidence indicates that patients with IBD receiving anti-TNF therapy may have a blunted vaccine response to inactivated vaccines, those on combination anti–TNF therapy with thiopurines or methotrexate are more likely to have a blunted vaccine response, and the timing of infliximab infusion had no effect on vaccine response. A meta-analysis reported that immunosuppressed patients with IBD had a significantly lower vaccine-induced immune response than nonimmunosuppressed patients and that those receiving combination anti–TNF therapy had the lowest response to adult vaccines. Studies of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine found that those on anti–TNF therapy, whether as monotherapy or in combination, was associated with lower antibody concentration. In 2 small studies of vedolizumab, patients with IBD had a normal influenza vaccine response, and a small study of 15 patients with IBD on ustekinumab compared with 20 healthy controls failed to show that ustekinumab impacted influenza vaccine response; in larger studies of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, vedolizumab or ustekinumab were not associated with lower antibody responses, and whether these findings are generalizable to other inactivated vaccines is not known. Oral small-molecule JAK inhibitors are approved for the treatment of UC (tofacitinib and upadacitinib) and CD (upadacitinib), inhibition of the JAK–STAT pathway may affect the vaccine response, and tofacitinib was associated with a lower humoral immune response to pneumococcal vaccines but not influenza vaccines in a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These studies have also shown that temporary discontinuation of methotrexate results in an increased humoral immune response to an influenza vaccine and a potential risk of disease flare, and whether holding an immunomodulator for a potentially higher antibody response is clinically beneficial is unknown.

Inactivated vaccines in inflammatory bowel disease — these vaccines are not viable and cannot replicate and are produced by growing pathogens in culture and by inactivating them using heat or chemicals; types include mRNA (COVID-19), adenoviral vector (COVID-19), recombinant (hepatitis B, human papillomavirus [HPV], and HZ subunit), toxoid (e.g., diphtheria and tetanus), and polysaccharides (e.g., pneumococcal polysaccharide). Multiple doses are required to provide adequate protection, the first dose typically does not induce protective immunity because it primes the immune system, a protective immune response develops after the second or third dose, and periodic supplemental doses, or boosters are required to maintain protection.

Patient not infected with SARS-CoV-2–IBD in relapse

Be aware of the patient's compliance.
UC: Dosage escalation of mesalazine; Local treatment, mesalazine and oral budesonide; Try budesonide MMX instead of corticosteroid; In severe flare-ups: use a short course (3 days) of intravenously administered steroid. If the patient does not respond to steroid therapy, infliximab or cyclosporine is recommended. If the patient responds to steroid therapy, any of the anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab or ustekinumab is suggested to use.
CD: Ileal location: oral budesonide; Colonic location: mesalazine, sulfasalazine; In severe flare-ups: short course (3 days) of intravenously administered steroid and adalimumab as an anti-TNF drug (possible use of vedolizumab or ustekinumab if local/national regulation permits). Adalimumab is recommended because of its subcutaneous administration; however, if there is no adequate response to steroids, infliximab or cyclosporine should be introduced.
Do not start azathioprine due to its slow onset of action and increased risk of infection. Azathioprine causes lymphopenia in 10% of the patients, and every fifth patient receiving azathioprine exhibits a decrease below 0.5 × 10⁹/L. The study by Wisniewski et al. confirmed that increased risk of serious viral infections was associated with exposure to thiopurines, and clinically active IBD at onset of infection.
Less frequently, a moderate decrease is also observable during methotrexate and tofacitinib therapy. Therefore, we would advise being aware of azathioprine-induced lymphopenia in SARS-COV-2 high-transmission areas.
Biological therapy should preferably be administered subcutaneously with proper patient education, and the maximal amount should be prescribed.
GI-selective vedolizumab or ustekinumab may be a good choice in patients with advanced age or comorbidities.

Patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection without clinical symptoms–IBD in remission or with mild activity

Decrease corticosteroid dose (< 16 mg prednisone).
Use oral budesonide instead of other steroid drugs.
Termination of azathioprine, methotrexate and tofacitinib therapy.
If possible, postpone all type of biological treatment for about 14 days or until seroconversion

### Recent advances in clinical practice: management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112htWLi]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccination

The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has led to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, hospitalisations and deaths. They have been well tolerated, and rates of adverse events post-vaccination have been reported to be similar in patients with IBD compared with the general population, without an increased risk of disease exacerbation. Previous studies, however, have demonstrated impaired vaccine response following pneumococcaland influenza vaccination in patients treated with infliximab, but not vedolizumabor ustekinumab. Therefore, initial concerns were raised that patients on immunosuppressive medications may have attenuated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with less immune protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of published data have focused on vaccine responses to BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, as these were most commonly administered worldwide. The optimal correlate of protection, defined as the immune response needed to protect an individual from a disease, for SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be established. Consequently, surrogates of humoral and cellular immune response have been used to predict vaccine efficacy. These include neutralisation antibody assays, antibodies to the spike(S) protein receptor binding domain (anti-S RBD) as a correlate of neutralising antibodies, and T cell studies as a measure of cellular immunity.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113FB1Tu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### Autoimmune and autoinflammatory connective tissue disorders following COVID-19 [^1173H661]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Patients with COVID-19 mount an early and robust defense through the activation of type 1 and 2 interferon (IFN) responses, which are pivotal against viral infections. Nevertheless, studies, indicate that these IFN responses may also induce hyperinflammation, exacerbate the severity of COVID-19, and be associated with mortality. A high IFN status has also been associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, such as vitiligo and alopecia areata, which exhibit type 1 and type 2 IFN signatures, respectively, suggesting a potential association of excessive antiviral responses with the subsequent breaching of immune-privileged areas leading to immune responses against self-antigens.

The risk of psoriasis was slightly elevated in the COVID-19 subcohort comprising men and those who had severe COVID-19. Previous reports described aggravation of preexisting psoriatic lesions, and increased levels of T helper (T H) 17–related cytokines in patients with COVID-19. Thereby, the T H 17–skewed milieu induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

The incidence of ANCA-associated vasculitis was increased in individuals with COVID-19, which was consistent with previous reports. Plausible mechanisms involve viral-induced hypercoagulability resulting from endothelial infection or injury, complement system activation, and dysregulation of the coagulation cascade, ultimately leading to vasculopathy. Moreover, the protracted exposure of neutrophil extracellular traps has been postulated to elicit the development of antineutrophil antibodies.

A few studies have reported Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis following COVID-19. Notably, our overall COVID-19 cohort showed increased risk of Crohn disease, whereas the risk of ulcerative colitis was increased in the severe COVID-19 subgroup only. Crohn disease is mainly mediated by T H 1 and T H 17, whereas ulcerative colitis is an atypical T H 2 disease. Hyperactivated T H 1 response against SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with Crohn disease, and triggering of T H 2 response which is associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 and may contribute to the development of ulcerative colitis.
