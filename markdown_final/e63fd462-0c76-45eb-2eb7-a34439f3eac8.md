## Question

Work up of iron deficiency (ferritin 6) without anemia in an otherwise healthy 30 year old female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup of iron deficiency with ferritin 6 ng/mL and no anemia in an otherwise healthy 30-year-old woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the significance of ferritin 6 ng/mL. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies in a premenopausal woman. Next, I will review what not to do, including unnecessary gastrointestinal endoscopy. After that, I need to outline the focused workup for heavy menstrual bleeding and malabsorption. Finally, I will plan treatment, monitoring, and when to escalate or investigate further, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its implications. Ferritin 6 ng/mL is unequivocally low and, in the absence of inflammation, confirms absolute iron deficiency even without anemia, because ferritin reflects depleted stores and is the most specific single test for iron deficiency in this context [^24b92ffd] [^527cf6a4]. Wait, let me verify the threshold I'm using: while some older literature used 15 ng/mL, contemporary guidance favors 30–45 ng/mL to improve sensitivity, so a ferritin of 6 ng/mL is far below any accepted diagnostic cutoff and leaves no doubt about iron deficiency here [^24b92ffd] [^527cf6a4].

> Next, I should review the most likely etiologies in a healthy 30-year-old woman. Heavy menstrual bleeding is the predominant cause of iron deficiency in premenopausal women, and many such women have iron deficiency without anemia, reflecting early depletion of stores before hemoglobin falls [^ff4df1d1] [^5ed098dd]. Hold on, I should verify the prevalence signal: studies in adolescents and young women show high rates of iron deficiency with and without anemia, reinforcing that menstrual blood loss is the leading contributor in this demographic [^ebfe442e] [^527cf6a4].

> I need to ensure I do not over-investigate the gastrointestinal tract. In premenopausal women with iron deficiency without anemia, the yield of bidirectional endoscopy for malignancy is extremely low, and routine upper and lower endoscopy is not recommended in the absence of red flags or symptoms, so I should avoid reflex EGD/colonoscopy here [^ff4df1d1] [^b8526278]. But wait, what if I initially thought to order colonoscopy because of cancer risk concerns? That would be a mistake in this scenario; guidelines explicitly de-emphasize invasive GI evaluation in non-anemic premenopausal women unless there are additional risk factors or symptoms, so I should correct that impulse and keep the evaluation focused [^ff4df1d1] [^b8526278].

> Let me consider the focused workup I should pursue. First, I should take a careful menstrual history using a structured approach or a validated tool like the PBAC to quantify blood loss and screen for features suggesting a bleeding disorder, because unrecognized heavy menstrual bleeding is common and treatable, and adolescents and young women have a higher prevalence of underlying hemostatic defects than older adults [^40359efd] [^ebfe442e]. Second, I should screen for celiac disease with tTG-IgA and total IgA, since celiac disease is found in 2–6% of patients with iron deficiency and can impair absorption; if positive, I should proceed to endoscopy with biopsies, but if negative and there are no GI symptoms, I can defer invasive GI testing [^026908b4] [^b8526278]. Third, I should check a CRP to ensure ferritin is interpretable; if CRP is elevated, I may need to rely more on transferrin saturation to confirm iron deficiency, but in an otherwise healthy 30-year-old, CRP is typically normal, making ferritin 6 ng/mL definitive [^d293ab36] [^527cf6a4].

> Now, I will outline treatment, but I should confirm dosing and strategy. Oral iron is first-line; ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day provides about 65 mg elemental iron per tablet, and every-other-day dosing can improve absorption and tolerability, with vitamin C co-administration enhancing uptake; I should counsel on GI side effects and adherence strategies to maximize success [^9dd8c36d] [^a4cf83f5]. Hold on, I should verify duration: a 3-month course is reasonable to replete stores, with reassessment of ferritin at 4–8 weeks to document recovery; if heavy menstrual bleeding is present, I should also initiate hemostatic therapy to reduce ongoing iron loss, using combined hormonal contraception or a levonorgestrel IUD as appropriate, and consider tranexamic acid in selected cases [^ebfe442e] [^40359efd].

> I should double-check monitoring and response expectations. I will recheck hemoglobin in 4–8 weeks to ensure we are not drifting toward anemia, and I will expect ferritin to rise toward at least 30–50 ng/mL if repletion is successful; if there is inadequate response, I need to reassess adherence, ongoing blood loss, and absorption, and consider switching to IV iron if malabsorption or intolerance is suspected [^9dd8c36d] [^a4cf83f5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to monitor hemoglobin every 2 weeks; that cadence is more typical for confirmed anemia rather than non-anemic iron deficiency, so I should correct that and align follow-up with a 4–8 week interval unless symptoms emerge or labs worsen [^7b660aec].

> Next, I should review when to escalate or broaden the evaluation. If ferritin fails to normalize after 3 months of appropriate therapy and confirmed adherence, or if anemia develops, I should reconsider ongoing menstrual blood loss, reassess for celiac disease if not previously tested, and then, if still unexplained, consider limited GI evaluation or referral to gastroenterology; in non-anemic premenopausal women, this remains a lower-yield pathway and should be individualized [^ff4df1d1] [^b8526278]. I need to ensure I also revisit the menstrual management plan, because persistent heavy menstrual bleeding will perpetuate iron deficiency unless addressed concurrently [^40359efd].

> Finally, I should confirm preventive counseling and longitudinal care. I will reinforce dietary sources of iron, discuss strategies to reduce menstrual blood loss, and consider periodic ferritin checks every 1–2 years in women with recurrent deficiency, especially if heavy menstrual bleeding persists or pregnancies are planned, since preconception optimization of iron stores improves maternal and fetal outcomes [^ebfe442e] [^b8526278]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overpromising on screening: routine population screening for iron deficiency in nonpregnant adults is not broadly endorsed, but targeted reassessment in high-risk groups like those with heavy menstrual bleeding is reasonable and supported by specialty guidance [^85c5484d] [^ebfe442e].

In a healthy 30-year-old woman with ferritin 6 ng/mL and no anemia, the most likely cause is **menstrual blood loss** or **inadequate dietary intake** [^ff4df1d1] [^5ed098dd]. Confirm iron deficiency with **ferritin < 30 ng/mL** and **transferrin saturation < 20%** if inflammation is suspected [^527cf6a4] [^d293ab36]. Evaluate for **heavy menstrual bleeding** and screen for **celiac disease** with tTG-IgA and total IgA [^026908b4]. Routine gastrointestinal endoscopy is not indicated unless there are symptoms, family history, or failure to respond to therapy [^ff4df1d1] [^b8526278]. Treat with **oral iron** (ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) for 3 months, reassess ferritin at 4–8 weeks, and address the underlying cause to prevent recurrence [^9dd8c36d] [^a4cf83f5].

---

## Step 1: confirm iron deficiency and exclude confounders

- **Ferritin**: < 30 ng/mL in the absence of inflammation confirms iron deficiency; ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and may be falsely normal or elevated with inflammation [^527cf6a4] [^d293ab36].
- **Transferrin saturation (TSAT)**: < 20% supports iron deficiency when ferritin is equivocal or inflammation is present [^d926af9f].
- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: check to assess for inflammation that could mask iron deficiency [^d293ab36].

---

## Step 2: identify the underlying cause

### Common causes in healthy premenopausal women

- **Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)**: the most common cause; assess with a detailed menstrual history and consider a bleeding disorder if HMB is severe or refractory [^ff4df1d1] [^40359efd].
- **Inadequate dietary intake**: poor intake or restrictive diets can contribute [^5ed098dd].
- **Celiac disease**: present in 2–5% of iron deficiency cases; screen with tTG-IgA and total IgA [^026908b4] [^82b01274].

---

### Less common causes (consider if HMB is absent or dietary intake is adequate)

Less common causes include **gastrointestinal blood loss** (rare in this age group without symptoms) [^ff4df1d1] and **malabsorption** (e.g. bariatric surgery, IBD) [^a4cf83f5].

---

## Step 3: targeted evaluation

| **Evaluation** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Detailed menstrual history (PBAC) | All patients |
| Celiac screening (tTG-IgA, total IgA) | All patients |
| Gastrointestinal evaluation (endoscopy) | Only if symptoms, family history, or refractory cases [^ff4df1d1] [^b8526278] |

---

## Step 4: management

### Iron replacement therapy

- **Oral iron**: first-line therapy; ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day for 3 months; every-other-day dosing may improve absorption and tolerability [^9dd8c36d] [^a4cf83f5].
- **Vitamin C**: co-administration can enhance absorption [^9dd8c36d] [^a4cf83f5].
- **Monitoring**: reassess ferritin at 4–8 weeks; expect ferritin to rise by about 50% if adherent [^notfound].

---

### Address underlying causes

Address **heavy menstrual bleeding** with hormonal therapy (COCs, LNG-IUD) or hemostatic agents (tranexamic acid, NSAIDs) [^40359efd] [^ebfe442e]. For **celiac disease**, initiate a strict gluten-free diet and consider IV iron if oral iron fails [^026908b4].

---

## Step 5: follow-up and prevention

Follow-up should include reassessing **ferritin** after 3 months of therapy and continuing to monitor for recurrence, especially if HMB persists. Prevention focuses on dietary counseling, ongoing management of HMB, and periodic ferritin checks in high-risk patients [^ebfe442e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm iron deficiency**: ferritin < 30 ng/mL in the absence of inflammation [^527cf6a4].
- **Identify cause**: prioritize HMB, dietary intake, and celiac disease [^ff4df1d1] [^026908b4].
- **Avoid unnecessary testing**: no routine GI endoscopy unless symptoms or refractory cases [^ff4df1d1] [^b8526278].
- **Treat**: oral iron for 3 months, address underlying cause, and monitor response [^9dd8c36d] [^a4cf83f5].

---

Iron deficiency without anemia in a healthy 30-year-old woman is common and usually due to **HMB or dietary insufficiency**; a focused, guideline-based approach confirms the diagnosis, identifies the cause, and guides safe, effective therapy without unnecessary testing.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^8b511868]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

### Iron deficiency anemia [^a06e018d]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^f7fc4df2]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: a review of diagnosis, investigation and management [^6ed77a2e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common form of anaemia worldwide. In men and postmenopausal women the commonest cause of IDA is blood loss from lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, making it a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Causes of IDA relate either to blood loss or iron malabsorption. After confirmation with laboratory tests, gastrointestinal evaluation is almost always indicated to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy. Specific patient groups such as premenopausal women, patients with low-normal ferritin and iron-deficient patients without anaemia may need an individualized approach. A small proportion of patients have recurrent or persistent IDA despite negative standard endoscopies. These patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding usually require evaluation of the small bowel with capsule endoscopy or double balloon enteroscopy. Treatment should involve prompt iron replacement plus diagnostic steps directed towards correcting the underlying cause of IDA. Oral iron replacement is cheap and effective, but parenteral (intravenous) therapy may be required due to intolerance, noncompliance or treatment failure with oral therapy.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency with anemia (IDA) and without anemia remain a diagnostic and management challenge. Iron deficiency has a broad spectrum of causes, including gastrointestinal malignancy. The purpose of this review is to summarize the value and limitations of current methods to diagnose iron deficiency and underline the relevance of contemporaneous evidence to guide the pretest probability of gastrointestinal disease.

Recent Findings

A number of biomarkers for iron deficiency exist, and all have their caveats. Serum ferritin remains the most pragmatic means of diagnosing iron deficiency. Hepcidin holds future promise as a marker of iron status during inflammatory states. Men and postmenopausal women with IDA have the highest overall prevalence of gastrointestinal malignancy (∼11%), while premenopausal women with IDA (< 1.5%) and those with iron deficiency without anemia (< 0.5%) have a very low risk. Noninvasive investigation with fecal immunochemical test and fecal calprotectin hold promise to guide further investigations in lower risk groups.

Summary

Confirmation of iron deficiency remains a challenge. Appropriate risk stratification is the key to guiding judicious gastrointestinal investigation. Use of noninvasive tests may play an important role in lower risk groups. Risk prediction tools applicable to relevant populations are required.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management… [^bb2bc3f2]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

The following diagnostic approach is recommended in patients with anemia and is outlined in Figure 1. 2, 6–11 A serum ferritin level should be obtained in patients with anemia and a mean corpuscular volume less than 95 μm³. Ferritin reflects iron stores and is the most accurate test to diagnose iron deficiency anemia. 7 Although levels below 15 ng per mL are consistent with a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, using a cutoff of 30 ng per mL improves sensitivity from 25 to 92 percent, and specificity remains high at 98 percent. 8, 12 Ferritin is also an acute phase reactant and can be elevated in patients with chronic inflammation or infection. In patients with chronic inflammation, iron deficiency anemia is likely when the ferritin level is less than 50 ng per mL. 7 Ferritin values greater than or equal to 100 ng per mL generally exclude iron deficiency anemia. 9, 10.

In patients with no inflammatory states and in whom the ferritin level is indeterminate, further tests can be performed to ascertain iron status. Values consistent with iron deficiency include a low serum iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a high total iron-binding capacity. 4, 11, 14 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for anemia and implementing iron therapy if iron deficiency anemia is confirmed. 15 The defined values consistent with anemia in pregnancy are hemoglobin levels less than 11 g per dL in the first or third trimester, or less than 10. 5 g per dL in the second trimester. 16 A maternal hemoglobin level of less than 6 g per dL has been associated with poor fetal outcomes, including death.

24 Etiologies include thyroid disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, coagulopathies, uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Initial evaluation includes a history, physical examination, and pregnancy and thyroid-stimulating hormone tests.

Initial clinical assessment

6. We recommend taking a detailed history, as it may provide important clues as to the cause(s) of IDA in the individual case (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

7. We recommend that initial investigation of confirmed IDA should include urinalysis or urine microscopy, screening for coeliac disease (CD) and in appropriate cases, endoscopic examination of the upper and lower GI tract (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

8. CD is found in 3%–5% of cases of IDA, and we recommend that it should be routinely screened for serologically, or on small bowel biopsy at the time of gastroscopy (evidence quality — high, consensus — 84%, statement strength — strong).

9. Age, sex, Hb concentration and mean cell volume are all independent predictors of risk of GI cancer in IDA, and need to be considered as part of a holistic risk assessment. It follows that the cancer risk in iron deficiency without anaemia is low (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

10. There are insufficient grounds at present to recommend faecal immunochemical testing for risk stratification in patients with IDA. The evidence base is evolving rapidly, however, and on that basis, this guidance may therefore change. (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — weak).

11. We recommend that in men and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed IDA, gastroscopy and colonoscopy should generally be the first-line GI investigations. In those not suitable for colonoscopy, CT colonography is a reasonable alternative (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Service provision

IDA is a common clinical problem with fairly clear diagnostic criteria, a degree of case homogeneity, and straightforward algorithms for treatment and investigation. These features make the condition eminently suitable for streamlined management in dedicated nurse-led IDA clinics, as have been developed in a number of units around the UK. An algorithm for the management approach to IDA is suggested in figure 2.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^ab7f58a9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

Investigations

Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > 50 or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged 50 years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over 50 years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > 50 after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > 50 years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B).

Management

All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C).

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^4f1082b1]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Questionnaire Design

We developed a survey to assess current PCP practices for the testing and evaluation of IDA. Clinical vignettes provided with the survey questions were used to address 3 sequential domains to elicit physicians' clinical practices and decision-making processes: (1) the practice of obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) for asymptomatic healthy individuals (ie, screening for anemia), (2) PCP ordering and interpretation of iron laboratory studies, and (3) evaluation and management of IDA and referral for GI endoscopy (colonoscopy and/or EGD). For screening, 5 scenarios were used to understand testing practices for 5 hypothetical asymptomatic individuals presenting as new patients: a 35-year-old man, a 35-year-old woman (not pregnant), a 35-year-old pregnant woman, a 65-year-old man, and a 65-year-old woman. For interpretation of iron laboratory studies, a series of 4 combinations of ferritin level and transferrin saturation were presented: low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL) (to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1.0), normal transferrin saturation (30%) and normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL), normal transferrin saturation (25%) and low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), and low transferrin saturation (2%) and normal to low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Respondents selected whether the scenario represented anemia due to iron deficiency or another cause.

Four hypothetical patient scenarios were presented for evaluation of management of newly diagnosed IDA to assess use of EGD and colonoscopy: a 35-year-old man, a 35-year-old woman (not pregnant), a 65-year-old man, and a 65-year-old woman. We also developed and included 2 questions regarding general attitudes about diagnostic testing: 1 focused on watching and waiting and 1 focused on laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures. The questionnaire included a subset of questions related to knowledge and application of the 2018 American Cancer Society Colorectal Cancer Screening Guideline, and these questions were analyzed separately. The questionnaire was developed in consultation with a survey development team and iteratively modified based on feedback from 10 PCPs at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The final version of the questionnaire is available in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^efed9f94]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA iron deficiency anemia in premenopausal women — In asymptomatic premenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia, the AGA suggests bidirectional endoscopy over iron replacement therapy only, and patients who place a high value on avoiding the small risk of endoscopy, particularly those who are young and might have other plausible reasons for IDA, and a low value on the very small risk of missing a gastrointestinal malignancy would reasonably select an initial course of iron replacement therapy and no initial bidirectional endoscopy.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^caa14b92]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Hereditary hemochromatosis phlebotomy regimen — initial depletion and maintenance guidance are as follows: One phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood) is performed "weekly or biweekly", and each unit removed contains "approximately 200–250 mg iron". Monitoring includes checking serum ferritin "after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months)" early in treatment, with excess iron mobilization indicated when ferritin "drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L". As the "target range of 50–100 μg/L" is approached, testing may be increased; frequent phlebotomy is stopped when ferritin "reaches 50–100 μg/L", and then continued to keep ferritin "between 50 and 100 μg/L". Safety measures include allowing hematocrit/hemoglobin to fall by "no more than 20% of prior level". Treatment burden can be substantial in heavily iron-loaded patients — those with total body iron stores " > 30 g" may require "up to 2–3 years" of therapy — and maintenance needs vary, with some patients requiring phlebotomy "monthly", while others may need "only 1–2 units of blood removed per year".

Table 8
Response to Phlebotomy Treatment in Patients with HH

Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of treatment for HH (Table 9). One unit of blood contains approximately 200–250 mg iron, depending on the hemoglobin concentration, and should be removed once or twice per week as tolerated. In patients with HH who may have total body iron stores > 30 g, therapeutic phlebotomy may take up to 2–3 years to adequately reduce iron stores. Each phlebotomy should be preceded by measurement of the hematocrit or hemoglobin so as to avoid reducing the hematocrit/hemoglobin to < 80% of the starting value. TS usually remains elevated until iron stores are depleted, whereas ferritin, which may initially fluctuate, eventually begins to fall progressively with iron mobilization and is reflective of depletion of iron stores. Serum ferritin analysis should be performed after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months) in the initial stages of treatment. It can be confidently assumed that excess iron stores have been mobilized when the serum ferritin drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L. As the target range of 50–100 μg/L is approached, testing may be repeated more frequently to preempt the development of overt iron deficiency. It is not necessary for patients to achieve iron deficiency and in fact, this should be avoided. Phlebotomy can be stopped at the point at which iron stores are depleted, and the patient should be assessed for whether they require maintenance phlebotomy. For reasons that are unclear, not all patients with HH reaccumulate iron and, accordingly, they may not need a maintenance phlebotomy regimen. Therefore, the frequency of maintenance phlebotomy varies among individuals, due to the variable rate of iron accumulation in HH. Some patients (either male or female) require maintenance phlebotomy monthly, whereas others who reaccumulate iron at a slower rate may need only 1–2 units of blood removed per year. In the United States, blood acquired by therapeutic phlebotomy may be used for blood donation in some institutions, and both the American Red Cross and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have deemed that the blood is safe for transfusion.

Iron deficiency anemia remains a common referral to the pediatric hematology-oncology subspecialist. Improved understanding of iron homeostasis, including the effects of the regulatory hormone hepcidin, recent adult and pediatric clinical trial data, as well as the availability of safer formulations of intravenous iron, have resulted in additional considerations when making treatment recommendations in such patients. Young children and adolescent females remain the most commonly affected groups, but children with complex medical or chronic inflammatory conditions including comorbid gastrointestinal disorders also require special consideration.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^9dd8c36d]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^bc1527ef]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in asymptomatic premenopausal women — the AGA suggests bidirectional endoscopy over iron replacement therapy alone. Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Pooled evidence from 10 studies showed detection of lower gastrointestinal malignancy in 0.9% (95% CI, 0.3%–1.9%) and upper gastrointestinal malignancy in 0.2% (95% CI, 0%–0.9%) of premenopausal women with IDA. As a comparison, a recent meta-analysis found a prevalence of colorectal cancer of 0.1% (95% CI, 0%–0.1%) in individuals younger than 50 years. Comment: Patients who place a high value on avoiding the small risk of endoscopy, particularly those who are young and might have other plausible reasons for iron deficiency anemia, and a low value on the very small risk of missing a gastrointestinal malignancy would reasonably select an initial course of iron replacement therapy and no initial bidirectional endoscopy.

### Impact of iron-deficiency management on quality of life in patients with cancer: a prospective cohort study (CAMARA study) [^67ee10ee]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a prospective monocentric cohort study to evaluate the impact of iron supplementation on the QoL of patients with cancer.

Eligibility criteria were as follows: patients treated for a solid tumor in the day unit of ICO, who were diagnosed with an ID (transferrin saturation coefficient < 20%). This could be a functional (ferritin < 800 ng/mL) or absolute deficit (ferritin < 300ng/mL), associated or not with anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL). Patients had to be over ≥ 18 years old, and could receive any specific oncologic treatment (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, hormonotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery). Patients were ineligible if they were in palliative care, suffering for hematologic malignancy, pregnant, or presenting contraindication to iron supplementation.

This study was approved by an independent ethics committee and all patients were informed. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03625661) databases. All patients gave written informed consent before participating in the trial.

At the inclusion, patients received an iron supplementation, using an i.v. iron preparation of ferric carboxymaltose according to ESMO Guidelines.

Patients' QoL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scale, which is a specific variation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale related to anemia.

The primary endpoint was its evolution at the intermediate visit, 15–30 days after initial intravenous iron supplementation.

Secondary endpoints included on one hand the evolution of this same assessment between baseline, intermediate, and final visit at 6 months, calculated among the patient that complete the entire survey.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^09bc7871]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

Interpretation of Iron Studies for Diagnosis of Iron Deficiency Anemia in 4 Scenarios With Different Combinations of Ferritin Levels and Transferrin Saturation (TSAT)

Details of the scenarios are given in the Questionnaire Design subsection of the Methods section.

Diagnostic Evaluation of IDA

Of 325 respondents, 316 (97.2%) reported that PCPs, not specialists, were primarily responsible for management of IDA within their practice settings. Respondents were asked about which tests they would obtain in a series of scenarios with new-onset IDA and negative celiac serologic test results in men and women aged 35 or 65 years. For the 65-year-old patients, nearly all respondents recommended initial GI endoscopic evaluation with colonoscopy and/or EGD (318 [97.9%] for women and 314 [96.6%] for men). Most respondents recommended performing both EGD and colonoscopy for 65-year-old patients (170 of 312 [54.5%] for women and 168 of 305 [55.1%] for men) (Figure 3). However, some recommended colonoscopy alone (without EGD) for initial evaluation (135 of 312 [43.3%] for women and 124 of 305 [40.7%] for men), which could lead to a potential diagnostic delay and additional sedation episode if upper GI pathologic findings were present or colonoscopy findings were normal. There were no statistically significant differences in the decision to perform EGD and colonoscopy for 65-year-old patients based on respondents' academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, practice type, or availability of open or direct access EGD and colonoscopy (without prior GI consultation).

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^85c5484d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a classic early diagnostic sign of gastrointestinal (GI) tract malignant neoplasm. Between 1% and 10% of adult patients with IDA may have undiagnosed GI tract cancer. Prompt and thorough evaluation of IDA is essential. However, retrospective studies have reported that delays in diagnostic evaluation of IDA are common, and can lead to a delayed diagnosis of colorectal cancer. This problem is of increasing importance given the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients outside the age range for which routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended, for whom IDA may be the first diagnostic sign of malignant neoplasm.

Clinical practices related to identification and evaluation of IDA likely vary substantially, with at least 30 different guidelines from 10 specialty societies. However, variation related to testing practices, interpretation of laboratory test results, and diagnostic evaluation of IDA among physicians is not well studied even though these factors may be associated with diagnostic delays, missed cancer diagnoses, and low-value care. For instance, because of a low diagnostic yield, anemia screening is not recommended for adults except during pregnancy, and recommendations about screening during pregnancy are mixed. Inappropriate screening may be associated with health care waste and potential unintended harm (eg, additional downstream diagnostic tests). Inaccurate test interpretation of iron studies (eg, serum ferritin level and iron saturation) can also lead to medical error, with misclassification of patients' iron level. Interpretation can be complicated because the ferritin level may be elevated in the context of an inflammatory process, potentially masking underlying iron deficiency. Guidelines consistently recommend that men with IDA and postmenopausal women, in the absence of obvious causes, should be evaluated for potential occult GI tract blood loss with colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, older guidelines, which predated the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients observed over the past decade, recommended against initial endoscopic evaluation for premenopausal women with IDA given the more common cause of iron deficiency secondary to menstrual blood loss. Together, these issues introduce ambiguity and complexity to the evaluation of IDA.

Our objective was to understand how primary care physicians (PCPs) approach testing and evaluation of patients for IDA. To do this, we conducted a survey study consisting of a vignette-based assessment of PCPs to examine their practices related to IDA testing and evaluation for male and female patients of different ages. A better understanding of current PCP evaluation and referral patterns for GI endoscopy in the context of IDA may reveal potential opportunities to intervene and promote earlier diagnosis of GI tract cancers.

### Prospective evaluation of a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^b1a57af9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined the effect of introducing an evidence-based clinical guideline on the diagnosis and evaluation of iron deficiency anemia.

Subjects and Methods

The guideline recommended measurement of serum ferritin levels for all anemic patients with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) ≤ 95 fL and endoscopic evaluation for those with a serum ferritin level less than 45 ng/mL. Physicians practicing in the general medicine inpatient and outpatient services of two university-affiliated hospitals were informed about the guideline and the data supporting it. Clinical evaluations during the 9 months before ("control period", n = 3341 patients) and the 9 months after ("intervention period", n = 3173 patients) the introduction of the guideline were compared.

Results

There was a 30% increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22% to 39%) in the proportion of anemic patients who underwent serum ferritin evaluation in the intervention period (41% [n = 1284]) compared with in the control period (31% [n = 1040]), and a 24% increase (95% CI: 4% to 48%) in the proportion with a serum ferritin level < 45 ng/mL (8.1% [n = 256] vs. 6.5% [n = 217]). The proportion of anemic patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation within 4 months of measurement of low serum ferritin level in the intervention period (3.3% [n = 106]) was 67% higher (95% CI: 23% to 125%) than in the control period (2.0% [n = 67]), and the proportion with serious gastrointestinal lesions found as a result of endoscopy was 62% (95% CI: 8% to 145%) higher (1.8% [n = 57] vs. 1.1% [n = 37]).

Conclusions

Introduction of a guideline describing appropriate evaluation of iron deficiency anemia led to an increase in the proportions of patients evaluated for iron deficiency anemia and found to have serious gastrointestinal lesions.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1bf98cb7]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

### Evaluation and management of heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents: the role of the hematologist [^c89c0007]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is frequently reported by adolescents. The role of the hematologist is threefold in the evaluation of such patients: 1) perform a clinical and laboratory evaluation for an underlying bleeding disorder based on the degree of clinical suspicion, 2) identify and manage any concomitant iron deficiency, and 3) provide input to the referring provider regarding the management of HMB, particulary for patients with identified hemostatic defects. Several clues in the menstrual history should raise suspicion for an underlying bleeding disorder, such as menses lasting > 7 days, menstrual flow which soaks > 5 products daily or requires product change during the night, passage of large blood clots, or failure to respond to conventional therapies. A detailed personal and family history of other bleeding symptoms should also be obtained. Iron deficiency with and without anemia is commonly found in young women with HMB. Therefore, it is important to obtain not only a hemoglobin, but also a ferritin level, when evaluating these patients. Iron supplementation is often a key component of management in the adolescent with heavy menses, and is still needed even in those who have received packed red cell transfusions due to severe anemia. Strategies for decreasing menstrual blood flow are similar between adults and adolescents with heavy menses, with combined hormonal contraceptives recommended as first-line therapy. However, adolescent-specific considerations exist for many of these agents, and must be incorporated into shared decision making when selecting the most appropriate treatment.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^c90807d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^a97d6fd3]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Is it time to offer routine screening for iron deficiency in healthy adolescent females? [^a7b46cd8]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID), with or without anaemia, remains a significant global health issue among adolescents. Despite its high prevalence and impact on physical and cognitive function, ID is often underrecognized and undertreated. Adolescent females are particularly at risk due to dietary patterns and menstrual blood loss. Serum ferritin is the most reliable marker of iron status. However, its interpretation and the effect of inflammation should be acknowledged. Current screening practices often focus only on individuals with symptoms or known risk factors. This paper challenges that approach and supports universal screening using haemoglobin and ferritin testing in female adolescents around the age of 14–15, approximately 3years post-menarche. Improving detection requires making screening more accessible, adolescent-friendly and connected to timely follow-up care. The end result is to build a healthier adolescent female population, preparing them to become healthier adult women facing the challenges of women's manifold roles in the modern world. It is important to clarify that the value of eliminating ID extends beyond future pregnancy readiness; it is equally critical for supporting the cognitive, physical and social demands of everyday life faced by adolescent girls and young women.

### Management of iron deficiency in women in scotland [^b7347525]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

I write in response to the recent publication by Fingrut et al, which highlights the need for studies reporting health equity in the field of hematology, in particular, iron deficiency. I present recent health equity observations evaluating iron deficiency management for reproductive-aged women across Scottish National Health Service (NHS) health boards.

On 31 August 2023, data on iron deficiency management were requested from the 14 NHS Scotland health boards in accordance with the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2022. The survey questioned whether health boards provided routine iron deficiency screening for reproductive-aged women and the diagnostic criteria used to identify iron deficiency.

Of the 13 responding health boards, no board reports providing routine iron deficiency screening for women during their reproductive years, although anemia and consequent iron deficiency screening is routinely conducted for either/both obstetric patients and those undergoing major surgery across all 13 health boards.

The standard diagnostic criteria operated by each board to define iron deficiency ranged from a ferritin level < 45 μg/L to a ferritin level < 10 μg/L (see table). Standard diagnostic criteria of ferritin < 30μg/L was used by 6 boards; 2 boards lowered the diagnostic criteria specifically for women; 1 board lowered the diagnostic threshold based on menstruation status; and 2 boards did not use specific diagnostic criteria (see table).

Diagnostic criteria used by Scottish health boards to identify iron deficiency in women of reproductive age

Despite iron deficiency affecting 40% of women of reproductive age, there is an evident lack of consensus regarding diagnostic criteria across the health boards. Substantial guidance on iron deficiency screening can be found in specific at-risk groups: obstetrics, renal failure, cardiac failure, and inflammatory bowel disease. There is however a distinct lack of guidance available for women of reproductive age. There is a need for clear guidance to be provided to the health boards to ensure equal and appropriate access to iron deficiency treatment is available for women across Scotland.

### Management of iron deficiency [^ef4bc942]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^eae70a77]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study of more than 255 000 patients, we investigated the determinants and variation of ferritin testing and the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in Swiss primary care. We observed a substantial association of the choice of ferritin cutoff with the rates of iron deficiency diagnoses, especially nonanemic iron deficiency. In addition, we found a substantial degree of variation in ferritin testing along with interesting associations, such as higher testing rates in postmenopausal women compared with men of the same age and higher testing rates by female and younger general practitioners. We also found gaps in the quality of ferritin testing in terms of a large proportion ordered without accompanying hemoglobin and CRP measurements.

Our most compelling finding regarding the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses was its strong dependence on the choice of the ferritin cutoff, especially for nonanemic iron deficiency. The use of ferritin cutoffs as treatment thresholds has been widely debated, and a recent Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend any specific cutoff in a healthy, asymptomatic population. Even within Switzerland, there are conflicting recommendations. A guideline from a prominent Swiss primary care network emphasizes that iron replacement is not warranted at ferritin concentrations above 15 ng/mL, whereas a local expert panel has recommended diagnosing iron deficiency at ferritin concentrations below 30 ng/mL. Our results show that these controversies affect the management of a considerable number of patients.

### Evaluation and management of heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents: the role of the hematologist [^37c0b699]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is frequently reported by adolescents. The role of the hematologist is threefold in evaluating such patients: (1) perform a clinical and laboratory evaluation for an underlying bleeding disorder on the basis of the degree of clinical suspicion, (2) identify and manage any concomitant iron deficiency, and (3) provide input to the referring provider regarding the management of HMB, particularly for patients with identified hemostatic defects. Several clues in the menstrual history should raise suspicion for an underlying bleeding disorder, such as menses lasting > 7 days, menstrual flow which soaks > 5 sanitary products per day or requires product change during the night, passage of large blood clots, or failure to respond to conventional therapies. A detailed personal and family history of other bleeding symptoms should also be obtained. Iron deficiency with and without anemia is commonly found in young women with HMB. Therefore, it is important to obtain measures of hemoglobin and ferritin levels when evaluating these patients. Iron supplementation is often a key component of management in the adolescent with heavy menses and is still needed in those who have received packed red cell transfusions as a result of severe anemia. Strategies for decreasing menstrual blood flow are similar for adults and adolescents with heavy menses, with combined hormonal contraceptives recommended as first-line therapy. However, there are adolescent-specific considerations for many of these agents, and they must be incorporated into shared decision-making when selecting the most appropriate treatment.

### Prevalence of iron deficiency using 3 definitions among women in the US and Canada [^527cf6a4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

For clinicians, no single SF definition of ID corresponds perfectly to the continuum of laboratory and clinical abnormalities that occurs when storage iron is reduced or absent. In ideal evaluations, clinicians can assess important associated variables, including those used to detect ID in women who have normal or elevated SF reactive to concomitant acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. SF less than or equal to 12 ng/mL is a marker of absolute ID, regardless of the presence or absence of inflammatory conditions. Correlation of stainable bone marrow iron in patients or healthy individuals and in patients with anemia responsive to iron therapy indicates that SF less than or equal to 12 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 25% for detecting ID. Using the definition of SF less than or equal to 30 ng/mL, sensitivity for detecting ID increased to 92%, with a positive predictive value of 83%. In a systematic review, there was insufficient evidence to know whether SF less than 30 ng/mL is a reasonably sensitive and specific test for ID when screening asymptomatic persons.

### Is it time to offer routine screening for iron deficiency in healthy adolescent females? [^709ca044]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued recommendations for preventing and treating ID in the United States. These guidelines recommend screening non‐pregnant women for IDA with haemoglobin levels every 5–10 years throughout their reproductive years.

More recently, in 2023, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) recommended routine blood tests to evaluate ID in women of reproductive age, starting at menarche. FIGO emphasized the use of serum ferritin as the primary marker of iron status, with transferrin saturation measured in cases where chronic inflammation was suspected. When ID is identified in adolescent girls or non‐pregnant women, heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) should be considered as a potential underlying cause, necessitating further evaluation and appropriate management (Table 2). Clinical indicators of HMB include the need to change sanitary products every 1–2 h, episodes of flooding, menstrual duration longer than 7 days, passage of clots larger than 2.5 cm in diameter or blood loss that impacts physical, social or emotional well‐being and/or leads to ID. The Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart (PBAC), a validated visual tool, identifies HMB with scores > 100 and has been updated for modern menstrual products.

TABLE 2
Conditions associated with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).

In 2023, MacLean et al. proposed a universal screening for ID in non‐pregnant women and adolescent girls of reproductive age. They recommended assessing serum ferritin levels and a complete blood count, beginning within 3 years of menarche for all women or earlier for those with risk factors (Table 3). Their analysis highlighted that screening adolescent girls for ID met the WHO criteria for screening tests. Iron deficiency is a prevalent health issue in this population, presenting early detectable signs and symptoms, an accurate diagnostic test and an effective, accessible and affordable treatment. The cost of screening and treatment versus the cost of undiagnosed ID may also support its implementation.

TABLE 3
Risk factors for iron deficiency in female adolescents.

In 2024, multiple Polish medical societies, including the Pediatric Society, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Society, Neonatology Society and Family Medicine Society, issued updated guidelines for preventing and managing ID in children and adolescents. These guidelines recommend routine laboratory testing for ID in girls following menarche, with screening at least every 5 years thereafter. More frequent screening is advised for at‐risk adolescents, particularly those with a history of ID, those following low‐iron diets and those experiencing HMB.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^026908b4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease — Celiac disease is present in 2% to 6% of asymptomatic patients with IDA; in most patients without another explanation for iron deficiency, anemia will improve after initiation of a strict gluten-free diet without iron supplementation, but up to 20% of patients will remain iron deficient even with strict gluten avoidance. Oral iron is less likely to be effective in patients with more severe degrees of villous atrophy, and IV iron may be indicated in these patients or in patients with more severe symptoms of iron deficiency; IV iron also may be indicated in patients whose iron stores do not recover sufficiently with oral iron and a strict gluten-free diet, and appropriate evaluation of other micronutrient deficiencies, sources of chronic blood loss, or anemia of chronic inflammation should be undertaken in patients whose iron stores are slow to recover.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^5f7de556]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

Meaning

The results of this study provide useful components for the evaluation of ferritin testing in high-resource primary care settings and call for harmonization of guidelines for iron deficiency.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^e97e65b1]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) present the official recommendations and highlight epidemiology, physiology, and evaluation considerations. U.S. epidemiology is detailed: In the United States in 1999–2000, 2% of men aged 16–69 years, 12% of women aged 12–49 years, and 9% of women aged 50–69 years were iron deficient, and 4% of women aged 20–49 years and 3% of women aged 50–69 years had IDA. The overall prevalence of IDA in North America in 2010 was estimated at 2.9%. Iron physiology notes that the normal total body iron content varies between 300 and 1,000 g and that about 1–2 mg of iron is lost daily through desquamation of skin and enteric cells or through minor blood loss. Gastrointestinal malignancy is the most serious potential cause, and in most adults without an obvious source of blood loss, evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract for a source of chronic blood loss or malabsorptive process is indicated. There is significant practice variability in the initial gastrointestinal evaluation of IDA. The next update for these guidelines is anticipated 3 years from publication (2023).

Additional etiologies that should be considered and evaluated with noninvasive testing include H pylori infection and celiac disease. Although other small bowel etiologies are often considered in patients with negative bidirectional endoscopy, they are relatively rare, and an initial trial of iron replacement therapy rather than routine small bowel investigation is suggested.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^e0f70a82]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. Whilst low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not dealt with however and is the subject of a separate guideline.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^ebfe442e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: The World Health Organization defines anemia in females 12 years and older as a hemoglobin threshold of 12 g/dL, and iron deficiency is generally identified by a serum ferritin concentration below 15 micrograms/L. Adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding may lose 0.4–0.5 mg of iron with every 1 mL of blood; the incidence of iron deficiency is 9%, increasing to 15–20% when iron deficiency without anemia is included. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend annual screening for adolescents at high risk; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends obtaining a complete blood count and iron studies, when possible. First-line therapy includes oral iron with dietary counseling, and the CDC recommends an oral dose of 60–120 mg per day of iron for adolescent girls and women who have anemia. Emerging data indicate once-a-day to every-other-day dosing is more efficient than multiple daily doses, and if menstrual-flow–reducing interventions are successful, a 3- to 6-month course of iron is sufficient with a ferritin level obtained to confirm complete resolution of iron deficiency.

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2). These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

FIGURE 2
Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels. Case 1: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow up. At age 26 (6 years post‐diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range. Case 2: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32‐year‐old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non‐pregnancy periods. Case 3: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (totalling 5800 mg FS at 200 mg/dose) was administered every 2 months, maintaining ferritin > 500 μg/L for nearly a decade, with Hb within the reference range. Diagnosis of IRIDA was made at t = 5 when she was 41 years old. Ferritin and TSAT varied widely, likely due to chronic inflammation (CRP ~25 mg/L). In the final years (following t = 15), heavy menstrual bleeding led to a Hb decline, requiring additional IV iron therapy (totalling 1700 mg FCM).

### Patients over 45 years with iron deficiency require investigation [^d5a2432c]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) that occurs in patients above the age of 45 years is often caused by gastrointestinal blood loss, and guidelines on the appropriate investigation of these patients have been published. There are few data regarding patients with iron deficiency who are not anaemic and it is not clear how these patients should be managed.

Objectives

We set out to investigate the hypothesis that similar pathologies are likely to underlie iron deficiency and IDA, and to assess whether IDA was being investigated according to the guidelines published by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG).

Methods

The pathology computer identified 153 consecutive patients over the age of 45 years who had serum ferritin levels below 20 microg/dl (normal range 20–200 microg/dl) in a 2 month period (i.e. October and November 2000). Medical records were examined and we recorded all investigations, the diagnoses reached, and the investigating specialty. The results were compared using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

The study shows that the causes of iron deficiency and IDA are similar, but IDA is investigated more thoroughly than iron deficiency, OR 2.07 (CI 1.08–3.97). Ten patients with iron deficiency without anaemia were found to have coeliac disease, a significant result, OR 6.71 (CI 1.38–32.6). The majority of patients with IDA are not under the care of a gastroenterologist and this group are significantly less likely to be investigated according to the BSG guidelines, OR 0.15 (0.04–0.6).

Conclusions

The study shows that the yield of investigation of iron deficiency is high and, hence, it should be investigated in all patients over the age of 45 years. Despite guidelines published by the BSG, IDA is investigated sub-optimally and measures other than the issuing of guidelines are needed to change practice.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^ff4df1d1]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-anaemic iron deficiency

The development of anaemia from iron deficiency goes through an initial phase where body iron stores are depleted resulting in hypoferritinaemia, but the Hb concentration is still within the normal range (non-anaemic iron deficiency (NAID)). For example, in a study of young women with menorrhagia, over half had reduced iron stores but only 25% were actually anaemic.

The overall prevalence of significant underlying GI pathology, and in particular of GI malignancy, is low in NAID. In the absence of other pointers, GI investigation generally is not warranted in premenopausal women since the cause is likely to be menstrual blood loss and/or recent pregnancy (see the Special situations section). The threshold for investigation of NAID should however be low in men, postmenopausal women, and those with GI symptoms or a family history of GI pathology.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^4676ac6f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### Is it time to offer routine screening for iron deficiency in healthy adolescent females? [^65aa12b5]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Emerging evidence highlights ID as a prevalent yet frequently overlooked health concern among adolescents, particularly females. In addition to its immediate health benefits to adolescent girls, screening during adolescence may also reduce the risk of ID during pregnancy, which is associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and child. Current screening strategies primarily target symptomatic individuals or those with established risk factors; however, this approach fails to identify a substantial proportion of affected individuals.

Given the high prevalence of ID, its significant impact on both physical and cognitive health and the well‐documented benefits of early intervention, routine screening should be considered an essential component of adolescent preventive care. Universal haemoglobin and ferritin testing in menstruating adolescents, ideally commencing at ages 14–15, approximately 3 years post‐menarche, could facilitate earlier detection and timely treatment, ultimately mitigating the long‐term burden of ID and IDA. While '3 years post‐menarche' may be a more clinical marker, the age‐based screening is more practical for policy and implementation, particularly as the average age of menarche still remains 12–13 years despite a gradual decline over recent decades. While our recommendations are directed at adolescent girls, implementing a 5‐year screening interval is likely to facilitate the continued identification and management of ID into young adulthood.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^7b660aec]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### Updates in the management of iron deficiency anemia… [^6742d215]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Lilian White, MD Posted on April 28, 2025 Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia globally, comprising an estimated 50% of patients with anemia. Women younger than 50 years are the most likely population to be affected. Iron deficiency due to poor nutrition is the most common cause of anemia in children. Iron deficiency without anemia is estimated to be twice as prevalent as iron deficiency with anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, menstrual blood loss, impaired absorption, inadequate dietary intake, and inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency results from reduced iron intake, absorption, losses or reduced mobilization of iron from bodily stores. Effects of iron deficiency anemia include reduced cognition in children and older adults, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is generally based on deficient iron stores and anemia.

A serum ferritin level of < 45 mg/dL is indicative of iron deficiency, demonstrating an 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association. In patients with an elevated serum ferritin due to inflammation, alternative markers of iron status such as transferrin saturation may be considered. In adults, evaluation of iron deficiency anemia involves noninvasive screening for celiac disease and. In children, mild iron deficiency anemia may be treated initially with oral iron supplementation for 1 month without additional testing. As in adults, an increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL of hemoglobin over 1 month is considered supportive of the diagnosis. In those who do not respond to empiric treatment, further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding and referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended.

Intravenous iron replacement is typically recommended by the AGA updated guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, exhibit poor absorption, or fail to demonstrate improvement with oral iron supplementation. Compared with oral iron, IV iron does not reduce mortality or the need for blood transfusions in adults with iron deficiency anemia, and it may increase the risk of infection, according to a 2022 FPIN Clinical Inquiry.

### Management of anaemia and iron deficiency in patients with cancer: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^cd18ae45]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^24b92ffd]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is considered to be present if ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%. It has been considered uncommon in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease), but this may be attributable to difficulties using the usual iron parameters in this setting. Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant in inflammatory states, ferritin levels are often elevated independent of iron status therefore a higher cutoff (< 100 µg/L) is needed to define IDA in these settings. Also in inflammatory states, serum iron and total iron-binding capacity are generally low, limiting the utility of TSAT for diagnosing IDA. This may be explained by the potential for inflammation to dysregulate iron homeostasis. The key regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a peptide that is produced primarily by hepatocytes. Increased hepcidin levels decrease iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes. In inflammatory states, hepcidin levels generally increase as a response to inflammatory cytokines and the net effect is decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. Patients with inflammatory disorders and iron deficiency exhibit lower levels of hepcidin than those with "pure" anemia of inflammation and, consequently, hepcidin levels can help distinguish between IDA and other anemias where there is no iron deficiency. The serum hepcidin level may be more reliable than ferritin or TSAT for identifying iron deficiency. For example, in patients discharged from the intensive care unit, a low hepcidin level (< 20 µg/L) identified iron deficiency in 37% of patients in contrast to 6% identified by iron tests alone.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^a4cf83f5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we will Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia, clinicians first should determine whether iron-deficiency anemia is owing to inadequate intake or absorption, or loss of iron, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated effectively to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Intravenous iron therapy should be given in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and active inflammation with compromised absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia, oral iron supplements initially should be used to replenish iron stores. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond to oral iron therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia without another identified source of chronic blood loss, treatment of portal hypertension with nonselective β-blockers can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In individuals with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastric antral vascular ectasia who have an inadequate response to iron replacement, consider endoscopic therapy with endoscopic band ligation or thermal methods such as argon plasma coagulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease, ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet to improve iron absorption. Consider oral iron supplementation based on the severity of iron deficiency and patient tolerance, followed by intravenous iron therapy if iron stores do not improve. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Deep enteroscopy performed in patients with iron-deficiency anemia suspected to have small-bowel bleeding angioectasias should be performed with a distal attachment to improve detection and facilitate treatment. Small-bowel angioectasias may be treated with ablative thermal therapies such as argon plasma coagulation or with mechanical methods such as hemostatic clips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Endoscopic treatment of angioectasias should be accompanied with iron replacement. Medical therapy for small-bowel angioectasias should be reserved for compassionate treatment in refractory cases when iron replacement and endoscopic therapy are ineffective.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^3ecf634f]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate gastrointestinal bleeding, we usually refer for colonoscopy and/or EGD. We frequently recommend FOBT, recognizing that FOBT alone is insufficient for excluding gastrointestinal bleeding, with a sensitivity of 58% at detecting the source of IDA.FOBT is more appropriate for colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic people without anemia. We refer for endoscopic evaluation irrespective of FOBT when IDA is suspected unless another etiology for IDA is established. In frail older adults, the decision to perform an endoscopy is often case-by-case with consideration for the person's life expectancy. It should be a shared decision with the patient and caregiver; a positive FOBT suggests a higher yield from endoscopy.

Patients with IDA may present with microcytic or normocytic hypochromic RBCs. Nearly 70% of older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) with IDA present with normal MCV. Laboratory evaluation includes obtaining a CBC, reticulocyte count, serum iron level, TIBC (represents the ability to bind iron to transferrin), TSAT (ratio of serum iron to TIBC), and ferritin (reflects iron stores). Individuals with iron deficiency typically have low serum iron, low TSAT, low ferritin, and high TIBC. Timing and fasted state should be considered when iron studies are collected. A TSAT of < 20% suggests that the iron supply is not adequate for RBC production and a very low TSAT of < 15% is consistent with iron deficiency. Compared with lower ferritin cutoffs, a ferritin level of < 50 ng/mL is suspicious for iron deficiency in older adults because this is a more reliable predicter of iron deficiency in older populations. Intermediate ferritin levels (the range from 30 to 100 ng/mL) pose difficulties, particularly in older adults with chronic diseases. Ferritin levels increase with age and patients with conditions such as chronic heart failure or inflammatory disorders may experience absolute iron deficiency even at ferritin levels of up to 100 μg/L and as high as 300 μg/L if the TSAT is < 20%.
