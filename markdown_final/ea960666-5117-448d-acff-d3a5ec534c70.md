Lymphedema

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lymphedema, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining lymphedema and its pathophysiology. Then, I should classify primary versus secondary causes and identify risk factors. Next, I will review diagnostic criteria and staging, including when to use imaging. After that, I need to outline first-line conservative management and appraise the evidence for each component. Then, I should evaluate surgical options and indications. I will also consider special populations and prevention strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and future directions, making sure to double-check any claims against consensus statements and high-quality reviews as I go [^111XiJBv] [^112PWBBp].

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive condition characterized by impaired lymphatic drainage leading to protein-rich interstitial fluid accumulation, inflammation, and fibroadipose tissue remodeling; it is incurable but treatable, and early intervention matters for limiting progression and complications [^111XiJBv] [^113Uqr6X] [^114UznoB].

> Hold on, I should verify the classification and common etiologies before moving to risk stratification. Primary lymphedema arises from intrinsic lymphatic developmental abnormalities, whereas secondary lymphedema results from extrinsic injury such as oncologic surgery, radiation, infection, or trauma; in high-income settings, cancer treatment is the predominant cause, with breast cancer-related lymphedema affecting roughly one in six survivors, and risk increases with axillary lymph node dissection versus sentinel node biopsy and with radiation exposure [^111AsfkR] [^114KSr77] [^115q7jHM].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach and staging so I don't overcall imaging. Clinical examination is usually sufficient for typical presentations, and most guidelines endorse an integrated assessment with limb volume quantification; a commonly used threshold is a greater than 10% volume difference in the affected limb, while pitting characteristics and duration help distinguish edema phenotypes, and the ISL staging (0–III) reflects progression from subclinical to fibrotic disease; for early or uncertain cases, imaging such as lymphoscintigraphy or ICG lymphangiography can aid diagnosis and surgical planning, though access varies [^112PWBBp] [^1173R8PR] [^111fLXhy] [^111A2VLG].

> I need to ensure I anchor first-line management in consensus-based conservative care. Complex decongestive therapy (CDT) remains the cornerstone, typically delivered in two phases: an intensive phase with manual lymphatic drainage, short-stretch bandaging, exercise, and meticulous skin care, followed by a maintenance phase with compression garments, self-drainage, and ongoing exercise; consensus statements emphasize compression as the key driver of volume reduction and maintenance, with MLD as an adjunct rather than a standalone therapy [^112PWBBp] [^114UznoB] [^1119puNe].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MLD might be the most critical element; let me reconsider in light of the evidence. High-quality consensus and systematic reviews suggest MLD adds only modest incremental benefit when layered onto compression bandaging, with pooled effects around 7% additional volume reduction in mild-to-moderate BCRL, and some trials showing no significant between-group differences; thus, MLD should be offered as part of CDT, especially in earlier stages, but not relied upon alone [^114KqC7Q] [^1119puNe] [^112MtBB4].

> Next, I should review compression technologies and their roles across phases. Adjustable Velcro devices are often favored initially for ease of titration and application, while circular versus flat-knit garments should be selected based on severity and limb shape; sequential pneumatic compression is reasonable as an adjunct in the maintenance phase, and adherence to compression is associated with reduced risk of edema recurrence even if it does not actively "reduce" established swelling during maintenance [^114Qayf8] [^111zmT4S] [^113yN91i] [^114VYzKB].

> I will now examine exercise because patients frequently ask whether activity worsens swelling. Progressive resistance and aerobic exercise are safe and do not exacerbate lymphedema; although earlier meta-analyses suggested minimal or no volume reduction, more recent overviews report a small but statistically significant pooled effect of exercise on volume, reinforcing its role for function, strength, and quality of life while acknowledging the magnitude of benefit is modest and heterogeneous [^112tJF6W] [^11245Yjh] [^112QVZPD].

> Let me think about weight management, and I should double-check the directionality of evidence. Obesity at the time of oncologic treatment increases lymphedema risk, but weight loss after onset has inconsistent effects on volume; some small studies suggest benefit, whereas larger trials and meta-analyses show no significant improvement in BCRL severity with weight loss, so counseling should be balanced and individualized rather than overpromising volume benefits [^112QVZPD].

> I should confirm the stance on pharmacotherapy so I don't inadvertently recommend ineffective agents. No medications are approved for lymphedema; diuretics are not recommended for pure lymphatic edema and may worsen protein concentration, and investigational agents such as ketoprofen, doxycycline, selenium, and cell-based therapies have shown signals in small studies but remain unsupported for routine care pending robust trials [^116vKX6S] [^116bHniu].

> Next, I should review surgical options and indications, and I need to be precise about evidence levels. Physiologic procedures such as lymphovenous bypass and vascularized lymph node transfer can reduce severity and improve quality of life in appropriately selected patients, with consensus supporting LVA at grade 1C and VLNT at grade 1B; debulking with suction-assisted lipectomy addresses the nonpitting fibroadipose component and is effective when combined with ongoing compression; timing remains debated, and many experts consider surgery after failure of optimized conservative therapy in stage II–III disease, though consensus is split for earlier stages [^111tkkYE] [^112b16Jr] [^111EQZJw] [^111H6qHu].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and prevention so I don't miss actionable steps. In pediatrics, primary lymphedema is often underrecognized and may warrant genetic evaluation; in filariasis-endemic regions, essential personal care packages reduce acute attacks and progression; for cancer patients, prospective surveillance with baseline measurements and early intervention reduces incidence and severity, and prophylactic LVA at the time of axillary surgery is promising but still maturing [^111AGDyi] [^116FGmZ3] [^111YX6hE] [^111tkkYE].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Diagnose clinically with volume quantification and stage using ISL; initiate CDT with compression as the anchor, add MLD selectively, implement exercise and weight optimization, and escalate to pneumatic devices if needed; reassess at 4–6 weeks and, if persistent stage II–III disease with functional impairment despite optimized conservative care, refer for surgical evaluation with imaging to guide physiologic versus debulking choices; throughout, embed education and skin care to prevent cellulitis and progression [^112PWBBp] [^114UznoB] [^111EQZJw].

> But wait, what about evidence quality and outcome measurement — this affects how confident we can be in comparative claims. Across modalities, randomized data are small, heterogeneous, and often at high risk of bias, with overviews showing only small pooled effects and no clear superiority of any single intervention; standardizing volume metrics, incorporating patient-reported outcomes, and aligning on clinically meaningful differences are critical next steps, and ongoing registries may clarify comparative effectiveness over time [^11245Yjh] [^114jGqP2] [^116qewN1].

> I should double-check that my key takeaways align with consensus and not overstate any single therapy. Lymphedema is chronic and progressive; early, coordinated, compression-centered care yields the best outcomes; MLD is an adjunct with modest incremental benefit; exercise is safe and may confer small volume benefits; surgery is appropriate for refractory cases with tailored selection; and prevention via surveillance and risk reduction is essential where feasible, all while acknowledging persistent evidence gaps that require better trials and harmonized outcomes [^114UznoB] [^112PWBBp] [^111tkkYE] [^111YX6hE].

Lymphedema is a **chronic, progressive swelling** of the limbs or other body parts due to impaired lymphatic drainage, most often from cancer treatment, infection, or inherited lymphatic disorders [^111XiJBv] [^113Uqr6X]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by limb volume measurement and imaging (ultrasound, lymphoscintigraphy, MRI) when needed [^112PWBBp] [^115XzG3q]. First-line management is **complete decongestive therapy** (CDT) with compression, manual lymphatic drainage, exercise, and skin care; surgery (lymphovenous bypass, vascularized lymph node transfer, liposuction) is reserved for refractory cases [^1139MuEy] [^111tkkYE]. Early detection and lifelong self-care are essential to prevent progression and complications such as recurrent cellulitis and reduced quality of life [^114UznoB] [^112KJntR] [^111VYgCb].

---

## Pathophysiology

Lymphedema results from **impaired lymphatic transport**, causing protein-rich fluid accumulation, chronic inflammation, and progressive fibrosis and adipose tissue deposition [^111AsfkR]. Primary lymphedema arises from congenital lymphatic abnormalities, whereas secondary lymphedema results from acquired lymphatic injury (e.g. surgery, radiation, infection, trauma) [^113Uqr6X].

---

## Clinical presentation

Lymphedema typically presents with:

- **Swelling**: Persistent, often unilateral, usually in the limbs; may involve face, trunk, or genitals [^113Uqr6X].
- **Skin changes**: Thickening, peau d'orange, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis [^113Uqr6X].
- **Heaviness and discomfort**: Common in affected limbs [^114KSr77].
- **Recurrent infections**: Frequent cellulitis or erysipelas [^11385TZw].

Staging follows the **ISL scale**: Stage 0 (subclinical), Stage I (pitting edema), Stage II (non-pitting, fibrosis), Stage III (elephantiasis) [^111AsfkR].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with objective measurement and imaging to confirm and stage disease:

- **Clinical examination**: Sufficient for typical cases; look for edema, skin changes, and Stemmer sign [^1173R8PR].
- **Limb volume measurement**: Water displacement, circumferential tape, or bioimpedance; > 10% difference supports lymphedema [^112PWBBp].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound (venous exclusion), lymphoscintigraphy (gold standard), MRI or CT (soft tissue detail), ICG lymphography (real-time lymphatics) [^111A2VLG] [^115XzG3q].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative therapy is **first-line** and requires lifelong adherence:

- **Complete decongestive therapy (CDT)**: Manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging, exercise, and skin care [^112PWBBp].
- **Compression garments**: Custom-fit sleeves or stockings for maintenance [^1119puNe].
- **Exercise**: Progressive resistance and aerobic training; safe and beneficial [^112tJF6W].
- **Skin care**: Daily hygiene, moisturizers, and infection prevention [^114KSr77].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is considered for **refractory cases** or when conservative therapy fails:

| **Procedure** | **Indication** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Lymphovenous bypass | Early-stage, fluid-predominant edema | Reduced volume, improved quality of life [^112DwGHq] |
| Vascularized lymph node transfer | Moderate-to-severe lymphedema | Significant volume reduction, improved lymphatic function [^112b16Jr] |
| Liposuction | Chronic, fibrotic, non-pitting edema | Effective debulking, improved contour [^111tkkYE] |

---

## Complications

Untreated or poorly managed lymphedema can lead to:

- **Recurrent infections**: Cellulitis, erysipelas [^11385TZw].
- **Progressive fibrosis**: Chronic skin thickening and hardening [^111AsfkR].
- **Functional impairment**: Reduced mobility and disability [^112b16Jr].
- **Psychosocial impact**: Anxiety, depression, body image issues [^111AsfkR].

---

## Prognosis

Lymphedema is **chronic and progressive** but can be controlled with early, consistent management. Prognosis varies with etiology, stage, and adherence; early intervention improves outcomes and quality of life [^114UznoB].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **pharmacologic agents** (e.g. doxycycline, tacrolimus) under investigation, regenerative approaches such as stem cell therapy, and improved imaging and biomarkers for earlier detection and monitoring [^116bHniu] [^114R134s] [^115XzG3q].

---

Lymphedema is a chronic condition with significant morbidity, but **early diagnosis and lifelong conservative management** — with surgery for refractory cases — enable effective control of swelling, prevention of complications, and preservation of quality of life [^111XiJBv].

### Guidelines relevant to diagnosis, assessment, and management of lymphedema: a systematic review [^112PWBBp]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance: Lymphedema is a common, distressing and debilitating condition with various etiologies. Effective diagnosis, assessment, and management rely on evidence-based clinical practice guidelines ("guidelines"). This study aims to describe and compare international guidelines on lymphedema diagnosis, assessment, and management. Recent Advances: The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Systematic searches of electronic literature databases and the web were completed in December 2020 for lymphedema guidelines published in English since 2000. Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE)-II reporting checklist. Synthesis took a narrative approach to compare guideline recommendations and associated levels of evidence. Critical Issues: This systematic review of 1,564 articles and 159 web pages yielded 14 guidelines. All guidelines were from high-income countries. Ten focused exclusively on lymphedema, and four on cancer. Most (n = 13) guidelines recommended an integrated medical, psychological assessment, and physical examination, with a limb volume measurement of > 10% in the affected limb compared, confirming a lymphedema diagnosis. Recommended management involved Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) followed by self-management using skincare, self-lymphatic drainage massage, exercise, and compression. Future Directions: The underlying etiology of lymphedema appeared to make little difference to guideline recommendations regarding care. High-quality guidelines are available to guide lymphedema care. However, their suitability for low-resource settings is unclear.

### Current concepts in surgical management of lymphedema [^11136Y2j]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The decision on whom to offer surgical interventions for lymphedema requires collaboration and input from all involved specialists and should address patients' expectations, invasiveness of procedures, and disease severity. There is no consensus on what constitutes success or failure of complex decongestive therapy and when to pursue surgical intervention. Surgery has the potential to fundamentally affect the pathophysiology of the disease state and can be a powerful tool when used correctly. The dogma of which surgery to offer for a given clinical situation has been undergoing revision and is an area of ongoing research.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^1139MuEy]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of lymphedema continues to evolve, with both medical and surgical treatments playing crucial roles in improving patient outcomes. Conservative approaches, including compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and exercise, remain foundational in symptom management and improving quality of life. Surgical treatments have emerged as promising options for long-term relief and functional improvement. Ongoing research and advancements in diagnostic tools are likely to further refine treatment strategies in the future.

### Review of the evidence of lymphedema treatment effect [^115w5mEf]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Lymphedema treatment aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, and reduce risk for skin infection. Mainstream treatment options have been investigated in more than 160 studies. Findings from these studies have been included in at least 1 of more than 20 literature reviews. A critique of these reviews was undertaken to summarize efficacy findings. The quality of the reviews was evaluated, and gaps in the research were identified to better guide clinical practice. Overall, there was wide variation in review methods. The quality of studies included in reviews, in study design and reporting overall, has been poor. Reviews consistently concluded that complex physical therapy is effective at reducing limb volume. Volume reductions were also reported after the use of compression garments, pumps, and manual lymphatic drainage. However, greatest improvements were reported when these treatments formed a combined treatment program. Large, well-designed, evaluated, and reported randomised, controlled trials are needed to evaluate and compare treatments. Consistent outcome measures will allow better quality reviews and meta-analysis in the future.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^111VYgCb]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We aim to review the current medical and surgical management strategies for lymphedema and present methods for their successful integration into clinical practice. In addition, the following summary background data is provided. Lymphedema is a chronic condition resulting from impaired lymphatic drainage, leading to significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Traditional management includes conservative therapies such as compression garments and physical therapy. However, advancements in surgical techniques have opened new avenues for treatment. This review aims to synthesize the available literature on both medical and surgical approaches to lymphedema management.

Materials and Methods

This article explores the senior author's strategies and experiences in lymphedema treatment, supplemented by a literature review that supports the described techniques.

Results

Effective lymphedema management is multifaceted, necessitating accurate diagnosis, medical treatment, and in some cases, surgical intervention. The senior author has sought to streamline his approach to this complex condition, and this article outlines his algorithm and techniques for treatment.

Conclusions

While conservative treatments remain the foundation of lymphedema management, surgical options in the properly selected patients have shown promising results. The integration of these approaches could enhance overall treatment efficacy and improve quality of life for individuals affected by lymphedema.

### Surgical intervention for lymphedema [^112DwGHq]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive disease with no curative treatment. Breast cancer therapy is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema in the developed world. Treatment includes nonsurgical and surgical strategies. Conservative measures are reserved for subclinical lymphedema. Surgical options are divided into physiologic (to restore function) and reductive (to remove diseased tissue). Early stage disease is managed with physiologic procedures. Reductive treatment is reserved for moderate to severe staged disease owing to high morbidity. Surgical options effectively decrease edema and improve quality of life. However, further research is necessary to best establish management of lymphedema.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^113YffMu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

PROVIDING LYMPHEDEMA TREATMENT OF LF-ENDEMIC POPULATIONS AT A PROGRAMMATIC SCALE

Challenges and strategies in lymphedema program management.

The basic principles for managing individual patients with lymphedema are clear, but to maximize "public health" progress in lymphedema management on a national scale, it is necessary to ensure that all those in need have both opportunity and access to the most appropriate treatments available. Such a public health dimension for patient management requires addressing a largely new set of variables with distinctly different "tools" to create new solutions. Indeed, although GPELF itself has achieved remarkable progress since its inception in 2000, this progress has been driven largely by the adoption and expansion of its MDA programs (with their distinct priorities, clear guidelines, and well-defined targets) aimed at interrupting LF transmission. However, for promoting the Program's MMDP agenda and bringing it also to the fore, significant programmatic challenges still need to be identified and addressed directly.

For example, before 2021 only 1.15 million cases of lymphedema, from an estimated total of 17 million cases, had been reported to the WHO by 61 of 72 LF-endemic countries, and only 10 of the countries had reported providing specific access to care for their affected patients. One important reason for the relatively slower (compared with MDA) progress in developing lymphedema interventions is a still incompletely developed programmatic structure for the MMDP effort, along with an absence of well-defined indicators and strategies for assessing morbidity itself, rather than just the availability of care, and tracking its alleviation. Tracking patients' improvement through a yet to be officially defined set of criteria (e.g. reduction in ADL attacks, increase in mobility, and use of the WHO QOL indicators) would be very valuable for assessing programmatic progress as well as providing good advocacy for the LF program. Although the inclusion of such morbidity indicators has been repeatedly advocated for LF control/elimination programs for years, now that the current expansion of lymphedema care programs targets providing 100% geographic national coverage with access to appropriate lymphedema care for every needy patient, the creation of a specific MMDP framework with well-defined epidemiologic indicators has become an increasingly urgent priority.

### Cancer related lymphedema [^111XiJBv]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Lymphedema is a prevalent, incurable, and morbid condition with the potential to degrade the health and quality of life of patients living with cancer and beyond cancer. Effective long term control requires coordination by an interdisciplinary team to ensure that lymphedema progression, complications, and related disablement are detected and appropriately addressed. This review provides an overview of lymphatic function and lymphedema pathogenesis with focused discussion of the unique characteristics of cancer related lymphedema (CRL) including natural history, clinical presentation, and risk factors for onset and progression. Surgical practice changes and supportive evidence for lymph node sparing and lymphatic reconstruction for CRL prevention are described. The review outlines evaluations to diagnose, stage, and monitor CRL, and characterizes evidence for current CRL prevention and management practices, including surgeries to restore lymphatic function. Multimodal management with complete decongestive therapy remains first line treatment for CRL, though patient-specific customization might be required to optimize patients' clinical response and quality of life as outlined in the review.

### Examining the efficacy of treatments for arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses [^112wnxBZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on the currently available data, there is no clear evidence of superiority of any one treatment on volume reduction nor any solid research refuting these treatments. Thus, definitive conclusions to inform clinical practice about the efficacy of these treatments cannot be drawn. Generally, research in this area is weak and more work is needed to untangle the efficacy of each treatment component for different stages of BCRL. Health care providers should not consider the lack of evidence a reason to refute these treatments to patients. Instead, it is recommended to closely monitor benefit with reliable, valid, and sensitive measures of improvement.

### Surgical procedures in lymphedema management [^112ZdkRT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Lymphedema has a high incidence and various causes. It reduces patients' quality of life and productivity and currently lacks a cure. Management is based on lifelong physical therapies. Many surgical procedures have been proposed for lymphedema without significant acceptance. This study evaluates surgical procedures aimed at the management of lymphedema and highlights present evidence.

Methods

Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation consensus, a systematic literature search (MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library) was performed to identify studies evaluating treatment outcomes after lymphedema surgery. The authors evaluated all articles found with the keywords "lymphedema" and "surgery", including experimental studies in animals. Cross referencing was made. Next, a protocol was created to assess the degree of quality of publications in this field. An overview of the complete medical literature was performed. Thereafter, publications meeting inclusion criteria were attributed a score according to the assessment protocol. This allowed an overview of the scientific quality of all surgical procedures for lymphedema.

Results

A total of 108 article texts were read and 70 publications included in this study according to predefined criteria. Lymphedema operative procedures were classified according to type. The outcomes highlighted the importance of individual patient analysis, as most interventions are not sufficiently studied to sustain clinical recommendations.

Conclusions

Risk factors for acquired lymphedema, such as lymph node excision and radiation therapy, are well identified and should allow primary prevention. Improved diagnosis, classification, standardized volume measurement, staging, and follow-up of lymphedema patients can facilitate their management and allow valid retrospective studies. Currently, there is no evidence of any treatment yielding high long-term cure rates. Therefore, lymphedema management must be based on interdisciplinary approaches, with curative or palliative therapy options discussed openly with the patient. Therapeutic plans should not exclude surgery. Nevertheless, additional studies are recommended to prove the validity of some surgical approaches.

### Lymphedema: a therapeutic approach in the treatment and rehabilitation of cancer patients [^113M5aWS]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Lymphedema therapy has gone by many names in the recent past, being referred to as complex decongestive therapy, complex physical therapy, or decongestive lymphatic therapy, among others. There are two phases of lymphedema treatment: the acute "intensive" phase and the maintenance phase. In the acute phase of treatment, the individual is typically wrapped with medical short-stretch compression bandages; receives a therapeutic exercise routine, skin care, and education; and undergoes manual lymphatic drainage by a specially trained physical therapist or healthcare professional. In the maintenance phase, the goals are for the individual to be able to wear a well-fitted appropriate gradient pressure garment during the day and compression bandaging (or a device that serves as an alternative to bandaging) at night, to maintain good skin care, to continue with therapeutic exercise, and to self-perform manual lymphatic drainage (or use a mechanical device that can perform manual lymphatic drainage) for the area of the body with impaired lymphatics. The effectiveness of the various components in each phase, as well as the motivation and compliance of the patient, differs. Further randomized trials are required to determine which component or combination of components in complex decongestive therapy works most effectively. It is recommended for patients not only to maintain physical activity for its many health benefits but also to facilitate muscle pumping to move lymphatic fluid throughout the body. Knowledge of some of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the development of lymphedema is increasing, and it is possible that current modes of treatment of lymphedema will be augmented by molecular therapies in the future.

### The treatment of lymphedema related to breast cancer: a systematic review and evidence summary [^117PkEax]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

To provide an evidence summary report on the question: What are the treatment options for women with lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer?

Methods

Cancer Care Ontario's Supportive Care Guidelines Group (SCGG) employed systematic review methodology to produce an evidence summary on this topic. Evidence-based opinions were formulated to guide clinical decision making, and a formal external review process was conducted to validate the relevance of these opinions for Ontario practitioners.

Results

The systematic review search strategy identified ten randomized controlled trials which form the basis of this evidence summary report. Four key opinions offered by the SCGG are outlined below. Responses from the practitioner feedback process supported the validity of these opinions in Ontario. (1) There is some evidence to suggest that compression therapy and manual lymphatic drainage may improve established lymphedema, but further studies are needed. Compression garments should be worn from morning to night and be removed at bedtime. Patients should be advised that lymphedema is a lifelong condition and that compression garments must be worn on a daily basis. Patients can expect stabilization and/or modest improvement of edema with the use of the garment in the prescribed fashion. (2) There is no current evidence to support the use of medical therapies, including diuretics. (3) Additional efforts to define relevant clinical outcomes for the assessment of patients with lymphedema would be valuable. (4) These opinions are appropriate for patients with more than mild lymphedema, where the signs and symptoms are considered significant from the patients' perspective.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^116TJ2WF]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic and debilitating condition characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid, most commonly in the extremities, leading to swelling, limb heaviness, and susceptibility to infections, among other uncomfortable pathologies. This condition can develop in two main forms: primary lymphedema, which is typically caused by genetic factors, and secondary lymphedema, which often results from trauma, surgical procedures, or radiation therapy, especially related to cancer treatment.

The treatment of lymphedema can be separated into medical and surgical arms, which in the ideal setting, work synergistically to improve quality of life of patients with this debilitating condition. Medical therapies consist of a combination of weight management, physical therapy, compression garments, and avoidance of infection, while surgical options can include physiological and debulking procedures. With advancements in our understanding of lymphedema, we have enhanced our ability to provide a wider range of treatments and improve patient outcomes. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment options for lymphedema, highlighting recent therapeutic advances and clinical practices.

### Lymphedema: current strategies for diagnostics and management [^116SiJwo]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphedema (LE) is characterized by the accumulation of lymph in the extremities, impairing functionality and quality of life. Despite its prevalence, accurate diagnoses and management remains complex because of inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria and limited epidemiological studies. This review aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of LE classifications, diagnostic approaches, and current management strategies. By synthesizing existing knowledge, this study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of LE for improvement of clinical consistency and education.

### Examining the efficacy of treatments for arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses [^114KSr77]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a debilitating complication of cancer treatment, primarily from surgical removal of axillary lymph nodes and radiation of the axilla, characterized by progressive swelling typically of the arm or hand affecting more than one in six breast cancer survivors. Due to the chronic nature of BCRL, it is one of the most feared sequelae with significant personal and societal impact on those affected. This has increased the interest in research in preventive and treatment strategies for BCRL.

Concurrent with the development of less invasive treatments for breast cancer, the field of lymphedema management has evolved. Treatment options for patients with cancer-related lymphedema aim to reduce excess volume of the arm and symptoms of BCRL (e.g. heaviness and swelling) and consequently reduce the lymphedema severity. Complex decongestive physical therapy (CDP) uses the following modalities in isolation or combination: a) compression bandaging or garments and therapeutic exercise to reduce infiltration, remove fluid, and remodel the limb; b) manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), a specialized massage technique to encourage lymph flow; c) skin care to protect and moisturize skin to avoid cuts and infections; and d) patient education. CDP is divided into two phases, one aiming to reduce volume and symptoms especially through compression bandaging, the second using a personalized compression garment with the aim of stabilizing the condition. Other treatment modalities for BCRL include acupuncture, kinesio taping, laser therapy, pneumatic compression pumps, cardio and resistance exercise, and surgical approaches.

There continues to be considerable debate about the efficacy of different approaches to treatment for lymphedema, particularly regarding the efficacy of MLD. To provide optimal treatment, health care professionals need to be able to identify the most effective evidence-based treatment options taking into account patient preferences, resources, and clinical setting.

Evidence relating to the efficacy of interventions for BCRL is often synthesized in intervention-specific systematic reviews. Overviews of reviews have the potential to improve access to evidence dispersed across multiple reviewsand address the growing problem of information overload by providing a way to filter large bodies of complex evidence, thereby informing decision-making in health care. To date, two overviews have assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of laser therapyand acupuncturefor treatment of BCRL, while no overviews have compiled evidence across treatment modalities.

### Managing lymphedema induced by lymphatic filariasis: implementing and improving care at the individual and programmatic levels [^116FGmZ3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness of treating individuals with LF lymphedema.

It is most important these days that both individuals with lymphedema and the health systems caring for them recognize that lymphedema is a condition that responds to good treatment. Indeed, although quantifying the effectiveness of implementing the EPC is an issue currently in need of improved long-term data, there is little doubt that implementing the EPC can be effective in preventing, or at least slowing, the worsening of lymphedematous changes, resulting in almost complete remission in low-stage cases. The EPC also has the important effect of reducing the number and severity of acute attacks and the severe consequences they can have. Although the continuing use of anthelminthic agents, at least in early infections, is also believed to be important, improvement associated with the EPC is most dramatic in those with shorter duration and lower stage conditions, though it can be seen even in patients with high-stage lymphedema.

Considering approaches used in treating non-LF associated lymphedemas.

It is valuable for those providing lymphedema care in LF-endemic countries to be aware of the approaches to lymphedema care in non–LF-endemic countries, particularly so that they might expand the range of care they currently provide if new strategies look to be safe, practical, and of benefit to the patients.

Because lymphedema is a disease caused by lymphatic functional insufficiency, the changes in affected tissues bear similarities across multiple causes. Use of treatments such as lymph node removal and radiation therapy for cancer is the greatest cause of lymphedema in affluent countries, and considerable research has been conducted on arm lymphedema among women who have undergone treatment of breast cancer. Although the incidence of breast malignancy continues to rise, the number of women experiencing arm lymphedema has significantly declined because of both an increase in the awareness of lymphedema among primary healthcare professionals (which has led to the use of lymph node–conserving surgery) and implementation of a prospective surveillance model for breast cancer patients, leading to the prevention of new lymphedema cases.

### Surgical treatment of lymphedema: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials. results of a consensus conference [^111tkkYE]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The goal of this consensus conference, sponsored by the American Association of Plastic Surgeons, was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials to examine both the benefits and risks of surgical treatment and surgical prevention of upper and lower extremity lymphedema.

Methods

The panel met in Boston for a 3-day, face-to-face meeting in July of 2017. After an exhaustive review of the existing literature, the authors created consensus recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. Important directions for future research were also identified.

Results

There is evidence to support that lymphovenous anastomosis can be effective in reducing severity of lymphedema (grade 1C). There is evidence to support that vascular lymph node transplantation can be effective in reducing severity of lymphedema (grade 1B). Currently, there is no consensus on which procedure (lymphovenous bypass versus vascular lymph node transplantation) is more effective (grade 2C). A few studies show that prophylactic lymphovenous bypass in patients undergoing extremity lymphadenectomy may reduce the incidence of lymphedema (grade 1B). More studies with longer follow-up are required to confirm this benefit. Debulking procedures such as liposuction are effective in addressing a nonfluid component such as fat involving lymphedema (grade 1C). There is a role for liposuction combined with physiologic procedures although the timing of each procedure is currently unresolved (grade 1C).

Conclusions

Many studies seem to support some efficacy of lymphovenous bypass and vascular lymph node transplantation. Many studies show the important role of lymphedema therapy and other procedures such as liposuction and debulking. The management of lymphedema is a challenging field with many promising advances. However, many questions remain unanswered.

American Venous Forum/American Vein and Lymphatic Society/Society for Vascular Medicine consensus — scope of agreement: The consensus process demonstrated that lymphedema experts agree on the majority of the statements related to risk factors for lymphedema and the diagnostic workup for lymphedema patients, with less agreement on statements related to treatment of lymphedema; this consensus suggests that variability in lymphedema care is high even among the experts, and developers of future practice guidelines for lymphedema should consider this information, especially in cases of low-level evidence that supports practice patterns with which the majority of experts disagree.

### A systematic review of guidelines for lymphedema and the need for contemporary intersocietal guidelines for the management of lymphedema [^115xxjrL]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lymphedema (LED) affects an estimated 35 million patients in the United States and a staggering 140,200 million people worldwide, yet LED is the forgotten vascular disease. Whereas the diagnosis and treatment of arterial and venous diseases have been strengthened by the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), few CPGs are available for LED. Moreover, for CPGs to have their greatest impact, they should be both of high quality and developed using the most rigorous evidence-based methods. We performed a systematic review of the available CPGs for LED, which were assessed for breadth of content and methodologic strength.

Methods

A literature search was conducted from National Guideline Clearinghouse (www.

Guidelines

gov), BMJ Clinical Evidence (http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com), and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (http://www.nice.org.uk) as well as from MEDLINE and Google, which selected 245 documents. After a horizon scan that identified 13 potential CPGs, 4 satisfied the criteria for LED. These were analyzed for inclusion of key elements of diagnosis and treatment.

Results

A horizon scan (abstract review) of the 245 documents identified 10 potential CPGs. Of the 10 documents, 6 claimed to be CPGs, but 2 were limited in scope (rehabilitation or compression only), 2 were consensus statements, 1 was a position statement, and 1 was a systematic review. This process yielded four CPGs: Lymphedema Framework Best Practice for the Management of Lymphedema; Japanese Lymphedema Study Group-A Practice Guideline for the Management of Lymphedema; Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Assessment and Management of Lymphedema; and Guidelines of the American Venous Forum. Only one of four CPGs was based on a contemporary systematic review (2016 end date of references), whereas the remainder had older systematic reviews (end dates of 2005, 2007, and 2007). Several areas of contemporary diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of LED were absent.

Conclusions

This systematic review of available LED CPGs demonstrates a limited number of guidelines. The four CPGs identified lack contemporary references while demonstrating low overall study quality. Therefore, it is imperative for our vascular societies to develop contemporary high-quality evidence-based CPGs for LED, as they have for other vascular diseases.

### Review of current surgical treatments for lymphedema [^112KJntR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The current mainstay of lymphedema therapy has been conservative nonsurgical treatment. However, surgical options for lymphedema have been reported for over a century. Early surgical procedures were often invasive and disfiguring, and they often had only limited long-term success. In contrast, contemporary surgical techniques are much less invasive and have been shown to be effective in reducing excess limb volume, the risk of cellulitis, and the need for compression garment use and lymphedema therapy. Microsurgical procedures such as lymphaticovenous anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer lymphaticolymphatic bypass can treat the excess fluid component of lymphedema swelling that presents as pitting edema. Suction-assisted protein lipectomy is a minimally invasive procedure that addresses the solid component of lymphedema swelling that typically occurs later in the disease process and presents as chronic nonpitting lymphedema. These surgical techniques are becoming increasingly popular and their success continues to be documented in the medical literature. We review the efficacy and limitations of these contemporary surgical procedures for lymphedema.

Methods

A Medline literature review was performed of lymphedema surgery, vascularized lymph node transfer, lymphaticovenous anastomosis, lymphatic liposuction, and lymphaticolymphatic bypass with particular emphasis on developments within the past 10 years. A literature review of technique, indications, and outcomes of the surgical treatments for lymphedema was undertaken.

Results

Surgical treatments have evolved to become less invasive and more effective.

Conclusions

With proper diagnosis and the appropriate selection of procedure, surgical techniques can be used to treat lymphedema safely and effectively in many patients when combined with integrated lymphedema therapy.

Lymphedema consensus methodology and evidence limitations state that results should be interpreted with several limitations, including that a systematic review was not conducted and the included studies' level of evidence was not graded using GRADE; a 6‑point Likert scale rather than a 5‑point Likert scale was used to increase precision; no specific pneumatic compression device was mentioned and evidence was based on clinical experience and judgement; the literature on all questions was weak and when agreement was very strong it was solely based on common sense and current clinical practice; no bias based on COI was identified, emphasizing the substantial need for further and more robust research and for well clinically and methodologically designed studies in lymphedema care.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^116vKX6S]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Optimal treatment for lymphedema begins with an accurate diagnosis as delineated above. Management of lymphedema includes both surgical and nonsurgical approaches, with the latter categorized into physiological and debulking procedures. Patients are initially referred for conservative management, and those who meet criteria may then proceed to surgical intervention.

Nonsurgical Management

Pharmacologic Treatment

Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of medications for treating lymphedema. Various pharmaceutical agents, including diuretics, coumarin, vitamin E, and steroids, have been discussed, but none have demonstrated compelling efficacy in managing lymphedema.

While diuretics may reduce limb volume, this effect is largely anecdotal and likely results from their action on swelling caused by conditions such as heart failure or venous stasis, rather than from treating lymphedema itself. In fact, some authors have raised concern that diuretics may exacerbate the condition by increasing the concentration of high protein fluid in the interstitial space. Similarly, coumarin, vitamin E, and pentoxifylline have been explored for their potential in preventing or treating lymphedema, but there is no supporting evidence for their effectiveness. Steroids have been shown to have a temporary benefit in lymphedema treatment, however, this effect is short-lived, and was not shown to extend beyond a month.

### Lymphedema: a comprehensive review [^111xYXvT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphedema is a chronic, debilitating condition that has traditionally been seen as refractory or incurable. Recent years have brought new advances in the study of lymphedema pathophysiology, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic tools that are changing this perspective.

Objective

To provide a systematic approach to evaluating and managing patients with lymphedema.

Methods

We performed MEDLINE searches of the English-language literature (1966 to March 2006) using the terms lymphedema, breast cancer-associated lymphedema, lymphatic complications, lymphatic imaging, decongestive therapy, and surgical treatment of lymphedema. Relevant bibliographies and International Society of Lymphology guidelines were also reviewed.

Results

In the United States, the populations primarily affected by lymphedema are patients undergoing treatment of malignancy, particularly women treated for breast cancer. A thorough evaluation of patients presenting with extremity swelling should include identification of prior surgical or radiation therapy for malignancy, as well as documentation of other risk factors for lymphedema, such as prior trauma to or infection of the affected limb. Physical examination should focus on differentiating signs of lymphedema from other causes of systemic or localized swelling. Lymphatic dysfunction can be visualized through lymphoscintigraphy; the diagnosis of lymphedema can also be confirmed through other imaging modalities, including CT or MRI. The mainstay of therapy in diagnosed cases of lymphedema involves compression garment use, as well as intensive bandaging and lymphatic massage. For patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy, several surgical options with varied proven efficacies have been used in appropriate candidates, including excisional approaches, microsurgical lymphatic anastomoses, and circumferential suction-assisted lipectomy, an approach that has shown promise for long-term relief of symptoms.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of lymphedema requires careful attention to patient risk factors and specific findings on physical examination. Noninvasive diagnostic tools and lymphatic imaging can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of lymphedema or to address a challenging clinical presentation. Initial treatment with decongestive lymphatic therapy can provide significant improvement in patient symptoms and volume reduction of edematous extremities. Selected patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy can achieve similar outcomes with surgical intervention, most promisingly suction-assisted lipectomy.

### Optimizing outcomes in lymphedema reconstruction [^116f1xJF]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe current surgical techniques for treating primary and secondary lymphedema. 2. Optimize the surgical care of patients with lymphedema.

Summary

Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the surgical treatment of lymphedema. The most notable changes have been the reintroduction and evolution of physiologic techniques, including lymphovenous bypass-sometimes referred to as lymphovenous anastomosis in the literature-and vascularized lymph node transplant. These surgical modalities are now often used as first-line surgical options or may be combined with nonphysiologic approaches, including direct excision and suction-assisted lipectomy. Surgeons continue to debate the most appropriate sequence and combination of surgical treatment, particularly for patients at both extremes of the severity spectrum. Furthermore, debate remains around the need to apply different treatment approaches for patients with upper versus lower extremity involvement and primary versus secondary cause. In this article, we provide a summary of the surgical techniques currently used for both primary and secondary lymphedema and provide our recommendations for optimizing the surgical care of patients with lymphedema.

Cancer-related therapy (CRT) and lymphedema — The panel's support for a CRT–lymphedema association is drawn from the extensive breast cancer literature, and edema has been estimated to occur in 19% of people with advanced cancer. From a Western medical context, CRT remains the most prevalent cause of lymphedema, and when addressing an individual who will be treated for cancer, the subject of lymphedema risk should be addressed and, where appropriate, surveillance and risk-reduction measures should be undertaken.

### Current views on diagnostic approach and treatment of lymphedema [^112EEUW6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and often debilitating condition. Primary lymphedema is a lymphatic malformation developing during the later stage of lymphangiogenesis. Secondary lymphedema is the result of obstruction or disruption of the lymphatic system, which can occur as a consequence of tumors, surgery, trauma, infection, inflammation, and radiation therapy. In this review, we report an update upon the diagnostic approach and the medical and surgical therapy for both primary and secondary lymphedema.

Lymphedema conservative care — MLD evidence and trials indicate limited standalone benefit. MLD is a major component of Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT), but the evidence for proving that MLD alone is an effective treatment is poor. In a randomized study on 42 patients assigned to 2 weeks of MLD plus hosiery versus hosiery alone, improvements in both groups were attributable to compression sleeves and MLD provided no extra benefit. A Cochrane review found little quality evidence for effectiveness, and a systematic review identified eight studies assessing MLD impact on quality of life with only one of the eight describing a statistically improved QOL; moreover, only one study of five showed a significant reduction in absolute lymphedema volume compared to control. A Cochrane systematic review reported two trials of MLD for breast cancer patients with small samples ranging from 24 to 45 participants and inadequate blinding; in two trials comparing MLD plus compression bandages versus compression bandages alone, response depended on the objective outcome measure, with significant percent volume reduction visible by water displacement but not by opto-electronic limb volumetry or circumferential tape measurements.

### Examining the efficacy of treatments for arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses [^11245Yjh]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Lymphedema affects one in six breast cancer survivors making it a global healthcare challenge. There is considerable debate about the efficacy of different treatments for lymphedema. We aimed to summarize the current evidence for treatments for lymphedema in breast cancer survivors.

Methods

In this overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses (SRMAs), five databases were searched for SRMAs of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting effects of medications, surgery, exercise, laser therapy, acupuncture, kinesio taping, or complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP) for breast cancer-related lymphedema published from database inception up to March 7, 2023. Data extraction was performed for the SRMAs and RCTs, and SRMAs were appraised with AMSTAR2. Random effects meta-analyses of the RCTs provided estimates of the pooled effects sizes (Hedges' g) for each treatment modality. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020184813.

Findings

1569 studies were identified by the search and eighteen SRMAs with 51 RCTs were included, investigating manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression pump, exercise, kinesio taping, laser, and acupuncture. Overall, the methodological quality of the SRMAs was low. SRMAs reached different conclusions for all treatment modalities, except for kinesio taping where the two SRMAs found no effect. The analysis of 40 RCTs with 1970 participants revealed a small effect across all interventions compared to any control (g = 0.20, p = 0.047, I² = 0.79), corresponding to volume reductions of 119.7 mL (95% CI 135–104) and 88.0 mL (95% CI 99–77) in the intervention and control groups, respectively, and a small effect of exercise (g = 0.26, p = 0.022, I² = 0.44). The between-group differences in volume reduction were small and did not reach statistical significance for any one treatment modality.

Interpretation

Based on the available data, there is no evidence of superiority of any one treatment on volume reduction nor any solid research refuting these treatments. Thus, definitive conclusions to inform clinical practice about the efficacy of these treatments cannot be drawn. Due to poor-quality evidence, more research is needed to untangle the efficacy of each treatment component for different stages of lymphedema.

### Lymphedema: diagnostic workup and management [^115XEHwz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment. It is caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is a chronic progressive disease with serious physical and psychosocial implications. It can be challenging to diagnose, especially in obese patients and in those with coexisting venous disease. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, lymphedema management, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. There are currently no standard guidelines for the diagnosis of lymphedema. There is no cure yet for lymphedema, and the objective for management is to limit disease progression and prevent complications.

Lymphedema treatment principles and compression technologies — The condition "is a progressive and incurable disease", making "early diagnosis and intervention, analogous to treatments for cancer or other progressive disease, is paramount", with "Intervention at pre-fibrotic (Stages 1–2) or even subclinical (Stage 0) stages is widely considered optimal for best results". For venous overlap, "All patients with edema due to chronic venous insufficiency should be considered for treatment similar to lymphedema patients", and recognition of coexistence "should prompt consideration for instituting advanced compressive modalities such as complete decongestive lymphatic physiotherapy and pneumatic compression pumps". For maintenance, "The expert panel identified the use of compression for maintaining limb volume reduction as opposed to a primary method of decongestion", and "Circular knit compression, flat knit compression and Velcro devices all garner support from the panelists". "Decongestive therapy with SPC and MLD as part of an overall complex decongestive therapy program were also recognized, while surgical therapy had less support from the expert panel". Device-oriented evidence noted that "APCDs (advanced pneumatic compression devices with calibrated gradient pressure) were superior to simpler devices (without calibrated gradient pressure)", and "The use of the trunk piece was felt by some to augment the physiologic effect".

Table 3
Pooled effect sizes of randomized controlled trials of the effect of treatment on lymphedema volume.

The moderator analyses suggested that the effects on volume reduction were: a) smaller in patients with ALND for all interventions; b) larger for CDP in older patients; and c) larger for CDP in patients with longer lymphedema duration (Supplementary File 8).

The supplementary Bayesian meta-analyses confirmed the weak evidence for the efficacy of lymphedema treatments (Supplementary File 9). The results indicated only anecdotal evidence for an overall effect of treatment (k = 40), with an effect different from zero being only 1.85 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Likewise, the effect of exercise being different from zero was only 2.28 times more likely than the null hypothesis (k = 13). Similarly, while the analysis of CDP favored the null hypothesis, it was only 2.31 times more likely than the alternative hypothesis.

Across all interventions, the volume reduction was 119.7 mL (95% CI 135.0–104.5) for the intervention groups and 88.0 mL (95% CI 99.0–77.1) for the control groups (Table 4). While the overall mean between-group difference in volume reduction was small (6.1 ml) but statistically significant (p = 0.039), the mean between-group differences in volume reduction were small and non-significant for all individual treatment modalities.

### Current diagnostic measures for lymphedema: a comprehensive review [^115XzG3q]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphedema presents diagnostic challenges due to complex symptomatology and multifaceted onset. This literature review synthesizes diagnostic measures ranging from clinical assessments to advanced imaging techniques and emerging technologies. It explores the challenges in early detection and delves into the disparities in access to advanced diagnostic tools, which exacerbate health outcome differences across populations. This review not only provides insights into the effectiveness of current diagnostic modalities but also underscores the necessity for ongoing research and innovation. The goal is to enhance the accuracy, affordability, and accessibility of lymphedema diagnostics. This is crucial for guiding future research directions and for the development of standardized diagnostic protocols that could help mitigate the progression of lymphedema and enhance the quality of life for affected individuals.

### A review of treatment for breast cancer-related lymphedema: paradigms for clinical practice [^1177KDRn]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) represents a major complication of breast cancer treatment, impacting the quality of life for breast cancer survivors that develop it. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the literature surrounding BCRL treatment modalities to guide clinicians regarding risk-stratified treatment options.

Methods

A review of studies over a 10-year period (January 2006 to February 2016) was performed. Noninvasive strategies evaluated included compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and complex decongestive therapy (CDT). Invasive modalities evaluated included liposuction and lymphatic bypass/lymph node transfer (LNT). Our search yielded 149 initial results with 45 studies included.

Results

A number of prospective studies have found that CDT is associated with volume reduction in the affected limb as well as improved quality of life, particularly in patients with early stage BCRL. With regards to invasive treatment options, data support that lymphatic bypass and LNT are associated with symptomatic and physiologic improvements, particularly in patients with more advanced BCRL. In addition, a small number of studies suggest that liposuction may be an efficacious and safe treatment for moderate to severe BCRL.

Conclusions

CDT is an effective treatment modality for early stage BCRL. For more advanced BCRL, LNT has demonstrated efficacy. Further study is required with respect to comparing BCRL treatment modalities.

Lymphedema is a common, complex, and inexplicably underappreciated human disease. Despite a history of relative neglect by health care providers and by governmental health care agencies, the last decade has seen an explosive growth of insights into, and approaches to, the problem of human lymphedema. The current review highlights the significant advances that have occurred in the investigative and clinical approaches to lymphedema, particularly over the last decade. This review summarizes the progress that has been attained in the realms of genetics, lymphatic imaging, and lymphatic surgery. Newer molecular insights are explored, along with their relationship to future molecular therapeutics. Growing insights into the relationships among lymphedema, obesity, and other comorbidities are important to consider in current and future responses to patients with lymphedema.

Because strategies for improving lymphedema therapy are likely to emerge from a better understanding of the disease itself, study of its pathogenesis and immunopathology in animal models and human patients is essential; it is, however, also important to study patients with lymphedema of nonparasite etiology to identify potential new targets or mechanisms that could improve treatment of lymphedema from any cause, especially in the early stages of the condition. Indeed, it is incumbent on those focused on lymphedema due to LF to also be aware of research and improvements being developed for nonfilarial lymphedema as well.

Improved clinical tools.

Importantly, increased understanding of both the pathogenesis of lymphedema and its clinical response to treatments requires development of better tools to assess and monitor changes in individual patients. For example, assessing a lymphedematous limb using new noninvasive imaging technologies (e.g. thermography and magnetic resonance imaging,) can help to relate observed changes to ongoing clinical signs and symptoms; indeed, repeated observations over time are likely to be particularly informative compared with assessments made just at single time points. Investigating the dermal changes using newer noninvasive techniques such as optical coherence tomography are likely to be informative, especially as standard dermal biopsies are ill-advised owing to the altered healing processes present in lymphedematous skin.

### Examining the efficacy of treatments for arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses [^112GA8y6]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our quality check revealed inconsistent reporting of the RCTs across the SRMAs. For this reason, we extracted data from all the RCTs, which revealed incorrect reporting by almost half of the SRMAs. While some of these issues may not have impacted the conclusions of a SRMA (e.g. incorrect registration of sample size), other issues may directly have impacted the result (e.g. pooling of different types of outcome measures). In contrast to the conclusions of some SRMAs, we only found a significant effect of one treatment modality, namely exercise. This underscores the absolute importance of a rigorous approach to conducting SRMAs.

Observing no benefit of any of the treatment modalities compared to active control conditions raises the question whether all modalities are equally beneficial or inefficacious. Across modalities, the mean volume reduction was 119 mL in intervention groups and 88 mL in control groups, with even smaller reductions in non-active controls (13 ml). It is important to note that clinically important differences in arm volume may be defined differently by the patient, the lymphedema therapist, and the health care system. Lymphedema therapists will typically aim for "maximum" reduction until sufficient stabilization of the condition to order a compression garment, the patient may want a "sufficient" reduction for the swelling to be invisible or have minimum impact on everyday activities, and the health care system will aim for "minimum" to reduce costs of hospitalization due to infection. Given the progressive nature of lymphedema where the condition is expected to worsen if left untreated, the treatment modalities may be considered to be equally beneficial. Importantly, as volume reductions are also seen in the control groups, it is unclear whether the reductions found in the intervention groups can be attributed to the intervention rather than spontaneous remission. Certainly, more work is needed by the research community to develop evidence-based treatments, including surgical interventions, for BCRL which affects hundreds of thousands of women worldwide. Thus, strategies to prevent BCRL are even more important. Recent and ongoing trials contribute to evidence for preventing BCRL using prospective surveillance and early management, or prophylactic use of compression sleevesfor those at high risk.

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^111fLXhy]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema evaluation — swelling quantification and AFTD-pitting test emphasize objective measurement at baseline and follow up and describe a consensus tool with a duration threshold. The page states that to evaluate treatment one "has to be able to quantify the amount of swelling at initial visit and during follow up", and because swelling is the presenting symptom it is "important to have an objective measure of initial swelling… and progressively evaluate whether the treatment reduces swelling". Practicality and standardization concerns are noted, yet a consensus "advocated the use of the AFTD-pitting test… using edema of > 3 months duration as a surrogate for lymphedema", although "low inter-observer reliability was reported in another cohort with milder lymphedema". For diagnostic confidence in early disease, "some of the experts consider additional assessment such as limb volume, physiologic changes, or lymphatic imaging necessary to make a confident diagnosis of Stage 0 and 1 lymphedema", and "Patients want to have confidence in their diagnosis… some are interested" in imaging to increase diagnostic confidence.

Manual lymph drainage (MLD) and complex decongestive therapy (CDT) — In breast cancer-related lymphedema, compression bandaging alone achieved baseline excess volume reductions of 30%–38.6%, with an additional 7.11% reduction for MLD (MLD 7.11%, 95% CI 1.75%–12.47%; two RCTs; 83 participants). Volume reduction was not significant (p = 0.06) and lymphedema volume was also not significant (p = NS), although subgroup analyses demonstrated that participants with mild-to-moderate breast cancer-related lymphedema responded better to MLD than those with moderate-to-severe disease. For lower extremity lymphedema, a systematic review of 2119 studies found only five clinical trials, and the largest RCT (n = 272) showed that lymphedema volume was reduced in both groups.

### Lower extremity lymphedema update: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines [^1166sYLs]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Lower extremity lymphedema is an important medical issue which causes morbidity and is frequently seen by dermatologists. The subject has not been adequately addressed in dermatologic literature for many years. Primary lymphedema is caused by an inherent malfunction of the lymph-carrying channel, in which no direct outside cause can be found. Secondary lymphedema is caused by an outside force, such as tumors, scar tissue after radiation, or removal of lymph nodes, which results in dysfunction of the lymph-carrying channels. Treatment is based on rerouting the lymph fluid through remaining functional lymph vessels. This is accomplished through elevation, exercises, compression garments/devices, manual lymph drainage, and treatment is combined with good skin care practices.

### Barcelona consensus paper on reconstructive lymphedema surgery: a Delphi study [^1157gnE1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lymphedema, a chronic condition characterized by accumulation of lymph fluid due to malfunction of the lymphatic system, remains a significant clinical challenge despite advances in diagnosis and treatment. Given that lymphatic surgery is an important therapeutic option, the aim of the present study was to establish an expert consensus on recommendations for improving the surgical management of lymphedema.

Methods

This was an international consensus study involving a modified nominal group and Delphi process. During the World Symposium for Lymphedema Surgery in 2023, the steering group invited five experts to participate in a nominal group with the aim of drawing up a set of seven preliminary recommendations. These recommendations were then evaluated and revised by a panel of 31 international experts in a two-round Delphi process. The threshold for consensus was set at a minimum of 70% agreement among panelists.

Results

Consensus regarding the content of the seven recommendations was high (mean overall agreement of 79.6%). Agreement was highest for the recommendations concerning specific techniques of reconstructive surgery, measures for preventing lymphedema and its clinical assessment, and post-intervention follow-up protocols.

Conclusions

The consensus recommendations on the surgical management of lymphedema highlight the importance of preoperative preparation of patients and careful clinical assessment. Also recommended is the use of preventive surgical procedures, including the combination of reconstructive and reductive techniques, along with multidisciplinary monitoring and follow up. Although these guidelines hold promise, further studies are required to evaluate their implementation and explore their impact on patient health outcomes.

### Updates on excisional procedures for lymphedema [^112xLgx3]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: Excisional procedures for lymphedema have been used for over a century, and many surgeons have abandoned the old techniques as improvements in nonsurgical management and microsurgery have limited their clinical utility. Nonetheless, excisional procedures remain relevant as an important tool in the comprehensive surgical management of lymphedema. Recent Advances: Modifications to the Charles procedure and other direct excisional procedures have improved the complication profile and patient outcomes. Moreover, the use of liposuction techniques for minimally invasive tissue excision has expanded the scope of excisional surgery to benefit patients with less severe lymphedema. Recent operations combining excisional and physiologic procedures may prove to have superior results to stand-alone procedures. Critical Issues: No standard protocol exists for the comprehensive surgical management of lymphedema. Proper patient selection for any procedure requires robust outpatient assessment, cooperation with physiotherapy treatment teams, careful patient stratification, and a clear understanding of the procedure's goal. Future Directions: Larger, prospective trials will be needed to elucidate the ideal timing and combinations of techniques to optimize outcomes for patients with late-stage lymphedema.

### Examining the efficacy of treatments for arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses [^1132KCu1]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first overview evaluating the efficacy of different treatment modalities for BCRL. Six modalities, namely MLD, compression pump, exercise, kinesio taping, laser therapy, and acupuncture were identified with between two and seven SRMAs assessing each modality. Overall, the methodological quality of the SRMAs was low, the risk of bias of the included primary studies were high, and they reached different conclusions for most treatment modalities, with the exception of kinesio taping where the two SRMAs were unable to demonstrate an effect. Further, our meta-analysis of the RCTs included in the SRMAs revealed no clear benefit of any of the treatment modalities, regardless of whether they were compared to active or non-active control conditions. This conclusion was further supported by the results of the Bayesian meta-analyses indicating only small differences between the probabilities of the null and alternative hypotheses and thus neither clear evidence to support nor refute the efficacy of these treatments.

The top research priorities within lymphedema management identified by patients and clinicians include identification of the most efficacious treatments. Given the inconclusive evidence regarding the superiority of treatments, even when compared to non-active control conditions, this remains the principal research priority. In line with our findings, two recent overviews of acupunctureand laser therapyreported poor quality of evidence and inability to demonstrate superiority of these treatments in reducing volume for BCRL. Other research priorities are to test the efficacy of MLD. Based on the available evidence, there appears to be no volume reduction of MLD (mean difference +5.7 ml, n = 336), compression pump (−4.6 ml, n = 78), or exercise (−7.2 ml, n = 514), which is in line with recently published work.

Lymphedema — compression sleeve usage notes that adherence to the compression sleeve is associated with the lowest risk for regaining edema and that regular use did not reduce swelling but prevented worsening; in intensive-phase studies edema volume reduction was limited to 50 mL, so a compression sleeve should be provided in the maintenance phase and should not be used in the intensive phase unless very early after onset of lymphedema.

### Lymphedema: a primer on the identification and management of a chronic condition in oncologic treatment [^111195SU]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

The primary goals of oncologic therapy are the compassionate care of cancer patients, eradication of disease, and palliation of symptoms. Advances in various targeted therapies such as highly conformal and image-guided radiotherapy techniques, sentinel lymph node dissection, and molecularly targeted agents hold the promise of allowing those goals to be reached with fewer treatment-related complications. Unfortunately, certain side effects remain problematic due to the inability to completely avoid injuring normal tissues. Lymphedema, a chronic condition that occurs as a result of the body's inability to drain lymph fluid from the tissues, is a common treatment-related side effect experienced by cancer patients. In this review, many of the important aspects of lymphedema with which clinicians who treat cancer patients should be familiar are outlined, including the anatomy, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of this condition. The authors also identify some of the resources available both to cancer patients with lymphedema and to the clinicians who treat them. It is hoped that this review will convey the importance of the early identification and management of this incurable disorder because this is essential to minimizing its complications.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of exercise for those with cancer-related lymphedema [^112tJF6W]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of exercise on cancer-related lymphedema and related symptoms, and to determine the need for those with lymphedema to wear compression during exercise.

Data Sources

CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, PubMed, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source, ScienceDirect, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched for trials published before January 1, 2015.

Study Selection

Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials and single-group pre-post studies published in English were included. Twenty-one (exercise) and 4 (compression and exercise) studies met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted into tabular format using predefined data fields by 1 reviewer and assessed for accuracy by a second reviewer. Study quality was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled using a random-effects model to assess the effects of acute and long-term exercise on lymphedema and lymphedema-associated symptoms, with subgroup analyses for exercise mode and intervention length. There was no effect of exercise (acute or intervention) on lymphedema or associated symptoms, with standardized mean differences from all analyses ranging between -0.2 and 0.1 (P values ≥ .22). Findings from subgroup analyses for exercise mode (aerobic, resistance, mixed, other) and intervention duration (> 12wk or ≤ 12wk) were consistent with these findings-that is, no effect on lymphedema or associated symptoms. There were too few studies evaluating the effect of compression during regular exercise to conduct a meta-analysis.

Conclusions

Individuals with secondary lymphedema can safely participate in progressive, regular exercise without experiencing a worsening of lymphedema or related symptoms. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the current clinical recommendation to wear compression garments during regular exercise.

### Compression garments versus compression bandaging in decongestive lymphatic therapy for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized controlled trial [^117KQEVe]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphedema as a result of curative surgery for breast cancer can lead to long-term morbidity. Decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT) is recognized as an optimal management strategy for patients with moderate symptomatologies, but there is little data in regard to the most effective means of providing compression therapy within a DLT protocol. We conducted a randomized trial of two forms of compression therapy within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for breast cancer-related lymphedema.

Methods

Subjects were required to have mild-moderate lymphedema (10–40% volume difference) acquired as a result of curative breast cancer surgery and were randomized to compression bandaging or garments within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol. Primary endpoint was change in affected limb volume assessed via volumetry, and secondary endpoints were symptom control and upper extremity function assessed via visual analogue scales and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, respectively. Endpoints were assessed at day 10 of treatment and at 3 months and compared to baseline.

Results

Twenty-one subjects were available for analysis. The group receiving bandaging experienced greater median volume reductions at 10 days (70 vs. 5 mL; p = 0.387) and at 3 months (97.5 vs. 50 mL; p = 0.182). The bandaging group also experienced a greater increase in median DASH scores at 10 days (+20.9 vs. +5; p = 0.143) and at 3 months (+18.4 vs. +3.3; p = 0.065).

Conclusion

Within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for acquired, breast cancer-related lymphedema, compression bandaging may lead to greater volume reduction but worse upper extremity functional status (higher DASH scores) as compared to compression garments.

### A systematic review of pharmacologic and cell-based therapies for treatment of lymphedema (2010–2021) [^116bHniu]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lymphedema describes the accumulation of interstitial fluid that results from lymphatic failure. Lymphedema can be of primary or secondary origin and has been estimated to affect 200 million people worldwide. Secondary lymphedema is commonly due to damage to the lymphatic vessels after surgical procedures. Treatments include compression bandaging and exercise regimens. However, at present, no pharmacologic therapy has been approved. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had investigated pharmacologic and cell-based therapies for secondary lymphedema.

Methods

We searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2010 to May 2021. Only RCTs that had investigated pharmacologic and/or cell-based therapies for secondary lymphedema were eligible for inclusion. Those studies that had examined only active filarial infection were excluded. Two of us (J.W. S.T.) independently screened the studies for eligibility.

Results

We identified eight RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were of poor quality with a high risk of bias. Ketoprofen demonstrated promising improvements in skin thickness and tissue histopathologic scores. Some evidence was found to suggest that doxycycline might be beneficial for nonfilarial secondary lymphedema, and a single, small RCT demonstrated that selenium might also confer some benefit. Neither synbiotics nor platelet-rich plasma resulted in reduced lymphedema volumes or symptom severity. Also, although bone marrow-derived stem cells resulted in improved symptom scores, no significant volume reduction was detected. Although positive results were demonstrated in trials investigating benzopyrones, previous meta-analyses have cast doubt on their efficacy. No two studies assessed the same intervention; thus, we could not perform a meta-analysis.

Conclusions

Although the results from some studies appeared promising, the available evidence at present is insufficient for any pharmacologic or cell-based therapy for patients with secondary lymphedema. Furthermore, large, high-quality RCTs are required before treatment recommendations will be possible.

### Overview of lymph node transfer for lymphedema treatment [^111p6vp4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Recent articles report that surgery can effectively treat secondary lymphedema. Lymphovenous anastomosis with supermicrosurgery technique has become popular for surgical intervention for lymphedema and has an advantage of minimal morbidity. Lymphovenous anastomosis is effective for treating early-stage lymphedema before fibrosis occurs but has limited outcomes in advanced lymphedema. Lymph node transfer is an emerging physiologic surgical treatment for lymphedema that shows promise. The mechanisms of lymph node transfer have been discordant between publications. However, initial reports encourage surgeons to use lymph node transfer to treat lymphedema patients. The authors review the literature on lymph node transfer and discuss its possible mechanisms and its role in lymphedema treatment.

The panel reached consensus that "cancer, infection, chronic venous disease, and surgery are risk factors for secondary lymphedema", and that "clinical examination is adequate for diagnosing lymphedema and that all patients with chronic venous insufficiency (C3–C6) should be treated as lymphedema patients". "No consensus was reached regarding routine clinical practice use of radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy as a mandatory diagnostic tool", but consensus supported "the importance of quantifying edema in all patients (93.6% in favor)". For treatment, consensus favored "the regular use of compression garments to reduce lymphedema progression (89.4% in favor, 10.6% against; mean score of 79)".

### Towards an effective management of chronic lymphedema [^112KG42R]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Lymph conduit perturbation causes lymph stasis and the local accumulation of interstitial fluid. Lymphedema, a chronic and debilitating disorder, remains incurable despite the advances in the description of its pathomechanism and the improvement of conservative and nonsurgical treatments. The gold standard of lymphedema treatment is multicomponent decongestive physiotherapy. Manual lymph drainage, compression bandaging, skin care, and exercises constitute the therapeutic regimen that could be adjusted with intermittent pneumatic compression. Prophylaxis could give a major benefit to risk group patients; however, the assessment of preventive approaches postulates further clinical trials. Surgery represents an emerging stakeholder in lymphedema care, although, the partnership with adjunctive nonsurgical therapy is still alive. Liposuction proved to be one of the most promising technique with the clearance of the lymph stasis-related adipose tissue. Regeneration of lymphatic tunnels with lymphovenous anastomoses or the transplantation of lymph vessels or small veins is based on long-term experience. The success of lymph node transplantation is still under evaluation, but this novel technique has produced notable improvements.

Lymphedema in children is rare; however, it is usually a progressive and chronic condition. Accurate diagnosis of lymphedema in the pediatric population often takes several months and sometimes is delayed for years. Lymphedema can be isolated or associated with genetic syndromes, thus it is very important to identify the correct diagnosis, to select carefully which patients to refer for genetic testing, and to initiate appropriate treatment in a timely fashion. In this article, we review key information about diagnosis of lymphedema, associated conditions and syndromes, and current treatment modalities.

### The Dutch lymphedema guidelines based on the international classification of functioning, disability, and health and the chronic care model [^113KJgy1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic and progressive condition due to an imbalance between lymphatic filtration and transport capacity. A relative overload of fluid is caused by lymphatic impairment (afterload impairment); an absolute overload is caused by increased filtration (preload raised). Lymphedema can result in considerable disability and loss of quality of life. The Dutch Society of Dermatology organized a task force to create guidelines using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. As lymphedema is a chronic condition, a new approach was chosen according to the chronic care model. In the development of the guidelines, the following topics of lymphedema care were proposed: (1) lymphedema detection; (2) clinimetric instruments; and (3) rational treatment modalities. A systematic review of the literature published up to June 2013 was conducted. Statements were based on scientific evidence and experience. The guidelines propose recommendations based on an interdisciplinary approach to lymphedema using a continuum of care from prevention to initial treatment phase, maintenance phase, and follow-up. An integrated treatment program can be conservative or surgical. A therapeutic program depends on stage and origin of lymphedema; International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health-based limitations; needs of the patient; ability to perform self-management; and ability to reduce patient-related risk factors, such as overweight and lack of exercise.

### Patient-reported outcome measures in lymphedema: a systematic review and COSMIN analysis [^114jGqP2]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lymphedema is a chronic and debilitating condition that affects many cancer survivors. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can give valuable insight into the impact of lymphedema on a patient's quality of life and can play an essential role in treatment decisions. This study aims to (1) identify PROMs used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with lymphedema; and (2) assess the quality of the lymphedema-specific PROMs.

Methods

We performed a systematic search to identify articles on lymphedema, quality of life, and PROMs. An overview was created of all PROMs used to assess HRQoL in patients with lymphedema. The methodological quality of the lymphedema-specific PROMs was assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) criteria.

Results

A total of 235 articles met the inclusion criteria, of which 200 described studies using one or more PROMs as an outcome measure in patients with lymphedema. The other 35 studies described the development and/or validation of a lymphedema-specific PROM. The COSMIN assessment demonstrated that none of these PROMs met all quality standards for development.

Conclusion

The use of PROMs in lymphedema is increasing; however, based on our findings, we cannot fully support the use of any of the existing instruments. A well-developed lymphedema-specific PROM, based on patient input, is needed to gain better insight into the impact of this condition, and can be used to measure the effect of possible medical and surgical treatments.

### Manual lymphatic drainage for lymphedema following breast cancer treatment [^1119puNe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

More than one in five patients who undergo treatment for breast cancer will develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). BCRL can occur as a result of breast cancer surgery and/or radiation therapy. BCRL can negatively impact comfort, function, and quality of life (QoL). Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), a type of hands-on therapy, is frequently used for BCRL and often as part of complex decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT is a fourfold conservative treatment which includes MLD, compression therapy (consisting of compression bandages, compression sleeves, or other types of compression garments), skin care, and lymph-reducing exercises (LREs). Phase 1 of CDT is to reduce swelling; Phase 2 is to maintain the reduced swelling.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of MLD in treating BCRL.

Search Methods

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform), and Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register from root to 24 May 2013. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of women with BCRL. The intervention was MLD. The primary outcomes were (1) volumetric changes, (2) adverse events. Secondary outcomes were (1) function, (2) subjective sensations, (3) QoL, (4) cost of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on three volumetric outcomes. (1) LE (lymphedema) volume was defined as the amount of excess fluid left in the arm after treatment, calculated as volume in mL of affected arm post-treatment minus unaffected arm post-treatment. (2) Volume reduction was defined as the amount of fluid reduction in mL from before to after treatment calculated as the pretreatment LE volume of the affected arm minus the post-treatment LE volume of the affected arm. (3) Per cent reduction was defined as the proportion of fluid reduced relative to the baseline excess volume, calculated as volume reduction divided by baseline LE volume multiplied by 100. We entered trial data into Review Manger 5.2 (RevMan), pooled data using a fixed-effect model, and analyzed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also explored subgroups to determine whether mild BCRL compared to moderate or severe BCRL, and BCRL less than a year compared to more than a year was associated with a better response to MLD.

Main Results

Six trials were included. Based on similar designs, trials clustered in three categories.(1) MLD + standard physiotherapy versus standard physiotherapy (one trial) showed significant improvements in both groups from baseline but no significant between-groups differences for per cent reduction.(2) MLD + compression bandaging versus compression bandaging (two trials) showed significant per cent reductions of 30% to 38.6% for compression bandaging alone, and an additional 7.11% reduction for MLD (MD 7.11%, 95% CI 1.75% to 12.47%; two RCTs; 83 participants). Volume reduction was borderline significant (P = 0.06). LE volume was not significant. Subgroup analyses was significant showing that participants with mild-to-moderate BCRL were better responders to MLD than were moderate-to-severe participants.(3) MLD + compression therapy versus nonMLD treatment + compression therapy (three trials) were too varied to pool. One of the trials compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus pneumatic pump. Volume reduction was statistically significant favoring MLD (MD 47.00 mL, 95% CI 15.25 mL to 78.75 mL; 1 RCT; 24 participants), per cent reduction was borderline significant (P = 0.07), and LE volume was not significant. A second trial compared compression sleeve plus MLD to compression sleeve plus self-administered simple lymphatic drainage (SLD), and was significant for MLD for LE volume (MD -230.00 mL, 95% CI -450.84 mL to -9.16 mL; 1 RCT; 31 participants) but not for volume reduction or per cent reduction. A third trial of MLD + compression bandaging versus SLD + compression bandaging was not significant (P = 0.10) for per cent reduction, the only outcome measured (MD 11.80%, 95% CI -2.47% to 26.07%, 28 participants).MLD was well tolerated and safe in all trials. Two trials measured function as range of motion with conflicting results. One trial reported significant within-groups gains for both groups, but no between-groups differences. The other trial reported there were no significant within-groups gains and did not report between-groups results. One trial measured strength and reported no significant changes in either group. Two trials measured QoL, but results were not usable because one trial did not report any results, and the other trial did not report between-groups results. Four trials measured sensations such as pain and heaviness. Overall, the sensations were significantly reduced in both groups over baseline, but with no between-groups differences. No trials reported cost of care. Trials were small ranging from 24 to 45 participants. Most trials appeared to randomize participants adequately. However, in four trials the person measuring the swelling knew what treatment the participants were receiving, and this could have biased results.

Authors' Conclusions

MLD is safe and may offer additional benefit to compression bandaging for swelling reduction. Compared to individuals with moderate-to-severe BCRL, those with mild-to-moderate BCRL may be the ones who benefit from adding MLD to an intensive course of treatment with compression bandaging. This finding, however, needs to be confirmed by randomized data. In trials where MLD and sleeve were compared with a nonMLD treatment and sleeve, volumetric outcomes were inconsistent within the same trial. Research is needed to identify the most clinically meaningful volumetric measurement, to incorporate newer technologies in LE assessment, and to assess other clinically relevant outcomes such as fibrotic tissue formation. Findings were contradictory for function (range of motion), and inconclusive for quality of life. For symptoms such as pain and heaviness, 60% to 80% of participants reported feeling better regardless of which treatment they received. One-year follow-up suggests that once swelling had been reduced, participants were likely to keep their swelling down if they continued to use a custom-made sleeve.

### Lymphedema management in patients with head and neck cancer: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on physical therapy interventions [^114CVAhD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Lymphedema is one of the most common side effects following oncological treatment. This systematic review analyzed the latest literature concerning the efficacy of physical therapy interventions in treating secondary lymphedema in patients with head and neck cancer.

Methods

Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies published before August 2023. Randomized controlled trials in which physical therapy was applied to treat lymphedema in head and neck cancer were included. Reviewers blinded screened the articles retrieved, scored methodological quality, and extracted data. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023439643). Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane tools.

Results

A total of four randomized controlled trials were included. They comprise 167 patients, and only one of the studies achieved a low risk of bias. Interventions were kinesio taping, compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage and/or exercise applied in combination with skin care and self-management. Some adverse effects related to intervention were mild and transitory.

Conclusion

The findings shown by this review were that an exercise program plus manual lymphatic drainage supplemented with kinesio taping or compression therapy could be beneficial for external lymphedema. Neither therapy achieved an improvement in internal lymphedema.

At the conclusion of this review, the authors were left with unanswerable questions. Is there a benefit for pre-operative CDT? What defines a failed CDT or conservative management of BCRL? What are the markers for pre-operative optimization (prehabilitation)? Do the outcomes of surgery reflect the pre- or post-operative conservative interventions? Are there established peri-operative guidelines to bridge the gap of knowledge and care between lymphedema surgeons and lymphedema therapists?

Lymphedema diagnostic approach — For initial assessment, "clinical recognition of lymphedema is preferred over additional testing", and "Certainly, venous duplex will be done in nearly all patients". "Lymphoscintigraphy or ICG imaging while only available in specialized centers may be helpful to identify stage 0 or I disease or to provide confirmation to patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear". When intervention is contemplated, "Imaging and physiologic testing is required for diagnosis when invasive treatment for lymphedema is planned or when the patient is part of a research trial".

Lymphedema pathophysiology and the role of venous disease — Contemporary physiology indicates that "there was no steady state venous reabsorption of microvascular fluid but rather steady, dwindling filtration", and "the lymphatics, not the venules, are predominantly responsible for maintaining tissue fluid balance by absorbing interstitial fluid and ultimately returning it into the circulation". Expert statements note that "lymphatic failure is responsible for all forms of peripheral edema" and that "all chronic edema indicates an inadequacy or failure of lymph drainage", and the panel acknowledges "the significant contribution from CVI". Accordingly, "The edema associated with CVI (C3–C6) represents lymphatic failure or phlebolymphedema".

Lymphedema diagnosis — clinical examination and imaging describe that clinical exam can be sufficient for characteristic presentations, with ultrasound broadly used for venous evaluation and selective confirmatory imaging in lower stages. It is stated that the diagnosis of Clinical Stage 2–3 lymphedema can be confidently made with clinical examination alone based on very characteristic findings. The page notes, "Ultrasound will be done in nearly all patients to evaluate the venous system", but also that evaluation for lower stage disease is "limited to centers of excellence". When invasive treatment or a research trial is planned, "an imaging or physiological test is required", and such information "is also valuable to help educate patients, encourage the use of compression, and to guide and assess treatment responses". For confirmatory testing, "Lymphoscintigraphy was the most commonly cited", though it "involves several hours of a patient's time" and intradermal radiotracer injection into the foot. Indocyanine green near-infrared fluorescence lymphography "requires equipment that is currently only found in select lymphatic surgery centers", yet is "increasingly being used by lymphatic surgeons to refine assessment of the clinical stage, observe lymphatic function real-time, and localize lymphatic reflux and leak points".

Weight Loss and Exercise

Obesity has been shown to be a major risk factor in the development of lymphedema, with multiple studies showing that patients with a higher body mass index are more significantly more likely to develop lymphedema. – It reasons that weight loss should be a beneficial adjunct in helping to reduce limb volume; however, this has not been borne out in the literature with certainty. A 2007 randomized controlled trial examined the impact of weight reduction on breast-cancer related lymphedema, with results showing significant reduction in arm volume in the weight-reduction group after 12 weeks; however, this study was limited by a small sample size. Since then, larger, more recent studies have reported fewer promising results, indicating that weight loss does not improve lymphedema symptoms. Schmitz et al. found in a large-scale randomized clinical trial that weight loss and exercise did not significantly improve breast-cancer-related lymphedema outcomes compared to the control group. Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that weight loss did not reduce severity of breast-cancer-related lymphedema. It may be the patient's weight at the time of surgery or lymphatic injury that determines their risk of lymphedema development, rather than their weight after the condition has already developed.

While the effectiveness of weight loss as a treatment for lymphedema is still debated, the role of exercise as a therapeutic approach is more supported. In general, exercise does not seem to worsen lymphedema symptoms, with literature suggesting that resistance training may be specifically beneficial. – Aquatic activities have also been recommended. Movement in a water-based environment eliminates a portion of gravitational load while supplying external compression, which together aids in the movement of fluid proximally and out of the extremity.

Surgical Management

Once a patient's medical therapy is optimized, they may be considered for surgical evaluation. Surgical options can be categorized into physiological and ablative procedures. Physiological procedures directly target the lymphatic system and include lymphovenous bypass and vascularized lymph node transfer. Ablative procedures focus on reducing limb size through debulking by means of liposuction or direct excision. Recent years have also seen a rise in interest in prophylactic procedures for lymphedema prevention.

### Management of lymphedema [^114RA91s]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The basic principle of the management of lymphedema is so called complex decongestive physical therapy. This therapy is divided into two phases: (i) edema reduction phase — an initial intensive treatment phase aiming for limb volume reduction; and (ii) maintenance phase — following long-term phase to sustain a manageable limb volume. The first phase consists of a number of physical therapeutic approaches which are: manual lymph drainage, pneumatic pump drainage, low-stretch bandaging, exercises, and skin care. Long-term maintenance phase consists of self-lymph drainage, low-stretch bandaging, or compressive garments, and sometimes when indicated pneumatic pump drainage, exercises, and skin care.

### Primary lymphedema: update on genetic basis and management [^112hmZRh]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: Primary lymphedema is a chronic condition without a cure. The lower extremities are more commonly affected than the arms or genitalia. The disease can be syndromic. Morbidity includes decreased self-esteem, infections, and reduced function of the area. Recent Advances: Several mutations can cause lymphedema, and new variants continue to be elucidated. A critical determinant that predicts the natural history and morbidity of lymphedema is the patient's body mass index (BMI). Individuals who maintain an active lifestyle with a normal BMI generally have less severe disease compared to subjects who are obese. Because other causes of lower extremity enlargement can be confused with lymphedema, definitive diagnosis requires lymphoscintigraphy. Critical Issues: Most patients with primary lymphedema are satisfactorily managed with compression regimens, exercise, and maintenance of a normal body weight. Suction-assisted lipectomy is our preferred operative intervention for symptomatic patients who have failed conservative therapy. Suction-assisted lipectomy effectively removes excess subcutaneous fibro-adipose tissue and can improve underlying lymphatic function. Future Directions: Many patients with primary lymphedema do not have an identifiable mutation and thus novel variants will be identified. The mechanisms by which mutations cause lymphedema continue to be studied. In the future, drug therapy for the disease may be developed.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Discuss the key points in diagnosing lymphedema. 2. Understand the imaging modalities that facilitate diagnosis and surgical planning. 3. Appreciate the indications for both physiologic and ablative procedures. 4. Recognize the potential role of lymphaticovenular anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer in the treatment of patients with lymphedema.

Summary

Lymphedema is an incurable disease caused by insufficient lymphatic drainage leading to abnormal accumulation of interstitial fluid within the soft tissues. Although this condition may result from a primary structural defect of the lymphatic system, most cases in developed countries are secondary to iatrogenic causes. The diagnosis of lymphedema can be made readily by performing a clinical history and physical examination and may be confirmed by imaging studies such as lymphoscintigraphy, magnetic resonance lymphangiography, or indocyanine green lymphangiography. Nonsurgical treatment continues to be the mainstay of lymphedema management. However, advances in microsurgical techniques have revolutionized surgical options for treating lymphedema, and emerging evidence suggests that reconstructive methods may be performed to restore lymphatic flow. Procedures such as lymphaticovenular anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer can potentially offer a more permanent solution to chronic lymphedema, and initial studies have demonstrated promising results.

### Surgical treatment of lymphedema [^112b16Jr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Lymphedema affects up to 250 million people worldwide. The understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition, however, is incomplete and a cure remains elusive. A growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of modern surgical techniques in ameliorating the long-term disability and functional impairment inflicted by lymphedema on the lives of those affected. These procedures can be broadly categorized as physiologic, including lymphovenous bypass and using a vascularized lymph node transplant; or de bulking, by suction-assisted lipectomy or direct excisional procedures. The lymphovenous bypass procedure involves identification of obstructed lymphatic vessels and targeted bypass of these into neighboring venules. The vascularized lymph node transplant procedure involves microvascular anastomosis of functional lymph nodes into an extremity, either to an anatomical (orthotopic) or nonanatomical (heterotopic) location, to restore physiologic lymphatic function. In patients undergoing postmastectomy breast reconstruction, this may be performed by transferring a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap with a chimeric groin lymph node flap. For patients that have undergone breast-conserving surgery, in those for whom a free abdominal flap is contraindicated, or for those with lymphedema affecting the lower extremity, many other vascularized lymph node transplant options are available; these include flaps harvested from within the axillary, inguinal, or cervical lymph node basins, or from within the abdominal cavity. Chronic lymphedema is characterized by fibroadipose soft-tissue deposition that can only be removed by lipectomy, either minimally invasively using liposuction, or by direct excision. This article reviews the techniques and outcomes of surgical procedures used to treat lymphedema.

### Topical tacrolimus for the treatment of secondary lymphedema [^11385TZw]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Secondary lymphedema (henceforth referred to as lymphedema) is a chronic debilitating disease that in the United States and Western countries occurs most frequently as a complication of cancer treatment. It is estimated that as many as one in three patients who undergo lymph node dissection will go on to develop lymphedema, and conservative estimates suggest that as many as 50,000 new patients are diagnosed annually. Because lymphedema is a life-long disease with no cure, the number of affected individuals is increasing annually with current estimates ranging between 5 and 6 million Americans. It is likely that this number will continue to increase in the future since the development of lymphedema is nearly linearly related with cancer survivorship, and because the prevalence of known risk factors for lymphedema, such as obesity and radiation, is rising.

Lymphedema is disfiguring and debilitating; patients have chronic swelling of the affected extremity, recurrent infections, limited mobility and decreased quality of life. In addition, once lymphedema develops it is usually progressive. Existing approaches for lymphedema management are palliative in nature, relying on compression garments and physical therapy to decrease fluid accumulation and progression of disease. Currently, there is no known pharmacologic therapy that can halt progression or promote resolution of lymphedema.

Complete Decongestive Therapy

Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) has been a mainstay in nonsurgical management since its introduction in the 1980s. Once a diagnosis of lymphedema is confirmed, patients are referred to a licensed lymphedema therapist who supervises the implementation of CDT, which includes manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), compression, exercise, skin care, and education. The success of this treatment largely depends on patient adherence to the regimen, which involves regular visits with the specialist divided into two phases. Phase I typically consists of an intensive 6-week program aimed at reducing the size of the swollen limb and preventing infection. Phase II follows, during which the focus shifts to maintenance therapy, promoting self-management for patients. They are encouraged to wear custom-fitted garments designed specifically for their limb to provide continuous compression and to maintain limb size.

CDT is often regarded as the first-line treatment for lymphedema, with studies revealing reduction in limb volumes and improvement in quality of life. – There is ongoing debate in the literature regarding which components of complete decongestive therapy are essential for effective volume reduction. Some studies suggest that individual elements, such as compression, physical exercise, or manual lymphatic drainage, may be sufficient on their own. – These studies, however, may be limited by small sample sizes. More recently, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) has been proposed as a viable adjunct to CDT for select patients with lymphedema. A 2024 systematic review assessing IPC found that, although its addition did not affect limb volume significantly, it significantly improved external joint mobility.

lymphedemaListen to pronunciationA condition in which lymph builds up in tissues and causes swelling. Lymphedema usually affects an arm or leg, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Lymphedema can occur when lymph vessels or nodes become damaged or blocked, which affects the flow of lymph in the body. This is most commonly caused by cancer or cancer treatment, such as surgery or radiation therapy. It can also be caused by infection with certain parasites or by having certain inherited conditions in which the lymph nodes or lymph vessels are abnormal or absent. Lymphedema cannot be cured, but treatment can help relieve swelling, pain, and other symptoms. More InformationLymphedemaEnlarge this image in new windowLymphedema is swelling caused by a buildup of lymph fluid in the body, usually in an arm or leg.

The lymph system helps the body fight infection and is made up of lymph nodes, lymphatic vessels, and organs that collect and carry lymph fluid through the body. When part of the lymph system is damaged or blocked by cancer or cancer treatment, the flow of lymph fluid through the body is disrupted. This can lead to increased fluid in the tissues, inflammation, and the release of white blood cells, which can cause swelling in the affected body part. Discoloration and hardening of the skin in the affected area can also occur.

Lymphedema –Health Professional Version Overview Lymphedema occurs when disruption of normal lymphatic drainage leads to accumulation of protein-rich lymph fluid in the interstitial space. Cancer survivors who experience lymphedema report poor physical functioning, impaired ability to engage in normal activities of daily living, and increased psychological distress. Pathophysiology of Lymphedema Body fluids can be discussed in terms of their composition and the specific fluid compartment where they are located. Intracellular fluid includes all fluid enclosed by the plasma membranes of cells. Extracellular fluid surrounds all cells in the body. ECF has two primary constituents: intravascular plasma and the interstitial fluid that surrounds all cells not in the plasma. Lymphedema is the abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial space that is accompanied by inflammation and, eventually, fibrosis.

Disease-Specific Lymphedema Breast Cancer A systematic review found the prevalence of lymphedema to be 21. 4% in patients with breast cancer. The incidence increased for up to 2 years after breast cancer diagnosis or surgery, and it was higher in women who underwent axillary lymph node dissection versus sentinel lymph node biopsy (19. 9% vs. Lymphedema in patients with head and neck cancer can present slightly differently. External lymphedema does show swelling in the head and neck area, but internal lymphedema does not. Instead, patients with lymphedema related to internal head and neck cancer can present with complaints of voice changes, dysphagia, and possible difficulty breathing.
- Stage 0: This stage, referred to as subclinical lymphedema, is characterized by impaired lymph flow.
- Stage I: This stage is spontaneously reversible and typically marked by pitting edema, an increase in upper-extremity girth, and heaviness.
- Stage II: This moderate stage is characterized by a spongy consistency of the tissue without signs of pitting edema. Tissue fibrosis can then cause the limbs to harden and increase in size. The swelling at this stage is mostly fluid.
- Stage III: In the most advanced stage, swelling is mostly secondary to fat hypertrophy, so there is no pitting edema.
