9 mo with vaginal bleeding noted in diaper, area between anus and vagina bloody, differential and work up?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach the differential diagnosis and workup for a 9-month-old infant with perineal or vaginal bleeding, including evaluation, triage, and management for possible abuse versus medical causes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety, mandated reporting, and the concept of sentinel injury. Then, I should construct a developmentally plausible differential diagnosis and obtain a careful, separated history. Next, I will outline a forensically sound physical examination, targeted laboratory and imaging workup, and key consultations. Finally, I will consider documentation, interpretation of results, disposition, follow-up, and prevention while verifying each step against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the safety frame and the sentinel injury concept, because a 9-month-old with unexplained perineal bleeding is high risk and could represent a sentinel injury that precedes more severe harm, and I need to ensure reporting and protection occur early [^116MDyTw]. Hold on, I should verify mandated reporting thresholds; any reasonable suspicion of abuse in the United States requires immediate reporting to Child Protective Services, and delay can expose the child to substantial reinjury and mortality risk, so I should not wait for the full workup before notifying CPS [^113PFMXN] [^1147kvp6]. I need to ensure my approach remains trauma-informed and multidisciplinary from the outset to minimize additional harm while securing safety [^112Luv9Q].

> I should double-check the immediate safety plan and disposition; if abuse is suspected, admission to a surgical trauma service is recommended to coordinate evaluation and mitigate the risk of occult polytrauma and unsafe discharge, and I should restrict unsupervised caregiver access during the evaluation while maintaining a trauma-informed stance [^111mGxEo]. Wait, let me verify my legal obligations again; emergency clinicians are mandated reporters, and safety-first disposition planning is part of appropriate advocacy for the child [^111aLNr4].

> Now, I need to build a tiered differential that respects developmental plausibility and medical mimics. Abuse-related etiologies include sexual abuse with genital trauma, inflicted blunt perineal injury, and even caregiver-fabricated bleeding in medical child abuse, but I must not jump to conclusions without ruling in or out mimics [^112dbdQc]. Let me consider common non-abuse causes in prepubertal girls: urethral prolapse is a well-described and frequently misattributed cause of bleeding, and I should also consider lichen sclerosus, vulvovaginitis, labial adhesions with microtrauma, dermatologic vascular lesions, foreign body, and very rare hormonal etiologies, keeping in mind the child's developmental abilities when evaluating any "straddle injury" history [^111vYkjM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "non-ambulatory" at 9 months, but I should correct that: many 9-month-olds are pre-walking yet may be pulling to stand or cruising; any history given must be scrutinized for consistency with that developmental stage, not assumed impossible or assumed typical without verification [^111QKP9U].

> Next, I should review how to take the history in a developmentally contextualized, unbiased way. I need to interview caregivers separately, document timing, bleeding characteristics, exposures, and who had access to the infant, and assess for red flags such as changing stories, delay in care, or mechanism-development mismatch, while consciously checking my own social risk perceptions so as not to let bias dilute or exaggerate suspicion [^111Lwxs7]. I will also screen for prior sentinel events and caregiver or household risk factors such as young parental age, substance use, intimate partner violence, or a non-biologic adult in the home, because these features can raise pretest probability and affect safety planning [^114p3hiD] [^112Luv9Q]. Hold on, I should verify whether prior unexplained injuries or ED visits were documented, as that pattern can be pivotal in recognizing escalation [^116MDyTw].

> I will now examine the infant with a forensically sound technique. I need to ensure the examiner is experienced in pediatric anogenital assessment, obtain high-quality photo documentation with scale, and avoid invasive speculum exams in infants unless there is an operative indication under anesthesia, since that can cause harm and confound findings [^1116VpSP]. Let me think about positioning and visualization for the hymen, peri-hymenal tissues, urethral meatus for prolapse, perineal body, and anus, and I must perform a meticulous head-to-toe skin and musculoskeletal exam to identify bruising in atypical locations, patterned injuries, and occult tenderness suggestive of fractures; fundoscopic examination for retinal hemorrhages should be arranged via ophthalmology when head injury is a concern [^1116VpSP]. I should confirm that my documentation uses precise, objective descriptors and maintains chain of custody for photos and any specimens to preserve evidentiary integrity [^112JxuSN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if the genital and anal exam is normal; most sexually abused children, especially when examined non-acutely, will have normal exams, so absence of injury does not rule out abuse, which means my diagnostic and safety plan cannot hinge solely on visible trauma [^1116VpSP] [^115sR3ic]. I need to check for high-specificity anal signs when indicated, such as reflex anal dilatation with venous congestion, and interpret them in the correct context and timing, acknowledging that some findings have strong likelihood ratios yet remain uncommon [^11547Xwr].

> Let me verify the laboratory workup based on the presentation. If there is concern for sexual contact or genital trauma, I should obtain NAAT testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis and consider serologies for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B, while remembering perinatal acquisition is possible but unlikely at 9 months and a positive STI substantially elevates concern for abuse [^1116VpSP]. I need to check for bleeding disorders with a CBC and coagulation profile when the clinical picture suggests coagulopathy, and reserve endocrine testing for true signs of precocious puberty or hormonal bleeding patterns, not routine use in every infant with perineal bleeding [^112Luv9Q].

> I should confirm the imaging strategy given the child's age and suspicion level. A complete skeletal survey is indicated for all infants and toddlers with suspected physical abuse, with repeat imaging in about two weeks to detect healing fractures that were initially radiographically occult, and I must ensure the full standardized series is obtained and interpreted by radiologists experienced in nonaccidental trauma [^115YgGgk]. If there are signs of abdominal injury or elevated transaminases, contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT is recommended to evaluate for visceral injury, recognizing that abusive abdominal trauma is uncommon but can be lethal and is often clinically occult, while neuroimaging is indicated if there are neurologic signs or other features of abusive head trauma risk [^1151zJ2h] [^112JxuSN]. I should double-check that the imaging plan is individualized to findings while respecting age-based best practices for occult injury detection [^112Luv9Q].

> I will now consider the role of a forensic interview; in a 9-month-old, a formal forensic interview is not applicable, so the medical evaluation, careful history from caregivers, and objective findings become central, and I should coordinate with child protection to ensure appropriate information gathering outside the medical setting [^115sR3ic]. Let me verify that I avoid leading questions and maintain neutrality in documentation to support downstream investigative processes [^112Luv9Q].

> Next, I should review consultations and team activation. I need to involve a child abuse pediatrician early for case coordination and interpretation, engage social work for immediate safety assessment and CPS liaison, arrange ophthalmology if head injury is suspected, and obtain pediatric gynecology or urology input for complex genital findings such as suspected urethral prolapse, all within a structured hospital-based child protection framework [^111mGxEo]. I should confirm that this multidisciplinary approach is active during admission or protected observation to ensure coherent communication and timely actions [^112Luv9Q].

> I need to ensure reporting, documentation, and chain-of-custody procedures are completed without delay. I should file a same-day CPS report based on reasonable suspicion, document objective findings and caregiver statements verbatim, avoid conclusory language, and safeguard all photos and specimens per protocol, because lapses here can compromise both safety and legal processes [^113PFMXN]. Let me double-check that my documentation includes developmentally informed analysis of the history-injury consistency and that evidentiary materials are labeled and stored according to institutional policy [^112JxuSN].

> Now, I will interpret results and plan next steps. If findings, history analysis, or imaging support abuse, I should hospitalize the infant under a surgical trauma or child protection pathway, notify law enforcement per local statutes when appropriate, complete the full occult injury evaluation, and coordinate safe disposition through CPS before any consideration of discharge [^111mGxEo]. I need to ensure that communication with the family remains trauma-informed and non-accusatory while prioritizing the infant's safety and the integrity of the investigation [^111aLNr4].

> But wait, what if a medical cause is identified and convincingly explains the bleeding with consistent history and negative abuse evaluation. In that case, I should treat the condition, for example using topical estrogen for urethral prolapse with appropriate follow-up, yet I should still complete mandated CPS reporting because the initial presentation reached the threshold of suspicion, allowing CPS to independently assess safety while medical care proceeds [^111vYkjM] [^113PFMXN]. I should carefully document why abuse becomes unlikely based on exam, imaging, and consistent developmental and historical analysis for clear medical reasoning [^112Luv9Q].

> If the evaluation is indeterminate, I should not discharge prematurely; instead, I should maintain a safety net through admission or expedited CPS safety planning, arrange follow-up with a child abuse pediatrician within 24 to 48 hours, and schedule the repeat skeletal survey at approximately two weeks if initial imaging is negative but concern persists, because delayed rib or metaphyseal findings can emerge on interval studies [^115YgGgk]. Hold on, I should verify whether this represents a potential sentinel event and elevate observation and protective steps accordingly to prevent escalation [^116MDyTw].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and prevention are addressed. I should arrange medical follow-up to reassess healing and symptoms, connect caregivers with parenting, social support, and mental health resources as indicated, and incorporate prevention counseling and systems-level resources into ongoing primary care to reduce the risk of recurrence or future harm [^1147Zwyj]. Let me consider community prevention linkages and advocate for multidisciplinary supports, as coordinated prevention efforts can mitigate future risk for this infant and family [^114zFfET].

In a 9-month-old with vaginal bleeding and blood between the anus and vagina, the differential includes **sexual abuse** [^115sR3ic], **anal fissures**, **vulvovaginitis**, **urethral prolapse** [^111vYkjM], **foreign body**, and **bleeding disorders**. Immediate evaluation should include a focused history [^112Luv9Q], thorough **anogenital exam** [^1116VpSP], and prompt reporting to **child protective services** if abuse is suspected [^113PFMXN]. Obtain a **skeletal survey**, head CT/MRI if neurologic symptoms, and abdominal imaging if intra-abdominal injury is suspected. Perform CBC, PT/PTT, and STI testing as indicated [^1116VpSP]. Management is **multidisciplinary** [^112Luv9Q], with admission for suspected abuse or significant injury [^111mGxEo], and urgent surgical or gynecologic consultation for active bleeding or foreign body.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Trauma-related causes

- **Sexual abuse**: Highly concerning in this age group; consider if injuries are unexplained or inconsistent with history [^115sR3ic] [^1116VpSP].

- **Anal fissures**: Common in infants due to constipation or trauma.

- **Accidental trauma**: Rare in non-ambulatory infants; requires careful assessment of plausibility [^116MDyTw].

---

### Non-traumatic causes

- **Vulvovaginitis**: Inflammation from poor hygiene, irritants, or infection.

- **Urethral prolapse**: Circular, friable mucosa protruding from the urethra, causing bleeding [^111vYkjM].

- **Foreign body**: Objects inserted into the vagina or anus causing mucosal injury.

- **Bleeding disorders**: Hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, or platelet disorders.

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize the **onset and duration** of bleeding and any associated symptoms. Assess for **recent trauma** (accidental or non-accidental); review medical history for bleeding disorders, constipation, and infections; and elicit family and social history to identify risk factors for abuse or neglect [^112Luv9Q].

---

### Physical examination

Evaluate general appearance, including **vital signs**, pallor, and distress. Perform a detailed **anogenital exam** to assess for lacerations, bruising, fissures, foreign bodies, or prolapse, and complete a full-body exam for other injuries, including additional bruising [^115sR3ic].

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Laboratory tests

Obtain a **CBC** to assess for anemia or thrombocytopenia. Order **coagulation studies** (PT, aPTT) to evaluate for bleeding disorders, and perform **STI testing** (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, HSV) if abuse is suspected [^1116VpSP].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain a skeletal survey in all infants with suspected abuse [^115YgGgk]. Perform **head CT/MRI** [^117Xgea9] for neurologic symptoms or concern for head injury, and obtain **abdominal imaging** if intra-abdominal injury is suspected [^1151zJ2h].

---

## Management and reporting

- **Immediate management**: Stabilize, control bleeding, treat infections [^112Luv9Q].

- **Reporting**: Mandated reporting to child protective services if abuse suspected [^113PFMXN].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involve pediatricians, social workers, child abuse specialists, and law enforcement [^112Luv9Q].

- **Admission**: For suspected abuse, significant injury, or unstable patients [^111mGxEo].

---

## Follow-up care

Arrange medical **follow-up** to monitor healing and complications, and provide **psychological support** [^117DxfTS] and counseling for the child and family. Deliver **preventive education** to address risk factors and prevent recurrence [^1147Zwyj].

---

Vaginal bleeding in a 9-month-old is rare and requires a **thorough evaluation** to rule out abuse, trauma, infection, and bleeding disorders. A structured approach with history, exam, labs, imaging [^117Xgea9], and mandated reporting ensures accurate diagnosis and child safety [^113PFMXN].

Visceral injuries as a result of physical child abuse are uncommon and may be difficult to identify clinically; nevertheless, they constitute a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in affected children. Any organ can be involved, but hepatic and bowel injuries are the most common, while injuries to solid and hollow organs are equally common. Abusive abdominal injuries are mostly seen in toddlers, whereas accidental abdominal injuries are more prevalent in older children. When abusive abdominal injury is suspected, the recommended radiological imaging modality is contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT, as it is in cases of suspected accidental abdominal injury.

### Unexplained fractures: Child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^1147kvp6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem, and an improper diagnosis carries tremendous consequences for the patient, their family, and the doctor. A substantial degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with a missed diagnosis, with a reinjury rate of 50% and a mortality rate of 10% for unprotected children. In addition, the emotional trauma for the patient and family undergoing a prolonged investigation by Child Protective Services (and perhaps even the wrongful removal of custody) demonstrates the power of a misguided diagnosis of abuse. With fractures representing the second most common manifestation of child abuse after soft tissue trauma, orthopaedic surgeons are at the forefront of evaluating patients with potential CAN.

Many studies have described the musculoskeletal manifestations of child abuse: rib fractures, skull fractures, and humeral and femur fractures are among the most common. Recent studies demonstrated that the combination of patient age and fracture location can reproducibly differentiate abuse from accidental trauma. Among these factors, a suspicious history, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months are associated with CAN.

In 1962, Kempe et al. introduced the concept of "battered child syndrome". The authors included osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) as part of the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with potential abuse. The authors noted that OI should be easily distinguishable from abuse based on history and physical examination. Despite their assertions, the diagnosis often remains challenging.

### Nonaccidental trauma: Clinical aspects and epidemiology of child abuse [^116Y7gWv]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Radiologists play a key role in the recognition of child abuse. In the last century, they pioneered the identification of nonaccidental injuries, including fractures and brain injury, and together with colleagues in pediatrics advocated for the protection of children from abuse. Prevalence studies in many countries have revealed the widespread and hidden nature of child maltreatment. New and complex forms of abuse, such as fabricated or induced illness, have been recognized. Physical abuse affects 7–9% of children in the UK, although fewer suffer the severe or life-threatening injuries seen by radiologists.

A high index of suspicion of nonaccidental trauma is required when known patterns of injury or inconsistencies of presentation and history are detected. In many cases, the diagnosis is readily made, although some cases remain contentious or controversial and consume much clinical time and energy. Differences of view between doctors are tested in the courts. Adverse publicity has made this work unpopular in the UK. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis of unexplained or apparent injury is essential for accurate diagnosis, as errors in either direction can be disastrous. New UK radiological guidelines will assist radiologists in achieving best evidence-based practice.

### Interpretation of medical findings in suspected child sexual abuse: An update for 2018 [^1116VpSP]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Most sexually abused children will not have signs of genital or anal injury, especially when examined non-acutely. A recent study reported that only 2.2% (26 of 1160) of sexually abused girls examined non-acutely had diagnostic physical findings, whereas among those examined acutely, the prevalence of injuries was 21.4% (73 of 340). It is important for healthcare professionals who examine children who might have been sexually abused to be able to recognize and interpret any physical signs or laboratory results that might be found.

In this review, we summarize new data and recommendations concerning documentation of medical examinations, testing for sexually transmitted infections, interpretation of lesions caused by human papillomavirus and herpes simplex virus in children, and interpretation of physical examination findings. Updates to a table listing an approach to the interpretation of medical findings are presented, and reasons for changes are discussed.

### Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: Systematic review [^114ENhH5]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

Skeletal fractures are diagnosed in up to a third of children who have been investigated for physical abuse. These fractures are often occult and occur in infants and toddlers who cannot provide a causal explanation. Children who have been physically abused represent a small proportion of the total number of childhood fractures. Most children who sustain fractures do so from falls, motor vehicle crashes, or other non-abusive trauma. Additionally, a small group of children are more susceptible to fractures due to underlying conditions that contribute to bone fragility. All health professionals who see children should be able to recognize the characteristics of fractures resulting from abuse and initiate child protection investigations where necessary to prevent further injury that could be fatal. In reality, the possibility of child abuse is often overlooked in clinical practice.

We systematically reviewed the published world literature to answer the question: "What features differentiate fractures resulting from abuse from those sustained from other causes?" We aimed to identify indicators that can help clinicians identify cases of suspected child abuse when a child presents with a fracture for which the cause cannot be confirmed. We explore the strengths and limitations of the evidence base and make recommendations for future research in this field. We anticipate that this review will enable the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines. It will also contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the scientific evidence that expert medical professionals can use to recognize abuse-related fractures.

### Effective components of school-based prevention programs for child abuse: A meta-analytic review [^115J8Two]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Low credibility.

To be included in the meta-analysis, primary studies had to meet the following inclusion criteria: First, studies had to report on the effect of at least one school-based child abuse prevention program on child abuse-related knowledge and/or self-protection skills of children. School-based prevention programs were defined as programs implemented by an instructor (e.g. teacher, school nurse, or external instructor) in a school setting, aimed at preventing child abuse by providing children with knowledge and self-protection skills that decrease a child's risk for abuse.

For the concept of child abuse, we followed the definition as formulated by the World Health Organization: "Child abuse or maltreatment constitutes all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, or negligent treatment, or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development, or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power" (World Health Organization). Following this definition, we included studies that reported on any form of child abuse (i.e. physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and any form of neglect) committed by parents or caregivers, as well as other adults or people with whom there is a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power. Studies reporting on extrafamilial child (sexual) abuse were therefore also included in the meta-analysis. As for child abuse-related knowledge, studies had to measure knowledge on…

### Perceived social risk in medical decision-making for physical child abuse: a mixed-methods study [^111Lwxs7]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Medical decision-making in cases of suspected child abuse has important consequences. An incorrect diagnosis may return an abused child to the abusive home; conversely, it may subject non-abusive families to legal remedies and stigma. Prior studies have shown that physicians are more comfortable reporting poor children for abuse; African American children are more likely than Caucasian children to undergo an abuse evaluation for fractures; Caucasian children are less likely to be evaluated for abusive head trauma than minority children; and decisions about discharging children home from the emergency department with a diagnosis of abuse depend upon socioeconomic status. These studies documented differential decision-making in the evaluation and disposition of children with suspected physical abuse.

Differences in medical decision-making may reflect differences in risk indicators for abuse among poor and minority children not captured in administrative datasets. They may also reflect differences in treating physicians' perceptions of the risk for abuse among poor and minority children. Social risk perception, defined here as the perceived risk for child abuse based on social aspects of the child's medical evaluation rather than physical, laboratory, or radiologic aspects of the evaluation, may play a role in how children are evaluated. Medical assessments of child physical abuse risk may be particularly vulnerable to physicians' perceptions of abuse risk, as child abuse pediatricians (CAPs) incorporate the child's entire social ecology into their evaluation.

### Child abuse and neglect [^117DxfTS]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, along with various forms of neglect of children, are associated with a substantially increased risk for subsequent psychopathology and are among the common problems encountered by clinicians in many clinical settings. Such cases pose additional challenges for clinicians because of the many complex family and system forces that engulf these children and their families. Assessing maltreated children generally requires more time than evaluations of children who have not experienced maltreatment.

Young children, who experience the highest rates of maltreatment, present especially complex assessments because they are highly dependent upon their caregiving environments. Treatment of psychopathology associated with maltreatment, which is often multimodal, requires addressing a variety of external factors that may perpetuate or exacerbate symptoms and impaired functioning. It is suggested that the more clinicians understand the different cultures of the legal and child protective services systems, the better they will advocate for the best interests of maltreated children. This understanding ensures that the complexity of their problems is matched by the comprehensiveness of efforts to minimize their suffering, enhance their development, and promote their competence.

### Anal signs of child sexual abuse: A case-control study [^116eG7xk]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

A different approach was used in a recent study. Children evaluated for possible sexual abuse were divided into two groups: one with a low probability (917 children) and one with a high probability (198 children) of having been anally penetrated. A comparison was made between these groups in terms of the physical signs observed. However, identifying comparison children with a low risk of having been anally penetrated in a group of children referred for sexual abuse evaluation is problematic, as suggested by the presence of anal bruising in 10, anal fissure in 25, and anal laceration in 3. Consequently, the solution of choosing as controls children examined with concerns about other forms of abuse, where the routine practice was to include anal examination, seemed overall the best solution.

While physically abused and neglected children have a known increased risk of CSA, in this study, the availability of wide-ranging sensitive information minimized the likelihood of including unrecognized CSA. However, it is possible that an occasionally sexually abused child could unintentionally have been included in the control group, which would mean that the prevalence of signs seen in the controls would be overestimated. Control children with anal photographs were more likely to be included in this study than those without, and this could also have had the effect of overestimating the proportion of controls with positive findings. If this were the case, that would imply that the true difference between groups was, in fact, even greater.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^111sURcw]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

There is low to very low certainty evidence that the use of screening tools may result in high numbers of children being falsely suspected or missed. These harms may outweigh the potential benefits of using such tools in practice. In addition, before considering screening tools in clinical programs and settings, research is needed that identifies patient-important outcomes of screening strategies (e.g. reduction of recurrence).

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^112ZBVu7]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Since January 2009, Dutch hospitals are legally required to meet the criteria of the Child Abuse Framework set by the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate. Most hospitals in this study met these criteria, facilitated by a supportive board, the presence of a child abuse attendant, a protocol for suspected child abuse, or an appropriate screening instrument. However, significant barriers to effectively detecting child abuse at emergency departments (EDs) persist. More time, resources, and efforts by health professionals and management are essential to overcome these challenges. Previous studies indicate that child abuse screening in emergency departments effectively increases the detection of suspected cases, although a validated protocol or screening instrument is lacking.

Health professionals are motivated to improve child abuse detection but lack sufficient time to develop adequate policies and protocols, register suspicions, and organize education and training. The high patient flow and diversity in symptom severity at EDs make it difficult for staff to discuss suspicions of child abuse calmly with parents. Appointing a dedicated child abuse attendant to handle these tasks could be an effective solution. Unfortunately, not all hospital directors, whose support is crucial for creating such positions, are convinced of its necessity. The Inspectorate views the appointment of a child abuse attendant as essential for delivering responsible care.

### Child maltreatment and neglect [^111aLNr4]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Emergency medicine clinicians are mandated reporters, legally obligating them to report any behavior suspicious for child maltreatment to local authorities. Pediatric patients often present to the emergency department with concerns for physical injury and other pervasive complaints. In some cases, these injuries are nonaccidental.

To appropriately advocate for and protect children from further physical and emotional trauma, it is important for clinicians to recognize the signs and symptoms of child maltreatment and sexual abuse.

### The radiographic approach to child abuse [^114bYnRW]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Osseous injuries are a major aspect of child abuse, and in most patients, radiographic imaging plays a significant role in diagnosis. While some injuries typically result from excessive and inappropriate force, others are nonspecific regarding their causation. These become suspicious when the history provided by caretakers is inconsistent with the type of injury observed.

- **Questions/purposes**: The study details the radiographic imaging of highly specific injuries, discusses major issues related to moderate- or low-specificity injuries, and describes several diseases that mimic abuse.

- **Methods**: A review of recent literature focused on the radiographic imaging of child abuse was conducted by searching the National Library of Medicine database at pubmed.gov. Keywords used included: radiology, fracture, child abuse, and/or nonaccidental trauma.

- **Results**: Injuries highly specific for the diagnosis of abuse include metaphyseal corner fractures, posteromedial rib fractures, and sternal, scapular, and spinous process fractures. Lesions of moderate specificity include multiple fractures of various ages and epiphyseal separations. Long-bone fractures and clavicular fractures, while common, are of low specificity. In addition to accurately diagnosing these injuries, it is crucial to consider diseases and syndromes that may mimic abuse due to similarities in the radiographic picture.

- **Conclusions**: The stratification of fractures sustained in child abuse according to specificity is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment.

### What's in a name? Sentinel injuries in abused infants [^116MDyTw]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Infants are at the greatest risk of severe and fatal physical abuse, yet they sometimes present for medical care multiple times with abusive injuries prior to being diagnosed with abuse and having protective actions taken. Efforts to identify these infants in a timely manner are critical to prevent repeated, escalating abuse and subsequent harm. Increasing the identification and evaluation of sentinel injuries has been highlighted as a strategy for improving timely detection of abuse in infants.

Sentinel injuries are visible, minor, poorly explained injuries in young infants that raise concern for abuse. These injuries include cutaneous injuries such as bruising, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and intra-oral injuries. Sentinel injuries can signal clinically occult but more serious injuries or precede more significant trauma from abuse. As such, sentinel injuries offer an opportunity to intervene and protect infants from further harm. A thorough physical exam is critical for detecting sentinel injuries. Imaging with skeletal survey and, when appropriate, neuroimaging are key components of the medical evaluation of sentinel injuries in these high-risk infants.

### Is early detection of abused children possible? A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the identification of abused children [^114WoUmR]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Child maltreatment is the "disease" of both the child and the caregiver. An abusive caregiver is characterized by abusive behavior, which initiates the cycle of child maltreatment. This behavior leads to poor health and development of the child. Therefore, identifying child maltreatment involves recognizing both the abused child and the abusive caregiver.

Two self-report questionnaires were administered to children who had to indicate if they had experienced specific behaviors from parents or caregivers. However, as only children capable of reading could respond, these questionnaires are not effective in reducing fatalities among the most vulnerable age groups. Fatal child maltreatment is most common among younger children. Over half of the 600 child maltreatment victims under five years old reported to the National Violent Death Reporting System in the United States from 2003 to 2006 were under one year old.

The WHO definition of child maltreatment is problematic because it is defined by the consequences of neglectful or abusive behaviors, which are not explicitly defined. Similarly, Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which mentions "all forms of physical or mental violence, injury and abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse", does not define these behaviors. Additionally, definitions based solely on abusive behaviors can vary considerably. For example, terms like physical contact or penetration are often used before defining reported experiences as sexual abuse.

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: A systematic review [^115wPpw4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Approximately one in four children in the United States experience child abuse or neglect during their lifetime, 18% of whom are victims of physical abuse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical child abuse is "the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury". Physical child abuse remains a major public health issue, despite notable efforts to prevent and address such cases. Approximately one in four children are abused in their lifetime, with 18% of those children experiencing physical abuse. Previous literature reports an incidence of physical child abuse ranging from 0.03% to 100%, depending on the nature of the study and the specifics of the study populations included. These cases of abuse present devastating consequences for both children and families that extend beyond the acute trauma and can result in long-term physical and psychosocial harm.

Physicians and other health care workers are in a unique position to identify children who are at risk and/or are victims of physical child abuse, as providers are often the first contact for abuse victims. If detected early, the damaging consequences of such abuse may be mitigated, and prompt action can be taken to remove the child from a dangerous situation by alerting the proper authorities. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize victims when encountered. Physicians are then responsible for facilitating immediate contact with child protection agencies and determining the cause of associated injury, while adequately documenting supporting evidence that led to the suspicion.

### Use of imaging in children with witnessed physical abuse [^1115cSpR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Physicians are occasionally asked to evaluate children who are reported to have been victims of witnessed abuse but who have no injuries noted on examination. The rate of injury in these patients is presently unknown. This is important because abuse allegations are brought for both altruistic and other reasons. This study compares the use of skeletal survey and neuroimaging in well-appearing and clearly injured children reported to be victims of witnessed child abuse.

- **Methods**: Retrospectively planned secondary analysis of the Examination of Siblings to Recognize Abuse cohort of children referred to a child abuse pediatrician with concerns for physical abuse. Children were selected who presented to a medical provider with a history of witnessed child abuse, including shaking. Rates of radiographically evident injuries are noted among children with and without injuries noted on physical examination.

- **Results**: Among 2890 children evaluated by a child abuse pediatrician, 90 children (3.1%) presented with a history of witnessed abuse. Among these, 51 children (57%) had injuries noted on physical examination; 9 (29%) of 31 skeletal surveys and 9 (35%) of 26 neuroimaging studies revealed injuries. Of 39 children (43%) with witnessed abuse and normal examination, 3 (10%) of 30 skeletal surveys and 2 (8%) of 25 neuroimaging studies revealed an injury.

- **Conclusions**: A significant minority of children evaluated for allegations of witnessed abuse will have occult injuries identified radiographically. Absence of injury on examination should not deter physicians from obtaining appropriate imaging studies.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^111smLYk]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The risk of bias and GRADE assessment of the included studies indicate that one study was rated as having an unclear risk of bias. All remaining studies were rated as high risk of bias, with 23 studies (72%) showing high risk across two or more domains (see supplemental file 4 for critical appraisal rankings). Several studies employed very narrow age ranges to test their index test, which might represent inappropriate exclusions for studying identification strategies. For instance, while very young children (under 5 years of age) are at the highest risk of serious impairment and death from physical abuse, including abusive head trauma, non-fatal physical abuse rates peak between 3 and 12 years. Ideally, index tests aiming to identify potential physical abuse should address all children legally entitled to protection, or at a minimum, address children aged ≤ 12 years.

Several studies did not apply the reference standard to all children. Instead, it was applied to only a subset who were positively identified by the index test or another method, leading to serious verification bias (i.e. no data for the number of potentially maltreated children missed). For example, the reference standard was applied to only 55 out of 18,275 (0.3%) children in the study by Louwers et al. In contrast, Sittig et al, in a study assessing one of the recently published screening tests, applied the reference standard to a random sample of 15% of children who received a negative screen by the index test, thus reducing the potential for serious verification bias.

### Clinical evaluation and management of children with suspected physical abuse [^111Hz4rz]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Evaluating and managing children with suspected physical abuse is challenging, as few single injuries are pathognomonic for abuse and child abuse can be easily missed. Therefore, a healthy bit of skepticism is needed to recognize and protect abused children. The medical history and clinical presentation should guide the evaluation. Medical providers must consider the differential diagnosis, epidemiology of injuries, and child development to inform the assessment.

In this review, we address evidence-based recommendations to inform child physical abuse evaluations. We also discuss the role of medical providers in communicating with families, mandated reporting, and interpreting medical information for investigative agencies and other non-medical colleagues entrusted with protecting children.

Recognizing the skeletal manifestations of inflicted injury (II) in infants and young children is of crucial importance. There are specific fracture patterns that are highly suspicious of II, in addition to common differential diagnoses with which radiologists should be familiar. Our objective is to provide a non-exhaustive review of the important factors relevant to the imaging and reporting of II as a platform for further learning. Part 2 encompasses fracture patterns of the axial skeleton and important differential diagnoses.

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: A systematic review [^1136oSuB]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Covidence (Melbourne, Australia) was used to conduct and manage this review process.

- **Search strategy**: A comprehensive search of the electronic databases PubMed (Medline), PubMed Central, and Embase was conducted from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022. We used a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, including "abuse", "risk factors", and "children", along with their appropriate variations. The reviewed articles were cross-referenced for any relevant articles, which were included as well.

- **Selection criteria**: Eligible study designs include case series (≥ 20 patients), cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, retrospective chart reviews, and randomized controlled trials. We included studies evaluating clinical, demographic, and radiographic risk factors associated with substantiated or suspected physical child abuse. Studies may have been conducted in any country but must have been published in English. Studies including populations exclusively older than 18 years were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Physical abuse: Cutaneous injuries [^114jhPbH]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Cutaneous injuries are the most common presentation of child physical abuse. Identification of injuries concerning for physical abuse is a challenging but important responsibility of pediatric clinicians. It is essential for these clinicians to consider three key features when assessing injuries that may indicate abuse: the age and developmental abilities of the child, the location of the injury, and the pattern of the injury. A thorough medical evaluation, along with consideration of a broad differential, helps ensure that a medical mimic is not mistaken for abuse. Early identification of concerning injuries and reporting to appropriate agencies may protect children from further harm.

### PedHITSS: A screening tool to detect childhood abuse in clinical settings [^1119Sg3Q]. Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Though child abuse is prevalent and detrimental, health care providers fail to screen for abuse at sufficient rates to detect or preempt events. Child abuse screening tools often lack brevity and usefulness in clinical settings. To validate the Pediatric Hurt-Insult-Threaten-Scream-Sex (PedHITSS) screening tool — a 5-item questionnaire designed to detect and prompt provider investigation into child abuse in clinical settings — the PedHITSS was compared to the Conflict Tactics Scale: Parent-Child Version (CTSPC) screening measure.

- **Methods**: Participants included 422 pediatric patients (n = 242 nonabused; n = 180 abused subsample) recruited from an ambulatory care setting, a medical center at-risk referral clinic, or a homeless shelter clinic. Parents were asked to complete a cross-sectional survey, including PedHITSS and CTSPC questionnaires. The validity of PedHITSS was tested with 242 participants identified as nonabused, and construct validity was assessed with 180 participants previously identified as victims of child abuse.

- **Results**: Convergent validity between the CTSPC and PedHITSS was strong (rs = .70, P < .01). Sensitivity and specificity for correctly identifying abuse victims (≤ 12 years) were optimal at a cutpoint of one or greater. There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between HITSS and CTSPC in correctly identifying victims of child abuse.

- **Conclusions**: This study indicates that PedHITSS performs as well as CTSPC in identifying and differentiating victims and nonvictims of child abuse. PedHITSS allows health care providers to effectively screen for child abuse.

### Child abuse and the pediatric surgeon: A position statement from the Trauma Committee, the Board of Governors and the Membership of the American Pediatric Surgical Association [^115EztsZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The pediatric surgeon is in a unique position to assess, stabilize, and manage a victim of child physical abuse (formerly non-accidental trauma [NAT]) within the framework of a formal trauma system.

- **Methods**: The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) endorses the concept of child physical abuse as a traumatic disease that necessitates the resource utilization of a trauma system to appropriately evaluate and manage this patient population, including evaluation by pediatric surgeons.

- **Results**: APSA recommends the implementation of a standardized tool to screen for child physical abuse at all state-designated trauma or ACS-verified trauma and children's surgery hospitals. APSA encourages the admission of a suspected child abuse patient to a surgical trauma service due to the potential for polytrauma and increased severity of injury. This approach provides reliable coordination of services. Nevertheless, APSA recognizes the need for pediatric surgeons to participate in a multidisciplinary team, including child abuse pediatricians, social work, and Child Protective Services (CPS), to coordinate the screening, evaluation, and management of patients with suspected child physical abuse. Finally, APSA recognizes that if a pediatric surgeon suspects abuse, a report to CPS for further investigation is mandated by law.

- **Conclusion**: APSA supports data accrual on abuse screening and diagnosis into a trauma registry, the NTDB, and the Pediatric ACS TQIP® for benchmarking purposes and quality improvement.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^113G7jqV]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

This review builds upon the work of Bailhache et al. and performs a systematic review with the objective of assessing evidence about the accuracy of instruments for identifying children suspected of having been exposed to maltreatment, including neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional abuse. Similar to the review by Bailhache et al, we investigate both screening tools and other identification tools or strategies that could be adapted into screening tools. In addition to reviewing the sensitivity and specificity of instruments, as was done by Bailhache et al. for five studies, we have also calculated estimates of false positives and negatives per 100 children. This calculation can assist providers in making decisions about the use of an instrument.

This review contributes to an important policy debate about the benefits and limitations of using standardized tools versus case-finding to identify children exposed to maltreatment. This debate has become increasingly salient with the publication of screening tools for adverse childhood experiences or tools that address child maltreatment alongside other adverse experiences.

It should be noted here that while "screening" typically implies identifying health problems, screening for child maltreatment is different in that it usually involves identifying risk factors or high-risk groups. As such, while studies evaluating tools that assist with identification of child maltreatment are typically referred to as diagnostic accuracy studies, the word "diagnosis" is potentially misleading. Instead, screening tools for child maltreatment should be understood as mechanisms focusing on identification rather than diagnosis.

### Defining sentinel injuries of suspected child abuse by age using International Classification of Diseases-10: A Delphi study [^114jsyAX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Low credibility.

Reports of child abuse in South Korea increased from approximately 10,000 cases per year before the enforcement of the Special Act on the Punishment of Child Abuse Crimes in 2014 to 52,000 cases per year in 2021. However, this figure reflects only an increase in public concern and reporting, and the actual number of cases of child abuse remains unknown and difficult to predict.

It is difficult to determine the scale of child abuse accurately, but it might be estimated through the incidence of sentinel injuries. A sentinel injury is defined as a minor but unusual bruise and/or other wound found in children of pre-cruising age. It is rare for a child to be seriously injured or killed by a single instance of abuse. Most cases of children who experience serious injuries or death are the result of being exposed to repeated and escalating abuse. Thus, sentinel injury data could be used as early signs of child abuse. Sheets et al. reported that 27.5% of abused children had a history of a sentinel injury, and Lindberg et al. reported that children with sentinel injuries were more likely to have been exposed to child abuse.

Although the exact incidence of child abuse is not known, in-depth studies have long been conducted. In addition, studies on using sentinel injuries for early recognition of, and intervention in, child abuse have been actively performed. However, in South Korea, social interest in child abuse is relatively recent after several high-profile child abuse cases. Previously, child abuse in the country has been studied mainly in the fields of humanities and sociology rather than medicine.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^117Shi2a]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

This study aims to identify facilitators of, and barriers to, screening for child abuse in emergency departments (ED) through interviews with ED staff, members of the hospital board, and related experts.

- **Methods**: This qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews with 27 professionals from seven Dutch hospitals, including seven pediatricians, two surgeons, six ED nurses, six ED managers, and six hospital board members. The resulting list of facilitators and barriers was subsequently discussed with five experts in child abuse and one implementation expert. The results are ordered using the Child Abuse Framework of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate, which legally requires screening for child abuse.

- **Results**: Lack of knowledge of child abuse, poor communication with parents in suspected abuse cases, and lack of time for policy development are barriers for ED staff in screening for child abuse. Additionally, for board members, lack of resources and time, along with high turnover of ED staff, hinder the improvement of their child abuse policy. Screening can be promoted by training ED staff to better recognize child abuse, improving communication skills, appointing an attendant for child abuse, explicit management support for screening policies, and national implementation of an approved protocol and validated screening instrument.

- **Conclusions**: ED staff are motivated to work according to the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate requirements but experience many barriers, particularly in communicating with parents of children suspected of being abused.

### Child abuse: Approach and management [^111Uz536]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Child abuse is a common diagnosis in the United States and should be considered any time neglect or emotional, physical, or sexual abuse is a possibility. Although home visitation programs have been effective in preventing child maltreatment, much of the approach to and management of child abuse is directed by expert opinion or legal mandate. Any suspicion of abuse must be reported to Child Protective Services.

A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately evaluate and treat child abuse victims; however, the responsibility often lies with the family physician to recognize and treat these cases at first presentation to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^115v6o14]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

As part of the study 'Screening for child abuse in EDs, implementation of an optimal protocol', interviews were held with 27 professionals who were all related to at least one of the seven participating hospitals in the province of South-Holland, the Netherlands. The hospitals included one university (urban) children's hospital, four urban teaching hospitals, and two rural peripheral hospitals. All participating hospitals had an emergency department where children of all ages were treated. Some of these emergency departments had been undertaking screening for child abuse prior to the staff being surveyed; this period ranged from several years to just one year.

At their offices, we interviewed members of four professions: nine senior physicians (seven pediatricians and two surgeons), six members of the hospital board, six ED nurses, and six ED managers. These professions were selected because of their direct involvement in the detection of child abuse in the ED or their responsibility concerning child abuse policy. From these 27 interviews, facilitators of and barriers to the detection of child abuse were extracted.

In the second phase of the study, these facilitators and barriers were presented to five child abuse experts and one implementation expert for their advice on how to tackle the barriers. These child abuse experts were a pediatrician with expertise in the prevention of child abuse, a forensic pediatrician, a child abuse hospital attendant, a forensic nurse specialist in child abuse detection, and a senior child abuse researcher specializing in child abuse prevention.

### Medical child abuse: An unusual "source" of vaginal bleeding [^112BFMvs]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

Medical child abuse (MCA) is challenging to diagnose. Although young children are often affected, adolescents can be victims through caregiver coercion. Presentation is highly variable, and diagnosis is essential because of the high associated morbidity and mortality.

- **Case**: We describe the case of a 12-year-old girl who presented to multiple subspecialty clinics with reported menorrhagia. Despite reassuring clinical examinations, the family described menorrhagia that failed to respond to standard treatment. After an urgent evaluation for reported heavy bleeding revealed only scant blood, the diagnosis of MCA was made.

- **Summary and conclusion**: Vaginal bleeding is a rare presentation of MCA but must be considered whenever reported symptomatology does not follow physiologic patterns, respond to standard medical treatment, or correspond to clinical evaluation. Prompt identification is important to prevent further harm.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^113sJcvW]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE)

Evidence was assessed using GRADE, which rates our certainty that the effect we present is close to the true effect. This certainty is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. A GRADE rating is based on an assessment of five domains:

- **Risk of bias**: Limitations in study designs.
- **Inconsistency**: Heterogeneity in the direction and/or size of the estimates of effect.
- **Indirectness**: The body of evidence related to the populations, interventions, comparators, and/or outcomes of interest.
- **Imprecision of results**: Few participants/events/observations and wide confidence intervals.
- **Indications of reporting or publication bias**.

For studies evaluating identification tools and strategies, a body of evidence starting off with cross-sectional accuracy studies is considered "high" certainty and then is rated down to moderate, low, or very low certainty based on the five factors listed above.

### Clinicians' description of factors influencing their reporting of suspected child abuse: Report of the Child Abuse Reporting Experience Study Research Group [^113uQPMz]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Primary care clinicians participating in the Child Abuse Reporting Experience Study did not report all suspected physical child abuse to child protective services. This evaluation of study data seeks to identify factors clinicians weighed when deciding whether to report injuries they suspected might have been caused by child abuse, to describe clinicians' management strategies for children with injuries from suspected child abuse that were not reported, and to describe how clinicians explained not reporting high-suspicion injuries.

From the 434 pediatric primary care clinicians who participated in the Child Abuse Reporting Experience Study and who indicated they had provided care for a child with an injury they perceived as suspicious, a subsample of 75 out of 81 clinicians completed a telephone interview. Interviewees included 36 clinicians who suspected child abuse but did not report the injury to child protective services (12 with high suspicion and 24 with some suspicion), and 39 who reported the suspicious injury. Interviews were analyzed for major themes and subthemes, including decision-making regarding reporting of suspected physical child abuse to child protective services and alternative management strategies.

Four major themes emerged regarding the clinicians' reporting decisions: familiarity with the family, reference to elements of the case history, use of available resources, and perception of expected outcomes of reporting to child protective services. When they did not report, clinicians planned alternative management strategies.

### Child abuse: Approach and management [^114p3hiD]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on child abuse:

- **Definition**: Child abuse is a violation of human rights, defined as an act or failure to act on the part of a parent, guardian, and/or caregiver that results in the death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or exploitation of a child. It also includes situations that place a child in imminent risk of serious harm and/or seriously impact the child's long-term development and potential.

- **Pathophysiology**: Child maltreatment encompasses physical, sexual (including sex trafficking), emotional/psychological abuse, and neglect.

- **Epidemiology**: Approximately 4.4 million children are reported to Child Protective Services each year, with about 9 out of 1,000 children in the US found to have evidence of maltreatment after investigation. Additionally, 9.2% of victimized children experience sexual assault. The global prevalence of self-reported child physical abuse is estimated to range from 7% to 19%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for child maltreatment include:
	- **Child factors**: Chronic illness, emotional or behavioral difficulties, physical disabilities, preterm birth, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy.
	- **Caregiver factors**: Young parental age, criminal history, alcohol or substance abuse, depression or other mental health issues, poor impulse control, history of abuse, unrealistic expectations for the child, poor knowledge of the child, negative perception of normal childhood behavior, low educational attainment, low self-esteem.
	- **Home environment**: Family or intimate partner violence, non-biologically related adult living in the home.

### Diagnostic imaging of child abuse [^117Xgea9]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The role of imaging in cases of child abuse is to identify the extent of physical injury when abuse is present and to elucidate all imaging findings that point to alternative diagnoses.

### Anal signs of child sexual abuse: A case-control study [^11547Xwr]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty about the nature and specificity of physical signs following anal child sexual abuse. The study investigates the extent to which physical findings discriminate between children with and without a history of anal abuse.

- **Methods**: Retrospective case note review in a pediatric forensic unit was conducted. Cases included all eligible instances from 1990 to 2007 alleging anal abuse, while controls encompassed all children examined anally from 1998 to 2007 for possible physical abuse or neglect, with no identified concern regarding sexual abuse. Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) was performed to ascertain the significance of differences for individual signs between cases and controls. Logistic regression was used to produce odds ratios adjusted for age and gender to explore the potential role of confounding.

- **Results**: A total of 184 cases (105 boys, 79 girls), with an average age of 98.5 months (range 26 to 179), were compared with 179 controls (94 boys, 85 girls), with an average age of 83.7 months (range 35–193). Of the cases, 136 (74%) had one or more signs described in anal abuse, compared to 29 (16%) of the controls. Additionally, 79 (43%) of cases and 2 (1.1%) controls had more than one sign. Reflex anal dilatation (RAD) and venous congestion were seen in 22% and 36% of cases but less than 1% of controls, with likelihood ratios (LR) of 40 and 60, respectively. Anal fissures were observed in 14% of cases and 1.1% of controls (LR 13), while anal laxity was found in 27% of cases and 3% of controls (LR 10).

	- Novel signs seen significantly more commonly in cases included anal fold changes, swelling, and twitching. Erythema, swelling, and fold changes were seen most commonly within 7 days of the last reported contact.

### Controversial aspects of imaging in child abuse: A second roundtable discussion from the ESPR child abuse taskforce [^117WhaQs]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The most common sites of abusive fractures are the long bone shafts, ribs, and skull (the discussion of abusive skull fractures is beyond the scope of this article). Certain fractures or fracture patterns are highly specific for abuse, such as the classic metaphyseal lesion (CML), rib fractures, and the presence of multiple fractures at different stages of healing (and therefore ages) in the absence of an alternative explanation. Different patterns of injury are seen depending on the age of the patient: rib fractures and CMLs are more common in infancy, while long bone shaft fractures are more common in older children. In contrast, long bone shaft fractures are low-specificity injuries for abuse, as they are radiologically indistinguishable from those with an accidental etiology.

No fracture or fracture pattern is pathognomonic of physical abuse. Determining whether a fracture is accepted as accidental or more likely inflicted can be challenging and is largely dependent upon the patient's age, the child's developmental level, and the clinical history (i.e. the proffered mechanism of injury) provided by the parent or caregiver. Any fracture in a dependent, non-ambulant child is concerning for an inflicted (abusive) injury. Moreover, identifying any fracture in the context of suspected child abuse is significant and indicates the application of significant and inappropriate forces. Abuse may also be suggested when an injury is inconsistent with the accepted or usual mechanisms required to result in a specific fracture or fracture pattern, based on the radiological evidence.

### Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: Systematic review [^112VR2WW]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

To systematically review published studies, the objective was to identify characteristics that distinguish fractures in children resulting from abuse from those not resulting from abuse and to calculate a probability of abuse for individual fracture types.

- **Design**: Systematic review.

- **Data sources**: An all-language literature search was conducted using Medline, Medline in Process, Embase, Assia, Caredata, Child Data, CINAHL, ISI Proceedings, Sciences Citation, Social Science Citation Index, SIGLE, Scopus, TRIP, and Social Care Online. These were used for original study articles, references, textbooks, and conference abstracts until May 2007.

- **Study selection**: Comparative studies of fractures at different bony sites, sustained in physical abuse and from other causes in children under 18 years old were included. The review excluded articles, expert opinions, postmortem studies, and studies in adults. Each study had two independent reviews (three if disputed) by specialist reviewers including pediatricians, pediatric radiologists, orthopedic surgeons, and named nurses in child protection. Each study was critically appraised using data extraction sheets, critical appraisal forms, and evidence sheets based on NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance. A meta-analysis was performed where possible. A random-effects model was fitted to account for the heterogeneity between studies.

- **Results**: A total of 32 studies were included. Fractures resulting from abuse were recorded throughout the skeletal system, most commonly in infants under one year and toddlers between one and three years old.

### Orthopedic manifestations of child abuse [^111fkseJ]. Pediatric Research (2022). High credibility.

Child abuse is common in the United States but is often undetected. The incidence of this form of abuse is difficult to quantify, yet children with a history of abuse are at risk of chronic health conditions. Medical providers hold the unique position of triaging trauma patients and differentiating unintentional from abusive trauma, as well as being mandated reporters of abuse in all states.

Obtaining a detailed history and screening for risk factors can help identify children at risk of abuse. Certain orthopedic injuries may be related to abuse, which may trigger clinical suspicion and lead to further workup or intervention. By increasing awareness through medical provider education and enhanced screening, earlier detection of abuse may prevent more serious injuries and consequences.

This review evaluates literature regarding the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse in the hopes of increasing medical provider awareness. Impact: Child abuse is common in the United States but often remains undetected. Medical professionals occupy a unique position in evaluating trauma patients and identifying concerns for abusive injuries. Certain orthopedic injuries may raise concerns for abuse, triggering clinical suspicion, and necessitating further workup or intervention.

### From suspicion of physical child abuse to reporting: Primary care clinician decision-making [^111NWKeD]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The goals were to determine how frequently primary care clinicians reported suspected physical child abuse, the levels of suspicion associated with reporting, and what factors influenced reporting to child protective services.

In this prospective observational study, 434 clinicians collected data on 15,003 child injury visits, including information about the injury, child, family, likelihood that the injury was caused by child abuse (5-point scale), and whether the injury was reported to child protective services. Data on 327 clinicians indicating some suspicion of child abuse for 1,683 injuries were analyzed.

Clinicians reported 95 (6%) of the 1,683 patients to child protective services. Clinicians did not report 27% of injuries considered likely or very likely caused by child abuse and 76% of injuries considered possibly caused by child abuse. Reporting rates increased if the clinician perceived the injury to be inconsistent with the history and if the patient was referred to the clinician for suspected child abuse. Patients with an injury that was not a laceration, who had more than one family risk factor, who had a serious injury, who had a child risk factor other than an inconsistent injury, who were black, or who were unfamiliar to the clinician were more likely to be reported. Clinicians who had not reported all suspicious injuries during their career or who had lost families as patients because of previous reports were more likely to report suspicious injuries.

Clinicians had some degree of suspicion that approximately 10% of injuries were possibly caused by child abuse.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: Abuse or accidental trauma [^114nugGT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). High credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons play a critical role in evaluating potential cases of child abuse because fractures represent the second most common presentation of abuse, behind only soft tissue injuries. Numerous studies have focused on the characteristics of fractures considered typical of abuse, including fractures of the femur, humerus, tibia, and ribs. Yet, orthopaedic surgeons are less likely than general pediatric and emergency room colleagues to identify abuse as the potential etiology of these fractures, which may cause delays in appropriate multidisciplinary intervention.

This is concerning because of the million children annually in the United States who are victims of substantiated abuse, orthopaedic surgeons are often the first clinicians to evaluate these patients. If the cause of injury is not recognized, these children may return to an abusive environment with a 50% risk for reinjury and a 10% risk of death. It is therefore essential that orthopaedic surgeons not only treat the fractures presented by these children but also recognize the associated etiologic characteristics of the injury that may suggest child abuse.

When examining a fracture in the emergency room, the following questions should arise: What patient characteristics may be indicative of abuse versus accidental trauma? Is the history and mechanism of injury inconsistent with the presenting injury? Does this fracture type, pattern, and location represent potential abuse? Fractures of the femur in young children provide an ideal model to develop a systematic examination procedure.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^113fFwkb]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Early detection of child abuse is a priority of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate; in the Netherlands, each year 107,200 children are victims of some type of child abuse. Child abuse is an important public health problem. Besides the serious consequences for each child and their environment, the estimated costs of child abuse in the Netherlands are 965 million euros per annum.

The Dutch media frequently report the inadequate detection of child abuse in hospital emergency departments (EDs). Since January 2009, all EDs are legally required to fulfill the Inspectorate criteria, published in the report 'EDs do not adequately detect child abuse: a broken arm is too often an incident' in 2008. This report includes a Child Abuse Framework with criteria such as screening each child visiting the ED for child abuse and regular training for ED staff. Perhaps related to these requirements, the total number of children reported by Dutch hospitals to the central Child Abuse Center increased from 677 (4%) in 2007 to 1,499 (8.3%) in 2010.

In the present study, ED professionals in Dutch hospitals were interviewed about the quality of child abuse detection in EDs. The aim was to define facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse and to make recommendations to optimize the screening for child abuse at EDs.

### Hospitalized cases of child abuse in America: who, what, when, and where [^116QTcJf]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2009). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons need to recognize features of child abuse. The purpose of this study was to identify common characteristics of child abuse and to delineate features of physical injury cases that would raise concern for child abuse.

- **Methods**: A nationally representative sample of all pediatric inpatient discharges for calendar years 1997, 2000, and 2003 was queried for physical injury diagnoses. Cases were identified as those with a diagnosis of child abuse, while controls were those without the diagnosis of child abuse. The incidence of coded child abuse and a comparison of rates across time, demographics, and injury pattern were determined. Cases were compared with controls, and relative risks for coded child abuse were computed using the generalized linear model specifying the Poisson distribution and a log link.

- **Results**: There were 665,195 physical injury cases identified. Of these, 11,554 (1.74%) had a diagnosis of child abuse. Fractures requiring orthopaedic management were present in 28% of the child abuse cases. The three strongest demographic predictors of coded child abuse were age younger than 1 year, age 1 to younger than 2 years, and Medicaid as primary payer, with adjusted relative risks of 11.46, 3.07, and 1.99, respectively. Winter and weekday presentations were significantly higher for coded child abuse. Fractures with the greatest adjusted relative risks for coded child abuse were rib or sternum (5.34) and scapula (3.22). Pelvic fracture was the only fracture significant for a lowered adjusted relative risk of coded child abuse.

- **Conclusions**: This study sh

### Sentinel injuries in emergency departments and subsequent serious injury in children [^112JodJs]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The study objective was to investigate sentinel injuries in young children, as these minor injuries can raise suspicion of physical abuse. Early identification is critical; however, widespread screening may inadvertently harm both children and families. The study aimed to determine the frequency of serious abusive injury within 12 months following an emergency department (ED) encounter for a sentinel injury.

Methods involved using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State ED and Inpatient Databases to identify children aged 0 to 24 months with an ED diagnosis of a sentinel injury between 2014 and 2019. The primary outcome was the occurrence of serious abusive injury, defined as admission for serious injury or death with a child abuse diagnosis, within 12 months of a sentinel injury ED visit.

- **Results**: Among 23,919 children with a sentinel injury ED visit (median age 5 months, 53% boys), a bruise or fracture was diagnosed in 14,501 children (60.6%). In the subsequent 12 months, serious abusive injury was diagnosed in 176 (0.7%) patients. At the index ED encounter, abuse was diagnosed in 1,156 children (4.8%); 96 (8.3%) of these patients were diagnosed with an additional serious abusive injury within 12 months.

- **Conclusion**: The subsequent diagnosis of a serious abusive injury was uncommon after an initial ED sentinel injury diagnosis. Of all children in whom abuse was diagnosed during the study period, the majority were diagnosed at the sentinel injury ED visit, with nearly 1 in 12 at risk for subsequent serious injury. Prospective studies are needed to further risk-stratify children.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^112NMjH6]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Also interviewed were five child abuse experts, and in addition, we asked an implementation expert for advice on how to implement a screening protocol for child abuse at emergency departments (EDs).

- **Policy**: To ensure funding for the policy to tackle child abuse, two experts advised adjusting the DBC code (Diagnostic/Treatment code in the Dutch medico-financial system) for child abuse. This adjustment would ensure that hospitals receive the necessary funding for this type of care.

- **Child abuse team, child abuse attendant, collaboration with the Child Abuse Center**: The experts believe that child abuse teams are essential for effective collaboration between various disciplines. Two experts advised evaluating the policy twice a year with the entire team. For specific cases, they recommended reviewing these with only the professionals involved. Four experts emphasized the importance of investing in and appointing an attendant specifically for child abuse. This is particularly important because psychosocial research and referrals to child care require considerable time and effort. A child abuse attendant can guarantee quality control, rapidity of treatment or referrals, and proper follow-up of patients.

- **Protocol for suspected child abuse**: The introduction of a national protocol, with local modifications, was supported by the experts. This approach would ensure uniformity in the process and prevent each hospital from having to develop its own protocol.

All experts found screening for child abuse at EDs worthwhile. They considered a head-to-toe examination an essential part of screening because important signs of child abuse often can be found on the body.

### How to explore and report children with suspected non-accidental trauma [^112JxuSN]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Child abuse is a controversial problem of special concern. Recent reports have focused on the broad variability of reporting to child protection services. Radiologists play a key role in the early diagnosis and imaging of suspected inflicted injury. Imaging must be performed and then interpreted with rigor.

The aims of this review are as follows:

- **Review the recent recommended guidelines**: These include a highly detailed complete skeletal survey with centered views. Brain CT and/or MRI are mandatory in children younger than 2 years. The use of abdominal imaging is debatable if the child has no symptoms. All siblings younger than 2 years should be assessed in the same way while the diagnosis of abuse is investigated.

- **Body MRI as an interesting modality**: This remains a "work-in-progress".

- **Highlight the imprecision in dating both brain and skeletal injuries**: The main point is to determine if the pattern is of "age-different" lesions. This not only provides a strong argument for the diagnosis of abuse, but also indicates repetitive violence with a high risk for further injury and death.

- **Emphasize the medical perspective of protecting the child**: Radiologists must communicate clearly the suspicion of abuse and the degree of certainty to clinicians to aid reporting or hospitalization.

### Child abuse and conditions that mimic it [^112dbdQc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

One percent to 2% of children in the United States are confirmed victims of child abuse, with many more likely affected. It can be difficult to diagnose, with often misleading medical histories. Acute care providers should be aware of its presenting warning signs and how to evaluate and document suspicious physical findings. Young children who cannot disclose are most vulnerable to forms of abuse with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to keep it in the differential diagnosis and to be aware of and know how to rule out medical conditions that mimic abuse.

### The intersection of medical child abuse and medical complexity [^111W6QMT]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Children with medical complexity and victims of medical child abuse may have similar clinical presentations. Atypical or unexplained signs and symptoms due to rare diseases may lead providers to suspect medical child abuse when it is not present. Conversely, medical child abuse may be the cause of or coexist with medical complexity. Careful consideration of whether or not medical child abuse is present is essential when assessing a child with medical complexity, since either diagnosis has significant consequences for children and families.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^1159uRVG]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Child maltreatment, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, impacts a significant number of children worldwide. For example, a survey involving a nationally representative sample of American children, selected using telephone numbers from 2013 to 2014, found that lifetime rates of maltreatment for children aged 14 to 17 were 18.1% for physical abuse, 23.9% for emotional abuse, 18.4% for neglect, and 14.3% and 6.0% for sexual abuse of girls and boys, respectively.

Child maltreatment is associated with many physical, emotional, and relationship consequences across the lifespan. These include developmental delay first seen in infancy; anxiety and mood disorder symptoms and poor peer relationships first seen in childhood; substance use and other risky behaviors often first seen in adolescence; and increased risk for personality and psychiatric disorders, relationship problems, and maltreatment of one's own children in adulthood.

Given the high prevalence and serious potential negative consequences of child maltreatment, clinicians need to be informed about strategies to accurately identify children potentially exposed to maltreatment, a task that "can be one of the most challenging and difficult responsibilities for the pediatrician". Two main strategies for the identification of maltreatment — screening and case-finding — are often compared to one another in the literature. Screening involves administering a standard set of questions or applying a standard set of criteria to assess for the suspicion of child maltreatment in all presenting children.

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: A systematic review [^1137UTxx]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global research & reviews (2025). Low credibility.

For clinical signs associated with physical child abuse, head injuries were the most cited clinical indication, referenced by 16 articles. This finding is consistent with other systematic reviews that have found that abusive head trauma (AHT) is the most common cause of traumatic death in abused children. Intracranial injury or hematoma was commonly cited and mentioned in six articles; however, it was only found to be a significant clinical indication in three of the six articles. A systematic review by Piteau et al. mentions that it is important to specify the type of intracranial injury because the mechanism of injury is critical from preliminary determination. Because many articles use the term "intracranial injury" as a broad term, this could be the reason why there is a divide among the significance of intracranial injuries as a clinical indication for physical child abuse. Unlike intracranial injuries, subdural hematoma or hemorrhage was found to be notable in all four articles that cited it. This is consistent with the systematic review by Piteau et al. that found subdural hemorrhage to be the most reported clinical indication of physical child abuse. These findings may be explained by the inherent severity of head injuries; therefore, abusive head injuries may be more likely to result in an emergency department visit than other less severe physical abuse injuries.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^114SLcMY]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

A protocol for this review is registered with the online systematic review register, PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2016: CRD42016039659), and study results are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist (see supplemental file 1). As the review by Bailhache et al. considered any English or French materials published between 1961 and April 2012 (only English-language materials were retrieved from their search), we searched for English-language materials published between 2012 and July 2, 2019, when the search was conducted. Additional inclusion criteria are found in Table 1. Inclusion criteria for this review were matched to those in Bailhache et al.'s review.

We included diagnostic accuracy studies that 1) evaluated a group of children by a test, examination, or other procedure (hereafter referred to as the index test) designed to identify children potentially exposed to maltreatment, and also 2) evaluated the same group of children (or ideally a random subsample) by a reference standard (acceptable reference standards are listed in Table 1) that confirmed or denied exposure to potential maltreatment. We excluded articles that assessed psychometric properties of child maltreatment measures unless diagnostic data was available in the paper.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: The searches for the review update were conducted in seven databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Sociological Abstracts, the Education Resources Information Center, and Cochrane.

### Child sexual abuse [^115sR3ic]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Child sexual abuse is a worldwide concern. It is an insidious, persistent, and serious problem that, depending on the population studied and definition used, affects 2–62% of women and 3–16% of men as victims. Although pain and tissue injury from child sexual abuse can completely heal in time, psychological and medical consequences may persist into adulthood. Associated sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, and suicide attempts can be fatal. All physicians treating children should be aware of the manifestations and consequences of child sexual abuse and be familiar with the normal and abnormal genital and anal anatomy of children. This aim is best accomplished through training and routine examination of the anus and genitalia of children.

Because as many as 96% of children assessed for suspected sexual abuse will have normal genital and anal examinations, a forensic interview by a trained professional must be relied upon to document suspicion of abuse.

### Prepubertal girl with vaginal bleeding [^111vYkjM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Prepubertal children with vaginal bleeding are frequently brought to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation, with the primary concern being sexual abuse. An appropriate history and physical examination can help recognize the specific cause, allay the anxiety of parents, and reduce unnecessary work-ups.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this report is to describe a frequently unrecognized cause of vaginal bleeding that is unrelated to sexual abuse.

- **Case report**: We report the case of a 6-year-old African-American girl referred to our ED due to vaginal bleeding, with suspicion of sexual abuse. She was clinically diagnosed with urethral prolapse.

- **Conclusion**: In prepubertal girls with vaginal bleeding, urethral prolapse should be strongly considered as a diagnostic possibility. Increased physician awareness and early recognition of urethral prolapse avoids unnecessary examinations and patient anxiety, and prevents misdiagnosis as sexual abuse.

### Child abuse and the pediatric surgeon: A position statement from the Trauma Committee, the Board of Governors and the Membership of the American Pediatric Surgical Association [^111mGxEo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for child abuse, more specifically with respect to indications for admission, APSA 2019 guidelines recommend admitting patients with suspected child physical abuse to a surgical trauma service due to the potential for polytrauma and increased severity of injury. This approach ensures reliable coordination of services, including mandatory reporting to Child Protective Services.
