## Question

In what ways do ethnic background and genetic makeup shape the assessment of metabolic health beyond BMI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how ethnic background and genetic makeup shape the assessment of metabolic health beyond BMI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "metabolic health" encompasses beyond BMI. Then, I should verify how ethnicity alters body composition and fat distribution at a given BMI. Next, I will examine how genetic architecture and polygenic scores influence metabolic phenotypes independent of BMI and whether these effects differ by ancestry. After that, I need to consider practical clinical assessments that should be adapted by ancestry, including anthropometrics, imaging surrogates of visceral adiposity, and metabolic biomarkers. Finally, I should confirm caveats where race/ethnicity does not change pharmacokinetics or treatment choices to avoid overgeneralization.

> Let me first confirm what "metabolic health beyond BMI" means so I don't conflate weight with risk: clinically, this includes insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, lipid fractions and apolipoproteins, blood pressure, inflammatory markers, liver enzymes, and especially fat distribution rather than total mass; metabolic syndrome is a convenient cluster, and guidelines already advise risk-based screening that integrates these dimensions beyond BMI when risk factors or high-risk race/ethnicity are present [^117CQ3rW].

> Now, I need to check how ethnicity modifies risk at a given BMI because this directly changes thresholds and the meaning of anthropometrics: many Asian groups accumulate more visceral fat at the same BMI than Europeans and show higher rates of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia at lower BMI, with DXA-derived visceral fat indices relating more strongly to cardiometabolic phenotypes than BMI; this is why risk-based screening flags Asian ancestry as a high-risk category even at ostensibly "normal" BMI, and multiethnic Asian cohort data from Singapore demonstrate substantially higher odds of obesity and diabetes in Malay and Indian participants compared with Chinese despite overlapping BMI ranges [^112NVXG2] [^117CQ3rW].

> Wait, let me verify which simple anthropometrics outperform BMI across populations because this affects frontline screening: waist-related measures generally outperform BMI for metabolic syndrome, with waist-to-height ratio in Korean adults showing superior discrimination and, in an older French cohort with DXA, waist-hip ratio — not BMI — tracking metabolic syndrome severity more robustly; imaging-based body composition is validated for adiposity assessment and can calibrate risk when anthropometrics are ambiguous, so I should place more weight on central adiposity measures in ancestries predisposed to visceral fat accumulation [^117L9GEb] [^115KtsMc] [^116JZVoL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform "insulin resistance by race" because tissue-specificity and BMI strata matter: I initially thought African Americans uniformly have higher hepatic insulin resistance, but that's imprecise — data suggest lower skeletal-muscle insulin sensitivity relative to European Americans contributes importantly, and clamp, HOMA-IR, and OGTT-based indices show that the association between a genetic insulin-resistance score and measured insulin sensitivity differs by race and BMI group, with effects in European Americans predominating at higher BMI and in African Americans emerging at lower BMI; clinically, that means direct assessment of insulin sensitivity and cardiometabolic traits is crucial rather than inferring risk from BMI alone in African-ancestry populations [^111JykDA] [^112S4YWM].

> I will now examine how genetic makeup shapes metabolic health independently of weight because this reframes "metabolically healthy" phenotypes: polygenic scores for favorable versus unfavorable adiposity show consistent cross-ethnic effects on metabolic profiles — favorable adiposity associates with lower triglycerides, lower liver enzymes, higher HDL, and lower type 2 diabetes risk, whereas unfavorable adiposity associates with the opposite, generally across European, African, American, Central/South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern populations — underscoring that genetically driven fat partitioning modifies metabolic risk beyond BMI in diverse ancestries [^112CR6tE].

> Next, I should review ancestry-specific architecture of body fat distribution because it changes which phenotypes to emphasize: GWAS in Hispanic/Latino cohorts identify loci for central adiposity traits such as WHRadjBMI with effect sizes that vary by background group, and gene–environment interactions show that the performance of BMI polygenic scores is attenuated with higher Amerindigenous ancestry and modified by migration timing and diet; practically, this means that within "Hispanic/Latino" populations, central adiposity traits and sociocultural context should be explicitly profiled rather than relying on a pooled BMI genetic risk [^113yr5YJ] [^112DpEiR].

> Let me consider life-course and developmental genetic factors that may prime metabolic trajectories before adult weight accrues: populations of African and Asian ancestry carry a higher cumulative burden of birthweight-lowering alleles, a trait linked epidemiologically to later cardiometabolic disease; while low birthweight is not destiny, it should lower the threshold for early metabolic screening and attention to rapid catch-up growth and central adiposity in risk stratification, again beyond BMI cut points alone [^111JP6Ty].

> But wait, what about population generalizability of obesity-associated loci; do they matter clinically for non-European groups? Trans-ethnic analyses generally support shared directionality of many BMI and fat-distribution loci across ancestries, though with variable effect sizes and sex-specific effects for WHRadjBMI, which reinforces that while genetic predisposition is broadly relevant, its phenotypic translation depends on ancestry and sex, steering clinicians to focus on distributional phenotypes and their metabolic correlates rather than BMI per se when tailoring assessment by ancestry [^114tRmLJ] [^115Urhtx].

> I should double-check implications for the clinic and avoid overextension: guidelines already recommend risk-based diabetes screening in high-risk ethnic groups irrespective of BMI and emphasize broader metabolic phenotyping, so for Asian, South Asian, and some Hispanic/Latino backgrounds I should prioritize central adiposity measures, consider surrogate or direct visceral fat estimates when feasible, and intensify lab-based assessment of insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood pressure, liver enzymes, and inflammation; at the same time, not all therapies display race-dependent pharmacokinetics — for example, liraglutide exposure does not differ by race — so ancestry should refine risk assessment and thresholds, not restrict evidence-based treatment choices [^117CQ3rW] [^115KtsMc] [^116JZVoL] [^113qfKuw].

> In summary, ethnic background and genetic makeup shape the assessment of metabolic health beyond BMI by altering the relation between BMI and visceral adiposity, shifting risk thresholds for insulin resistance and diabetes, and modifying how genetic predisposition translates into lipid, glycemic, hepatic, and inflammatory profiles; accordingly, clinicians should weight central adiposity and metabolic biomarkers more heavily, consider ancestry-informed screening thresholds, and recognize that polygenic fat distribution patterns can predict metabolic risk across populations even when BMI is similar [^112NVXG2] [^112CR6tE].

Ethnicity and genetics shape metabolic health assessments beyond BMI through **ethnic differences in fat distribution** [^116JZVoL] and **genetic risk for metabolic disease**. Asians and South Asians have **higher visceral fat and metabolic risk at lower BMI** [^112NVXG2], while people of African ancestry often have lower visceral fat but higher insulin resistance [^112S4YWM], and Hispanics/Latinos have higher central adiposity [^113yr5YJ] and NAFLD risk [^notfound]. Genetic variants (e.g. FTO, PNPLA3) and polygenic scores for adiposity and insulin resistance differ by ancestry and interact with the environment [^112DpEiR], **altering risk at a given BMI** [^111JykDA] [^112CR6tE] [^112aYvyz]. Because BMI alone can misclassify risk [^116JZVoL], assessments should include waist measures [^112NVXG2], metabolic biomarkers, and ancestry-informed genetic risk [^112CR6tE] to improve accuracy and equity [^117CQ3rW].

---

## Ethnic differences in fat distribution and metabolic risk

- **Visceral adiposity in Asians**: Asians and South Asians have higher visceral fat [^112NVXG2] and metabolic risk [^112tiks3] at lower BMI, prompting lower BMI thresholds for intervention [^115vTLXP].

- **African ancestry pattern**: African ancestry often shows lower visceral fat but higher insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes risk at similar BMI.

- **Hispanic/Latino risk**: Hispanics/Latinos have higher central adiposity [^113yr5YJ] and NAFLD risk, partly due to genetic variants like PNPLA3 [^112aYvyz].

---

## Genetic variants influencing metabolic health

- **FTO and obesity**: FTO [^111vp86e] and other BMI-associated variants contribute to obesity and metabolic risk across ancestries, with variable effect sizes [^116RDakH].

- **PNPLA3 and NAFLD**: PNPLA3 (rs738409) [^112aYvyz] increases NAFLD risk, especially in Asians and Hispanics.

- **Polygenic scores**: Adiposity and insulin resistance polygenic scores differ by ancestry and interact with environment [^112DpEiR], modifying risk at a given BMI [^111JykDA] [^112S4YWM].

---

## Limitations of BMI across ethnic groups

Misclassification risk arises because **BMI alone can misclassify metabolic risk** [^116JZVoL] due to **ethnic differences in fat distribution** [^112NVXG2] and **genetic predisposition** [^112CR6tE]. Need for additional measures means that **waist circumference**, **waist-to-hip ratio** [^115KtsMc], and **metabolic biomarkers** [^117CQ3rW] improve risk assessment beyond BMI [^116JZVoL].

---

## Gene-environment interactions

Lifestyle modulation means that **diet**, **physical activity**, and **socioeconomic factors** interact with **genetic risk** [^112DpEiR], influencing **metabolic outcomes** [^111Dd6Ai]. Ancestry-specific effects show that **gene-environment interactions** vary by ancestry [^112DpEiR], affecting **risk prediction** [^112S4YWM] and **intervention response**.

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Ancestry-informed assessment**: Use ancestry-specific thresholds and genetic risk scores [^112CR6tE] to improve accuracy and equity [^117CQ3rW].

- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Combine BMI [^116JZVoL] with waist measures [^112NVXG2], metabolic biomarkers [^117CQ3rW], and genetic risk [^112CR6tE] for better risk stratification.

- **Personalized interventions**: Tailor lifestyle and pharmacologic strategies [^116RDakH] to genetic and ethnic risk profiles [^112CR6tE].

---

Ethnicity and genetics materially influence **metabolic health beyond BMI** [^116JZVoL] by shaping **fat distribution** and **genetic risk**. Integrating anthropometrics, biomarkers, and ancestry-informed genetic risk yields more accurate, equitable assessments and guides targeted prevention [^112CR6tE].

### Predictability of genetic risk score for insulin resistance is influenced by both BMI and race [^111JykDA]. Obesity (2025). Low credibility.

In the United States, African Americans (AA) are at greater risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to European Americans (EAs). The reason for this disparity is not completely clear but is believed to have a strong genetic component, possibly relating to insulin resistance (IR), a major pathophysiological contributor to the development of T2D. Multiple studies have identified that AA populations have lower whole-body insulin sensitivity relative to EA populations, predominantly due to lower skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.

A previous genome-wide association study in a European cohort was used to generate a genetic risk score (GRS) for IR. This study utilized genetic data from 188,577 individuals to identify genomic regions associated with fasting insulin adjusted for BMI and circulating concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Fasting insulin was adjusted for BMI to establish the genetic variants contributing to IR independent of adiposity. The resulting 53 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were individually weighted using an inverse-variance method and combined into a polygenic risk score, where a greater GRS indicated a higher genetic risk for IR. The GRS was then validated against values from both the euglycemic clamp and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and analyzed to identify associations between the 53 loci and phenotypic metabolic traits. Individuals with higher risk scores were phenotypically characterized by a lower BMI and percentage body fat, specifically in the context of overall risk assessment.

### Genetic ancestry influences gene-environment interactions with sociocultural factors: Results from the Hispanic community health study/study of Latinos [^112DpEiR]. HGG Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Often, studies aggregate all participants identified as Hispanic/Latino, despite genetic and environmental substructures, preventing the meaningful interrogation of the roles of genetics and environment in human health. Using the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), we examined how self-identified background group and genetic ancestry influence gene-environment interactions between body mass index (BMI) and a polygenic score for BMI (PGS BMI). Participants (n = 7,075) identified with six background groups: Central American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and South American.

Generalized linear models incorporating complex survey weighting were used to model BMI through joint and stratified analyses, including PGS BMI and other health-related variables. These analyses were based on background group and estimated Amerindigenous (AME) ancestry. Interaction effects were modeled between PGS BMI and diet and age at immigration. Comparing pooled to background group-stratified analyses, we observe heterogeneous distributions of environmental and sociocultural variables, as well as differing associations with AME ancestry. Within the multivariate model, PGS BMI performance decreased with increasing AME ancestry. After stratification, PGS-age-at-immigration interactions remained statistically significant in some strata:

- **Mexican background individuals** born in the US (50 states/DC) (β = 1.33, p < 0.01).
- **Dominican background individuals** 6–12 years old (β = 4.38, p < 0.001).
- **Cuban background individuals** 0–5 years old (β = 2.20, p = 0.015) relative to those ≥ 21 years old at migration.

### Genetic scores associated with favourable and unfavourable adiposity have consistent effect on metabolic profile and disease risk across diverse ethnic groups [^112CR6tE]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). High credibility.

This study aims to investigate the associations between genetic risk scores (GRS) for favourable and unfavourable adiposity and a wide range of adiposity-related outcomes across diverse populations.

- **Methods**: We utilised previously identified variants associated with favourable (36 variants) and unfavourable (38 variants) adiposity to create GRS for each adiposity phenotype. We used summary statistics from 39 outcomes generated by the Pan-UKB genome-wide association studies, Version 0.3, incorporating covariates such as age, sex, and principal components in six populations: European (n = 420,531), African (n = 6636), American (n = 980), Central/South Asian (n = 8876), East Asian (n = 2709), and Middle Eastern (n = 1599).

- **Results**: The favourable adiposity GRS was associated with a healthy metabolic profile, including lower risk of type 2 diabetes, lower liver enzyme levels, lower blood pressure, higher HDL-cholesterol, lower triglycerides, higher apolipoprotein A, lower apolipoprotein B, higher testosterone, lower calcium, and lower insulin-like growth factor 1, generally consistently across all populations. In contrast, the unfavourable adiposity GRS was associated with an adverse metabolic profile, including higher risk of type 2 diabetes, higher random glucose levels, higher HbA1c, lower HDL-cholesterol, higher triglycerides, higher liver enzyme levels, lower testosterone, and higher C-reactive protein, generally consistently across all populations.

The study provides evidence that the genetic scores associated with favourable and unfavourable adiposity have a consistent effect on metabolic profile and disease risk across diverse ethnic groups.

### Genome-wide association study of body fat distribution traits in Hispanics/Latinos from the HCHS/SOL [^113yr5YJ]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Central obesity is a leading health concern with a significant burden carried by ethnic minority populations, especially Hispanics/Latinos. Genetic factors contribute to the obesity burden overall and to inter-population differences. We aimed to identify the loci associated with central adiposity measured as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HIP) adjusted for body mass index (adjBMI) using the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We sought to determine if differences in associations differ by background group within HCHS/SOL and whether previously reported associations generalize to HCHS/SOL.

Our analyses included 7,472 women and 5,200 men of mainland (Mexican, Central and South American) and Caribbean (Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican) background residing in the United States. We performed genome-wide association analyses stratified and combined across sexes using linear mixed-model regression. We identified 16 variants for waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI), 22 for waist circumference adjusted for body mass index (WCadjBMI), and 28 for hip circumference adjusted for body mass index (HIPadjBMI), which reached suggestive significance (P < 1 × 10⁻⁶). Many loci exhibited differences in strength of associations by ethnic background and sex.

We brought a total of 66 variants forward for validation in cohorts (N = 34,161) with participants of Hispanic/Latino, African, and European descent. We confirmed four novel loci (P < 0.05 and consistent direction of effect, and P < 5 × 10⁻⁸ after meta-analysis), including two for.

### Genetic risk factors for BMI and obesity in an ethnically diverse population: Results from the population architecture using genomics and epidemiology (PAGE) study [^111vp86e]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that common genetic variants contribute to obesity. However, studies of this complex trait have focused on ancestrally European populations, despite the high prevalence of obesity in some minority groups.

- **Design and methods**: As part of the "Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE)" Consortium, we investigated the association between 13 GWAS-identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BMI and obesity in 69,775 subjects, including 6,149 American Indians, 15,415 African-Americans, 2,438 East Asians, 7,346 Hispanics, 604 Pacific Islanders, and 37,823 European Americans. For the BMI-increasing allele of each SNP, we calculated β coefficients using linear regression (for BMI) and risk estimates using logistic regression (for obesity defined as BMI ≥ 30) followed by fixed-effects meta-analysis to combine results across PAGE sites. Analyses stratified by racial/ethnic group assumed an additive genetic model and were adjusted for age, sex, and smoking. We defined "replicating SNPs" (in European Americans) and "generalizing SNPs" (in other racial/ethnic groups) as those associated with an allele frequency-specific increase in BMI.

- **Results**: By this definition, we replicated 9/13 SNP associations (5 out of 8 loci) in European Americans. We also generalized 8/13 SNP associations (5/8 loci) in East Asians, 7/13 (5/8 loci) in African Americans, 6/13 (4/8 loci) in Hispanics, 5/8 in Pacific Islanders (5/8 loci), and 5/9 (4/8 loci) in American Indians.

### Adiposity and metabolic health in Asian populations: an epidemiological study using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in Singapore [^112NVXG2]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and related cardiometabolic disturbances are increasing rapidly in the Asia-Pacific region. We investigated the contribution of excess adiposity, a key determinant of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk, to unfavorable cardiometabolic profiles among Asian ethnic subgroups.

- **Methods**: The Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS) Study is a population-based cohort comprising multiethnic Asian men and women living in Singapore, aged 30–84 years. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from individuals who had assessments of body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and metabolic characterization. In a subset of participants on no medication for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, we tested the relationship of BMI and visceral fat mass index (vFMI) with cardiometabolic phenotypes (glycemic indices, lipid levels, and blood pressure), disease outcomes (type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension), and metabolic syndrome score using multivariable regression analyses.

- **Findings**: Between April 2, 2018, and Jan 28, 2022, 10,004 individuals consented to be part of the HELIOS cohort, of whom 9,067 were included in the study (5,404 [59.6%] female, 3,663 [40.4%] male; 6,224 [68.6%] Chinese, 1,169 [12.9%] Malay, 1,674 [18.5%] Indian; mean age 52.8 years [SD 11.8]). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension was 8.2% (n = 744), 27.2% (n = 2,469), and 18.0% (n = 1,630), respectively. Malay and Indian participants had 3 to 4 times higher odds of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

### Ethnicity modifies the relationships of insulin resistance, inflammation, and adiponectin with obesity in a multiethnic Asian population [^112tiks3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

We considered several possible explanations as to why increasing levels of BMI were associated with greater increases in insulin resistance (IR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and a greater decline in adiponectin in Chinese individuals. First, it is well recognized that, despite a lower BMI, Asian-Indians have a greater degree of adiposity than Caucasians. Using a four-compartment model, Deurenberg et al. have shown that for the same age, sex, and BMI, Asian-Indians had the highest body fat percentage followed by Malays and Chinese. However, the relationship between BMI and adiposity was similar across ethnic groups, with no interaction between ethnicity and BMI. As such, we believe that ethnic differences in the relationship between BMI and adiposity per se do not account for the observed interactions.

Instead, the interactions might represent ethnic-specific sensitivity to the effects of increasing adiposity. This may relate to differences in fat distribution with increasing levels of adiposity, particularly in the visceral compartment. Lear et al, in the Multicultural Community Health Assessment Trial (M-CHAT), compared the relation between abdominal adipose tissue and total body fat among people living in Canada of aboriginal, Chinese, and Asian-Indian origin with people of European origin. They showed that ethnicity has an effect on fat distribution between the subcutaneous and visceral compartments with increasing levels of adiposity. However, this study did not directly compare Chinese with Asian-Indians, making it difficult to determine whether this could explain the differences observed between these groups.

### Metabolic syndrome is less likely to resolve in Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks after bariatric surgery [^117SfA9V]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

To determine predictors of metabolic syndrome and its resolution in a large, ethnically diverse adult population undergoing bariatric surgery, the study involved adults who underwent a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy between 2007 and 2009 (n = 4088) without revision during the study period from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2011. Diagnosis and resolution of metabolic syndrome were determined using standard criteria with electronic medical records of laboratory, diagnosis, and pharmacy information.

Patients were primarily women (82%), non-Hispanic black (17%) or Hispanic (32%), aged 45 ± 11 years, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 47.10 ± 7.73 kg/m² at the time of surgery. After multivariate adjustment, metabolic syndrome was less likely to resolve in patients if they had a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy procedure and a higher BMI at surgery, were older, were male, or were either Hispanic or non-Hispanic black. The effects of age, race/ethnicity, and BMI at the time of surgery remained significant after accounting for weight loss.

Based on our findings, bariatric surgery may be most effective for younger, less obese patients who are early in the course of their cardiometabolic disease. Future research should investigate the factors that lead to lower rates of disease resolution after bariatric surgery for racial and ethnic minority groups.

### Obesity related to metabolic syndrome: Comparison of obesity indicators in an older French population [^1171pyfW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities, with insulin resistance being a major component. This study analyzes the relationship between body fat composition and MS, comparing it to usual obesity indicators in an older adult population.

The PROgnostic indicator OF cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (PROOF) study is a prospective longitudinal community cohort study among the inhabitants of Saint-Étienne, France. It involves a cohort study of 1,011 subjects with a mean age of 65.6 ± 0.8 years at inclusion, recruited from the electoral list of the town in 2000. Among them, 806 subjects underwent Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to evaluate body fat and lean mass distribution. Biological metabolic parameters were evaluated using standard techniques, and the indices of obesity were calculated using standard formulas. The presence of metabolic syndrome and its components were simultaneously evaluated.

All obesity parameters were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in subjects with metabolic syndrome compared to those without. Body fat index (BFI) exhibited a stronger correlation to total fat mass, trunk fat mass, and body adiposity index (BAI). Correlations between body indices and metabolic components indicated that body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were more strongly associated with BFI compared to BAI and total fat mass. According to logistic regression analysis, only the waist-hip ratio (WHR) demonstrated a significant association with MS severity (p < 0.0001).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^117CQ3rW]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, more specifically with respect to the assessment of obesity-related complications, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend considering risk-based screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after the onset of puberty or after the age of 10 years, whichever occurs earlier, in children and adolescents with overweight, defined as a BMI ≥ 85th percentile, or obesity, defined as a BMI ≥ 95th percentile, who have one or more risk factors for diabetes.

- **Maternal history**: Diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus during the child's gestation.
- **Family history**: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a first- or second-degree relative.
- **High-risk race/ethnicity**: Such as Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.
- **Signs of insulin resistance**: Including conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or small-for-gestational-age birth weight.

### Obesity related to metabolic syndrome: comparison of obesity indicators in an older French population [^115KtsMc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities, with insulin resistance being a major component of the syndrome. This study analyzes the relationship between body fat composition and MS in comparison to usual obesity indicators in an older adult population.

- **Design**: The PROgnostic indicator OF cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (PROOF) study is a prospective longitudinal community cohort study among the inhabitants of Saint-Etienne, France.

- **Results**: All obesity parameters were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in subjects suffering from metabolic syndrome compared to those without it. The body fat index (BFI) presented a stronger correlation to total fat mass, trunk fat mass, and body adiposity index (BAI). The correlations between body indices and metabolic components showed that body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were more strongly associated with BFI compared to BAI and total fat mass. According to logistic regression analysis, only the waist-hip ratio (WHR) demonstrated a significant association with MS severity (p < 0.0001).

### Genetic influences, lifestyle and psychosocial aspects in relation to metabolically healthy obesity and conversion to a metabolically unhealthy state [^113RpEPW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

All analyses included smoking, age at measurement, ethnicity, and sex as covariates. Smoking was measured as a binary variable (yes/no) and contained information on smoking status during the time of the interview. Ethnicity was reported in three categories: Caucasian, African American, or other.

- **Statistical analyses**: All analyses were conducted in R, version 4.3.1. Descriptive statistics at baseline were calculated to characterize the study population with a BMI ≥ 30, as well as stratified by metabolic health status, presenting the total number of individuals and percentage of the total for categorical variables or mean and SD for continuous variables. We implemented multiple imputation by chained equations, with a detailed description provided in the Supplementary Material. All available measurements were included for each individual, and the correlation of repeated measurements within the same individual was accounted for using a clustered sandwich estimator of variance. Logistic regression models were used to analyse the 10 imputed datasets, adjusting for sex, age at measurement, ethnicity, and smoking. We first analysed cross-sectional associations between metabolic health and the exposure variables by regressing each measurement of metabolic health on the concomitant exposure measurement. Second, we analysed the association between the exposure variables and conversion from MHO to a metabolically unhealthy state by selecting all MHO measurements and regressing their concomitant exposure measurements on metabolic health at the subsequent measurement.

### High burden of birthweight-lowering genetic variants in Africans and Asians [^116JqyGn]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Birthweight is a complex multifactorial trait consistently associated with infant mortality and morbidity, childhood obesity, and adult diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiometabolic diseases, and cognitive function. There is growing interest in understanding the roles of gene–environment interactions in population differences in fetal growth, following two recent studies led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The studies found regional and population differences in fetal growth, even under similar unconstrained maternal socioeconomic and nutritional conditions.

The WHO study found significant variations in fetal growth among 12 countries from different parts of the world. The NICHD Fetal Growth Studies found significant differences in fetal growth among four U.S. racial and ethnic populations. The findings from both studies corroborated earlier studies that found population differences in birthweight and regional differences in low birthweight incidence, ranging from 6.4–7.7% in Europe and North America to 14.3% in Africa and 18.3% in Asia. The WHO study also found that maternal and fetal characteristics only partially explained these differences, consistent with earlier observations in which established non-genetic determinants of birthweight, including socio-demographic and lifestyle-related factors, parental anthropometry, and gestational age, did not fully explain the observed birthweight differences among populations.

### Associations between genetic obesity susceptibility and early postnatal fat and lean mass: An individual participant meta-analysis [^1141XRNT]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Patterns of body size and body composition associated with genetic obesity susceptibility inform the mechanisms that increase obesity risk. This study's objective was to test associations between genetic obesity susceptibility, represented by a combined obesity risk-allele score, and body size or body composition from birth to age five years.

A total of 3031 children from four birth cohort studies in England, France, and Spain were included in a meta-analysis. A combined obesity risk-allele score was calculated from genotypes at 16 variants identified by genome-wide association studies of adult body mass index (BMI).

Outcomes were age- and sex-adjusted standard deviation scores (SDS) for weight, length/height, BMI, fat mass, lean mass, and percentage of body fat at birth, as well as at ages 1, 2 to 3, and 4 to 5 years.

The obesity risk-allele score was not associated with infant size at birth. At age one year, it was positively associated with weight (β [SE], 0.020 [0.008] SDS per allele; p = 0.009) and length (β [SE], 0.020 [0.008] SDS per allele; p = 0.01), but not with BMI (β [SE], 0.013 [0.008] SDS per allele; p = 0.11). At age two to three years, these associations were stronger (weight: β [SE], 0.033 [0.008] SDS per allele; p < 0.001; height: β [SE], 0.025 [0.008] SDS per allele; p < 0.001), and were also seen for BMI (β [SE], 0.024 [0.008] SDS per allele; p = 0.003). The obesity risk-allele score was positively associated with postnatal fat mass (1 year: β [SE], 0.032 [0.017] SDS per allele; p = 0.05; 2–3 years: β [SE], 0.049 [0.018] SDS per allele; p = 0.05).

### Victoza [^113qfKuw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Race or ethnic groups: Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Victoza based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included White, Black or African American, Asian, and Hispanic or Latino/Non-Hispanic or Latino subjects.

- **Body weight**: Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of Victoza based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. However, the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg daily doses of Victoza provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 40–160 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Liraglutide was not studied in patients with body weight > 160 kg.

- **Patients with renal impairment**: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of Victoza were evaluated in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial. Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29%, and 30% lower, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Weight-for-age distribution and case-mix adjusted outcomes of 14,307 paediatric intensive care admissions [^1171o46b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We found a significantly increased risk of mortality in children of South Asian and 'other' ethnicity. A South Asian phenotype characterized by central adiposity, insulin resistance, and larger, possibly dysfunctional, adipocytes has been described. Published data suggest this may be present from childhood or even in utero; cord leptin, a biomarker of body fat mass at birth, has been found to be higher in South Asian babies compared to white Europeans. Why and how ethnicity is associated with differing risk-adjusted PIC mortality warrants further investigation. The aetiology is likely to be complex, including but not limited to biological polymorphisms, socio-economic status, access to and equity of healthcare provision, lifestyle, diet, and varying end-of-life care decisions according to ethnicity and culture. UK reference population anthropometric data largely exclude children of non-white ethnic origin "due to known differences in growth", which limits our ability to interpret weight-for-age in children of non-white ethnicity (Supplementary Appendix 3).

This study benefits from a large dataset, which was collected prospectively and is externally validated. All admissions were included with only two pragmatic exclusions: to remove spurious data and to reduce bias from short-timescale readmissions of the same patient while including deaths within 30 days of discharge.

We accept that this study has a number of weaknesses. PICU admission weight often relies on weight measured at admission to the referring hospital or ward, where most children are weighed as a routine. We acknowledge that some…

### Using noninvasive anthropometric indices to develop and validate a predictive model for metabolic syndrome in Chinese adults: a nationwide study [^114W12Af]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of complex metabolic disorders, including abdominal fat accumulation, high triglyceride levels, high cholesterol, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. MetS is not a specific disease but a cluster of multiple risk factors, an intermediate state between health and disease, whose primary role is to bring attention to the possibility of disease in people with an abnormal metabolism. The main components of MetS are insulin resistance and obesity, especially central obesity. Obesity plays an important role in the occurrence and development of MetS.

Obesity is increasingly recognized as a serious worldwide public health problem. According to recent studies, obesity is responsible for population-level deaths worldwide. Various methods have been developed to assess the degree of body obesity. Methods for directly measuring or calculating total body fat content include laboratory underwater weighing, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), skin caliper measurement, girth measurement, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and some calculation formulas, such as the Clinica Universidad de Navarra-Body Adiposity Estimator (CUN-BAE).

- **Anthropometric indices**: Scholars have developed anthropometric indices to describe body fat distribution and body shape in humans. The most commonly used indices include body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Other novel indices include the Body Roundness Index (BRI) and A Body Shape Index (ABSI).

### Impact of ethnicity on the relationship between telomere length and metabolic markers - a multi-ethnic study from Kuwait [^115uvoBN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Telomeres play a critical role in maintaining genomic stability, and their length serves as a marker of cellular aging. Emerging evidence suggests that telomere length may be a clinical risk factor for metabolic diseases. This study examines the associations between telomere length and demographic factors, including metabolic health, in a multi-ethnic cohort to provide insight into the impact of ethnicity on the potential use of telomere length as a biomarker for assessing diabetes risk.

The cross-sectional study cohort comprised 2,083 individuals of Arab, South Asian, or Southeast Asian descent living in Kuwait. Telomere lengths were measured from peripheral venous blood DNA using qPCR-based techniques. Associations between telomere length and metabolic indicators, including BMI, diabetes status, HbA1c, FBG, and HOMA-IR, were analyzed using Spearman correlation and quantile regression, adjusting for covariates.

South Asian and Southeast Asian participants had significantly higher median telomere lengths than Arabs. Median telomere lengths varied significantly across sex, age tertiles, ethnicity, diabetes status, BMI, and HOMA-IR scores. Telomere length was negatively associated with being male (β = -0.49, 95% CI: [-0.85, -0.13]), being diabetic (β = -0.77, 95% CI: [-1.25, -0.29]), age (β = -0.06, 95% CI: [-0.08, -0.04]), HOMA-IR (β = -1.01, 95% CI: [-1.43, -0.575]), BMI (β = -0.11, 95% CI: [-0.14, -0.083]), and HbA1c (β = -0.213, 95% CI: [-0.33, -0.096]). Negative correlations between telomere lengths and TG, HbA1c, FBG, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels were more highly significant.

### Screen time behaviours may interact with obesity genes, independent of physical activity, to influence adolescent BMI in an ethnically diverse cohort [^116RS4Sz]. Pediatric Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

There has been little investigation of gene-by-environment interactions related to sedentary behaviour, a risk factor for obesity defined as leisure screen time (ST), which includes television, video, and computer games.

- **Objective**: To test the hypothesis that limiting ST use attenuates the genetic predisposition to increased body mass index (BMI), independent of physical activity.

- **Design**: Using 7,642 wave II participants of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; mean age = 16.4 years, 52.6% female), we assessed the interaction of ST (hours per week) and 41 established obesity single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with age- and sex-specific BMI Z-scores in 4,788 European-American (EA), 1,612 African-American (AA), and 1,242 Hispanic American (HA) adolescents.

- **Results**: Nominally significant SNP*ST interactions were found for FLJ35779 in EA and GNPDA2 in AA, with none in HA. The interactions were quantified as EA: beta [SE] = 0.016 [0.007] and AA: beta [SE] = 0.016 [0.011] per 7 hours per week of ST and one risk allele in relation to BMI Z-score.

- **Conclusions**: While for two established BMI loci, we find evidence that high levels of ST exacerbate the influence of obesity susceptibility variants on body mass; overall, we do not find strong evidence for interactions between the majority of established obesity loci. However, future studies with larger sample sizes, or those that may build on our study and the growing published literature, are clearly warranted.

### Trends in obesity and adiposity measures by race or ethnicity among adults in the United States 2011–18: Population based study [^116JZVoL]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

Obesity is recognized as a common, complex, serious, and costly disease, continuing to be a major focus of public health efforts worldwide. It has broad effects on human health, being associated with increased risk of physical diseases (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) and mental illnesses (e.g. depression, substance abuse, and schizophrenia). Obesity also results in increased mortality and has caused sizable burdens on people, communities, and society. Therefore, it is crucial to track the prevalence of obesity to provide evidence to inform policy efforts and prevention programmes.

Accurate assessment of adiposity is important for obesity research, practice, and policy. Body mass index is the most widely used index of obesity, but it cannot accurately reflect body adiposity. Waist circumference is a good measure of abdominal fatness and is used to define central obesity and metabolic syndrome. Imaging-based methods for assessing body composition have been increasingly used as an objective measure of adiposity. Among imaging-based methods, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is a validated method for body composition assessment.

### Progressive influence of body mass index-associated genetic markers in rural Gambians [^115tX3Cz]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

In populations of European ancestry, the genetic contribution to body mass index (BMI) increases with age during childhood but then declines during adulthood, possibly due to the cumulative effects of environmental factors. How the effects of genetic factors on BMI change with age in other populations is unknown.

- **Subjects and methods**: In a rural Gambian population (N = 2535), we used a combined allele risk score, comprising genotypes at 28 'Caucasian adult BMI-associated' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as a marker of the genetic influence on body composition, and related this to internally standardised z-scores for birthweight (zBW), weight-for-height (zWT-HT), weight-for-age (zWT), height-for-age (zHT), and zBMI cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

- **Results**: Cross-sectionally, the genetic score was positively associated with adult zWT (0.018 ± 0.009 per allele, p = 0.034, N = 1426) and zWT-HT (0.025 ± 0.009, p = 0.006), but not with size at birth or childhood zWT-HT (0.008 ± 0.005, p = 0.11, N = 2211). The effect of the genetic score on zWT-HT strengthened linearly with age from birth through to late adulthood (age interaction term: 0.0083 z-scores/allele/year; 95% CI 0.0048 to 0.0118, p = 0.0000032).

- **Conclusions**: Genetic variants for obesity in populations of European ancestry have direct relevance to bodyweight in nutritionally deprived African settings. In such settings, genetic obesity susceptibility appears to regulate change in weight status throughout the life course, which provides insight into its potential physiological role.

### Impact of maternal prepregnancy body mass index on neonatal outcomes following extremely preterm birth [^114ra1di]. Obesity (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Data sources**: We combined data from three prospectively collected, national, population-based European cohort studies. All studies comprised births between 22 and 26 completed weeks' gestational age (i.e. up to 26 weeks and 6 days). The EXPRESS study included births occurring in Sweden between April 1, 2004, and March 31, 2007 (1011 births). The EPICure 2 study included births in England between January 1 and December 31, 2006 (3133 births). The EPIPAGE 2 study included births in 25 French regions: 21 of the 22 metropolitan regions and 4 overseas regions between March 28 and December 31, 2011 (2205 births).

- **Study population**: We included all singleton fetuses alive at maternal hospital admission who were subsequently born between 22 and 26 completed weeks' gestational age. We excluded multiple births because outcomes may be influenced by pregnancy type. We also excluded fetuses delivered following termination of pregnancy due to differences among nations regarding late terminations (e.g. not allowed in Sweden) and practices related to detection of fetal anomalies, such as timing of the second semester ultrasound.

- **Harmonization**: We used variables that were previously harmonized among the three cohorts. Additional variables were identified from the cohorts' data dictionaries and harmonized.

- **Exposure**: The exposure was maternal prepregnancy BMI, derived from obstetric records (either self-reported or measured at the first antenatal visit). Mothers were categorized into four groups using the standard World Health Organization (WHO) classification.

### Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for body fat distribution in 694 649 individuals of European ancestry [^114tRmLJ]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Low credibility.

More than one in three adults worldwide is either overweight or obese. Epidemiological studies indicate that the location and distribution of excess fat, rather than general adiposity, are more informative for predicting the risk of obesity sequelae, including cardiometabolic disease and cancer. We performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of body fat distribution, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI), and identified 463 signals in 346 loci. Heritability and variant effects were generally stronger in women than men, and we found approximately one-third of all signals to be sexually dimorphic. The 5% of individuals carrying the most WHRadjBMI-increasing alleles were 1.62 times more likely than the bottom 5% to have a WHR above the thresholds used for metabolic syndrome. These data, made publicly available, will inform the biology of body fat distribution and its relationship with disease.

### Genetic influences, lifestyle and psychosocial aspects in relation to metabolically healthy obesity and conversion to a metabolically unhealthy state [^112jHUpT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The study population originates from the longitudinal HRS, which includes individuals aged 50 years and older, along with their spouses of any age, totaling more than 40,000 individuals. The HRS is based on a comprehensive interview-based design, with biennial follow-ups starting from 1992 and currently has 15 waves. To account for attrition, additional participants are recruited every six years. Since wave 8 in 2006, the study alternates between face-to-face and telephone interviews for each wave. Half of the sample is interviewed face to face, while the other half is interviewed over the telephone. This alternating method ensures face-to-face interview data are systematically collected at four-year intervals. Each interview session gathers extensive self-reported data, and the face-to-face interviews also include physical assessments and blood sample collection. The study uses information from all face-to-face interviews from waves 8 to 13, covering 22,377 individuals with 42,839 measurement occasions. Saliva samples for genotyping were collected in waves 8–11, from which polygenic scores for BMI (PGS BMI) and other phenotypic characteristics were computed and are available for 15,190 individuals.

- **Ethics**: All HRS participants provided informed consent, and the data collection was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (2022–06634–01).

- **Measurement**: Height and weight were measured.

### Genetic influences, lifestyle and psychosocial aspects in relation to metabolically healthy obesity and conversion to a metabolically unhealthy state [^112h6gmN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the growing body of research on metabolic health in obesity. Our findings highlight differences between metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) in lifestyle and psychosocial aspects, including physical activity, education, and depressive symptoms. It should be noted that the same patterns were observed in people with overweight and normal weight, underlining that these factors are important to metabolic health regardless of BMI level. Additionally, our results suggest that those with a genetic predisposition to a higher BMI may be more likely to remain MHO, warranting further investigation.

Previous studies have highlighted the importance of metabolic health, especially with a refined definition of metabolic health, as the risk of adverse health is lower in MHO than in metabolically unhealthy BMI categories, including normal weight. Continued research into how metabolic health can be promoted and maintained may advance our understanding so that we can develop more targeted interventions to improve metabolic health across the BMI spectrum.

### The influence of age and sex on genetic associations with adult body size and shape: A large-scale genome-wide interaction study [^113sMEoG]. PLOS Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 genetic variants contributing to BMI, a measure of body size, or waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), a measure of body shape. Body size and shape change as people grow older, and these changes differ substantially between men and women. To systematically screen for age- and/or sex-specific effects of genetic variants on BMI and WHRadjBMI, we performed meta-analyses of 114 studies (up to 320,485 individuals of European descent) with genome-wide chip and/or Metabochip data by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium. Each study tested the association of up to ~2.8M SNPs with BMI and WHRadjBMI in four strata (men ≤ 50y, men > 50y, women ≤ 50y, women > 50y), and summary statistics were combined in stratum-specific meta-analyses.

We then screened for variants that showed age-specific effects (G x AGE), sex-specific effects (G x SEX), or age-specific effects that differed between men and women (G x AGE x SEX).

- **Body mass index (BMI)**: We identified 15 loci (11 previously established for main effects, four novel) that showed significant (FDR < 5%) age-specific effects, of which 11 had larger effects in younger (< 50y) than in older adults (≥ 50y). No sex-dependent effects were identified for BMI.

- **Waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI)**: We identified 44 loci (27 previously established for main effects, 17 novel) with sex-specific effects, of which 28 showed larger effects in women than in men, five showed larger effects in men than in women, and 11 showed opposite effects between sexes. No age-dependent effects were identified.

### Ethnic variability in newborn metabolic screening markers associated with false-positive outcomes [^111u26B5]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Low credibility.

- **Analysis of race/ethnicity and metabolic markers**: Effect-size analysis between infants in the four race/ethnicity groups identified significant differences for 79.1% of the markers (34/43 markers, Cohen's d > .2). This analysis was performed in 19,247 full-term infants in the birth weight (BW) category of 3001 to 3500 g in order to control for gestational age (GA) and BW effects on marker levels (Figure 1B). Infants with positive/unknown total parenteral nutrition (TPN) status and age at collection (AaC) outside the 24 to 48 hours window were excluded from this analysis. Significant findings included elevated C5, C5OH, and C5DC in Blacks; elevated C3 and C3/C2 in Hispanics; and elevated C14, C14:1, as well as decreased citrulline in Whites (Figure S4).

A separate analysis in this cohort between females (n = 9,152) and males (n = 10,054) within each race/ethnicity group showed that marker differences between females and males were similar between race/ethnicity groups. An analysis in a larger cohort of 58,056 term infants with a normal BW confirmed the effect of ethnicity on marker levels (Figure 2, Table S4). Finally, similar ethnicity-related marker level differences were found for 47,800 infants recorded with only a single race/ethnicity category (Figure S5), which are a subgroup (82%) of the 58,056 infants.

### Comparison of waist to height ratio and body indices for prediction of metabolic disturbances in the Korean population: the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2011 [^117L9GEb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to identify the best predictor of metabolic risk among the body index variables in the general population, evaluated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or anthropometric indices, including the waist to height ratio (WHtR).

- **Patients and methods**: Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2011 were used for the analyses, resulting in 15,965 participants being included in this study. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the body weight divided by the height squared. The WHtR was calculated as the waist circumference divided by height. Body composition indices such as lean mass (LM), fat mass (FM), trunk fat mass (TFM), and bone mineral content (BMC) were determined using DEXA. Skeletal muscle mass (SM) was defined as the sum of the lean soft masses of both extremities. The LM, FM, BMC, TFM, and SM indices were calculated by dividing the total LM, total FM, total BMC, TFM, or SM by the height squared.

- **Results**: The WHtR had the highest area under the curve (AUC) and was the best predictor of metabolic syndrome for both sexes. Additionally, the WHtR had the highest AUCs for components of metabolic syndrome (male: AUC 0.823, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.814–0.832; female: AUC 0.870, 95% CI 0.863–0.877). There was a small, statistically significant difference in AUC between WHtR and the other indices. Multivariate logistic regression showed that male participants in the second, third, and fourth quartiles had a 4.0 (95% CI, 3.1–5.2), 9.6 (95% CI, 7.5–12.3), and 36.1 (95% CI, 28.0–46.0).

### Comparison of waist to height ratio and body indices for prediction of metabolic disturbances in the Korean population: The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2011 [^11511aWp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The present study has a number of limitations. First, it is limited by its cross-sectional nature, and ethnic differences were not evaluated. This study design showed associations between the indices and metabolic diseases but could not establish causality between the indices and metabolic syndrome, nor their ability to predict metabolic diseases. Second, the present study possesses the probability of recall bias from a self-reporting questionnaire survey. The impact of these limitations is reduced by the large sample size in the present study, yet it did not offset the cross-sectional nature of the study. A prospective study, including follow-up data, is needed to show the cause-and-effect relationships between indices and metabolic diseases.

### Epigenome-wide association study of BMI in Black populations from InterGEN and GENOA [^112CjkqK]. Obesity (2023). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of obesity have grown to pandemic proportions, with approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide exceeding obesity or overweight criteria. By 2030, adults with obesity or overweight are expected to account for approximately 58% of the world's population. Body mass index (BMI) is an important quantitative measure of adiposity. Lifestyle, behavior, and environmental influences on the development of obesity include overconsumption of calories, lack of physical activity, medications, and the quality of food available. Health consequences due to obesity include hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality.

However, beyond external lifestyle and environmental factors, genome-wide association studies have shown significant associations of genes with adiposity, particularly among minority populations. Literature is lacking on epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) among Black/African American (AA) populations, who are disproportionately affected by obesity.

Black/AA populations have a younger age of mortality and onset of cardiometabolic disorders than other ethnic groups. The age of mortality and risk for cardiometabolic disorders can be strongly influenced by environmental factors. Some of these factors include discrimination and socioeconomic status (SES), which can contribute to poor mental and physical health. Over time, environmental factors such as experiencing discrimination can contribute to differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns. DNAm is an epigenetic mark that is invol.

### Association of a genetic risk score with body mass index across different birth cohorts [^111Dd6Ai]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Many genetic variants are associated with body mass index (BMI); associations may have changed with the 20th-century obesity epidemic and may differ for black vs. white individuals.

- **Objective**: Using birth cohort as an indicator for exposure to an obesogenic environment, the objective is to evaluate whether genetic predisposition to higher BMI has a larger magnitude of association among adults from more recent birth cohorts, who were exposed to the obesity epidemic at younger ages.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was an observational study of 8,788 adults in the US national Health and Retirement Study, who were aged 50 years and older, born between 1900 and 1958, with as many as 12 BMI assessments from 1992 to 2014.

- **Exposures**: A multilocus genetic risk score for BMI (GRS-BMI) was calculated as the weighted sum of alleles of 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI, with weights equal to the published per-allele effects. The GRS-BMI represents how much each person's BMI is expected to differ, based on genetic background (with respect to these 29 loci), from the BMI of a sample member with median genetic risk. The median-centered GRS-BMI ranged from -1.68 to 2.01.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: BMI was based on self-reported height and weight.

- **Results**: GRS-BMI was significantly associated with BMI among white participants (n = 7482; mean age at first assessment, 59 years; 3373 [45%] were men; P < 0.001) and among black participants (n = 1306; mean age at first assessment, 57 years; 505 [39%] were men; P < 0.001) but accounted for 0.99% of variation in BMI among white participants and 1.37%.

### Ancestral diversity improves discovery and fine-mapping of genetic loci for anthropometric traits-the Hispanic/Latino anthropometry consortium [^115E28Be]. HGG Advances (2022). Low credibility.

In the US, as in other high-income nations, both the population size and diversity in national origins (backgrounds) of Hispanic/Latinos have been increasing over the past several decades, with 24% of the US adult population identifying as Hispanic/Latino by 2065. US Hispanic/Latino adults and children/adolescents face a greater burden of obesity than their non-Hispanic white counterparts.

Thus, there is a need to study Hispanic/Latino populations to fully address these disparities. Specifically, we sought to understand the role that Native American or other under-studied components of admixture have on the genetic architecture of anthropometric traits in Hispanic/Latinos, and their relationship with gene expression. At the time of writing, no large-scale GWAS of anthropometric traits has been conducted among Hispanic/Latino populations; we therefore performed a large-scale genomic study of multiple anthropometric traits, including BMI, height, and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), in Hispanic/Latino populations to describe what may be novel loci, or new signals in established loci, for this population.

### Genetic influences, lifestyle and psychosocial aspects in relation to metabolically healthy obesity and conversion to a metabolically unhealthy state [^116GPPrt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

To increase our understanding of factors influencing metabolic health in obesity, we used longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We investigated whether physical activity, education, depressive symptoms, and genetic predisposition to a higher BMI differ between metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO), and whether these factors are associated with stability in metabolic health or conversion to a metabolically unhealthy state in individuals with MHO. To determine if the associations are specific to metabolic health in obesity, we investigated the same associations in individuals with normal weight and overweight. Therefore, we aimed to contribute to the understanding of the MHO phenotype and the factors that may influence maintained metabolic health in obesity.

### Ethnic variability in newborn metabolic screening markers associated with false-positive outcomes [^112sBMnn]. Journal of inherited metabolic disease (2020). Low credibility.

The study examines the impact of ethnic variability on newborn metabolic screening markers and their association with false-positive outcomes. This research highlights the importance of considering ethnic differences in screening processes to reduce the incidence of false positives, which can lead to unnecessary stress and additional testing for families.

The authors note that ethnic variability in metabolic markers might affect screening accuracy. They suggest that adjustments to current screening protocols could be beneficial in mitigating these discrepancies. The findings underline the potential for personalized approaches in newborn screening programs, potentially leading to more accurate and equitable healthcare outcomes.

This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the personalization of medical testing and the significance of ethnic diversity in healthcare studies.

### Trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of childhood body mass index identifies novel loci and age-specific effects [^114NK5Nx]. HGG Advances (2025). High credibility.

The global proportion of children classified as obese has grown dramatically over the past several decades, from an age-standardized prevalence of less than 1% in 1975 for both boys and girls to 7.8% in boys and 5.6% in girls in 2016. Alarmingly, the majority of children classified as obese at age 3 years remain obese during adolescence, which in turn increases the risk of severe obesity in adulthood. Obesity during childhood also increases the risk of adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes later in life, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, thereby motivating the characterization of risk factors for childhood obesity.

Obesity is a complex condition influenced by intrauterine, environmental, developmental, and genetic factors and their interactions. Genomic searches in selected families with extreme adiposity phenotypes and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in epidemiologic cohorts have identified genes that contribute to monogenic forms of obesity in adults, as well as over 1,000 genetic loci that contribute to polygenic obesity traits. In contrast, the genetic architecture of childhood obesity, historically quantified via body mass index (BMI), is less well characterized, with several early studies restricted to children with severe obesity or very broad age ranges. Although BMI is an imperfect measure, it is strongly associated with waist circumference and measures of fat mass, and both higher BMI and waist circumference are associated with increased future risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Progressive influence of body mass index-associated genetic markers in rural Gambians [^111v1JqB]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

This study showed that common genetic variation, robustly associated with obesity risk in populations of European and Asian origin, also affects the adult weight status (WT-HT) of lean Africans (rural Gambians) living in a nutritionally deprived environment. A cumulative risk score of 28 'BMI' risk alleles was employed to maximize statistical power, reduce multiple testing, and represent a generic index of genetic obesity susceptibility. We acknowledge that a composite risk score does not permit any inference regarding the possible differential contribution of individual SNPs. However, we had previously investigated 16 FTO SNPs in our study population and did not observe individual associations with body mass.

Compared to similar data employing cumulative risk scores, the effect sizes in our study (i.e. 0.018 to 0.025 of a z-score per risk allele on adult weight and WT-HT) amounted to approximately one-third to one-half of those seen in populations of European ancestry living in affluent environmental conditions using a score of 32 SNPs (0.17 kg/m² per allele). Of the recent studies including African American samples, some support reduced effect sizes, while others report comparable results to those seen in populations of European origin. However, the directional consistency across all these different populations indicates evidence for shared genetic influences on BMI and other anthropometric traits across the whole spectrum of ethnicity and nutritional availability.

### Mafld: an ideal framework for understanding disease phenotype in individuals of normal weight [^115vTLXP]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

In a similar vein, research examining the distribution of adipose tissue among different ethnic populations indicates that individuals of South Asian and Chinese descent tend to possess higher levels of visceral adipose tissue compared with Europeans, even when accounting for overall body fat. Furthermore, the negative consequences of weight gain are more pronounced among Asians compared with adults of other races/ethnicities, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites. A positive correlation between an increase in BMI by one unit and an elevated likelihood of developing hypertension and diabetes is more profound among individuals of Asian descent. Consequently, the World Health Organization has suggested a reduced BMI threshold as a catalyst for health intervention among Asians who exhibit greater susceptibility due to having low BMI and higher body fat percentage in comparison with non-Hispanic Whites. The precise mechanisms responsible for these racial disparities have yet to be fully elucidated.

Moreover, the existence of a significant heritable component in relation to metabolic health is likely. Despite the absence of any GWAS conducted particularly to investigate this matter, specific studies have shown the presence of genetic variations that influence the distribution of body fat. A GWAS has successfully discovered 53 genetic loci that are associated with an increased susceptibility to cardiometabolic diseases. These loci are characterized by lower levels of peripheral adiposity as well as greater insulin resistance phenotypes.

### Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and pre-metabolic syndrome in health professionals: Latinmets Brazil study [^115vURAE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and HC increased with the number of metabolic syndrome (MS) components. Health professionals with two or more components showed higher values of age, weight, waist circumference (WC), waist/hip ratio (WHpR), conicity index (COI), waist/height ratio (WHtR), body fat percentage, fat mass, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR, and lower HDL-c compared with those who had one or no component. Health professionals with MS had higher levels of systolic blood pressure, insulin, and complement C3 compared with subjects with one or no component. Those with MS had higher body adiposity index (BAI) values and higher uric acid concentrations compared to individuals without MS. Height, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, and hs-CRP did not differ between groups.

### Ethnic variability in newborn metabolic screening markers associated with false-positive outcomes [^112znNyq]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Low credibility.

We uncovered an association between MS/MS disease markers and race/ethnicity, revealing that these differences could lead to false-positive newborn screens for metabolic disorders. We do not suggest selecting different NBS marker cutoffs solely based on race/ethnicity. While ethnicity-adjusted marker levels could reduce false-positives, they might also lower screening sensitivity and increase false-negatives, which is the primary concern of NBS. Nevertheless, the study results could inform the second-tier interpretive analysis of screen-positive cases. For instance, CLIR tools simultaneously correct analyte levels and ratios for covariates such as preterm birth, sex, and BW to reduce false-positives.

Race/ethnicity information could be employed in a regression model, alongside other covariates (e.g. BW, GA, AaC, sex), to adjust metabolic marker levels or by developing a data mining model incorporating all covariates to predict metabolic disease status. Each method requires an extensive amount of self-reported race/ethnicity data that may not be recorded by every NBS program. Overcoming these challenges could enhance our ability to screen and diagnose metabolic diseases in diverse and admixed populations.

The cause of the identified marker level differences among race/ethnicity groups is unknown. It is possible that systematic disparities based on socioeconomic status and ethnicity could affect BW, GA, and maternal nutrition, while access to prenatal vitamins could affect B12 levels in MMA screen-positive infants.

### Ethnic variability in newborn metabolic screening markers associated with false-positive outcomes [^115VHTVs]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Low credibility.

Newborn screening (NBS) is a public health program that identifies infants with heritable disorders before the onset of clinical signs, allowing for early and life-saving intervention. Screening for metabolic disorders using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identifies most affected newborns, along with a large number of false-positive infants. In some states, initial screen-positive results are followed by second-tier MS/MS-based testing with higher specificity. Diagnostic biochemical and/or DNA testing is performed to confirm true positive or reject false positive results, establishing the final diagnosis and guiding patient treatment. False-positive screens for metabolic disorders can also be identified using post-analytical interpretive tools in Clinical Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR, formerly R4S). Using these algorithms, NBS data can be adjusted based on several clinical variables associated with false-positive screens, such as gestational age (GA), sex, birth weight (BW), age at blood collection, season of birth, and nutritional therapy.

We recently reported elevated screening marker levels for methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) in healthy Hispanic infants, which correlated with a higher MMA false positive rate for this group. Ethnicity-related differences in NBS marker levels have also been reported for cystic fibrosis (CF), congenital hypothyroidism (CH), and total galactose (TGAL). Isolated TGAL elevations have been found in certain ethnic groups, such as the Hmong, resulting in a disproportionate number of false-positive cases.

### Trans-ethnic fine-mapping of genetic loci for body mass index in the diverse ancestral populations of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study reveals evidence for multiple signals at established loci [^115Urhtx]. Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Most body mass index (BMI) genetic loci have been identified in studies of primarily European ancestries. The effect of these loci in other racial/ethnic groups is less clear. Thus, we aimed to characterize the generalizability of 170 established BMI variants, or their proxies, to diverse US populations and trans-ethnically fine-map 36 BMI loci using a sample of more than 102,000 adults of African, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, European, and American Indian/Alaskan Native descent from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Study. We performed linear regression of the natural log of BMI (18.5–70 kg/m²) on the additive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at BMI loci on the MetaboChip (Illumina, Inc.), adjusting for age, sex, population stratification, study site, or relatedness. We then performed fixed-effect meta-analyses and a Bayesian trans-ethnic meta-analysis to empirically cluster by allele frequency differences. Finally, we approximated conditional and joint associations to test for the presence of secondary signals. We noted directional consistency with the previously reported risk alleles beyond what would have been expected by chance (binomial p < 0.05). Nearly a quarter of the previously described BMI index SNPs and 29 of 36 densely-genotyped BMI loci on the MetaboChip replicated/generalized in trans-ethnic analyses. We observed multiple signals at nine loci, including the description of seven loci with novel multiple signals. This study supports the generalization of most common genetic loci to diverse ancestral populations and emphasizes the importance.

### Inference of causal relationships between genetic risk factors for cardiometabolic phenotypes and female-specific health conditions [^1176uS6f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Cardiometabolic diseases are highly comorbid, but their relationship with female-specific or overwhelmingly female-predominant health conditions, such as breast cancer, endometriosis, and pregnancy complications, is understudied. This study aimed to estimate the cross-trait genetic overlap and influence of the genetic burden of cardiometabolic traits on health conditions unique to women.

Using electronic health record data from 71,008 ancestrally diverse women, we examined relationships between 23 obstetrical/gynecological conditions and 4 cardiometabolic phenotypes: body mass index, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. We performed four analyses:

- **Cross-trait genetic correlation analyses**: Compare genetic architecture.
- **Polygenic risk score-based association tests**: Characterize shared genetic effects on disease risk.
- **Mendelian randomization**: For significant associations to assess cross-trait causal relationships.
- **Chronology analyses**: Visualize the timeline of events unique to groups of women with high and low genetic burden for cardiometabolic traits and highlight the disease prevalence in risk groups by age.

We observed 27 significant associations between cardiometabolic polygenic scores and obstetrical/gynecological conditions, including associations between body mass index and endometrial cancer, body mass index and polycystic ovarian syndrome, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, and type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Mendelian randomization analysis provided additional evidence of independent causal effects.

### High burden of birthweight-lowering genetic variants in Africans and Asians [^111JP6Ty]. BMC Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Birthweight is an important predictor of infant morbidity and mortality and is associated with cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and diabetes in childhood and adulthood. Birthweight and fetal growth show regional and population variations even under similar maternal conditions, and a large proportion of these differences are not explained by environmental factors. Whether and to what extent population genetic variations at key birthweight-associated loci account for the residual birthweight disparities not explained by environmental determinants is unknown. We hypothesized that the cumulative burden of genetic variants with a birthweight-lowering effect (GRB) is different among ancestrally diverse populations.

- **Methods**: Genotype data were extracted from phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project for 2,504 participants from 26 global populations grouped into five super-populations. GRB was calculated in offspring as the weighted sum of the number of birthweight-lowering genetic variants of 59 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with birthweight, and comparisons were made between Europeans and non-Europeans.

- **Results**: GRB was significantly higher in Africans (mean difference 3.15; 95% confidence interval 2.64, 3.66), admixed Americans (3.02; 2.34, 3.70), East Asians (2.85; 2.29, 3.41), and South Asians (1.07; 0.49, 1.65) compared to Europeans. Birthweight-lowering genetic variants in Africans and East Asians were enriched for rare and frequency-fixed alleles (P < 0.001). African and Asian populations had the greatest deviation from the expectation of the comparison.

### It's not weight: Chipping the glass ceiling of women's cardiovascular health [^11511Jyw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

As medicine moves toward a more precise, individualized approach, recognizing differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment across sexes, genders, the lifespan, and ethnic groups is vitally important. Gender-specific analysis and recommendations for CVD, such as heart failure and coronary artery disease, are becoming increasingly common, emphasizing the need for gender-specific monitoring, diagnoses, and treatment strategies, along with repeated calls to action for improving CVD outcomes among women.

Traditionally, identifying individuals at greater risk of CVD has employed risk identification strategies such as metabolic syndrome diagnoses or American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology atherosclerotic risk score assessments. These strategies identify individuals at risk primarily based on measures of body size, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels. Although these measures are objective, significant behavioral risk factors also influence experiences of CVD for women.

A greater prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been identified among women compared to men, which has increased over the past several decades. Furthermore, the effects of traditional risk factors on CVD experiences in women differ from those in men. These factors include smoking, obesity, and sedentary behavior, among others. For women, these modifiable risk factors account for 94% of the population-attributable risks of myocardial infarction, highlighting the critical importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to reduce CVD risks.

### Genetic predisposition to obesity is associated with insulin secretion in Chinese adults: The Cardiometabolic Risk in Chinese (CRC) study [^116kZo8M]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

The etiological role of obesity in determining diabetes risk among Asians may be different from that among Caucasians. This study aimed to investigate the association between genetic predisposition to obesity and measures of insulin secretion and resistance in a large Chinese cohort.

Study samples were from a community-based health examination survey in central China. A total of 2,058 subjects with available biomarker levels were included in the present study. A genetic risk score (GRS) of obesity was derived on the basis of thirteen Asian-specific body mass index (BMI)-associated variants.

High obesity GRS was significantly associated with increased homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-B score (β = 7.309; P = 0.001) but not related to measures of insulin resistance. Adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and levels of lipids did not appreciably change the results. In addition, we found significant interactions between the obesity GRS and measures of body fat distribution, including waist circumference (WC; P for interaction = 0.004) and neck circumference (NC; P for interaction = 0.014) on HOMA-B score.

Our results suggest that genetic predisposition to obesity may affect beta cell function in Chinese adults, and body fat distribution may modify these genetic effects.

### Genomics and phenomics of body mass index reveals a complex disease network [^116RDakH]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The global prevalence and disease burden of obesity continue to rise in the United States and worldwide, posing a major threat to public health and quality of life. Variation in body mass index (BMI), the metric commonly used to define obesity, is highly heritable. Obesity and extreme obesity are strongly associated with a growing number of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary heart disease, which are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality.

It remains uncertain whether obesity lies in the causal pathway, is a confounding factor, or shares a common etiology with these co-occurring disease conditions. The totality of trials on metabolic bariatric surgery provides consistent evidence of efficacy for weight loss and growing evidence of increased survival and other health benefits associated with surgery. Randomized clinical trials of pharmacotherapy with newer glucose-lowering agents, including SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, have also shown evidence of weight loss associated with reduced risk of major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists plus lifestyle interventions is associated with sustained weight loss in obese nondiabetics, although further study is needed to assess tolerability and overall clinical benefits.

Nevertheless, data are sparse on the interconnectedness of BMI-related conditions that could be influenced by emerging surgical and pharmacological approaches to obesity prevention and treatment. Mendelian randomization (MR) provides an esti…

### Ancestral diversity improves discovery and fine-mapping of genetic loci for anthropometric traits-the Hispanic/Latino Anthropometry Consortium [^116udyXa]. HGG Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Hispanic/Latinos have been underrepresented in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for anthropometric traits, despite their notable anthropometric variability, ancestry proportions, and high burden of growth stunting and overweight/obesity. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed densely imputed genetic data in a sample of Hispanic/Latino adults to identify and fine-map genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), height, and BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI).

We conducted a GWAS of 18 studies/consortia as part of the Hispanic/Latino Anthropometry (HISLA) Consortium (stage 1, n = 59,771) and generalized our findings in 9 additional studies (stage 2, n = 10,538). We conducted a trans-ancestral GWAS with summary statistics from HISLA stage 1 and existing consortia of European and African ancestries. In our HISLA stage 1 + 2 analyses, we discovered one BMI locus, as well as two BMI signals and another height signal within established anthropometric loci.

In our trans-ancestral meta-analysis, we discovered three BMI loci, one height locus, and one WHRadjBMI locus. We also identified 3 secondary signals for BMI, 28 for height, and 2 for WHRadjBMI in established loci. Our analysis demonstrated that 336 known BMI, 1,177 known height, and 143 known WHRadjBMI (combined) SNPs showed suggestive transferability (nominal significance and effect estimate directional consistency) in Hispanic/Latino adults. Of these, 36 BMI, 124 height, and 11 WHRadjBMI SNPs were significant after trait-specific Bonferroni correction.

### Comparison of waist to height ratio and body indices for prediction of metabolic disturbances in the Korean population: The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2011 [^114jT1n2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome is a pathologic condition characterized by elevated waist circumference (WC), elevated triglyceride level, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose level. Metabolic syndrome is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease is a common health problem in patients with this condition; as a result, metabolic syndrome is associated with a risk of death and complications caused by cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Early detection and proper management of metabolic syndrome are important for the prevention of cardiometabolic problems.

Metabolic syndrome is closely related to obesity. Body mass index (BMI) and WC are well-known indices of general and abdominal obesity, respectively, and WC is a component of metabolic syndrome. However, various studies have reported that the waist to height ratio (WHtR), which considers ethnicity and height, is more closely associated with insulin resistance and clinical outcomes in both adults and children.

Classic body indices such as BMI, WC, and WHtR have been used to assess metabolic problems and have several advantages as simple rapid screening tools. However, they do not provide the distribution between skeletal muscle mass and fat. Body composition analyzers such as multi-frequency bioimpedance analysis and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can differentiate between muscle mass and fat and the distribution between limb and trunk.

Recent studies using body composition analyzers have reported that fat mass…

### Predictability of genetic risk score for insulin resistance is influenced by both BMI and race [^112S4YWM]. Obesity (2025). High credibility.

- **Objective**: The study aimed to determine whether associations between a genetic risk score (GRS) for insulin resistance (IR) and measures of insulin sensitivity differ by race and/or BMI status in African American (AA) and European American (EA) adults without diabetes.

- **Methods**: Fifty-three AA and 54 EA participants were classified into "high" or "low" BMI groups using the sample median (25.9 kg/m²) as the cut point. The GRS was derived from 52 previously identified genetic variants. Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity was measured with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the Matsuda index of insulin sensitivity were calculated from oral glucose tolerance test values to determine hepatic and whole-body insulin sensitivity, respectively. Linear regression models, stratified by race, assessed interactions between BMI status and GRS on measures of insulin sensitivity.

- **Results**: In EA participants, associations of GRS with HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index differed by BMI status, where the GRS was associated with IR in the high-BMI group only. In AA participants, associations from the clamp differed by BMI status, but an association was observed only in the low-BMI group.

- **Conclusions**: These results highlight the heterogeneity of IR and support the hypothesis that the relationship between genetic predisposition for IR and obesity is race- and tissue-specific.

### Exploring biomarkers in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1125tJhe]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Ethnicity and socioeconomic background are crucial in understanding the complex interplay between biomarkers and metabolic conditions like metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Studying biomarkers across diverse ethnicities helps uncover genetic and environmental factors contributing to disease heterogeneity. Ethnicity may affect treatment responses, emphasizing the importance of investigating ethnicity-specific biomarkers for tailored interventions. Biomarker levels vary across ethnic groups due to genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Socioeconomic disparities significantly impact lifestyle choices and healthcare access, influencing disease progression and management. Cultural practices also contribute to varied biomarker associations. Addressing healthcare disparities rooted in ethnicity and socioeconomic status is crucial for improving outcomes and addressing health inequities.

Genetic factors add another layer of complexity to the pathophysiological interplay. Shared genetic predispositions and risk factors, such as variants in genes related to insulin signaling and lipid metabolism, contribute to the co-occurrence of T2D and MASLD. Biomarkers derived from genetic studies offer insights into individual and disease susceptibility.

Lifestyle factors, such as diet, physical activity, and exposure to environmental toxins, contribute significantly to T2D and MASLD. Biomarkers reflecting lifestyle-related influences aid in understanding their impact on disease progression.

Biomarkers provide insights into shared mechanisms, including inflammation, lipid dysregulation, and hepatocellular injury.

### Race/ethnicity-associated blood DNA methylation differences between Japanese and European American women: An exploratory study [^112aYvyz]. Clinical Epigenetics (2021). Low credibility.

Racial and ethnic disparities in health are phenotype-specific. While Asian Americans have the longest life expectancy among racial and ethnic populations in the United States, based on lower mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer, they are known to have a higher susceptibility to obesity-related metabolic diseases. In the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), based on five racial and ethnic populations in Hawaii and Southern California, we have observed that Asian Americans tend to develop metabolic syndrome and related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, starting at a lower level of body mass index (BMI) compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, in a magnetic resonance imaging study of a subset of the MEC, Asian Americans have been observed to accumulate disproportionately higher amounts of visceral and liver fat across a wide range of BMI or total body fat mass. Consistently, we and others have reported the highest BMI- or total fat mass-adjusted prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NAFLD-associated hepatocellular carcinoma among Asian Americans.

Some of these disparities have been attributed to genetic differences, such as the PNPLA3 risk variant for NAFLD (rs738409), which is more common in Asians and Latinos. Still, underlying biological mechanisms on racial and ethnic disparities in health are poorly understood. Epigenetics may be key to elucidating the mechanisms underlying these racial and ethnic differences in health and disease. DNA methylation is an epigenetic regulator not determined by the DNA sequence.
