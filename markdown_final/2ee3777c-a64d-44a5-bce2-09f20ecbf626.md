## Question

hereditary spherocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to establish clinical suspicion across ages. Then, I should review initial laboratory screening and the differential for spherocytes. Next, I will confirm diagnosis with specific tests, including EMA binding and genetic analysis. After that, I need to assess disease severity and complications to guide management. Finally, I should weigh treatment options including splenectomy strategies, address special populations like neonates, and lay out long-term monitoring and a succinct clinical algorithm [^116gFRHJ] [^112qF6b8].

> Let me first confirm the typical clinical patterns that should trigger suspicion for hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Classic features include hemolytic anemia with reticulocytosis, jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia, and splenomegaly, but I need to remember that severity varies widely from asymptomatic to transfusion-dependent even within families, and in neonates spherocytes and splenomegaly can be minimal or absent, which complicates recognition, so I should keep a high index of suspicion in Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice, especially with a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance in roughly 70–75% of cases, while allowing for de novo or recessive presentations in about 25% of patients [^111JJubt] [^116xoD1m] [^116kANqA] [^111aYFFi] [^111nEBKY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions just because I see spherocytes on a smear; I should double-check the differential because spherocytes also appear in warm or cold autoimmune hemolysis and other hemolytic states, so a direct antiglobulin test is critical to exclude AIHA before labeling this HS. In initial screening, I will examine the smear for spherocytes, review CBC indices noting that MCHC may be increased and RDW often elevated as disease severity rises, and confirm a reticulocytosis indicating marrow compensation; I'll consider osmotic fragility as supportive but recognize its limitations and variability across labs. In neonates, I need to be careful: the HS index (MCHC/MCV) has only modest discrimination in diverse populations, so I should not over-rely on a single cutoff if the pretest probability is high [^116gFRHJ] [^112qF6b8] [^112G94wE] [^114k8hSu] [^116BfFPt].

> Wait, let me verify the best confirmatory pathway. The eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test by flow cytometry is a highly validated, first-line confirmatory assay in suspected HS and performs well even in neonates; if EMA is equivocal or the phenotype is atypical, next-generation sequencing can define the molecular defect for counseling, clarify atypical cases, and detect de novo or compound heterozygous variants, most commonly involving ANK1 and SPTB across cohorts. Protein quantification by SDS-PAGE can help in rare or complex situations, for example suspected recessive alpha-spectrin deficiency when indices are atypical [^113vRLZK] [^1177JgHr] [^116Rx6VU] [^1136vrmH] [^116xoD1m] [^113EovH6].

> I need to ensure I correctly grade clinical severity because that will steer management. Functional red-cell markers outperform genotype alone; patients with moderate to severe HS show shorter RBC lifespan with lower density, greater heterogeneity, and reduced deformability on ektacytometry, whereas mild HS often shows denser RBC due to longer survival and progressive membrane loss before splenic clearance. I should also proactively look for complications: hemolysis-related pigment gallstones are notably more frequent in HS than the general population, co-inherited Gilbert syndrome increases cholelithiasis risk and bilirubin levels, and I must keep aplastic crisis in mind during parvovirus outbreaks [^112qF6b8] [^111otvD1] [^117DX77Y] [^1118suHq].

> Let me think about the overarching treatment philosophy before committing to surgery. Supportive care includes folate supplementation to match erythropoietic demand, close surveillance for hemolytic or aplastic crises, and evaluation for biliary disease when symptomatic. Splenectomy improves anemia and hemolysis by reducing splenic destruction, with hemoglobin typically increasing and reticulocytes and bilirubin decreasing; however, I should confirm the risk-benefit calculus because total splenectomy carries lifelong infection risks beyond encapsulated organisms and increased late vascular events, so indications should be individualized to severe anemia, symptomatic splenomegaly, growth failure from hyperactive erythropoiesis, or recurrent/symptomatic gallstones [^113vRLZK] [^113eVuce] [^113Z7esG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost defaulted to total splenectomy; I should reconsider partial splenectomy in selected children to balance hemolysis control and splenic immune preservation. Partial splenectomy typically removes 85–90% of splenic tissue, yields sustained improvements in hemoglobin, reticulocytes, and bilirubin, lowers infection risk relative to total splenectomy, but usually leaves mild hemolysis and a residual risk of gallstones; a small proportion require completion splenectomy if symptoms recur. Longitudinal pediatric data suggest these gains persist for years, supporting partial splenectomy as a reasonable option when immune preservation is a priority [^1118suHq] [^1139Qu5r] [^116aNBfM].

> I should double-check contemporary practice patterns to ensure my recommendations align with trends in risk mitigation. National pediatric data show splenectomy rates have declined over two decades with delays to older ages, and clinical drivers for proceeding include concurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis and significant splenomegaly or hypersplenism; this trend underscores more conservative, individualized decision-making rather than routine early splenectomy [^111iJvSB].

> Next, I should review neonatal-specific considerations because early recognition prevents bilirubin neurotoxicity. In neonates with Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice and suggestive family history, EMA testing is feasible and helpful, while the HS index provides only modest discrimination and should not exclude HS if clinical signs persist. Management focuses on standard hyperbilirubinemia pathways, including phototherapy and exchange as indicated, with early genetic confirmation supporting counseling and anticipatory guidance; I should remember that spherocytes and splenomegaly may be subtle initially, so serial assessment matters [^1177JgHr] [^116BfFPt] [^111nEBKY] [^116kANqA].

> But wait, what if modifying genes are present and confound the phenotype? I should actively consider co-inheritance that alters indices or risk profile: G6PD deficiency can increase transfusion needs, Gilbert syndrome variants amplify bilirubin and gallstone rates, and beta-thalassemia trait lowers MCV and MCHC, potentially masking the classic HS indices; in such settings, genetic testing and a comprehensive lab review prevent misclassification and refine counseling about complications [^117DX77Y] [^113djNS5].

> I will now examine perioperative and special procedural settings to avoid unnecessary splenic surgery. For major surgeries such as cardiac procedures, with careful pump and hemolysis mitigation strategies, uneventful courses are reported without preoperative splenectomy, supporting individualized planning rather than reflexive splenic removal solely for anticipated hemolysis risk [^111MV9A5].

> I need to ensure a robust long-term plan, especially post-splenectomy. Vaccination against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Hib, along with consideration of antibiotic prophylaxis in young children, forms the cornerstone of infection prevention; vigilant monitoring for thrombocytosis, thrombotic events, and pulmonary hypertension is prudent after total splenectomy, while ongoing surveillance for biliary symptoms remains important even after partial splenectomy due to persistent low-grade hemolysis [^113vRLZK] [^113Z7esG] [^1118suHq].

> Let me summarize a practical, stepwise algorithm while double-checking each step against the evidence. Suspect HS in hemolytic anemia with spherocytes and negative DAT, then build support with smear, CBC indices, and reticulocytes; confirm with EMA as first-line and add targeted genetic testing when atypical or for counseling; assess severity using functional RBC markers and clinical complications rather than genotype alone; manage conservatively when mild and tailor splenectomy decisions to severity and complications, considering partial splenectomy in children to preserve immune function; and implement lifelong risk reduction and monitoring tailored to splenectomy status and co-inherited modifiers [^116gFRHJ] [^112qF6b8] [^113vRLZK] [^113eVuce] [^111otvD1] [^117DX77Y].

Congenital spherocytosis, or hereditary spherocytosis (HS), is a **genetic disorder** of red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins that produces spherical, fragile RBCs and chronic hemolytic anemia [^111JJubt]. The most common mutations affect ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EPB42, and SPTA1 [^116xoD1m] [^116Rx6VU], with **autosomal dominant** inheritance in about 75% of cases [^113vRLZK] and autosomal recessive or de novo mutations in the remainder. Clinical features include **anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and an increased risk of gallstones**, with severity ranging from mild to severe [^111JJubt] [^111otvD1].

Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, family history, a peripheral smear showing **spherocytes** [^116gFRHJ], and confirmatory testing such as osmotic fragility or EMA binding [^113vRLZK] [^1177JgHr]. Management includes **supportive care, folic acid supplementation, and splenectomy for severe cases** [^111JJubt] [^113eVuce], with **partial splenectomy** as an alternative to reduce infection risk [^1118suHq]. Prognosis is generally good with appropriate management [^116aNBfM], though complications such as gallstones [^111otvD1], aplastic crises [^1125RLan], and increased infection risk may occur [^113Z7esG].

## Genetic mutations and inheritance patterns

HS is caused by mutations in genes encoding **RBC membrane proteins**, including:

- **ANK1 (ankyrin-1)**: Most common mutation, accounting for approximately 50% of cases [^116xoD1m] [^116Rx6VU].

- **SPTB (spectrin beta)**: Accounts for about 20% of cases [^116xoD1m] [^116Rx6VU].

- **SLC4A1 (band 3 protein)**: Accounts for approximately 15% of cases [^116xoD1m] [^117DX77Y].

- **EPB42 (protein 4.2)**: Accounts for about 10% of cases [^116xoD1m] [^111JJubt].

- **SPTA1 (spectrin alpha)**: Accounts for about 5% of cases [^111aYFFi] [^111JJubt].

Inheritance is predominantly **autosomal dominant** (approximately 75% of cases), with autosomal recessive or de novo mutations accounting for the remaining cases [^111aYFFi] [^113vRLZK].

---

## Pathophysiology

Genetic mutations in HS cause defects in RBC membrane proteins [^111v7wtC]. These defects lead to **membrane instability** with loss of membrane surface area and reduced deformability [^112qF6b8], spherocyte formation with increased osmotic fragility [^111JJubt], and hemolysis from premature splenic destruction, leading to chronic hemolytic anemia [^1135x9Ax].

---

## Clinical manifestations

HS presents with a wide range of clinical severity, from **asymptomatic to severe** anemia requiring regular transfusions. Common clinical features include:

- **Anemia**: Chronic hemolytic anemia of varying severity [^111JJubt].

- **Jaundice**: Due to increased bilirubin from hemolysis [^111nEBKY].

- **Splenomegaly**: Enlarged spleen due to increased RBC destruction [^114vKEuP].

- **Gallstones**: Increased risk of pigment gallstones due to chronic hemolysis [^111otvD1].

- **Aplastic crises**: Often triggered by parvovirus B19 infection [^1125RLan].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of HS involves a combination of **clinical evaluation**, laboratory tests, and genetic analysis:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Family history, physical examination, and clinical symptoms [^111JJubt].

- **Laboratory tests**: Peripheral blood smear showing spherocytes, increased osmotic fragility [^113vRLZK], elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) [^116BfFPt], and reticulocytosis [^111JJubt].

- **Genetic analysis**: Identification of mutations in ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EPB42, or SPTA1 genes [^111aYFFi] [^116Rx6VU].

---

## Management and treatment strategies

Management of HS depends on disease severity. Supportive care includes folic acid supplementation, regular monitoring, and transfusions as needed [^111JJubt] [^116gFRHJ]. Splenectomy is recommended for **severe cases** to reduce hemolysis and anemia; **partial splenectomy** is an alternative to reduce infection risk [^113eVuce] [^1139Qu5r]. Vaccinations are essential to prevent infections, especially after splenectomy [^113vRLZK].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis for patients with HS is **generally good** with appropriate management [^116aNBfM]. Complications include an increased risk of gallstones due to chronic hemolysis [^111otvD1], aplastic crises often triggered by infections [^1125RLan], and a heightened infection risk, especially after splenectomy [^113Z7esG].

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

Recent research has focused on genetic analysis to identify novel mutations and define **genotype-phenotype correlations** [^116Rx6VU] [^117DX77Y]. Additional work evaluates partial splenectomy as an alternative to total splenectomy to reduce infection risk [^116aNBfM] and explores targeted therapies aimed at specific genetic mutations.

---

Overall, congenital spherocytosis is a **genetic RBC membrane disorder** that leads to chronic hemolytic anemia. Management includes supportive care, splenectomy when indicated, and vaccinations, with a **generally good prognosis**.

Guidelines on hereditary spherocytosis (HS) published in 2004 (Bolton-Maggs et al, 2004) are here replaced to reflect changes in opinion on the surgical management, particularly the indications for concomitant splenectomy with cholecystectomy in children with mild HS, and concomitant cholecystectomy with splenectomy in those with asymptomatic gallstones. Further potential long-term hazards of splenectomy are now recognized.

Advances have been made in our understanding of the biochemistry of the red cell membrane, which underpins the choice of tests. Biochemical assays of membrane proteins and genetic analysis may be indicated (rarely) to diagnose atypical cases. The diagnostic value of the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test has been validated in a number of studies with an understanding of its limitations.

### Identification of a novel heterozygous SPTB mutation by whole genome sequencing in a Chinese patient with hereditary spherocytosis and atrial septal defect: a case report [^116xoD1m]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorder characterized by an abnormal increase of spherocytes in peripheral blood. HS occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, and its prevalence in China is about 1.27–1.49 per 100,000 individuals. The clinical spectrum of HS ranges broadly from a nearly asymptomatic disease to life-threatening anemia, serious splenomegaly, and/or severe hyperbilirubinemia, even within the same family. About 70% of HS cases are associated with autosomal dominant inheritance, although non-dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance have also been described.

HS is mostly characterized by sphere-shaped erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear, resulting from qualitative and/or quantitative abnormalities of RBC membrane proteins. These abnormalities are basically caused by mutations in the corresponding genes. Evidence indicates that mutations in ankyrin 1 (ANK1; about 50%), spectrin-β, erythrocytic (SPTB; approximately 20%), solute carrier family 4, member 1 (SLC4A1; about 15%), erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2 (EPB42; 10%), and spectrin-ɑ, erythrocytic 1 (SPTA1; 5%) are associated with membrane defects in HS.

Although SPTB mutations mostly cause HS, only a few HS families with such mutations have been reported in the Chinese population. Here, we identified a novel SPTB frameshift mutation responsible for HS in a Chinese family by whole genome sequencing (WGS).

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^112qF6b8]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) originates from defective anchoring of the cytoskeletal network to the transmembrane protein complexes of the red blood cell (RBC). Red cells in HS are characterized by membrane instability and reduced deformability, and there is marked heterogeneity in disease severity among patients. To unravel this variability in disease severity, we analyzed blood samples from 21 HS patients with defects in ankyrin, band 3, α-spectrin, or β-spectrin using red cell indices, eosin-5-maleimide binding, microscopy, the osmotic fragility test, Percoll density gradients, vesiculation, and ektacytometry to assess cell membrane stability, cellular density, and deformability.

Reticulocyte counts, CD71 abundance, band 4.1 a:b ratio, and glycated hemoglobin were used as markers of RBC turnover. We observed that patients with moderate/severe spherocytosis have short-living erythrocytes of low density and abnormally high intercellular heterogeneity. These cells show a prominent decrease in membrane stability and deformability and, as a consequence, are quickly removed from the circulation by the spleen. In contrast, in mild spherocytosis, less pronounced reduction in deformability results in prolonged RBC lifespan, and hence, cells are subject to progressive loss of membrane. RBC from patients with mild spherocytosis thus become denser before they are taken up by the spleen.

Based on our findings, we conclude that RBC membrane loss, cellular heterogeneity, and density are strong markers of clinical severity in spherocytosis.

### Pediatric red cell disorders and pure red cell aplasia [^1125RLan]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia in children may arise from a wide variety of pathogenetic mechanisms that include congenital and acquired disorders. Often, the diagnostic considerations include disorders that are not commonly seen in adults and lifelong disorders that arise in children and persist throughout life. Consideration of diverse causes of anemia such as red cell membrane disorders, red cell enzymopathies, congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, congenital sideroblastic anemias, and hereditary pure red cell aplasia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia), as well as infectious causes such as parvovirus B19 infection, is often required when diagnosing anemia in an infant or young child. Knowledge of these entities, which are important causes of anemia in the pediatric population, including clinical manifestations and laboratory workup, will aid in the recognition of the specific disease entities and effective workup of pediatric red cell disorders.

### Long-term evaluation of the beneficial effect of subtotal splenectomy for management of hereditary spherocytosis [^1118suHq]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) can be mitigated by splenectomy. However, concerns persist regarding the lifelong risk of overwhelming infections and, to a lesser extent, vascular complications after total splenectomy. In search of alternative treatments, we previously assessed the potential usefulness of subtotal splenectomy in a small patient population. During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, subtotal splenectomy effectively decreased the hemolytic rate while maintaining spleen phagocytic function.

In this study, we evaluated the clinical and biological features of 40 HS patients who underwent subtotal splenectomy and were monitored for 1 to 14 years. The beneficial effects included a sustained decrease in hemolytic rate and maintained phagocytic function of the splenic remnant. However, mild-to-moderate hemolysis persisted, leading to secondary gallstone formation and aplastic crisis in a small subset of patients. Interestingly, regrowth of the remnant spleen did not significantly impact the beneficial outcomes for these individuals.

Our results suggest that subtotal splenectomy is a reasonable treatment option for managing HS patients, especially young children.

Spherocytes can arise from various conditions, including cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, burn injury, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and snake bite.

### Splenectomy improves erythrocyte functionality in spherocytosis based on septin abundance, but not maturation defects [^113eVuce]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Besides transfusion and erythropoietin treatment, splenectomy represents a therapeutic intervention for hereditary spherocytosis. It might be the only intervention granting long-term relief from symptoms, allowing for the reduction of RBC destruction and preservation of less deformable but still functional RBCs. Thus, after splenectomy, the Hb concentration almost always increases, reticulocytes decrease, bilirubin levels return to normal, and RBCs exhibit a relatively normal lifespan. This favorable response led to the recommendation of splenectomy even for patients with spherocytosis with moderate degrees of hemolysis based on quality of life and spleen size.

Nevertheless, it is largely unknown whether and to what extent splenectomy is able to improve RBC morphology and functionality as well as the RBC maturation process. Enucleation represents the final step of the RBC maturation process, resulting in the formation of a reticulocyte and the release of a pyrenocyte. The reticulocyte is then released from the bone marrow and undergoes its terminal differentiation in the circulating blood. Enucleation is a complex process involving multiple steps, including:

- **Cell polarization**: Achieved through microtubules.
- **Formation of a contractile actomyosin ring**: Similar to cytokinesis but in an asymmetric manner.
- **Vesicle trafficking**: Creates an asymmetric protein distribution.

Protein sorting might involve the RBC cytoskeleton proteins, as revealed by the aberrant protein sorting in mice lacking ANK or 4.1R proteins. Nevertheless, cytoskeletal proteins involved in cytokinesis remain a subject of study.

### Understanding the genetic architecture and phenotypic landscape of SPTB gene variants causing hereditary spherocytosis in an Indian cohort [^116Rx6VU]. Human Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common form of haemolytic anaemia caused by defects or deficiencies in genes encoding erythrocyte membrane proteins, such as ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EPB42, and SPTA1. Among these, ANK1 and SPTB mutations are the most frequent causes of HS worldwide. This study analysed 53 Indian HS patients, identifying 33 novel and 12 previously reported SPTB variants using targeted next-generation sequencing (t-NGS). The identified SPTB variants included frameshift (28%), missense (24%), nonsense (44%), and splicing (4%) types, with nonsense variants being the most common. These nonsense variants typically result in truncated proteins.

The variants were widely distributed across the gene, with the highest density observed in the spectrin repeats and ankyrin-binding domain, while no variants were found in the tetramerization domain. All identified SPTB variants exhibited heterozygous inheritance, consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the gene causing HS. One patient, however, carried compound heterozygous variants, leading to severe anaemia, and five patients had de novo SPTB variants.

This study expands the spectrum of SPTB variants, enhances the understanding of spectrin-related molecular defects, establishes genotype-phenotype correlations, and provides valuable insights for laboratories developing genetic tests for HS. The high number of identified variants highlights the importance of advanced technologies like NGS for accurate molecular diagnosis in HS disorder. This approach not only supports clinical diagnostics but also aids in…

### Long-term hematologic and clinical outcomes of splenectomy in children with hereditary spherocytosis and sickle cell disease [^116aNBfM]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Total splenectomy (TS) and partial splenectomy (PS) are used for children with congenital hemolytic anemia (CHA), although the long-term outcomes of these procedures are poorly defined. This report describes long-term outcomes of children with CHA requiring TS or PS.

- **Procedure**: We collected data from children ages 2–17 with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) or sickle cell disease (SCD) requiring TS or PS from 1996 to 2016 from 14 sites in the Splenectomy in Congenital Hemolytic Anemia (SICHA) consortium using a prospective, observational patient registry. We summarized hematologic outcomes, clinical outcomes, and adverse events to 5 years after surgery. Hematologic outcomes were compared using mixed effects modeling.

- **Results**: Over the study period, 110 children with HS and 97 children with SCD underwent TS or PS. From preoperatively compared to postoperatively, children with HS increased their mean hemoglobin level by 3.4 g/dL, decreased their mean reticulocyte percentage by 6.7%, and decreased their mean bilirubin by 2.4 mg/dL. Hematologic improvements and improved clinical outcomes were sustained over 5 years of follow-up. For children with SCD, there was no change in hemoglobin after PS or TS following surgery, although all clinical outcomes were improved. Over 5 years, there was one child with HS and 5 children with SCD who developed post-splenectomy sepsis.

- **Conclusions**: For children with HS, there are excellent long-term hematologic and clinical outcomes following either PS or TS. Although hemoglobin levels do not change after TS or PS in SCD, the long-term clinical outcomes are improved.

### 10-year risk of gallstones in congenital red blood cell disorder patients: A nationwide cohort study [^111otvD1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic hemolysis potentially elevates the risk of gallstones in several types of congenital red blood cell (RBC) disorders. However, the magnitude of the risk is unknown. We investigate the risk of gallstone disease in congenital RBC disorder patients, compared with general population comparators. Patients were identified from the Danish National Patient Registry covering all Danish hospitals and the National Reference Laboratory for RBC disorders during 1980–2016. Patients were matched by sex, age, and region of origin with up to 50 general population comparators. Gallstone events were identified using hospital-registered diagnoses and surgery codes.

Our study included 9,354 congenital RBC disorder patients, grouped according to type of congenital RBC disorder, and 416,994 general population comparators. The cumulative 10-year incidence of gallstone disease was 4.2% in patients with congenital RBC disorders and 1.7% among comparators. Adjusted csHRs [95% confidence interval] were 8.1 [6.8, 9.7] for hereditary spherocytosis; 3.3 [1.6, 6.8] for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; 21.6 [10.6, 44.1] for pyruvate kinase deficiency; 3.7 [1.9, 7.0] for sickle cell disease; 0.8 [0.4, 1.6] for sickle cell trait; 1.5 [1.1, 2.2] for α-thalassemia trait; 1.8 [1.4, 2.3] for β-thalassemia minor; and 2.1 [1.8, 2.6] for other congenital hemolysis.

We found a markedly higher risk of hospital-registered gallstone diseases in nearly all groups of patients with congenital RBC disorders compared with the general population.

### Risks and benefits of splenectomy versus no splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis — a personal view [^113Z7esG]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Splenectomy is indicated in hereditary spherocytosis to relieve symptoms due to anaemia or splenomegaly, reverse growth failure or skeletal changes due to over-robust erythropoiesis, and prevent gallstones. A life-long risk of bacterial infection has been recognized for many years as a concomitant cost of splenectomy. The scope of this risk has expanded to include a number of organisms beyond the triad of pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that splenectomy also confers a significant risk of delayed adverse vascular events in patients with hereditary spherocytosis, just as it does in patients undergoing splenectomy for other indications. Further, these same studies demonstrated a benefit of avoiding splenectomy: hereditary spherocytosis patients with a spleen have significantly fewer adverse vascular events than unaffected family members, probably because of the protective effect of chronic, mild anaemia.

Accordingly, this review marshals the evidence favoring a conservative approach to splenectomy in spherocytosis.

### Splenomegaly: A combined clinical and radiologic approach to the differential diagnosis [^114vKEuP]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). High credibility.

Splenomegaly can arise from various conditions, including schistosomiasis, DRESS syndrome, and cryoglobulinemia. It may also be caused by hereditary spherocytosis, leukemia, and lymphoma. Other associated conditions include Felty's syndrome, infective endocarditis, and beta thalassemia. Viral infections such as hepatitis, syphilis, adult-onset Still's disease, hairy cell leukemia, and Hodgkin's lymphoma are also potential causes.

Systemic diseases like mastocytosis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and multiple myeloma can lead to splenomegaly. This condition may result from infections, including malaria, splenic sequestration crisis, infectious mononucleosis, dengue virus infection, and typhus fever. Bartonella quintana infection, relapsing fever, psittacosis, and brucellosis are further infectious causes.

Other factors include bartonellosis, visceral leishmaniasis, babesiosis, toxocariasis, and paragonimiasis. Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, and serum sickness are linked to splenomegaly. It can occur in Gaucher disease, extramedullary hemopoiesis, and common variable hypogammaglobulinemia.

Visceral larva migrans, myelofibrosis, Castleman disease, and myeloproliferative disorders are additional etiological factors. Whipple's disease, cat scratch disease, and hereditary neutrophilia should also be considered. Portal hypertension, amyloidosis, Niemann-Pick disease, and primary myelofibrosis are more conditions that can cause splenomegaly. Further, chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, and primary biliary cholangitis may lead to this condition.

Additional causes include congestive heart failure, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, histoplasmosis, and cystic fibrosis. Sickle cell disease, typhoid fever, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia are linked as well. Chronic granulomatous disease, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic liver disease, and glycogen storage disease are possible causes. Lastly, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, and hepatic vein thrombosis can lead to splenomegaly.

### Use of complete blood cell count components to screen for hereditary spherocytosis in neonates [^116BfFPt]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The neonatal hereditary spherocytosis (HS) index, defined as the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration divided by the mean corpuscular volume, has been proposed as a screening tool for HS in neonates. In a population of mostly white infants, an HS index > 0.36 was 97% sensitive and > 99% specific. We evaluated the utility of the HS index among a more racially and ethnically diverse population and determined if its discrimination varies with total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels.

- **Methods**: Infants born at ≥ 35 weeks' gestation at 15 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals from 1995 to 2015 were eligible (N = 670,272). Erythrocyte indices from the first complete blood count drawn at ≤ 7 days and TSB levels drawn at ≤ 30 days were obtained. Diagnoses of HS were confirmed via chart review.

- **Results**: HS was confirmed in 79 infants, 1.2 per 10,000. HS was more common among infants of white and "other" race or ethnicity and among those with higher peak TSB levels. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the HS index was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.78–0.90). Likelihood ratios ranged from 10.1 for an HS index ≥ 0.380 to 0.1 for an HS index < 0.310. Dichotomized at 0.36, the HS index was 56% sensitive and 93% specific. Discrimination of the HS index appeared best among infants with TSB levels < 10 mg/dL.

- **Conclusions**: The HS index, when obtained from a CBC drawn within the first week after birth, had only modest ability to alter the probability of HS.

### Evaluating eosin-5-maleimide binding as a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis in newborn infants [^1177JgHr]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Neonates with undiagnosed hereditary spherocytosis (HS) are at risk for developing hazardous hyperbilirubinemia and anemia. Making an early diagnosis of HS in a neonate can prompt anticipatory guidance to prevent these adverse outcomes. A recent comparison study showed that a relatively new diagnostic test for HS, eosin-5-maleimide (EMA)-flow cytometry, performs better than other available tests in confirming HS. However, reports have not specifically examined the performance of this test among neonates.

- **Study design**: We compared EMA-flow cytometry from blood samples of healthy control neonates versus samples from neonates suspected of having HS based on severe Coombs-negative jaundice and spherocytes on blood film. The diagnosis of HS was later either confirmed or excluded based on clinical findings and next-generation sequencing (NGS), after which we correlated the EMA-flow results with the diagnosis.

- **Result**: EMA-flow was performed on the blood of 31 neonates: 20 healthy term newborns and 11 who were suspected of having HS. Eight of the 11 were later confirmed positive for HS, and one was confirmed positive for hereditary elliptocytosis (HE). All nine had persistently abnormal erythroid morphology, reticulocytosis, and anemia, and eight of the nine had relevant mutations discovered using NGS. The other was confirmed positive for HS on the basis that a parent had HS, and the neonate's spherocytosis, reticulocytosis, and anemia persisted. The 20 healthy controls and the 2 in whom HS was initially suspected but later excluded all had EMA-flow results in the range.

### Splenectomy improves erythrocyte functionality in spherocytosis based on septin abundance, but not maturation defects [^1135x9Ax]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

The cytoskeleton is one of the main red blood cell (RBC) constituents involved in deformability and functionality. It is composed of a meshwork of spectrin (SPT) tetramers linked to the lipid bilayer by two non-redundant anchorage complexes based on 4.1R and ankyrin (ANK1) proteins. The 4.1R anchorage complexes allow for SPT horizontal linkages, whereas the ANK1 anchorage complexes ensure most of the vertical linkages between the SPT meshwork and the lipid bilayer. Upon RBC deformation, a transient rise of intracellular calcium activates Gardos channels, leading to cell dehydration and favoring local uncoupling between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Besides a specific surface-to-volume ratio, a finely regulated cytoplasmic viscosity, controlled by the intracellular hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and the redox state, also contribute to the RBC deformation process.

During the RBC's normal lifespan of 120 days, the RBC membrane elasticity is strained approximately 12,000 times upon its passage from the splenic cords to the venous sinuses demarcated by a discontinuous endothelium. Defective or old RBCs have difficulty managing this passage and remain blocked in the cords, where they are phagocytosed. This is the case in hereditary spherocytosis, a disease characterized by a loss of RBC biconcavity in favor of spherocytes, stomatocytes, acanthocytes, and echinocytes, and by an impairment of RBC deformability. Spherocytosis is the most common cause of chronic hemolytic anemia because of a red cell membrane defect.

### A pediatrician's practical guide to diagnosing and treating hereditary spherocytosis in neonates [^111nEBKY]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Newborn infants who have hereditary spherocytosis (HS) can develop anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction is less likely in these neonates if the diagnosis of HS is recognized and appropriate treatment is provided. Among neonates listed in the United States Kernicterus Registry, HS was the third most common underlying hemolytic condition, after glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and ABO hemolytic disease. HS is the leading cause of direct antiglobulin test (direct Coombs) negative hemolytic anemia requiring erythrocyte transfusion in the first months of life.

We anticipate that as physicians become more familiar with diagnosing HS in the newborn period, fewer neonates with HS will develop hazardous hyperbilirubinemia or present to emergency departments with unanticipated symptomatic anemia. We predict that early suspicion, prompt diagnosis and treatment, and anticipatory guidance will prevent adverse outcomes in neonates with HS. The purpose of this article was to review the neonatal presentation of HS and to provide practical and up-to-date means of diagnosing and treating HS in neonates.

### Evidence for a protective role of the Gardos channel against hemolysis in murine spherocytosis [^113XHFp8]. Blood (2005). High credibility.

It has been shown that mice with a complete deficiency of all 4.1R protein isoforms (4.1-/-) exhibit moderate hemolytic anemia, with abnormal erythrocyte morphology (spherocytosis) and decreased membrane stability. Here, we characterized the Gardos channel function in vitro and in vivo in erythrocytes of 4.1-/- mice. Compared with wild-type, the Gardos channel of 4.1-/- erythrocytes showed an increase in Vmax (9.75 ± 1.06 vs. 6.08 ± 0.09 mM cell × minute; P < .04) and a decrease in Km (1.01 ± 0.06 vs. 1.47 ± 1.02 µM; P < .03), indicating an increased sensitivity to activation by intracellular calcium.

In vivo function of the Gardos channel was assessed by the oral administration of clotrimazole, a well-characterized Gardos channel blocker. Clotrimazole treatment resulted in worsening of anemia and hemolysis, with decreased red cell survival and increased numbers of circulating hyperchromic spherocytes and microspherocytes. Clotrimazole induced similar changes in 4.2-/- and band 3 ± mice, indicating that these effects of the Gardos channel are shared in different models of murine spherocytosis. Thus, potassium and water loss through the Gardos channel may play an important protective role in compensating for the reduced surface-membrane area of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) erythrocytes and reducing hemolysis in erythrocytes with cytoskeletal impairments.

### Partial splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis: a multi-institutional review [^1139Qu5r]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Partial splenectomy has emerged as a surgical option for selected children with hereditary spherocytosis, aiming to reduce anemia while preserving splenic function. This multi-institutional study is the largest series at the time of writing, examining outcomes data for partial splenectomy in patients with hereditary spherocytosis.

- **Methods**: Data were collected retrospectively from five North American pediatric hospitals. Sixty-two children underwent partial splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis between 1990 and 2008.

- **Results**: At one year following partial splenectomy, mean hemoglobin significantly increased by 3.0 ± 1.4 g/dL (n = 52), reticulocyte count decreased by 6.6% ± 6.6% (n = 41), and bilirubin level decreased by 1.3 ± 0.9 mg/dL (n = 25). Patients with poor or transient hematologic response were found to have significantly more splenic regeneration postoperatively compared with patients with a durable clinical response (maximal spleen dimension, 9.0 ± 3.4 vs 6.3 ± 2.2 cm). Clinically significant recurrence of anemia or abdominal pain led to completion splenectomy in 4.84% of patients. No patients developed postsplenectomy sepsis.

- **Conclusions**: Our multi-institutional review indicates that partial splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis leads to sustained and clinically significant improvement in hematologic profiles and clinical symptoms in most patients. Our data support partial splenectomy as an alternative for selected children with hereditary spherocytosis.

### Deciphering molecular heterogeneity of Indian families with hereditary spherocytosis using targeted next-generation sequencing: First South Asian study [^117DX77Y]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Low credibility.

Defects in various erythrocyte membrane proteins genes, such as ankyrin, band-3, β- and α-spectrin, and protein 4.2, can cause hereditary spherocytosis (HS). This molecular heterogeneity of HS, together with co-inherited genetic modifiers, results in marked phenotypic variability among patients. We studied the molecular spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations in 73 families with 113 patients with HS. Deleterious variants, including nonsense (42%), deletions (18%), splice site (20%), missense (10%), and duplication/insertion (10%), were found in 47 patients. The variants detected included sporadic and dominantly inherited defects in ANK1 (53.2%), SPTB (36.2%), and SLC4A1 (4.2%).

Compound heterozygous variants in SPTA1 (6.4%) showed autosomal recessive inheritance. Alpha-spectrin variants were associated with severe anaemia, and splenectomy alleviated symptoms. Co-inherited glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was found in 15% of cases. G6PD variants (n = 5) led to greater transfusion requirements (1–8 times) in males with HS. Homozygosity (41%) for the promoter variant of UGT1A1 (Gilbert syndrome) led to a significantly higher mean bilirubin level (126.54 µmol/l) with a higher frequency of cholelithiasis (30%) (P < 0.001).

This first-ever South Asian study on the molecular spectrum of HS found ANK1 and SPTB genes variants to be the most common, with inheritance being sporadic or dominant. Next-generation sequencing provided a relatively sensitive and rapid tool for molecular diagnosis, with a diagnostic yield of 64.4%.

### Amechanotoxin-4 (GsMTx4)-sensitive cation channel mediates increased cation permeability in human hereditary spherocytosis of multiple genetic etiologies [^111v7wtC]. Haematologica (2021). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia among people of Northern European descent. HS is caused by mutations in genes encoding the erythroid cytoskeleton proteins ankyrin-1 (ANK1), β-spectrin (SPTB), and α-spectrin (SPTA1), the major intrinsic erythroid membrane protein and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, SLC4A1/band 3, and rarely EPB42/protein 4.2. These mutations lead to destabilization and progressive loss of red cell membrane lipids and surface area, and in some cases, to destabilization of cytoskeletal-membrane attachment. The resulting red cells often exhibit normochromic or hyperchromic, mild-moderate microcytosis with increased incubated osmotic fragility and reduced deformability. Anemia and chronic hemolysis can be accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia and painful splenic enlargement. Splenectomy often provides symptomatic relief and attenuates anemia and hemolysis.

Increased erythroid cation permeability in HS was first reported by Harris and Prankerd (1953) and Bertles (1957), as subsequently cited by Zarkowsky et al. Later reports of increased red cell cation permeability appeared in the setting of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis and cryohydrocytosis in association with SLC4A1 mutations, in the setting of overhydrated stomatocytosis in association with mutations in RHAG, SLC2A1, and SLC4A1, and in the setting of familial pseudohyperkalemia associated with ABCB6 mutations. Spherocytic mouse red cells genetically lacking EBP41 or EBP42, or haploinsufficient for SLC4A1, exhibited enhanced Gardos channel activity and increased hemolysis.

### Hereditary spherocytosis [^111JJubt]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a common inherited disorder characterized by anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. It is reported worldwide and is the most common inherited anemia among individuals of Northern European ancestry. Clinical severity is variable, with most patients having a well-compensated hemolytic anemia. Some individuals are asymptomatic, whereas others experience severe hemolytic anemia requiring erythrocyte transfusion.

The primary lesion in hereditary spherocytosis involves loss of membrane surface area, leading to reduced deformability due to defects in the membrane proteins ankyrin, band 3, beta spectrin, alpha spectrin, or protein 4.2. Many isolated mutations have been identified in the genes encoding these membrane proteins, yet common hereditary spherocytosis-associated mutations have not been identified. Abnormal spherocytes are trapped and destroyed in the spleen, which is the main cause of hemolysis in this disorder.

Common complications include cholelithiasis, hemolytic episodes, and aplastic crises. Splenectomy is curative but should be undertaken only after careful assessment of the risks and benefits.

### De novo variations of ANK1 gene caused hereditary spherocytosis in two Chinese children by affecting pre-mRNA splicing [^111aYFFi]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS, MIM#612641) is a hereditary genetic disease caused by abnormalities in red blood cell membrane proteins, resulting in congenital haemolytic anaemia. HS is mainly characterized by anaemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. Additional features include increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility and spherical red blood cell (RBC) count in peripheral blood smears. The symptomatology and clinical outcomes of HS are highly variable. Patients with mild HS might exhibit no clinical manifestations related to anaemia due to the compensatory effect of the bone marrow, which causes more erythropoiesis than destruction. Meanwhile, patients with severe HS might experience hemolytic crisis or even death.

The major genetic mode of HS is autosomal dominant, accounting for approximately 75% of cases. Additionally, about one-fourth of HS patients have no family history of the disease, with inheritance patterns indicating that HS can be inherited as an autosomal recessive single-gene disorder or due to de novo mutations. At the time of writing, five genes associated with HS have been reported: ANK1, SLC4A1, SPTA1, SPTB, and EPB42, encoding ankyrin protein, band-3 protein, alpha-spectrin protein, beta-spectrin protein, and erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2, respectively. In summary, HS shows marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity, and the prevalence of HS patients exhibits a cosmopolitan distribution. Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of HS in Europe is approximately 1/2000–1/5000, whereas in China, the estimated incidence is.

### Splenectomy improves erythrocyte functionality in spherocytosis based on septin abundance, but not maturation defects [^113T5kJn]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Septins as potential new key players in spherocytosis:

As expected, splenectomy was not able to restore ANK1 and SPTB deficiencies. More surprisingly, these protein deficiencies were not accompanied by significant alterations in membrane SPT occupation or distribution. This observation might partially rely on the fact that SPT immunolabeling was performed with an antibody directed against both SPTB and SPTA, potentially hiding alterations resulting from SPTB deficiency, combined with the calculation of the mean SPT occupation for the whole cohorts regardless of the mutation.

The idea of assessing the molecular defect to determine clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis is not new. We showed here that ANK1 levels were negatively correlated with the SPT variance and the RBC alteration score. It might seem a little surprising that such a correlation could be established for the whole patient cohort. However, molecular defects in SPTB are often accompanied by ANK1 deficiencies in hereditary spherocytosis. An even better correlation could be demonstrated between the RBC alteration and septin/ANK1 ratios. Except for the abundance of spherocytes, not all septins correlated with the same RBC parameters. Thus, septin-2 and -7 both correlated with cytoskeleton and functionality parameters, but only septin-2 correlated with EV release, and septin-11 correlated with spherocyte abundance. These differential implications might be related to the fact that, unlike septins-2 and -7, septins-8 and -11 are constitutively bound to GTP and do not have a polybasic domain.

### Laparoscopic subtotal splenectomy in hereditary spherocytosis: To preserve the upper or the lower pole of the spleen [^113mxhyQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations of hereditary spherocytosis can be controlled by splenectomy. However, the use of this procedure has been restricted due to concerns regarding exposure of patients to a lifelong risk of overwhelming infections. Subtotal splenectomy, which removes 85–90% of the enlarged spleen, is a logical alternative. In the initial laparoscopic cases, we chose to preserve the upper pole. This technique had some disadvantages, particularly concerning the correct intraoperative evaluation of the splenic remnant volume. Consequently, we developed a new variant of the procedure by preserving the lower pole of the spleen.

- **Methods**: Based on the authors' experience in laparoscopy (176 laparoscopic splenectomies), 10 laparoscopic subtotal splenectomies were performed in patients with hereditary microspherocytosis, preserving either the upper or the lower splenic pole.

- **Results**: Patient age ranged between 5 and 35 years. The mean volume of the remnant spleen was 41.4 cm³. There were no complications, and no transfusions were needed. Follow-up for 1–30 months was available.

- **Conclusions**: Subtotal splenectomy appears to control hemolysis while maintaining splenic function. The laparoscopic approach is safe and effective and should be considered the procedure of choice in hereditary microspherocytosis. Laparoscopic subtotal splenectomy presents an advantage over open subtotal splenectomy, resulting in decreased blood loss, shorter hospital stay, no conversions, fewer operative and postoperative complications, and excellent remission rates.

### Partial splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis [^111qNy9x]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The significant risks associated with total splenectomy have led to interest in the use of partial splenectomy as an alternative surgical therapy for children who have congenital hemolytic anemia. Partial splenectomy is designed to remove enough of the spleen to achieve desired hematologic outcomes while preserving splenic immune function. Although preliminary data demonstrate successful laboratory and clinical outcomes after partial splenectomy in various congenital hemolytic anemias, conclusive data comparing the efficacy of partial splenectomy to total splenectomy are not reported. Based on preliminary data, a definitive clinical trial of partial splenectomy in children who have severe congenital hemolytic anemia may be warranted.

### A neonate with Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice with spherocytes but normal erythrocyte indices: a rare case of autosomal-recessive hereditary spherocytosis due to alpha-spectrin deficiency [^113EovH6]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in a newborn infant is generally made based on a positive family history, the presence of spherocytes on a blood film, and Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice of variable severity with an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Typically, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) quantification of erythrocyte membrane proteins is not necessary to make the clinical diagnosis of HS. However, we observed a neonate with no family history of HS but with abundant spherocytosis on repeated blood films, Coombs-negative hemolytic jaundice, and normal MCHC and MCV measurements. SDS-PAGE revealed an alpha-spectrin deficiency, indicating a rare autosomal-recessive variety of HS that generally presents a severe clinical phenotype.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation associated to hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^116kANqA]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) results from defects in erythrocyte membrane proteins characterized by hemolysis, anemia, jaundice, gallstones, and splenomegaly. The severity depends on the rate of hemolysis and the degree of compensation of anemia by reticulocytosis. The clinical manifestations vary widely, ranging from nearly asymptomatic to transfusion-dependent or severe life-threatening anemia. In the neonatal period, the major clinical manifestations are jaundice and anemia. Splenomegaly and spherocytes are rarely observed, making it difficult to diagnose in neonates. Even during the first year of life, approximately 34% of affected infants are diagnosed.

Previous research has shown that mutations in ANK1 (ankyrin 1), SPTB (spectrin, beta, erythrocytic), SPTA1 (spectrin alpha, erythrocytic 1), SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4, member 1, or band 3), and EPB42 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2) are associated with HS. These gene mutations cause the normally double-concave disc-shaped red cells to become spherical, leading to fragile red cells. ANK1 is located on 8p11.21, and its mutations, including nonsense, splicing, or frameshift mutations, affect about half of patients with HS.

In most cases, HS is diagnosed based on a positive family history, increased osmotic fragility, hyperbilirubinemia, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly, and spherocytes on peripheral blood smears. The neonatal HS ratio, calculated by dividing the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), provides valuable information for physicians.

### Recurrent hemolysis-associated pseudoerysipelas of the lower legs in a patient with congenital spherocytosis [^111JkZP4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004).

A 29-year-old patient presented with erythematous eruptions on both lower legs of 15 years' duration. Family history, along with clinical and laboratory examinations, revealed congenital hereditary spherocytosis and excluded other reasons for the erythematous eruptions of the lower legs. During two subsequent episodes, we detected increased hemolysis that disappeared concomitantly with spontaneous resolution of the lesions. To our knowledge, this case is the first report showing an erythematous eruption on the lower legs in a patient with congenital hereditary spherocytosis. These eruptions might be caused by intermittent hemolysis-induced inflammation as a result of the increased osmotic fragility of the erythrocytes and may evolve to chronic leg ulcers later in life.

### Open-heart surgery using a centrifugal pump: A case of hereditary spherocytosis [^111MV9A5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic, frequently familial hemolytic blood disease characterized by varying degrees of hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. There are few reports on adult open-heart surgery for patients with hereditary spherocytosis.

- **Case presentation**: We report a rare case of an adult open-heart surgery associated with hereditary spherocytosis. A 63-year-old man was admitted for congestive heart failure due to a bicuspid aortic valve, aortic valve regurgitation, and sinus of subaortic aneurysm. The family history, the microscopic findings of the blood smear, and the characteristic osmotic fragility confirmed the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Furthermore, splenectomy had not been undertaken preoperatively. The patient underwent a successful operation by means of a centrifugal pump. Haptoglobin was used during the cardiopulmonary bypass, and a biological valve was selected to prevent hemolysis. No significant hemolysis occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively.

- **Conclusion**: There are no previous reports of patients with hereditary spherocytosis and bicuspid aortic valve. We have successfully performed an adult open-heart surgery using a centrifugal pump in an adult patient suffering from hereditary spherocytosis and a bicuspid aortic valve.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^111VZn8E]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

We repeated the mechanical measurements for the HS-derived EVs from the three patients. These EVs showed similar size (R₀ = 84 ± 5 nm, s.e.m. N = 3 patients), and they appear similarly rounded as the donor samples with H/Rc = 1.5 ± 0.1 nm (s.e.m. N = 3 patients). In about 50% of cases, a membrane tether could be detected with average forces in the same range as the donor samples (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, combining the stiffness, radius, and tether force measurements to estimate the bending modulus for each patient (Supplementary Fig. 6) revealed that the bending modulus of patient-derived EVs is 9 ± 1 kₐT (s.e.m. N = 3 patients) (Fig. 5d). This is approximately 40% lower than EVs derived from the three healthy donors, hence HS patient-derived EVs are significantly softened compared to healthy donor-derived EVs.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation in a childhood hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^115FeRGm]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia are atypical signs of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) in children. In this case, the child was clinically diagnosed with HS at the local hospital six years ago. However, due to the mild nature of the child's symptoms at that time, regular follow-up was not conducted. The child later presented with a sudden worsening of jaundice and severe abdominal pain, developing potentially life-threatening complications due to biliary obstruction caused by gallstones formed from long-term chronic hemolysis.

Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is the most common form of familial unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which can lead to hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced activity of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Patients with both HS and GS have been reported to have a four- to fivefold increased risk of gallstone disease compared with patients with only HS. Although there is no biological link between HS and GS, both disorders may co-occur in a significant number of patients. In this case, genetic testing revealed mutations in the ANK1 gene with no abnormalities in the UGT1A1 gene, suggesting a lack of genetic evidence for GS in this child. Although this case was not compounded with GS, genetic testing remains necessary to screen for other genetic disorders that may coexist in patients with HS, particularly in those with poor treatment efficacy or a prolonged chronic onset of jaundice.

### Abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane [^111yZ35c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Primary abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane are characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity. Among this group, hereditary spherocytosis patients are more likely to experience symptomatic anemia. Treatment of hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy is curative in most patients. However, the growing recognition of the long-term risks of splenectomy has led to a re-evaluation of its role. Management guidelines acknowledge these considerations and recommend discussions between healthcare providers, patients, and families. The hereditary elliptocytosis syndromes are the most common primary disorders of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Nonetheless, most elliptocytosis patients are asymptomatic and do not require therapy.

### Synchronous splenectomy during cholecystectomy for hereditary spherocytosis: Is it really necessary [^111EyZm1]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to determine if data support the expert guideline that recommends performing synchronous splenectomy in patients with mild hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and symptoms of gallstone disease. This recommendation has not been widely explored in the literature, and the study aims to assess if different practice patterns should exist.

This is an IRB-approved retrospective study. All HS patients under 18 years of age who underwent cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones at a single institution between 1981 and 2009 were identified. Patients who underwent cholecystectomy without concurrent splenectomy were reviewed retrospectively for future need for splenectomy and evidence of recurrent gallstone disease.

Of the 32 patients identified, 27 underwent synchronous splenectomy. The remaining 5 patients underwent cholecystectomy without splenectomy and had a mean age of 9.4 years. One of the 5 patients eventually required splenectomy for left upper quadrant pain. None of the remaining 4 required hospitalization for symptoms related to hemolysis or hepatobiliary disease. The median follow-up is 15.6 years.

The conclusion suggests that the need for splenectomy in patients with mild HS and symptomatic cholelithiasis should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The recommendation is to not perform synchronous splenectomy in conjunction with cholecystectomy for these patients if no indication for splenectomy exists.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation in a childhood hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^115bTDgh]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Due to the heterogeneity of the phenotype of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) patients, some patients may have rare clinical complications such as biliary obstruction and ultra-high bilirubinemia.

- **Case presentation**: A 8-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with complaints of anemia for 6 years and worsened abdominal pain and scleral yellowing of the skin for 2 days. Physical examination showed tenderness in the middle and upper abdomen and splenomegaly. Abdominal CT revealed biliary obstruction. Genetic analysis revealed a de novo mutation in the gene ANK1, and HS with biliary obstruction was diagnosed. Surgery for bile duct exploration and T-tube drainage, followed by a splenectomy, was performed. This patient was followed up for 13 months after splenectomy, and his condition remained stable.

- **Conclusion**: The diagnosis of HS is not clinically difficult. Once a patient with HS is diagnosed, regular follow-up management and standardized treatment are required. Genetic testing is also necessary to screen for other genetic disorders that may co-exist in patients with HS who do not respond well to treatment or who have a long-term chronic onset of jaundice.

### Band 3 cape town (E90K) causes severe hereditary spherocytosis in combination with band 3 Prague III [^114Vecgd]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited haemolytic anaemia characterized by spheroidal, osmotically fragile red blood cells. This disorder exhibits heterogeneity in terms of both clinical severity and underlying molecular defects. We have studied a South African Cape Coloured individual with severe HS owing to a band 3 deficiency caused by two mutations occurring in trans in the band 3 gene: a novel variant that we have designated band 3 Cape Town and a previously described mutation, band 3 Prague III.

Analysis of erythrocyte membrane proteins indicated a deficiency of both band 3 and protein 4.2, as well as a decreased functional capacity of band 3 to transport anions. Band 3 Cape Town is defined by a GAG→AAG point mutation at codon 90, substituting a glutamic acid with a lysine in the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule, while band 3 Prague III is a codon 870 CGG→TGG point mutation, replacing an arginine with a tryptophan in the transmembrane region of band 3.

mRNA is transcribed from both mutant alleles, implying that mutant proteins are synthesized but either degraded prior to membrane incorporation or their insertion is impaired. We conclude that the combination of these two mutations exacerbated the clinical presentation of the proband.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation in a childhood hereditary spherocytosis: A case report [^112hAaPZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Mutations in ANK1 are the most common cause of hereditary spherocytosis (HS), with at least 60 mutations identified in ANK1 among HS patients, including 7 missense mutations. Recently, mutations in different regions of the ANK1 gene have been linked to varying clinical phenotypes, demonstrating that the same mutated genes and sites may result in diverse clinical outcomes. In a Canadian cohort study, it was reported that four children with HS had the ANK1 mutation (c.1405–9G > A); three cases were inherited (autosomal dominant), while one was a de novo mutation. These four patients also carried other mutated gene sites concurrently.

In addition, the HS patients in the study exhibited mild anemia and slightly elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin, with a median age of onset at 13 years (ranging from 8.6 to 17.6 years). In contrast, in the case we reported, the age of onset was younger, and the patient experienced more severe anemia and significantly elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels, resulting in gallstones and biliary obstruction. Despite the common mutation site in the ANK1 genes among HS patients, clinical phenotypes can vary greatly, potentially influenced by age and race.

Since abnormal spherical red blood cells are primarily captured and destroyed in the spleen, splenectomy is recommended for patients with moderate to severe hemolytic HS. In this case, the patient had moderate anemia and persistent hyperbilirubinemia following T-tube drainage. Although symptoms of biliary obstruction resolved, excessive hemolysis due to HS might lead to hyperbilirubinemia, indicating that splenectomy was performed.

### Red blood cell indexes in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and beta-thalassemia combination [^113djNS5]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

The spontaneous occurrence of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and beta-thalassemia in the same patient is a rare event. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is elevated above the reference range in half to two-thirds of patients with HS, but there are no data for the HS/beta-thal combinations for the red blood cell indexes. This study reassessed these values in these particular patients. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution (RDW), and reticulocyte count were documented from 43 HS patients, 13 of which were from 10 families with the combination of beta-thal and HS. Additionally, 28 controls were included.

Patients with HS/beta-thal have a significantly lower MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and MCHC, and a significantly higher RDW than normal control subjects. Notably, 95% of beta-thalassemia carriers are free of clinical symptoms. When red blood cell indexes reveal a possibility of a beta-thalassemia carrier state with the symptoms of hemolytic anemia, HS should be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of rare congenital nonimmune hemolytic disease [^115f9yjX]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology: Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Rare congenital nonimmune hemolytic disorders of the erythrocyte, although uncommon, are important causes of anemia in both children and adults. These disorders represent a heterogeneous group of diseases that disrupt normal erythrocyte structure and function in various ways.

- **Abnormalities of hemoglobin stability**: Unstable hemoglobinopathies may lead to chronic or episodic hemolysis.

- **Defects of erythrocyte metabolism**: Perturbation of critical enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway leads to altered erythrocyte metabolism and chronic hemolysis.

- **Disorders of erythrocyte hydration**: These are an under-recognized cause of hemolytic anemia.

Beyond their pathophysiologic mechanisms, this group of disorders is characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity and are often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This review discusses pathophysiology, inheritance, clinical findings, laboratory manifestations, and management considerations for several rare nonimmune hemolytic diseases, including unstable hemoglobins, disorders of erythrocyte metabolism, and abnormalities of erythrocyte hydration.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115G5C3h]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The RBC membrane is composed of a fluid double layer of lipids in which approximately 20 major proteins and 850 minor proteins are embedded. The membrane is attached to the intracellular cytoskeleton by protein–protein and lipid–protein interactions, essential for maintaining the RBC's shape, stability, and deformability. Many transmembrane (TM) proteins possess both transport and structural functions by interacting with cytoskeletal proteins. For instance, band 3 interacts with cytoskeletal proteins and functions as the red cell chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger. In tissues, red cells take up CO2, which is converted to bicarbonate ion that leaves the cell in exchange for chloride ion via band 3.

Many families with red cell membrane disorders of varying severity have been documented. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) involves altered membrane structural organization. In most HS cases, mutations occur in the genes ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EBP42, and SPTA1, encoding ankyrin, spectrin β-chain, band 3 protein (the red cell chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger 1), protein 4.2, and spectrin α-chain, respectively. Mutations associated with other disorders like hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) reside in the SPTA1 and SPTB genes and the EPB41 gene, which encodes protein 4.1. HS, HE, and HPP are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous blood cell membrane disorders. The presence of another RBC defect can amplify or diminish the phenotypic impacts of HS, HE, or HPP.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^111HSTLj]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Our results provide new insights into the pathophysiology and vesiculation process in hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Suggested mechanisms for membrane shedding by red blood cells (RBCs) relate to clustering of membrane proteins driving curvature generation, and to the balance between membrane bending and stretching of the spectrin cytoskeleton. The weaker linkage of the membrane with the underlying cytoskeleton in HS likely causes loss of organization in the membrane. This is supported by the observation that diffusion of membrane proteins is faster in RBCs from patients with HS. We speculate that loss of organization of the membrane allows for the accumulation of specific membrane proteins that locally lower the bending modulus, thus reducing the energy barrier for vesicle formation. This would be consistent with the observation that the bending modulus of spherocytic red blood cells is not decreased, indicating that the loss of membrane linkage could lead to the increased vesiculation observed in HS patients. Ultimately, such increased vesiculation is the primary reason for the rounding and stiffening of HS RBCs, resulting in RBC clearance from circulation and hemolytic anemia.

To conclude, we have presented an innovative approach to characterize the structural and material properties of extracellular vesicles. Surprisingly, the material properties of RBC extracellular vesicles (EVs) from healthy donors are similar to that of fluid liposomes. In contrast, the EVs from hereditary spherocytosis patients are significantly softer. This suggests a neutral effect for membrane proteins in donor EVs, whereas the different protein composition in HS affects the vesiculation process.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^11772G9B]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

This comprehensive study in a well-characterized cohort of patients offers insight into the variable phenotypic manifestations of hereditary spherocytosis (HS), possible causes of clinical heterogeneity and severity, and the impact of splenectomy. We show here that strong markers of moderate/severe expression of HS are: (i) lower red blood cell (RBC) density, reflected by differences in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and fractionation of RBC on the Percoll density gradient; (ii) reduced RBC deformability and increased membrane loss, as determined by RBC vesicle numbers and a decrease in micropipette aspiration (MPA); and (iii) heterogeneity in the RBC population, as indicated by differences in red cell distribution width (RDW) and fractionation of RBC using a Percoll gradient.

We conclude that patients with moderate/severe HS have short-lived RBCs of lower density and abnormally high intercellular heterogeneity, whereas patients with mild HS have a less pronounced reduction in RBC deformability, resulting in the cells living longer and being subject to progressive loss of membrane. RBCs from patients with mild HS thus become denser before they are taken up by the spleen.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^111cWpya]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycythemia vera, more specifically with respect to patients with congenital erythrocytosis, BSH 2019 guidelines recommend considering venesection in patients with congenital erythrocytosis, particularly in the following cases:

- **Symptoms likely caused by raised hematocrit**: This includes any symptoms that are probably the result of an increased hematocrit level.

- **Previous thrombotic episode**: A history of thrombosis should prompt consideration for venesection.

- **Thrombotic episode in a family member**: If an asymptomatic person has a family member carrying the same genetic lesion who has experienced a thrombotic episode, especially with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins, venesection is recommended.

### Vibrio vulnificus necrotizing fasciitis of the calf presenting with compartment syndrome [^1172zEjT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a 17-year-old boy with congenital spherocytosis and iron overload who presented with compartment syndrome of the calf as the initial manifestation of Vibrio vulnificus infection after minor trauma in a contaminated fish pond. The disease was complicated by necrotizing fasciitis requiring above-the-knee amputation. Childhood diseases associated with iron overload pose an increased risk for complicated V. vulnificus infections.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^114MQRKr]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

This study reveals the factors defining RBC longevity and erythropoietic activity in patients with HS. These factors include membrane stability, which depends on the localization of mutations affecting vertical or horizontal interactions within the membrane cytoskeleton and on the presence of splenic filtering capacity. Mild HS is associated with prolonged survival of RBC in the circulation, allowing greater loss of membrane, which results in smaller and denser RBC. Shorter-lived, unstable RBC from patients with a severe HS phenotype are more heterogeneous and less dense, as reflected by lower MCHC.

- **Factors defining clinical severity in HS**: Parameters that specifically mark clinical severity in HS are RBC density (MCHC, Percoll, O hyper), RBC deformability (EI max), and RBC heterogeneity (RDW). These parameters may be used to monitor the success of supportive therapy and assist in the development of new personalized treatment regimens.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^112G94wE]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

In the study of red blood cell markers of severity in hereditary spherocytosis (HS), the severity in non-splenectomized patients was assessed based on the reduction in hemoglobin concentration and an increase in reticulocyte count. In our patients, hemoglobin concentration showed a positive correlation with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Inverse correlations were observed between hemoglobin and red blood cell distribution width (RDW), and between hemoglobin and reticulocyte count. Additionally, inverse correlations were noted between hemoglobin and parameters that define red blood cell hydration status, such as intracellular potassium (K+) and hypertonic osmolarity at 50% of maximal elongation (O hyper).

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^116ZPEHX]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, we investigated a unique and genetically well-diagnosed group of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) patients in whom we performed an in-depth analysis of red blood cell (RBC) properties, such as membrane instability, cellular density, cellular heterogeneity, vesiculation, turnover, and lifespan. The data obtained were then correlated to clinical manifestations of HS in both non-splenectomized and splenectomized patients to identify markers of disease severity. Our results indicate that clinical severity in HS cannot be solely attributed to the protein harboring the mutation but rather to the stability of the whole cytoskeletal network. RBC density, heterogeneity, and deformability were identified as potential markers of severity. We found that the presence of dense RBC is strongly associated with milder manifestations of HS. We hypothesize that unstable RBC from patients with clinically more severe disease are removed from the circulation before they acquire the features of senescence.

### Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia secondary to combined RhC hemolytic disease, congenital hypothyroidism and large adrenal hematoma: a case report [^112xmaHK]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

ABO blood group incompatibility, neonatal sepsis, G-6-PD deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, and hereditary spherocytosis are all probable causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. However, the etiology of some hyperbilirubinemia can be extremely complex, potentially involving multiple factors that result in severe jaundice. This report examines a case of severe jaundice due to three causes, highlighting the importance of investigating the etiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

- **Case presentation**: At 96 hours of life, a full-term male infant, delivered vaginally, presented with yellowish discoloration of the body and was transferred to our hospital. Upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit on the fourth day after birth, he developed jaundice. The transcutaneous bilirubin level was 28 mg/dl, with a total bilirubin of 540.2 μmol/L and indirect bilirubin of 516.7 μmol/L. Blood types of both parents and the baby were O Rh(D +), and the direct Coombs test was negative, whereas the mother's indirect Coombs test was positive. An investigation of the minor blood group revealed that the father's Rh was CCDee, the mother's was ccDEE, and the baby's was CcDEe. Despite intensive phototherapy and double volume exchange transfusion, the total bilirubin remained at 303 μmol/L. By day 10, the bilirubin level was 303.5 μmol/L. Intensive phototherapy continued, and intravenous immunoglobulin was administered again. On day 10, thyroid hormone tests indicated a TSH level of 13.334 mIU/L, and screening for congenital hypothyroidism showed a TSH level of 33 mIU/L. Due to a palpable abdominal mass, an ultrasound and MRI were conducted.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 100–120, and reticulocytopenia. However, 30% of cases have a normal MCV. There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected. The hallmark of CDA-I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated two weeks post-intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, such as when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency, or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is approximately 75–80%. In ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30%.

Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) for achieving a clinical diagnosis of CDA-II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA-I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig. 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, and microspherocytes.

### Splenectomy improves erythrocyte functionality in spherocytosis based on septin abundance, but not maturation defects [^112mAwuW]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: Although other studies have focused on morphological and, less frequently, functional alterations of RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis, our study combined biochemical, proteomic, and imaging approaches to investigate a series of RBC functionality-related parameters in a cohort of patients, splenectomized or not. We revealed that splenectomy limited but did not prevent alterations in RBC morphology and functionality. Moreover, septins were increased in patient RBCs and correlated with RBC alteration. This increase might have resulted from RBC maturation defects. These findings are discussed below and summarized in supplemental Figure 4.

- **Study limitations**: To determine the effect of splenectomy on RBC morphology and functionality, patients should ideally have been compared before and after splenectomy. However, as most patients were splenectomized before the study was launched, this approach could only be applied to P1, P7, and P13 for some parameters. Therefore, an entire cohort of 4 nonsplenectomized and 10 splenectomized patients was included for comparison. Because biological and RBC fragility parameters measured in P1 and P7 before and after splenectomy showed the same evolution as those in the whole patient cohort, we were confident about the data obtained. Comparison of patient baseline characteristics indicated that the nonsplenectomized group mainly includes men and patients with ANK1 mutations, whereas the splenectomized group shows a higher proportion of SPTB mutations and a wider age range.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^113odKzb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

We present a case that does not fit into the above categories. We describe a family previously classified as having hereditary spherocytosis (HS) phenotype who presented in a novel form with familial pseudohypokalaemia. The patient and his daughter were recalled to the hospital as an emergency for a repeat electrolyte measurement when routine samples were found to show low serum potassium. Repeat serum potassium measurements in the emergency department were within reference intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first case presentation of pseudohypokalaemia associated with the HS phenotype.

### A de novo ANK1 mutation associated to hereditary spherocytosis: a case report [^115TZhix]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

ANK1 is an important red cell membrane protein, which plays a vital role in maintaining erythrocyte membrane integrity. ANK1 consists of three structural domains: a multiple repeats N-terminal domain, a spectrin-binding center region, and a regulatory C-terminal domain. Mutations in the spectrin-binding and regulatory C-terminal domains result in the most severe anemia compared to mutations located in other domains.

In our study, the patient had suffered from unexplained hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia since the neonatal period. At the age of 3 months, hepatosplenomegaly and spherocytes, which are critical for diagnosing hereditary spherocytosis (HS), weren't observed; erythrocyte osmotic fragility was negative. It was difficult to diagnose HS originating from mutations in genes coding for RBC membrane components. Gene detection is the principal method for cases with no family history of HS, especially in some atypical cases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is capable of providing a thorough genetic analysis and identifying which candidate gene is responsible for the disease. Therefore, with this patient, we used an NGS panel to analyze 566 genes responsible for hematological disorders. The genetic tests showed a de novo ANK1 c.2693dupC (p. A899Sfs*11) frameshift mutation, which was not found in the 1000G, ExAC, or HGMD databases. Moreover, this mutation was located in the spectrin-binding domain, potentially causing HS. At the age of 11 months, spherocytes on a peripheral blood smear were 10%, and the neonatal HS ratio was 4.38. Our report strongly suggests that, in infants, it is important for physicians.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^111hNCvd]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) originates from defective anchoring of the cytoskeletal network to the transmembrane protein complexes of the red blood cell (RBC). Red cells in HS are characterized by membrane instability and reduced deformability, and there is marked heterogeneity in disease severity among patients. To unravel this variability in disease severity, we analyzed blood samples from 21 HS patients with defects in ankyrin, band 3, α-spectrin, or β-spectrin using red cell indices, eosin-5-maleimide binding, microscopy, the osmotic fragility test, Percoll density gradients, vesiculation, and ektacytometry to assess cell membrane stability, cellular density, and deformability. Reticulocyte counts, CD71 abundance, band 4.1 a:b ratio, and glycated hemoglobin were used as markers of RBC turnover.

We observed that patients with moderate/severe spherocytosis have short-living erythrocytes of low density and abnormally high intercellular heterogeneity. These cells show a prominent decrease in membrane stability and deformability and, as a consequence, are quickly removed from the circulation by the spleen. In contrast, in mild spherocytosis, a less pronounced reduction in deformability results in prolonged RBC lifespan and, hence, cells are subject to progressive loss of membrane. RBC from patients with mild spherocytosis thus become denser before they are taken up by the spleen. Based on our findings, we conclude that RBC membrane loss, cellular heterogeneity, and density are strong markers of clinical severity in spherocytosis.

### De novo variations of ANK1 gene caused hereditary spherocytosis in two Chinese children by affecting pre-mRNA splicing [^1136vrmH]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is one of the most common hereditary haemolytic disorders. Two unrelated families, with the probands displaying typical manifestations of HS, were enrolled in this study. The aim was to characterize the effect of two novel variants in HS patients on gene splicing, to help minimize the rate of misdiagnosis of HS and enhance clinicians' understanding of the disease.

A retrospective review was conducted. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all family members, and genomic DNA was extracted for genetic diagnostics. Initially, high-throughput sequencing technology was used for the preliminary screening of candidate causative variants. Thereafter, the variants were verified via Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, a pathogenicity analysis of the detected variants was performed, including in silico prediction and in vitro experiments. We constructed matched wild-type and mutant-type minigene plasmids of ANK1 based on HEK293T cells to address the effects of variants on mRNA splicing.

The c.1305 + 2 T > A (family 1) and c.1305 + 2del (family 2) variants were detected in the ANK1 gene. These two de novo mutations have not been reported prior to this study. Moreover, the validation results of splicing reporter systems revealed that the intronic mutations resulted in abnormal pre-mRNA splicing. Specifically, the minigene plasmid expressing the c.1305 + 2 T > A variant transcribed the two aberrant transcripts: r.1305_1306ins1305 + 1_1305 + 229 and r.1305_1306ins1305 + 1_1305 + 552.

### Temporal trends of splenectomy in pediatric hospitalizations with hereditary spherocytosis from 2000 to 2019: A national survey [^111iJvSB]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Total and partial splenectomy are used in pediatric patients with hereditary spherocytosis to resolve anemia and hemolytic complications.

- **Procedure**: Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Kid's Inpatient Database was used to profile and describe temporal trends in pediatric (≤ 18 years) hospital admissions in the United States from 2000 to 2019 data release years. Survey sampling methods were used to produce national estimates.

- **Results**: From 2000 to 2019, the use of splenectomy declined overall, from 427 to 206 weighted procedures (difference = 222, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 124–320; p < .0001); the risk of undergoing splenectomy during admission also declined from 56.7% to 38.7% (risk difference = 17.9 percentage points [p.p.], 95% CI: 9.7–26.1; p < .0001). Total splenectomy was mostly used. Age at time of splenectomy increased 10.2 years (difference = 1.6 years, 95% CI: 0.6–2.7; p = .0018). The risk of splenectomy increased with age until 10 years, then leveled off until 18 years. The proportion of children aged ≤ 5 years undergoing splenectomy decreased from 27.7% to 11.2% in 2019 (risk difference: 16.5 p.p., 95% CI: 7.3–25.7; p = .0004). The strongest clinical predictors of splenectomy, adjusting for patient- and hospital-level characteristics, were a co-diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.18, 95% CI: 1.92–5.28; p < .0001) and splenomegaly or hypersplenism (aOR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.74–3.65; p < .0001). Risk of splenectomy with splenomegaly or hypersplenism increased over time.

- **Conclusion**: Splenectomy was

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^117XXUWn]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

RBC EVs from hereditary spherocytosis patients are softened. We compared the mechanical properties of RBC EVs from healthy donors with RBC EVs from patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Dominantly inherited HS is often caused by mutations in the genes encoding ankyrin and band 3. In two of these patients (patient 1 and 2), HS is caused by heterozygosity for a novel 4 base pair insertion in ANK1 (c.5201_5202insTCAG p. Thr1734fs). This 4 base pair insertion results in a shift of the reading frame, leading to a truncated ankyrin protein. One of these two patients underwent splenectomy (patient 2). The third patient (patient 3) shows heterozygosity for a novel nonsense mutation in ANK1: c.498C > G p.(Tyr166*). If stable, such proteins likely would be deficient in their function.

Ankyrin truncation is expected to result in a disturbed cytoskeletal network and its connection to the plasma membrane. This leads to increased vesiculation and hence a reduced ratio of surface area to volume, resulting in spherocytic cells. Such RBCs are poorly deformable and will be cleared prematurely from the blood circulation, leading to hemolytic anemia. Reduced RBC deformability was confirmed by laser diffraction ektacytometry.

### Density, heterogeneity and deformability of red cells as markers of clinical severity in hereditary spherocytosis [^114k8hSu]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

The effect of splenectomy on red blood cell markers of disease severity in patients with moderate to severe hereditary spherocytosis (HS) shows that splenectomy results in an increase in hemoglobin levels and erythrocyte counts (data not shown). In our cohort, splenectomy was also associated with a decrease in red cell distribution width (RDW) and normalization of red blood cell (RBC) morphology (Online Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). The survival of RBCs from splenectomized HS patients, as assessed by HbA1c content or the band 4.1a:b ratio, was found to be increased.

- **Role of splenectomy on red blood cell parameters in hereditary spherocytosis**:
	- Blue circles represent healthy controls, black circles represent unsplenectomized hereditary spherocytosis (HS) patients, and red circles represent splenectomized HS patients. HS patients are grouped according to clinical severity (i.e. mild, moderate/severe, and splenectomized).

	- **Parameters**:
		(A) Red cell distribution width (RDW; percent coefficient of variation, %CV).
		(B) Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, mmol/mol).
		(C) Band 4.1a/4.1b ratio.
		(D) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC, g/L).
		(E) Intracellular potassium (mmol/L).
		(F) Eosin-5′-maleimide (EMA)-binding hemoglobin (%).
		(G) Maximum deformability (EI max).
		(H) Hydration state of the red blood cells reflected by hypertonic osmolarity at 50% of maximal elongation (O hyper, mOsmol/L).
		(I) 50% lysis point in the osmotic fragility test (g/L NaCl).

Significant differences are noted by: ✱ p ≤ 0.05, † P ≤ 0.01, or ‡ P ≤ 0.001.

Several parameters remained unaffected by splenectomy. Splenectomy did not alter MCHC or intracellular potassium levels.
