## Question

How is pulmonary hypertension diagnosed, what are its sequelae, and how does it relate to symptomatic bradycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a stepwise approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and a summary of its major sequelae, including how it relates to symptomatic bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how pulmonary hypertension is initially suspected clinically. Then, I should verify the first-line noninvasive test and its thresholds and limitations. Next, I will confirm the invasive hemodynamic criteria and classification. After that, I need to check indications for vasoreactivity testing and ancillary investigations to define etiology. Finally, I will examine the key sequelae: right ventricular failure, arrhythmias, symptom burden, and mortality risk, including risks even at mildly elevated pressures, and I will self-check any discrepancies in thresholds along the way [^1114ERM9] [^112doT7x].

> Let me first confirm how we get to clinical suspicion before any testing, because I need to ensure we anchor the diagnostic pathway appropriately: patients often present with nonspecific symptoms like exertional dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, chest pressure, or edema, with risk factors spanning left heart disease, lung disease/hypoxia, connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease, drugs/toxins, chronic thromboembolic disease, and sleep-disordered breathing, so a careful history and exam are essential to set pretest probability and to avoid premature closure on a single cause [^1114ERM9] [^115YWDzU] [^115dHHvh].

> Next, I should review the first-line noninvasive test, but wait, let me verify the strength of the recommendation: guidelines consistently endorse transthoracic echocardiography as the initial investigation for suspected pulmonary hypertension or unexplained dyspnea, used to assign an echocardiographic probability rather than to confirm the diagnosis, which is a critical distinction I must not overlook [^111vzstk] [^112QSaH1] [^1117cusi].

> Hold on, I should verify the echocardiographic thresholds because I initially thought a tricuspid regurgitation velocity > 2.5 m/s might define risk, but that was from observational/meta-analytic data and not guideline criteria; current ESC/ERS guidance maintains the threshold TRV > 2.8 m/s, integrated with secondary signs, to assign a probability of pulmonary hypertension, whereas the 2.5 m/s signal identifies at-risk patients but is not a diagnostic cutoff, so I should correct my initial assumption here [^1177PAn6] [^113ySxcS] [^116X984w].

> I need to ensure the echo assessment is comprehensive, not just a single jet velocity: echo should evaluate left-sided chambers and valves to uncover post-capillary causes, estimate right atrial pressure via IVC size/collapse, and assess right ventricular size and function using TAPSE, tissue Doppler S', RV index of myocardial performance, and where available, RV free-wall strain, because missing left-heart pathology here could misclassify the hemodynamic type downstream [^115hsuGA] [^112wuZTY] [^111iZwGm].

> Let me now confirm the definitive step, and I should double-check that we are using the updated hemodynamic definitions: right heart catheterization is mandatory to establish the diagnosis, quantify severity, and classify the hemodynamic phenotype, with pulmonary hypertension defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg at rest, a change from the historical 25 mmHg threshold that I must explicitly acknowledge and not confuse with older definitions [^112doT7x] [^1114ERM9] [^117YUKud].

> I will now examine how we classify the hemodynamic type on RHC, and I should verify the current PVR cut-points: precapillary pulmonary hypertension requires PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg and PVR > 2 Wood units, isolated postcapillary pulmonary hypertension requires PAWP > 15 mmHg with PVR ≤ 2 WU, and combined post- and precapillary disease requires PAWP > 15 mmHg with PVR > 2 WU, which reflects the contemporary shift from using 3 WU in older schemas and must be applied consistently to avoid mislabeling combined disease as isolated [^112doT7x] [^1114ERM9] [^116cyzkU].

> Wait, let me first confirm who should undergo vasoreactivity testing and with what agents before I assume it applies broadly: acute vasodilator testing during RHC is reserved for idiopathic, heritable, or drug-associated PAH, using inhaled nitric oxide, IV epoprostenol, or adenosine, and a positive response is defined by a drop in mPAP ≥ 10 mmHg to < 40 mmHg with preserved or increased cardiac output, which predicts suitability for high-dose calcium channel blockers in expert centers only [^112doT7x] [^111qcLwS] [^1127apm1].

> Next, I should review ancillary studies to define etiology and probability when echo is indeterminate, because I need to ensure we do not miss treatable subtypes: ventilation–perfusion scanning is essential to screen for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary function tests with DLCO and thoracic CT help characterize lung disease, sleep testing is indicated when clinical context suggests sleep-disordered breathing, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing can refine probability if echo is intermediate, all of which should be integrated rather than viewed in isolation [^112oPzzu] [^115ZdU8U] [^1117cusi].

> But wait, what if the wedge pressure is borderline and I suspect occult HFpEF physiology; I should double-check the guidance here: in patients with mPAP > 20 mmHg and PAWP 13–15 mmHg with features of HFpEF, fluid challenge or exercise hemodynamics during RHC can unmask post-capillary physiology, preventing inappropriate labeling as precapillary disease and avoiding harmful PAH-directed therapy in Group 2 PH [^114fuFyr] [^112doT7x].

> Now, shifting to sequelae, let me consider the right ventricle because I need to emphasize what ultimately determines outcomes: chronic pressure overload induces RV hypertrophy, dilation, and progressive failure, commonly termed cor pulmonale in lung disease, and RV failure is the leading cause of death across pulmonary hypertension phenotypes, underscoring why serial RV assessment and decongestion are central to care [^1114ERM9] [^115EicHG].

> I should review arrhythmic complications next, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the type that predominates: supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation and flutter, are frequent and portend worse outcomes with an emphasis on maintaining sinus rhythm when feasible, whereas robust evidence for a causal role of bradyarrhythmias in PAH is limited and management follows general syncope/bradycardia guidance, with pacing indicated when symptomatic bradycardia is causally linked to syncope, and PAH guidelines caution against routine beta-blockade unless needed for comorbidities to avoid aggravating low cardiac output and bradycardia [^11111b1u] [^115T3GxJ] [^113HBX48].

> Let me think about the symptom trajectory and supportive care needs, and I should verify we align this with prognostic staging: symptoms typically progress from exertional dyspnea and fatigue to chest pain, presyncope/syncope, abdominal distension, and edema as RV failure advances, and high symptom burden in advanced disease justifies early integration of palliative care for symptom control and goals-of-care planning alongside disease-targeted therapy [^1114ERM9] [^114Pi1kM].

> I should double-check the mortality signal at lower pressure thresholds because I initially conflated "mild" with "benign", which is incorrect: meta-analyses demonstrate increased mortality even with mildly elevated pressures below traditional thresholds, supporting the updated definition and the need for earlier detection and risk modification, so I will correct that assumption and emphasize risk beginning around mPAP just above 19–20 mmHg while still requiring RHC for diagnosis [^116aj1aE] [^116Vi23A] [^111ijwim].

> To make sure I have closed the loop, let me reconsider the full pathway: start with careful clinical suspicion and risk stratification, use transthoracic echocardiography to assign probability without overcalling a diagnosis, proceed to right heart catheterization to confirm and classify hemodynamics using the updated mPAP and PVR criteria, apply vasoreactivity testing only in the narrow PAH subset, use targeted ancillary tests to define etiology, and anticipate sequelae — particularly RV failure, tachyarrhythmias, progressive symptoms, and elevated mortality risk even at mild pressure elevations — to guide timely referral and longitudinal management in PH centers [^111vzstk] [^112doT7x] [^1114ERM9].

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is diagnosed by a **mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg** on right heart catheterization [^1114ERM9], with echocardiography as the initial noninvasive test [^111vzstk] and vasoreactivity testing reserved for selected PAH cases [^112doT7x]. PH leads to **right ventricular failure [^1114ERM9], arrhythmias [^11111b1u], and increased mortality** [^116aj1aE]. Symptomatic bradycardia in PH is uncommon but can occur due to right atrial enlargement [^11111b1u], hypoxemia [^116VpaZ9], or drug effects [^113HBX48], and may worsen hemodynamics by **reducing cardiac output** and precipitating syncope [^115T3GxJ] or right heart failure [^1114ERM9]. Management includes **addressing reversible causes** [^113HBX48], cautious use of chronotropes [^115gLXxM], and pacing when bradycardia causes hemodynamic compromise [^115T3GxJ].

## Diagnostic criteria and methods for pulmonary hypertension

### Hemodynamic definition

The hemodynamic definition relies on **right heart catheterization** [^1114ERM9] to confirm a mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg at rest [^112doT7x]. Precapillary pulmonary hypertension is defined by a pulmonary vascular resistance > 2 Wood units [^116cyzkU] [^1114ERM9].

---

### Diagnostic approach

- **Echocardiography**: Initial noninvasive test to estimate pulmonary pressures and assess right ventricular (RV) function [^112QSaH1] [^111vzstk].

- **Right heart catheterization**: Gold standard [^1114ERM9] for definitive diagnosis [^116yR6R1] and hemodynamic classification.

- **Vasoreactivity testing**: Performed in selected idiopathic, heritable, or drug-associated PAH [^111qcLwS] to identify candidates for high-dose calcium channel blockers (CCBs) [^112doT7x].

---

## Clinical sequelae and complications of pulmonary hypertension

PH is a **progressive disease with significant morbidity and mortality** [^1114ERM9], driven primarily by RV failure and its complications.

---

### Right ventricular failure

Chronic pressure overload produces right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation [^1114ERM9], leading to **remodeling and eventual failure** [^116GBV2a]. The resulting RV dysfunction limits cardiac output and causes fatigue, syncope, and exercise intolerance [^1114ERM9].

---

### Arrhythmias

Supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly **atrial fibrillation and flutter**, are common in pulmonary hypertension [^11111b1u] and are associated with worsened outcomes [^1114ERM9]. Ventricular arrhythmias are less frequent but can contribute to sudden cardiac death [^11111b1u].

---

### Other complications

Syncope results from reduced cardiac output and impaired right ventricular function [^1114ERM9]. Right heart failure is the **leading cause of mortality** in pulmonary hypertension [^1114ERM9]. Even mild elevations in pulmonary pressure [^1114ERM9] are associated with increased mortality risk [^116aj1aE].

---

## Relationship between pulmonary hypertension and symptomatic bradycardia

Symptomatic bradycardia is **not a common direct complication** of PH [^11111b1u] but may occur secondary to several mechanisms:

---

### Mechanisms linking PH to bradycardia

- **Right atrial enlargement**: Chronic pressure overload can cause right atrial enlargement, predisposing to sinus node dysfunction and bradyarrhythmias [^11111b1u].

- **Hypoxemia**: Chronic hypoxemia in PH can increase vagal tone, leading to bradycardia [^116VpaZ9].

- **Medications**: Beta-blockers [^113HBX48] and other medications used to manage comorbidities in PH patients can induce bradycardia.

---

### Clinical significance of bradycardia in PH

Bradycardia **reduces cardiac output** [^115gLXxM], exacerbates right ventricular failure, and worsens symptoms. It can precipitate syncope [^115T3GxJ], particularly in advanced pulmonary hypertension with RV dysfunction. Severe bradycardia that requires pacing is associated with increased mortality in PH.

---

## Management of symptomatic bradycardia in pulmonary hypertension

Management of symptomatic bradycardia in PH requires careful consideration given the **hemodynamic instability** inherent to the disease.

---

### General principles

Management should begin with identification and correction of **reversible causes** [^115T3GxJ] such as hypoxemia, electrolyte disturbances, and medication-induced bradycardia. Chronotropic agents (e.g. beta-agonists or anticholinergics) may be used cautiously [^115gLXxM] to increase heart rate. Temporary or permanent **pacing** may be required when bradycardia causes hemodynamic compromise [^115T3GxJ].

---

### Specific considerations in PH

- **Avoidance of beta-blockers**: Beta-blockers [^113HBX48] are generally avoided in PAH unless required for specific comorbidities due to potential worsening of RV function.

- **Careful fluid management**: Fluid overload can exacerbate RV failure, so careful monitoring and management are essential [^113Tdas2].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Management should involve PH specialists, cardiologists, and electrophysiologists to optimize outcomes [^112doT7x].

Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed by a **mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg** [^1114ERM9], confirmed by right heart catheterization. It leads to **right ventricular failure** [^1114ERM9], arrhythmias [^11111b1u], and increased mortality [^116aj1aE]. Symptomatic bradycardia, though uncommon, can occur due to right atrial enlargement [^11111b1u], hypoxemia [^116VpaZ9], or medications [^113HBX48], and may **worsen hemodynamics** [^115gLXxM]. Management includes treating **reversible causes**, cautious use of chronotropic agents, and pacing when necessary [^115T3GxJ].

### Pulmonary hypertension [^1114ERM9]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension encompasses a range of conditions directly or indirectly leading to elevated pressures within the pulmonary arteries. Five main groups of pulmonary hypertension are recognized, all defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure of > 20mmHg: pulmonary arterial hypertension (rare), pulmonary hypertension associated with left-sided heart disease (very common), pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease (common), pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary artery obstructions, usually related to thromboembolic disease (rare), and pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (rare).

At least 1% of the world's population is affected, with a greater burden more likely in low-income and middle-income countries. Across all its forms, pulmonary hypertension is associated with adverse vascular remodeling with obstruction, stiffening, and vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature. Without proactive management, this leads to hypertrophy and ultimately failure of the right ventricle, the main cause of death. In older individuals, dyspnea is the most common symptom. Stepwise investigation precedes definitive diagnosis with right heart catheterization.

Medical and surgical treatments are approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. There are emerging treatments for other forms of pulmonary hypertension; however, therapy primarily targets the underlying cause. There are still major gaps in basic, clinical, and translational knowledge; thus, further research, with a focus on vulnerable populations, is necessary.

### Arrhythmias in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^11111b1u]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias are important contributors to morbidity and mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Such patients manifest a substrate resulting from altered autonomics, repolarization abnormalities, and ischemia. Supraventricular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and flutter are associated with worsened outcomes, and maintenance of sinus rhythm is a goal. Sudden death is a relatively common issue, though the contribution of malignant ventricular arrhythmias versus bradyarrhythmias differs from non-PAH patients. Congenital heart disease patients with PAH benefit from catheter ablation of medically refractory arrhythmias. Clinical studies of defibrillator/pacemaker therapy for primary prevention against sudden death in PAH patients are lacking.

### Association between hemodynamic markers of pulmonary hypertension and outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111Mcpuz]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is highly prevalent, yet there are no specific therapies, possibly due to phenotypic heterogeneity. The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with HFpEF is considered a high-risk phenotype in need of targeted therapies, but there have been limited hemodynamic and outcomes data.

The objective of this study was to identify the hemodynamic characteristics and outcomes of PH-HFpEF. This cohort study analyzed participants who had a right heart catheterization from January 2005 to September 2012 (median [interquartile range] follow-up time, 1578 [554–2513] days). Hemodynamic catheterization data were linked to the clinical data repository of all inpatient and outpatient encounters across a health system. The study was conducted at a single tertiary referral center for heart failure and PH within a large health care network using a common clinical data repository. There were 19,262 procedures in 10,023 participants.

Participants were classified as having no PH, precapillary PH, or PH in the setting of left heart disease (reduced or preserved ejection fraction). Pulmonary hypertension associated with HFpEF was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 25 mm Hg or more, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or more, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more. Pulmonary hypertension severity was quantified by the hemodynamic parameters of transpulmonary gradient, pulmonary vascular resistance, and diastolic pulmonary gradient.

### Mild pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116X984w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Data from this study address the controversy on the mPAP level required to capture clinical risk in patients referred for RHC or echocardiography using a meta-analysis, which is the optimal research tool for determining aggregate risk across study populations. We report that mildly elevated PA pressures, estimated by either echocardiography or invasive catheterization, are associated with a 19% increased risk of mortality over 5 years. Despite analyzing both community-based and referral populations with varying underlying comorbidities, there was only mild statistical heterogeneity of risk across the included studies. This suggests a truly generalizable association between mild PH and mortality. These data support ongoing efforts to identify optimal cutoffs for hemodynamic parameters in PH, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, to identify at-risk populations earlier.

A notable finding of this study is the consistent association between mild PH and increased mortality when PA pressure was measured by either RHC or echocardiography. Although RHC is the only test available to diagnose PH, echocardiography is the preferred screening test for at-risk patients. Guidelines recommend further evaluation of patients for PH if the tricuspid regurgitation velocity is > 2.9 m/s (corresponding to PASP > ≈40 mm Hg). However, our findings demonstrate that PA pressure assessed by echocardiography, at levels currently considered to be below the range of clinical significance (tricuspid regurgitation velocity ≈ > 2.5 m/s, PASP > 35 mm Hg), is significant across both community-based and referral populations.

### Bradyarrhythmias, temporary and permanent pacing [^115gLXxM]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is common in critical care units; it may be transient, asymptomatic, and of little consequence, or life-threatening. Bradycardia may result from abnormalities of the sinus node, atrioventricular node, or the His-Purkinje system. It may also be precipitated by drug effects or enhanced vagal tone. Proper diagnosis is pivotal to determining prognosis and management. Temporary and permanent pacing is now readily available, markedly improving the morbidity and mortality associated with bradyarrhythmias.

### Ventavis [^114RM6NJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hypotension leading to syncope has been observed. It is crucial to monitor vital signs while initiating Ventavis. Ventavis should not be administered in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg [5.1]. Pulmonary venous hypertension is a concern; discontinue use if pulmonary edema is present [5.2]. The medication may cause bronchospasm, and patients with a history of hyperreactive airway disease may be more sensitive [5.3].

- **Risk of syncope**: Monitor vital signs while initiating Ventavis. It is advised not to initiate Ventavis in patients with a systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. Syncope can also occur in association with pulmonary arterial hypertension, particularly with physical exertion. The occurrence of exertional syncope may reflect a therapeutic gap or insufficient efficacy, indicating a potential need to adjust the dose or change therapy.

- **Pulmonary venous hypertension**: Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when inhaled Ventavis is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, it is essential to stop treatment immediately, as this may be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension.

- **Bronchospasm**: Ventavis inhalation can induce bronchospasm. The condition may be more severe or frequent in patients with a history of hyperreactive airways. Ventavis has not been evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, or acute pulmonary infections.

### Pulmonary hypertension and its management in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^111TuJoP]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a complex disorder of the pulmonary vasculature that leads to increased peri-operative morbidity and mortality. Non-cardiac surgery constitutes a significant risk in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The management of right ventricular failure is inherently challenging and fraught with life-threatening consequences. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology, the severity of the disease, and its treatment modalities is required to deliver optimal peri-operative care. This review provides an evidence-based overview of the definition, classification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary hypertension and focuses on the peri-operative management and treatment of pulmonary hypertensive crises in a non-cardiac setting.

### Diagnosis: Pulmonary hypertension. Next steps [^1114CcFB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease that is generally first encountered by primary care physicians. Patients typically present with dyspnea on exertion and a loss of exercise tolerance, although they can also experience symptoms such as chest discomfort, syncope, or edema. Most patients are diagnosed using 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography, although this method is not 100% sensitive or specific for making the diagnosis. It should be noted that the diagnostic criteria for this disease have changed recently.

Most patients develop PH secondary to left heart failure, or due to pulmonary disease with or without hypoxemia. Ultimately, many patients require right heart catheterization for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This procedure is best performed by specialists in the management of this disease. It is crucial to diagnose patients who have PH due to pulmonary artery hypertension and those with chronic thromboembolic PH, as these patients require specialized treatment that is most effective if initiated early in the disease course.

This review discusses issues related to the diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with PH.

Critically ill patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) often appear stable, but they can decompensate dramatically in a short time. PH has several causes, classes, and complications; however, its natural progression eventually leads to right ventricular failure, which can be extraordinarily difficult to manage. This review discusses the causes, signs, and symptoms of PH, as well as its management strategies and emergent complications. Treatment options are often limited, making it imperative for emergency department physicians to recognize and manage these patients in a timely fashion.

### Pathophysiology and new advances in pulmonary hypertension [^112QoeeC]. BMJ Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in our understanding of pulmonary arterial hypertension, several questions remain. The development of curative treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension and other types of pulmonary hypertension is needed. Furthermore, the key initiating events in pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension, as well as the combinations in which they occur, are still unclear. It is also unclear whether pulmonary arterial hypertension is a systemic rather than a cardiopulmonary disease, and whether pre-existing metabolic, inflammatory, genetic, and epigenetic abnormalities can predispose some individuals to develop pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonary hypertension. Regardless, the critical point at which a patient develops or does not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonary hypertension is not defined. Molecularly, it is still debated which cell types are the most critically injured, and the exact mechanisms are speculative. Most work on the cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension has been conducted in preclinical animal models, which do not completely replicate human disease. Additionally, patient tissues from early stages of the disease are not available.

Finally, despite its importance for patient survival and mortality, no treatments directed at the right ventricle currently exist. Research is only beginning to molecularly define right ventricular failure and how it progresses. The development of powerful new omics-based approaches and improved access to and affordability of database repositories is crucial for future advances.

### Canadian cardiovascular society/Canadian thoracic society position statement on pulmonary hypertension [^112wuZTY]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary hypertension, specifically with respect to echocardiography, the CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining baseline and follow-up echocardiograms in patients with pulmonary hypertension. These echocardiograms should measure systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, right atrial size, tricuspid regurgitation severity, and the presence and severity of pericardial effusion.

- **Assessment indices of RV systolic function**: Perform this using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, S', or RV index of myocardial performance. Use free wall strain measurements with 2D speckle tracking in centers with appropriate equipment and expertise.

The findings emphasize the importance of understanding the differences between various steady‐state and pulsatile indices of pulmonary vascular afterload, particularly in undifferentiated and left‐sided pulmonary hypertension (PH). Measurement of pressure or resistance alone does not fully characterize the functional properties of the pulmonary artery; not all vascular afterload parameters are interchangeable. More accurate methods of pulmonary artery compliance (PAC) determination now exist, and changes in one index do not always result in an equivalent or proportional change in another, as demonstrated in the study.

From a clinical standpoint, the resurfacing of questions about how to quantify pulmonary vascular afterload in the context of emerging therapies for PH and structural interventions affecting the right side of the heart suggests a reconsideration of pulsatile vascular afterload measures. Specifically, more accurate methods of PAC determination may provide new insights into the challenging problem of predicting right-sided heart dysfunction (RHD) in early PH, particularly in patients with PH caused by left‐sided disease. Future studies validating a three-component model of pulmonary vascular afterload with clinical endpoints in larger cohorts are now justified.

### Left ventricular heart failure and pulmonary hypertension [^115sAVT8]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

In patients with left ventricular heart failure (HF), the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction are frequent and have a significant impact on disease progression, morbidity, and mortality, warranting clinical attention. Pulmonary hypertension related to left heart disease (LHD) represents the most common form of PH, accounting for 65–80% of cases. Proper distinction between pulmonary arterial hypertension and PH-LHD is challenging, yet has direct therapeutic consequences.

Despite recent advances in the pathophysiological understanding and clinical assessment, as well as adjustments in the hemodynamic definitions and classification of PH-LHD, the hemodynamic interrelations in combined post- and pre-capillary PH are complex. The definitions and prognostic significance of hemodynamic variables characterizing the degree of pre-capillary PH in LHD remain suboptimal, and currently, there are no evidence-based recommendations for the management of PH-LHD.

We highlight the prevalence and significance of PH and RV dysfunction in patients with both HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Insights into the complex pathophysiology of cardiopulmonary interaction in LHD may lead to the evolution from a 'left ventricular phenotype' to a 'right ventricular phenotype' across the natural history of HF. Furthermore, we propose to better define the individual phenotype of PH by integrating the clinical context, non-invasive assessment, and invasive hemodynamic measures.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension: A palliative medicine review of the disease, its therapies, and drug interactions [^114Pi1kM]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is often a progressive and ultimately fatal disease. It is characterized by an elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure because of disease of the small pulmonary arterioles. PAH leads to a constellation of symptoms, including dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, chest discomfort, and peripheral edema. Disease-targeted therapies for PAH produce symptomatic and functional improvement, but long-term survival remains uncommon without lung transplantation.

Palliative care is appropriate to support patients with advanced PAH who typically have a high symptom burden. However, palliative care has historically focused on supporting patients with malignant disease, rather than progressive chronic diseases such as PAH. Our aim is to provide palliative care clinicians with a background in the classification, pathophysiology, and modern treatment of PAH.

This review describes disease-targeted therapies and their effects on symptoms, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life. We also review the unique physiology of PAH and its implication for palliative interventions. Pharmacological interactions with, and precautions related to commonly used palliative care medications, are discussed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary hypertension, specifically with respect to vasoreactivity testing, CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines recommend viewing marked vasodilator responsiveness (a decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure of ≥ 10 mmHg to < 40 mmHg and stable/increased cardiac output) as predictive of responsiveness to high-dose CCBs. Such treatments should be initiated in pulmonary hypertension expert centers.

### Management of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113J4MXN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common and may result from a number of disorders, including left heart disease, lung disease, and chronic thromboembolic disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an uncommon disease characterized by progressive remodeling of the distal pulmonary arteries, resulting in elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and, eventually, in right ventricular failure. Over the past decades, knowledge of the basic pathobiology of PAH and its natural history, prognostic indicators, and therapeutic options has exploded.

A thorough evaluation of a patient is critical to correctly characterize the PH. Cardiac studies, including echocardiography and right heart catheterization, are key elements in the assessment. Given the multitude of treatment options currently available for PAH, assessment of risk and response to therapy is critical in long-term management.

This review also underscores unique situations, including perioperative management, intensive care unit management, and pregnancy. It highlights the importance of collaborative care of the PAH patient through a multidisciplinary approach.

### Clinical characteristics of pulmonary hypertension in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^1124GFdC]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary vascular disease associated with left-side heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (PH-HFpEF) is an increasingly common cause of pulmonary hypertension. The distinction between PH-HFpEF and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is important because therapies indicated for PAH can be detrimental in HFpEF. The characteristic features of PH-HFpEF are understudied.

- **Methods and results**: In a cross-sectional study, we compared the clinical, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic features of PH-HFpEF (n = 100) with PAH (n = 522) and HFpEF without pulmonary vascular disease (n = 45). We determined the clinical characteristics that best differentiated PH-HFpEF from PAH. Compared with patients with PAH, patients with PH-HFpEF were older; had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities; had worse exercise capacity and renal function; more frequently had left atrial enlargement; and less frequently had right atrial enlargement. PH was less severe in PH-HFpEF patients than in PAH patients (pulmonary vascular resistance 4.8 [interquartile range 3 to 8.4] versus 10.9 [interquartile range 7.4 to 15.7] Wood units; P < 0.001).

Old age, the presence of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the absence of right atrial enlargement, higher aortic systolic pressure, higher mean right atrial pressure, and higher cardiac output best differentiated PH-HFpEF from PAH (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve; curve 0.97). Compared with HFpEF patients without pulmonary hypertension, PH-HFpEF patients were often female and more symptomatic.

### Influence of upright versus supine position on resting and exercise hemodynamics in patients assessed for pulmonary hypertension [^113FZ8GR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

At rest, hemodynamic parameters in both upright and supine positions for the main cohort are illustrated, with detailed changes shown in figures and tables removed from the text. Overall, mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), and right atrial pressure (RAP) were slightly but significantly lower in the upright position compared to the supine position. The cardiac index was also significantly lower when upright, resulting in a higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Additionally, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mPAP/cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were significantly higher when upright.

- **Differences in resting hemodynamics**: Mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in main resting hemodynamic measures were assessed by right heart catheterization in upright vs. supine positions within patients of both the entire main cohort and different hemodynamic subgroups. Differences are noted as negative when values in the upright position are lower than in the supine position. Key measures include cardiac index (L/min per m²), mPAP (mm Hg), PAWP (mm Hg), and PVR.

For the precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) group, PAWP, RAP, and cardiac index were significantly lower in the upright position. In contrast, PVR, HR, SBP, DBP, mPAP/CO, and SVR were significantly higher when upright.

### Pulmonary diseases and the heart [^115EicHG]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

The complex nature of interactions between the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems is becoming increasingly appreciated. Pulmonary vascular abnormalities are frequently present in patients with respiratory disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, neuromuscular or chest wall disorders, and disorders of ventilatory control, such as sleep apnea syndromes and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Pulmonary hypertension, classified as group III in the World Health Organization classification scheme for pulmonary hypertension, may result in severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by lung disease, also known as cor pulmonale. The development of cor pulmonale is generally associated with poorer prognosis and increased death.

Systemic manifestations of lung disease, particularly obstructive disorders, are also particularly relevant because they are associated with increased cardiac death and impaired health status. This article will discuss the most common pulmonary diseases and disorders of ventilatory control that cause pulmonary vascular abnormalities and cor pulmonale, with particular concentration on how the treatment of these diseases may affect the heart. In addition, the complex nature of cardiac and lung disease will also be explored, particularly with respect to the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular death, which is currently a very active focus of research.

### Definitions and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension [^115YWDzU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension can be associated with a variety of conditions and symptoms, including amphetamines, obstructive sleep apnea, and peripheral edema. It is also linked to conditions such as portal hypertension, Raynaud's phenomenon, abdominal distension, palpable P2, and jugular venous distention. Additional associations include an enlarged pulmonary artery, hepatomegaly, congenital heart disease, and atrial septal defect. Patients may present with Graham Steell murmur, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, fatigue, sickle cell disease, and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Other symptoms include fainting, dizziness, dyspnea, patent ductus arteriosus, and a holosystolic murmur.

Moreover, schistosomiasis, hypertension, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and the use of dasatinib are associated with the disease. Conditions such as HIV infection and factors like parasternal heave, aminorex, ascites, and systemic sclerosis also relate. Additional symptoms can include palpitations, fenfluramine usage, a third heart sound, an enlarged right atrium, chest pain, and tricuspid regurgitation. Lightheadedness, a split S2 heart sound, ventricular septal defect, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may also be observed.

### Does pulmonary endarterectomy improve the clinical conditions of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease without pulmonary hypertension [^116SE8Dh]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

To verify whether the new hemodynamic definition of pulmonary hypertension (PH) has any implications in the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) patients without PH, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and functional changes determined by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) in 63 CTEPD patients without PH who underwent surgery at our center. We compared those in whom the hemodynamic diagnosis of PH met recent guideline recommendations versus those in whom the diagnosis only met previous hemodynamic thresholds.

The results show that the vast majority of CTEPD patients without PH operated on at our center would now be defined as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) patients. PEA did not result in any improvement in exercise capacity, right ventricular function, or lung function tests in patients with mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≤ 20 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≤ 2 WU. On the contrary, hemodynamic parameters, exercise capacity, right ventricular function, and lung function significantly improved in patients with mPAP between 21 and 24 mm Hg.

### The relationship between pulmonary hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea [^112xZYPg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Although obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-associated pulmonary hypertension is not uncommon and carries a worse prognosis if left untreated, it is less well recognized by clinicians. This review provides information on the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension in OSA.

The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in OSA ranges from 17 to 53%. The underlying pathophysiology is complex and yet to be fully understood. Continuous positive airway pressure has been proven efficacious in the treatment of OSA-associated pulmonary hypertension.

There is still a lack of research in this field. We look forward to more well-designed studies to help us understand this disease entity better.

### Pathophysiology and new advances in pulmonary hypertension [^115oDoET]. BMJ Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

As well as the hallmarks of the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension, several other features occur in the lung, right ventricle, or both, such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, vascular fibrosis, and perturbation of signaling hubs. Mechanisms not dependent on transforming growth factor β, driven by oxidative stress (e.g. neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 9, NEDD9), have recently been found to promote endothelial fibrosis and pulmonary artery remodeling. These mechanisms are not described here but are highlighted in recent articles.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary hypertension, particularly in relation to echocardiography, the CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a complete echocardiographic assessment in patients with suspected PH. This includes the estimation of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure using the tricuspid regurgitation velocity jet, measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) size, the degree of inspiratory collapse, and assessment of "secondary" signs of PH. These signs include right atrial or right ventricular (RV) enlargement, RV hypertrophy, septal flattening, and RV dysfunction.

### Variables influencing heart rate [^116VpaZ9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

In both physiologic and pathological conditions, the instantaneous heart rate value is the result of a rather complex interplay. It constantly varies under the influence of a number of factors, which are categorized as nonmodifiable and modifiable. Pharmacologic blockade with beta-adrenergic antagonists and/or parasympathetic antagonists such as atropine has permitted the identification of the mechanisms of autonomic nervous regulation of heart rate in various physiologic and pathological conditions.

The analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability has yielded additional information on the autonomic control of circulation, which has proven to have diagnostic and prognostic implications in numerous clinically relevant conditions such as hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and predisposition to sudden cardiac death.

This article will summarize, based on available epidemiologic and clinical studies, the key variables influencing heart rate and heart rate variability in view of the known association between heart rate and cardiovascular disease.

### Mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressure is associated with a high risk of progression to pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Vi23A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of our study was all‐cause mortality, because for patients who died from other diseases, an elevated PAP might have aggravated their clinical conditions and worsened their prognoses. In 2018, Kolte et al. reported an increased risk of mortality in patients with mild PH, defined as a measured or calculated mPAP > 19 mm Hg by RHC or echocardiography, in a meta‐analysis. However, the studies included in the meta‐analysis used different criteria for the lower limit of a mildly elevated PAP, which varied from 19 to 21 mm Hg, leading to potential misclassification: participants with an mPAP of 19 to 20 mm Hg might be assigned to the normal PAP group in some studies but to the mild PH group in others, possibly reducing the credibility of the results. Moreover, echocardiography is useful for screening for PH but is not precise enough for an individual diagnosis of PH.

In our study, the mPAP of participants was measured by RHC, and the hemodynamic criteria for different groups were clear: mPAP ≤ 20 mm Hg for the normal PAP group, 20 mm Hg < mPAP < 25 mm Hg for the mildly elevated PAP group, and mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg for the PH group. The pooled HR for mortality in our study suggested increased mortality for the mildly elevated PAP group, consistent with the study by Kolte et al.

Subgroup analyses based on baseline diseases and comorbidities showed no statistically significant differences between subgroups, suggesting that increased mortality was a general phenomenon in the population with a mildly elevated PAP.

### Influence of upright versus supine position on resting and exercise hemodynamics in patients assessed for pulmonary hypertension [^112koK7i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The exercise hemodynamics in the upright position (main cohort) versus supine (historical cohort) at baseline and end-exercise, and the difference between upright and supine exercise, are shown overall and separated by groups in figures referenced in the study.

- **Exercise hemodynamics in upright versus supine position**:
	- Hemodynamic measures under exercise in the upright position (main cohort) and the supine position (historical cohort) are compared at baseline and end-exercise. Means and standard deviations of main hemodynamic measures, assessed by right heart catheterization, are presented for the upright position (main cohort, n = 217, black diamonds) and supine position (historical cohort, n = 270, white squares) at baseline, 50%, and 100% of individual end-exercise work rate. Parameters include mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), cardiac index, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) expressed in Wood units (WU). Significant differences were observed between groups (✱ p < 0.05) in adjusted regression analyses.

- **Comparison at end of exercise**:
	- Mean differences with 95% confidence intervals of the main hemodynamic parameters at the end of cycle exercise in the upright versus supine position, unadjusted and adjusted for baseline values and end-exercise work rate, were assessed.

The detailed figures and tables in the study provide comprehensive visual representation for these assessments.

### Pulmonary hypertension is associated with systemic arterial hypertension among patients with normal left ventricular diastolic function [^116V8vKw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The association of pulmonary and systemic arterial hypertension is believed to be mediated through hypertensive left heart disease. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is associated with systemic arterial hypertension among patients with apparently normal left ventricular diastolic function.

- **Methods and results**: Consecutive patients who had echocardiographic evaluations between 2007 and 2019 were enrolled. Patients with disease states known to be associated with PHT, including diastolic dysfunction, were excluded from the analysis. Estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, defined as > 40 mm Hg, was extracted for all patients from the echocardiographic reports. Multivariate logistic regression models were applied. The final study population included 25,916 patients with a median age of 59 years (interquartile range, 44–69), of whom 12,501 (48%) were men and 13,265 (51%) had systemic arterial hypertension. Compared with normotensive patients, hypertensive patients were 3.2 times more likely to have PHT (95% CI, 2.91–3.53; P < 0.001).

- **Multivariate model**: Adjusted for clinical and echocardiographic parameters known to be associated with PHT, it demonstrated that hypertensive patients are almost 3 times more likely to have PHT (95% CI, 2.45–3.15; P < 0.001). The association was significant in multiple subgroups but was more significant among women compared with men (odds ratio, 3.1 versus 2.4; P for interaction < 0.001).

Conclusions: PHT is associated with systemic arterial hypertension.

### Mildly elevated pulmonary arterial pressure is associated with a high risk of progression to pulmonary hypertension and increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143XQnT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The study faced several **limitations**: First, due to the nature of the meta‐analysis, we were unable to obtain individual participant data from each study, which might have influenced the precision of the pooled estimates and survival curves. Additionally, the criteria used for repeated RHC varied among studies, which could have led to an overestimation or underestimation of the incidence of progression to PH.

Moreover, the time intervals between the first and the second RHCs were not provided in most of the studies, making it impossible to pool the risk of progression to PH at the same time point. In addition, any retrospective study is subject to selection bias. Three of our included studies were retrospective, potentially affecting our results. Last but not least, the clinical phenotypes of participants varied among studies. Even though we conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, there might still be some effects.

### Right ventricular-vascular uncoupling predicts pulmonary hypertension in clinically diagnosed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116cyzkU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

According to the 2022 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines for pulmonary hypertension (PH), PH is diagnosed when the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is greater than 20 mm Hg. PH can be subclassified as precapillary PH when the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is ≤ 15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is greater than 2 Wood units (WU); isolated postcapillary PH (Ipc-PH) when the PCWP is greater than 15 mm Hg and PVR is ≤ 2 WU; and combined post and precapillary PH (Cpc-PH) when the PCWP is greater than 15 mm Hg and PVR is greater than 2 WU. Patients with PH with PCWP ≤ 15 mm Hg and PVR ≤ 2 WU were defined as unclassified.

In this study, 113 patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were clinically diagnosed, and 68 (60.18%) were found to have PH according to invasive hemodynamic studies. PCWP could not be obtained in 5 patients. Among the remaining 63 patients, most were classified as having Ipc-PH (60.32%, N = 38), followed by Cpc-PH (12.7%, N = 8), and precapillary PH (7.94%, N = 5). Twelve patients (19.05%) were classified as unclassified.

- **Hemodynamic classification**: The classification of clinically diagnosed patients with HFpEF was done according to the 2022 European Society of Cardiology PH guidelines:
	- **Prevalence of PH**: PH was diagnosed in 60.18% of the study population.
	- **Subtypes of PH**: The majority were classified as Ipc-PH, followed by Cpc-PH, and precapillary PH.

*Note*: Five patients with HFpEF could not be classified into PH subtypes due to unavailable data on PCWP and PVR. Unclassified patients had a mean PAP greater than 20 mm Hg with PCWP ≤ 15 mm Hg.

### Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction in left heart disease (group 2 pulmonary hypertension) [^117NbYh1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Group 2 pulmonary hypertension is most frequently caused by left heart disease, a heterogeneous set of disorders. These processes include left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction, and valvular (mitral and/or aortic) diseases. Left heart disease may cause passive backward transmission of pressure, leading to elevated left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures through various mechanisms. It is increasingly recognized that some patients may develop pulmonary arterial pressure disproportionate to what is expected. This phenomenon is believed to result from increases in vasomotor tone and/or vascular remodeling. Over time, patients may develop progressive right ventricular dysfunction, a marker for poor prognosis. This review explores the different characteristics of these conditions, including the incidence, pathophysiology, clinical implications, prognosis, and state of available medical therapies.

### Haemodynamic evaluation of pulmonary hypertension [^112Y5K96]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is characterised by the chronic elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), leading to right ventricular enlargement and hypertrophy. It may result from respiratory and cardiac diseases, with the most severe forms occurring in thromboembolic and primary pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is most often defined as a mean PAP > 25 mmHg at rest or > 30 mmHg during exercise, with pressure measured invasively using a pulmonary artery catheter. Doppler echocardiography allows for serial, noninvasive follow-up of PAPs and right heart function.

When the adaptive mechanisms of right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy cannot compensate for the haemodynamic burden, right heart failure occurs, which is associated with a poor prognosis. The haemodynamic profile is the major determinant of prognosis. In both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension, special attention must be paid to the assessment of the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI), right heart function, and pulmonary vasodilatory reserve. Recent studies have emphasized the prognostic values of exercise capacity (6-min walk test), right atrial pressure, stroke index, and vasodilator challenge responses, along with interest in new imaging techniques and natriuretic peptide determinations.

Overall, careful haemodynamic evaluation may optimise new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in pulmonary hypertension.

### Pathophysiology and new advances in pulmonary hypertension [^114CCBvw]. BMJ Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension covers a group of cardiopulmonary diseases defined at the Sixth World Symposium for Pulmonary Hypertension as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of > 20 mm Hg, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance > 3 Woods units (1 Woods unit = 80 dynes × sec/cm⁵). Pulmonary hypertension is clinically divided into five groups:

- **Pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)**: This category includes cases specifically categorized as pulmonary arterial hypertension.
- **Pulmonary hypertension caused by left heart disease (Group 2)**: This is the most prevalent form along with Group 3.
- **Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung diseases, hypoxia, or both (Group 3)**: This form is also prevalent worldwide.
- **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension caused by pulmonary artery obstructions (Group 4)**: These cases involve chronic clots in the lung vessels.
- **Pulmonary hypertension caused by unclear or multifactorial mechanisms (Group 5)**: Encompasses poorly understood or varied factors.

Pulmonary hypertension causes progressive pulmonary vascular remodeling. If left untreated, it ultimately leads to right ventricular failure and death. It is estimated that 1% of the global population and up to 10% of individuals over 65 years of age are affected by pulmonary hypertension.

Many conditions are complicated by pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular failure, or both, including HIV infection, chronic liver disease, connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease, and schistosomiasis.

### Mild pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ijwim]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated a continuum in clinical risk related to mean pulmonary artery pressure that begins at > 19 mm Hg, which is below the traditional threshold used to define pulmonary hypertension (PH) of 25 mm Hg. Because of the implications on patient diagnosis and prognosis, the generalizability and validity of these data need further confirmation.

- **Methods and results**: Databases were searched from inception through January 31, 2018, to identify studies comparing all-cause mortality between patients with mildly elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure. The analysis yielded a significant increase in the risk of mortality. There was evidence of publication bias; however, this did not influence the risk estimate (Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill adjusted risk ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–1.56).

- **Conclusions**: The risk of mortality increases with mildly elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure.

### Evaluation and management of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [^115dHHvh]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Symptoms are often nonspecific and can be seen in many other cardiopulmonary diseases. Most patients will report exertional dyspnea and progressive exercise intolerance. As right ventricular (RV) dysfunction ensues, other signs of right heart failure, such as abdominal distention, lower extremity swelling, chest pressure, exertional lightheadedness, and syncope, can develop. Hemoptysis may occur in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), likely related to the hypertrophied bronchial artery collateral circulation. Similarly, the physical examination findings can evolve as the disease progresses. Pulmonary flow murmurs, caused by turbulent blood flow through partially obstructed pulmonary arteries, can be heard in approximately 30% of patients.

Chest radiography often is unrevealing but may show enlarged central pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary function tests can show normal results in CTEPH, but mild restriction, reduced diffusion capacity, or both may be present. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can also provide insight into the causes of dyspnea. Patients with pulmonary vascular disease have a unique signature on cardiopulmonary exercise testing that can include reduced exercise capacity, stroke volume limitation, increased dead space ventilation, and ventilatory inefficiency. The role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing and exercise hemodynamics in the workup of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease without pulmonary hypertension (PH) may be growing.

Because of the widespread availability of transthoracic echocardiography, this commonly provides the initial evidence of possible PH resulting from objective assessments of RV size and function, as well as estimated right ventricular pressures.

### Influence of upright versus supine position on resting and exercise hemodynamics in patients assessed for pulmonary hypertension [^111jz2Hc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of the present work was to study the influence of body position on resting and exercise pulmonary hemodynamics in patients assessed for pulmonary hypertension (PH).

- **Methods and results**: Data from 483 patients with suspected PH undergoing right heart catheterization for clinical indications (62% women, age 61 ± 15 years, 246 precapillary PH, 48 postcapillary PH, 106 exercise PH, 83 no PH) were analyzed. A total of 213 patients (main cohort, years 2016–2018) were examined at rest in upright (45°) and supine position, such as under upright exercise. Upright exercise hemodynamics were compared with 270 patients (historical cohort) undergoing supine exercise with the same protocol. Upright versus supine resting data revealed a lower mean pulmonary artery pressure: 31 ± 14 versus 32 ± 13 mm Hg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure: 11 ± 4 versus 12 ± 5 mm Hg, and cardiac index: 2.9 ± 0.7 versus 3.1 ± 0.8 L/min per m². There was also higher pulmonary vascular resistance: 4.1 ± 3.1 versus 3.9 ± 2.8 Wood units, P < 0.001. Exercise data upright versus supine revealed higher work rates: 53 ± 26 versus 33 ± 22 watts. Adjusting for differences in work rate and baseline values showed higher end‐exercise mean pulmonary artery pressure: 52 ± 19 versus 45 ± 16 mm Hg, P = 0.001, similar pulmonary artery wedge pressure and cardiac index, higher pulmonary vascular resistance: 5.4 ± 3.7 versus 4.5 ± 3.4 Wood units, P = 0.002, and higher mean pulmonary artery pressure/cardiac output: 7.9 ± 4.7 versus 7.1 ± 4.1 Wood units, P = 0.001.

### Phenylephrine HCI [^115PRkga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients, families, or caregivers that the primary side effect of phenylephrine is hypertension and rarely, hypertensive crisis. Patients may experience bradycardia (slow heart rate), which in some cases may produce heart block or other cardiac arrhythmias, extra ventricular beats, myocardial ischemia in patients with underlying cardiac disease, and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) or rales. Common, less serious symptoms include the following:

- **Chest pain** and skin or tissue damage if the drug leaks out of the venous catheter into the surrounding tissue.
- **Additional symptoms**: headache, nervousness, tremor, numbness/tingling (paresthesias) in hands or feet, nausea, vomiting, excitability, dizziness, sweating, flushing.

### Anagrelide [^115fpz4P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are detailed in other sections of the labeling: cardiovascular toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], pulmonary hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], bleeding risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], and pulmonary toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Clinical studies in adult patients**: In three single-arm clinical studies, 942 patients [see Clinical Trials (14)] diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasms of varying etiology (essential thrombocythemia: 551; polycythemia vera: 117; other myeloproliferative neoplasms: 274) were exposed to anagrelide with a mean duration of approximately 65 weeks. Serious adverse reactions reported in these patients included congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, pericardial effusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and pancreatitis. Of the 942 patients treated with anagrelide, 161 (17%) were discontinued from the study because of adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory test results. The most common adverse reactions resulting in treatment discontinuation were headache, diarrhea, edema, palpitations, and abdominal pain.

### Exercise physiology and pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116GBV2a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The lungs are the only organs that receive the entire cardiac output with every stroke. The pulmonary circulation is typically a high-flow, low-resistance, low-pressure system that carries blood into the pulmonary microcirculation. In pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), vascular remodeling contributes to a sustained elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). This remodeling is largely characterized by vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, medial hypertrophy, and endothelial cell proliferation, resulting in lumen obliteration.

The loss of pulmonary arterial compliance and development of elevated PVR place an excessive burden on the right ventricle due to the increased workload necessary to overcome the downstream pressure. This ultimately leads to right-sided heart failure. The functional status of the pulmonary circulation and the levels of PVR and PAP ultimately determine the outcome of patients with PAH. Studying the pressure-flow relationships in the pulmonary vascular bed will provide an improved appreciation of the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension.

### Pulmonary hypertension with left heart disease: Prevalence, temporal shifts in etiologies and outcome [^111dEWdW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension has many causes. While it is conventionally thought that the most prevalent is left heart disease, little information about its proportion, causes, and implications on outcomes is available.

- **Methods**: Between 1993 and 2015, 12,115 of 66,949 (18%) first adult transthoracic echocardiograms were found to have a tricuspid incompetence gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, a surrogate for pulmonary hypertension. Left heart disease was identified in 8,306 cases (69%) and included valve malfunction in 4,115 (49%), left ventricular systolic dysfunction in 2,557 (31%), and diastolic dysfunction in 1,776 (21%). Patients with left heart disease, as compared to those without, were of similar age, fewer were females (50% vs. 63%, P < 0.0001), and they had a higher tricuspid incompetence gradient (median 48 mm Hg [interquartile range 43, 55] vs. 46 mm Hg [42, 54], P < 0.0001). In reviewing trends over 20 years, the relative proportions of systolic dysfunction decreased and diastolic dysfunction increased (P for trend < 0.001), while valve malfunction remained the most prevalent cause of pulmonary hypertension with left heart disease. Independent predictors of mortality were age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04–1.05; P < 0.0001), tricuspid incompetence gradient (HR 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02, P < 0.0001 per mm Hg increase), and female sex (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.91, P < 0.0001).

- **Results**: Overall, left heart disease was not an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99–1.09; p = 0.110). However, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and with combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction had higher risks of mortality.

### Sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114vo1tR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Hypoxia is an important influencer of pulmonary vasomotor tone and is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor. A relationship between hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids, upper airway obstruction causing hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale was first proposed in 1965. Pediatric pulmonary hypertension guidelines recommend that if primary causes of pulmonary hypertension, such as lung disease and congenital heart disease (CHD), are ruled out, children and adolescents should undergo a sleep study.

However, additional evidence suggests that the presence of pulmonary hypertension and the development of cor pulmonale may be less common in children and adolescents with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and, if present, may be secondary to other comorbid conditions. A retrospective study of 2020 pediatric patients diagnosed with OSA in the San Antonio Military Health System found that the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension was low among children and adolescents with OSA (e.g. 1.8%). This study also found that none of the patients with pulmonary hypertension had severe OSA and that all of the children with pulmonary hypertension had comorbid cardiac conditions.

If a child develops sleep-dependent airway obstruction, early recognition and appropriate treatment with improved respiratory control leads to improved ventilation and elimination of asphyxia during sleep and thus a lower risk for pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. The presence of cor pulmonale, once developed, can be reversed by surgical removal of obstructing airway tissue.

### Mild pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aj1aE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

The database search yielded 11,184 articles. After removing duplicates, 7,920 articles were screened at the title/abstract level, and 7,880 were excluded for various reasons, such as systematic reviews, case reports, studies that included only patients with known pulmonary hypertension (PH), and studies with no data on mortality. Forty full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.

- **Included studies**: Fifteen studies (eight right heart catheterization [RHC] and seven echocardiography) were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 12 were retrospective, one was prospective, one was ambispective, and one was a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial. These studies included a total of 16,482 patients, with 7,451 patients (45.2%) diagnosed with mild PH (6,037 diagnosed by RHC and 1,414 diagnosed by echocardiography) and 9,031 patients (56.4%) in the referent group. The mean duration of follow-up, weighted for sample size, was 5.2 years.

- **Patient population**: The studies encompassed a broad spectrum of the patient population at risk of PH, including those with cardiac, pulmonary, connective tissue, and hematologic diseases. The mean/median age of patients ranged from 41 to 77 years, with the proportion of women ranging from 3.5% to 90%.

These characteristics illustrate the diverse nature of the study population and underline the significance of mild pulmonary hypertension as a notable risk factor for increased mortality.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The clinical syndrome [^111LQqmp]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. In this review, we attempt to answer some important questions commonly asked by patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension pertaining to the disease, and aim to provide an explanation in terms of classification, diagnosis, pathophysiology, genetic causes, demographics, and prognostic factors. Furthermore, important molecular pathways that are central to the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension are reviewed, including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, endothelin-1, reactive oxygen species, and endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation.

### Electrocardiogram essentials: Bradycardia [^116uzyy5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic cases to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest.

This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases. Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, which will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and knowledge of treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

### Pulmonary hypertension: Diagnosis and treatment [^117YUKud]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a common, complex group of disorders characterized by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 25 mm Hg or greater. Patients often initially present to family physicians; however, because the symptoms are typically nonspecific or easily attributable to comorbid conditions, diagnosis can be challenging and requires a stepwise evaluation. There is limited evidence to support screening of asymptomatic individuals. Echocardiography is recommended as the initial step in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension. A definitive diagnosis cannot be made on echocardiographic abnormalities alone, and some patients require invasive evaluation by right heart catheterization.

For certain categories of pulmonary hypertension, particularly pulmonary arterial hypertension, treatment options are rapidly evolving, and early diagnosis and prompt referral to an expert center are critical to ensure the best prognosis. There are no directed therapies for many other categories of pulmonary hypertension; therefore, family physicians have a central role in managing contributing comorbidities. Other important considerations for patients with pulmonary hypertension include influenza and pneumonia immunizations, contraception counseling, preoperative assessment, and mental health.

### Pulmonary hypertension [^116yR6R1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension describes a group of disorders characterized by abnormally high pressures in the pulmonary arteries. Initial evaluation focuses on identifying the cause, which guides appropriate treatment. Pulmonary hypertension is often a feature of advanced common diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left heart disease, with treatment primarily targeting the underlying conditions. More rarely, pulmonary hypertension results from chronic organized thromboemboli or a primary vasculopathy. The former requires evaluation for surgical intervention, while the latter is treated with advanced medical therapies.

### Pathophysiology of acute pulmonary vasoconstriction [^111ETuNH]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs in a variety of clinical settings relevant for the cardiac intensivist, with postoperative pulmonary hypertension being perhaps the most common. Although it is known that significant postoperative pulmonary vasoconstriction generally occurs in patients with a pathologically remodeled pulmonary circulation, the details of its pathophysiology remain uncertain. This review describes the biochemistry of smooth muscle contractile activation and examines the possible role that endothelin-1 may play in postoperative pulmonary hypertension.

### Advances in the understanding and classification of pulmonary hypertension [^117KCy82]. Histopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension has a complex pathobiology. The term pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) encompasses a variety of pulmonary hypertensive diseases with different etiologies. These diseases may share a similar clinical presentation and, in some cases, respond similarly to medical treatment. More recent classifications have been based on etiology, functional data, and clinical presentation. However, morphometric studies have shown differences in the distribution and prevalence of vascular changes among cases of PAH with different etiologies.

Recent advances in understanding genetic and molecular mechanisms, along with detailed descriptions of the histopathological findings in PAH cases of varying etiologies, should contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between the various subsets of the disease, the prognostic implications, and possible treatment options.
