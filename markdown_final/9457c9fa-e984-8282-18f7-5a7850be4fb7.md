## Question

ICD 10 code for right knee pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for right knee pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the request is for a symptom code versus a disease-specific diagnosis. Then, I should verify which ICD-10 code best captures "pain in the knee" with right-sided laterality. Next, I will check whether any of the provided sources explicitly list the exact code. Finally, I will confirm the code format and ensure it aligns with ICD-10-CM conventions, including any encounter-type extensions if needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing. "Right knee pain" is a symptom rather than a disease diagnosis, so I should avoid jumping to osteoarthritis or meniscal codes unless the underlying condition is specified; instead, I need a generic joint pain code that allows laterality, which in ICD-10-CM is typically M25.5 Pain in joint, with subcodes for laterality and site [^11411p3W].

> Wait, let me verify the exact subcode. I initially thought M25.561 might be correct, but hold on, I should verify the digit pattern. The ICD-10-CM structure for M25.5 includes M25.55 for hip, M25.56 for knee, and then a final digit for laterality: 1 for right, 2 for left, and 9 for unspecified; so for right knee pain, the correct code is M25.561, not M25.5611, which would be too many digits for this category [^11411p3W].

> I need to check whether any of the supplied references explicitly state M25.561. The patellofemoral pain papers list M25.561 among codes used for patellofemoral disorders and knee pain presentations, which supports its appropriateness for "knee pain" even when a more specific diagnosis like patellofemoral pain is not yet established, reinforcing that M25.561 is the correct symptom code for right knee pain in the absence of a more specific etiology [^11411p3W].

> Hold on, I should verify the encounter extension. ICD-10-CM often requires a seventh character for encounter type (e.g. A initial, D subsequent, S sequela), but for diagnostic codes in the M25.5 series, many payers and systems accept the base code without the extension unless a specific encounter context is being captured; if an extension is required locally, it would be appended as M25.561A for initial encounter, M25.561D for subsequent, or M25.561S for sequela, so I should note that the base code is M25.561 and the extension depends on billing context [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider alternatives to ensure I'm not missing a more specific code. Codes like M17.x denote osteoarthritis, S83.x denote acute injuries, and M23.x denote internal derangements; none of these fit "unspecified right knee pain" unless the clinical evaluation supports that specific diagnosis, so M25.561 remains the most accurate and parsimonious choice for symptom-level coding in this scenario [^11411p3W] [^112Uqfsn] [^115jRMru].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for right knee pain is M25.561, with the understanding that an encounter-type extension (A, D, or S) may be added if required by local coding rules [^11411p3W].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for right knee pain is **M25.561** (Pain in right knee). This code is used for unspecified knee pain localized to the right knee, without identifying a specific underlying condition. If the pain is due to a known cause, such as osteoarthritis or a meniscal tear, a more specific diagnosis code should be used instead of M25.561 [^11411p3W] [^112Uqfsn].

## ICD-10-CM code for right knee pain

The ICD-10-CM code for right knee pain is **M25.561**, which specifically denotes pain in the right knee joint without further specification of the underlying cause [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding of right knee pain requires **clear clinical documentation** that specifies:

- **Anatomical location**: Right knee joint.
- **Laterality**: Right side.
- **Clinical findings**: Description of pain characteristics, severity, and functional impact.
- **Exclusion of specific underlying conditions**: Documentation should indicate whether the pain is unspecified or attributable to a specific diagnosis (e.g. osteoarthritis, meniscal tear, ligamentous injury) [^115jRMru] [^112Uqfsn].

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes for knee pain

While M25.561 is the general code for right knee pain, **alternative codes** may be used if the underlying condition is known:

| **Condition** | **ICD-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Osteoarthritis of right knee | M17.11 (primary), M17.12 (post-traumatic), M17.13 (secondary) [^notfound] |
| Meniscal tear of right knee | S83.241 (medial), S83.251 (lateral) [^notfound] |
| Anterior cruciate ligament sprain of right knee | S83.511 [^notfound] |
| Patellofemoral pain syndrome | M22.2X1 (right knee) [^notfound] |
| Rheumatoid arthritis of right knee | M06.861 [^notfound] |

## Clinical implications of ICD-10 coding

Accurate ICD-10 coding of right knee pain has **significant clinical implications**, including:

- **Treatment planning**: Guides appropriate management strategies, including pharmacologic, physical therapy, and surgical interventions [^115nQ3mU].
- **Reimbursement**: Ensures appropriate billing and reimbursement for healthcare services provided [^116FM4wi].
- **Epidemiological tracking**: Facilitates monitoring of disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, and healthcare resource utilization [^113ZKYPo].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite the importance of accurate coding, several **limitations and challenges** exist:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Often, the underlying cause of knee pain is unclear, leading to the use of unspecified codes such as M25.561 [^114ytV8D].
- **Variability in clinical documentation**: Inconsistent or incomplete documentation can hinder accurate coding and billing [^116FM4wi].
- **Complexity of ICD-10-CM**: The extensive number of codes and specificity requirements can lead to coding errors and increased administrative burden [^117Bg7Cb].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for right knee pain is **M25.561**, used for unspecified pain in the right knee joint. Accurate coding requires clear clinical documentation and consideration of underlying conditions. While this code facilitates treatment planning, reimbursement, and epidemiological tracking, challenges such as diagnostic uncertainty and documentation variability persist.

### Deep learning based phenotyping of medical images improves power for gene discovery of complex disease [^115Be38L]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Image-based phenotyping reveals twofold more cases compared with ICD-10 records

We next deployed our trained model on the remaining 28,725 images of knee DXA scans from the dataset. We considered an individual a "case" if our model predicted the individual to have knee OA on either the left or the right knee and a control otherwise, in line with the ICD-10 code M17 for knee OA. We then assessed how many cases were determined by our deep-learning-based binary classification of radiographic OA as compared to what already exists in the ICD-10 code M17. We found that after deploying the DL-binary classifier, we determined 1931 more cases compared with the ICD-10 code for knee OA (ICD-10 code M17 1085 cases, DL-binary 3016 cases) (Fig. 1a). To provide additional support for cases reported by DL-binary that were not already reported in the ICD-10 code M17, our clinical team examined 100 individuals manually and confirmed the presence of osteophytes, reduced joint space and in some cases subchondral sclerosis (Fig. 1b). As these alone may not be diagnostic, we also investigated associations with three self-reported measures of knee pain in the UKB: knee pain experienced in the past month (binary), knee pain for 3+ months (binary, and reflecting knee pain experienced over a long duration) and rating of knee pain in the past three months (scale from 0 to 10). We found that in individuals who were newly identified as cases, the rate of self-reported knee pain was significantly higher compared to control individuals (individuals not diagnosed by ICD-10 code M17 or by DL-binary) across all three measures we examined (recent pain reported as knee pain in the past month: 49.4% in cases and 27.2% in controls, chi-square statistic = 536.6, P = < 2.2 × 10 −16, chronic pain as determined by knee pain lasting 3 or more months: 80.4% in cases and 70.6% in controls, chi-square statistic = 28.29, P = 1.5 × 10 −7 and severity of pain reported in the last 3 months: mean rating of 3.33 in cases and 2.58 in controls, t test P = 1.45 × 10 −15). These results suggest that knee OA is likely underdiagnosed in the ICD-10 record and that our approach is capable of identifying additional true cases not already present in the EHR.

### All cause and disease specific mortality in patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis: population based cohort study [^1143nQsb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

In 1994–5, examined participants were asked about knee or hip pain with the following questions: "In the past 12 months, have you had pain in or around your left (right) knee (hip) on most days for one month or longer during the day (night)? (yes/no)". We considered participants to have pain if they reported pain during the day or night in at least one hip or knee. Participants were asked about their walking disability: "How difficult is it for you to go outdoors and walk down the road on your own? (not difficult/quite difficult/very difficult/impossible)". We considered patients to have disability if walking was described at least to be "quite difficult". Survival status of the 2703 participants and information on the cause of death up to 9 February 2009 came from the Office for National Statistics, London. The causes of death were registered and coded according to ICD-9 (international classification of diseases, 9th revision) or ICD-10. We recoded all to ICD-10 and considered death to be caused by the primary cause of death listed on the death certificate with ICD-10 codes of "I" for cardiovascular disease, "C" for cancer, "J" for respiratory disease, "K" for gastrointestinal disease, and "F01", "F03", or "R54" for dementia associated disease.

At baseline, participants had weight bearing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the knees and hip according to a standardised protocol. Details of the radiographic examinations are described elsewhere. We assigned Kellgren-Lawrence grades of global radiological severity on anteroposterior views by using a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = no features of osteoarthritis; 1 = minute osteophytes of doubtful significance; 2 = definite osteophytes, no definite joint space narrowing; 3 = definite joint space narrowing of a moderate degree; 4 = severe joint space impairment). We considered osteoarthritis to be present if a Kellgren-Lawrence grade of at least 1 was measured for at least one joint.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

 Prior Infection Codes at Knee Joint, Unnamed: 1, Unnamed: 2 "For revision KPRO procedures: If a total or partial revision KPRO is performed, determine if any of the ICD-10-PCS/CM diagnosis or procedure codes listed below were coded for that joint in the 90 days prior to and including the index KPRO revision. If any of these codes are recorded in the patient's record, select YES on the NHSN Procedure Event form for 'prior infection at index joint'. Note: The 'prior infection at index joint' variable only applies to revision KPRO procedures. Cases designated 'prior infection at index joint' = YES using ICD-10-PCS/CM diagnosis or procedure codes should be validated before the procedure is submitted to NHSN. This validation is necessary to ensure that the specified code in fact aligns with the index joint revision.

Methods

Overview

This manuscript was produced as part of the GBD Collaborator Network and in accordance with the GBD Protocol. The GBD Study adheres to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting statement. The methods presented here describe case definitions, data collection, and disease modelling methods. Studies done between 1980 and 2019 from all available global locations were identified using PubMed (appendix pp 3–4). These data were used to produce prevalence estimates for each osteoarthritis site between the years 1990 and 2020, across the age range (> 30 years), for male and female sexes, and for all GBD locations (appendix pp 1–2 presents a description of GBD super- regions, regions, and country groupings).

Input data sources used for osteoarthritis models are listed in the appendix (pp 38–51). Many of these studies are Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseasesand applied a common methodological framework to ascertain the scope of musculoskeletal conditions in more than 30 countries in the Americas, Africa, Australasia, and the Middle East.

Case definitions

The GBD reference case definition for both hip and knee osteoarthritis is symptomatic osteoarthritis radiographically confirmed as Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2–4 (definitive osteoarthritis). Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 indicates the presence of one defined osteophyte in the joint, grade 3 indicates the presence of several osteophytes and joint-space narrowing, and grade 4 indicates the same criteria as grade 3 in addition to bone deformity. Symptomatic osteoarthritis requires reported pain for at least 1 month out of the past 12 months.

The main sources of input data for the hip and knee osteoarthritis models were cross-sectional, population-based survey data from locations worldwide and state-level US insurance claims data captured by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 four-digit or five-digit codes starting with 715 specific to knee or hip, and ICD-10 codes M16 and M17. ICD-10 used the terminology osteoarthritis and replaced ICD-9 that used osteoarthrosis to reflect the recognition that inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.

### Osteoarthritis and the rule of halves [^116aXSee]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that the management of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis does not conform to a Rule of Halves. Our sensitivity analyses, using more stringent definitions that were still consistent with current recommendations, suggest that rates of detection, treatment, and control are, if anything, likely to be lower.

Our estimate of 55% detection is at the slightly higher end compared with previous studies. The inclusion of both self-reported recall and electronic health record as sources for consultation in the present study could partially explain the higher estimate. More fundamentally, 'detection' was defined simply as evidence of a general practitioner consultation and rates of treatment and control differed little depending on whether knee-related consultations were recorded under the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis or under non-specific symptom codes. Prioritising higher consultation rates and disease diagnosis may be less important than implementing timely, accurate 'detection' of patients' pain severity and functional limitation. These are currently poorly recordedbut consistently proposed quality of care indicators. Our unit is currently evaluating simple computer prompts and intensive training and support of practitioners to improve implementation.

Regarding the level of detail provided in the classification, the participants' ratings favoured the ICD-11 over the ICD-10 for every diagnostic code assessed. A majority (74.1%) judged the level of detail in the ICD-11 codes as "just right" vs 24.8% for the ICD-10. (χ² [3, N = 2515] = 1073.01, P < 0.001). Most participants regarded the level of detail in ICD-10 (68.7%) as "too low" (Fig. 3). Some lines in ICD-11 were perceived as allowing too little coding details (for a line-by-line analysis cf S5); > 30% regarded the codes for chronic nonspecific back pain, postherniotomy and postmastectomy pain, and painful diabetic neuropathy and central poststroke pain as too broad.

### Long-term pain management and health care resource use among an employed population in Japan with knee osteoarthritis combined with low back pain [^1176Tk71]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Study scheme.

This study included a cohort of patients with KOA only without LBP (KOA-noLBP) and a cohort of patients with KOA plus LBP (KOA+LBP). Definitions for these cohorts are as follows:

KOA+LBP cohort: Patients were included in this cohort if they had at least one diagnosis of LBP in the baseline period or in the first 12 months after the index date (inclusive of the index date). ICD-10-CM codes for LBP are presented in the Supplementary Data.
KOA-noLBP cohort: Patients were included in this cohort if they did not have any diagnosis of LBP (ICD-10-CM codes M40, M41, M43, M47, M48, M51, M53, and M54) in the baseline and follow-up periods.

Because the patient data used in this study were anonymized, the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan) were not applicable to this study. This study was reviewed by RTI International's Institutional Review Board and was granted a waiver from full review as the data were de-identified, retrospective, and collected for billing purposes.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^111V3LKf]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain [^117N25C1]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic musculoskeletal pain is defined as chronic pain arising from musculoskeletal structures such as bones or joints. Although comprising the most prevalent set of chronic pain conditions, it was not represented appropriately in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which was organized mainly according to anatomical sites, was strongly focused on musculoskeletal disease or local damage, and did not consider the underlying mechanisms of pain. The new ICD-11 classification introduces the concept of chronic primary and secondary musculoskeletal pain, and integrates the biomedical axis with the psychological and social axes that comprise the complex experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is a condition in its own right, not better accounted for by a specific classified disease. Chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain is a symptom that arises from an underlying disease classified elsewhere. Such secondary musculoskeletal pain originates in persistent nociception in musculoskeletal structures from local or systemic etiologies, or it may be related to deep somatic lesions. It can be caused by inflammation, by structural changes, or by biomechanical consequences of diseases of the nervous system. It is intended that this new classification will facilitate access to patient-centered multimodal pain management and promote research through more accurate epidemiological analyses.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Pain as a disease: an overview [^111v7tL4]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Today, it is acknowledged that there is an essential difference between pain as a symptom and chronic pain. The scientific community has also recognized the specificity of this condition on the basis of the identification of several associated pathologic modifications, but the recognition of pain as a disease in its own right remains debated, principally owing to the lack of an ultimate scientific description of this pathologic condition. Nevertheless, we believe that the acknowledgment of pain as a disease, and its clear definition and classification, should be intensively pursued. In 2015, the IASP Task Force for the classification of chronic pain proposed a new categorization of pathologic pain conditions for the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). This work aims at filling the gap in the World Health Organization's ICD by presenting a "classification system that is applicable in primary care and in clinical settings for specialized pain management". As remarked by the authors, "the lack of adequate coding in the ICD makes the acquisition of accurate epidemiological data related to chronic pain difficult, prevents adequate billing for health care expenses related to pain treatment, and hinders the development and implementation of new therapies". Thus, the lack of a proper definition of this condition hampers adequate investigations, which could lead to a more accurate estimation of the burden of pathologic pain. This situation entails the denial of the pain sufferers' right to be recognized as ill and even affects their ability to identify themselves as illand to receive adequate health care support; this would also entail a reduction of the number of inappropriate diagnostic procedures aimed at finding "the cause of pain". Moreover, the fact that today pain is not recognized as a public health care priorityhinders scientific research on pain, including its risk factors and comorbidities.

Thus, a vicious circle is created: without a definition of pain as a disease, despite the scientific knowledge already available on the pathologic mechanisms underlying this condition and the socioeconomic burden of chronic pain, pain does not gain the attention it deserves and is not adequately studied in order to consolidate definitively its recognition as a disease in its own right. Therefore, we believe that proposals aimed at improving the definition of pain as a disease which might result in a primary pain diagnosis and an adequate classification of its clinical forms should be embraced and encouraged.

To assess usage of ICD-10 across specialties, clinician subgroups were assessed for number of higher-usage codes: 9 codes (2.1%) for primary care, 8 (2.1%) for rheumatology, 2 (0.5%) for orthopedics, and 6 (1.4%) for other specialties. There were no differences between primary care physicians, rheumatologists, and other physicians, whereas orthopedists used significantly fewer codes.

2.3. Data analysis

2.3.1. Line coding

For the ICD-10 and the ICD-11, the percentage of correct codes for each diagnosis and the percentage of difficulties with assigning the code were computed. The variable for the reported ambiguity of assigning the diagnosis was transformed into a binary variable (yes or no) and the frequencies determined. The frequencies of correctly assigned diagnoses, cases without difficulties, and cases without ambiguity were compared between ICD-10 and ICD-11 with the McNemar test. The respective frequencies for specificity (too little detail, too much detail, or just right) were calculated and compared between ICD-10 and ICD-11 with the McNemar–Bowker test. We also compared the groups of chronic primary and chronic secondary pain regarding correctly assigned diagnoses, difficulties, ambiguity, and specificity.

2.3.2. Case coding

The percentage of correct codes per pain diagnosis was calculated, and the mean judgements of the 3 facets of clinical utility for each pain diagnosis were computed. The correct selection of the main condition according to the morbidity rules was analysed between the rules by the χ² test.

2.3.3. Evaluation

Frequencies for coverage, ease of use, and level of detail were calculated. The textboxes were scrutinized for relevant comments and coded whether the participant reported gaps (no comment or no gap or gap) or redundancies (no comment or no redundancy or redundancy) and frequencies reported.

### Deep learning based phenotyping of medical images improves power for gene discovery of complex disease [^112eHprz]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We evaluated the performance of the segmentation model in several ways. First, the set accuracy, the correspondence between labeled data and annotation of the trained model on validation data, was 0.99. Second, the correlation between measurements taken between the right and left leg was 0.82 (Fig. 2c). Third, the correlation between images taken of the same person across two imaging visits was 0.88, despite changes in image resolution, scanner, technician, and imaging position, demonstrating that our mJSW phenotype measurement process is fairly consistent across biological replicates (Fig. 2d). We do not expect to see 100% concordance across these replicates as joint space width often can change in a period of more than 2 years particularly in older individuals, in part due to possible knee joint cartilage degeneration. Fourth, we examined the relationship between the mJSW phenotype and OA status, both using the DL-binary model and the ICD-10 code M17 case–control data (Fig. 2e). As expected, the mJSW phenotype was significantly lower in cases compared to controls regardless of which case annotation we used (t test P < 2.2 × 10 −16, and P < 2.2 × 10 −16 for DL-binary and ICD-10 code M17, respectively). Finally, we examined the relationships between the mJSW phenotype and age — which is known to be highly associated with knee degeneration (Fig. 2f). Again, as expected, we found that the mJSW phenotype decreased significantly with age (linear regression, beta = −0.028, P < 2.2 × 10 −16).

### Clinical factors and expenditures associated with ICD-9-CM coded trauma for the U.S. population: a nationally representative study [^111oqhwE]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is a lack of information on annual healthcare expenditures both per person and for the U.S. population associated with trauma, as identified by International Classification of Disease Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes.

Methods

This paper employed a two-part model to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted annual per individual expenditures and population burden of trauma exposure for the U.S. population, using a nationally representative survey of medical care expenditures. In addition, we estimated a logit model to examine the demographic and comorbidity factors associated with the likelihood of experiencing trauma.

Results

Approximately 18.2% of U.S. adults were found to have trauma exposure during the survey year of 2011. The most frequent trauma ICD-9-CM code was injury not elsewhere classified/not otherwise specified. Adjusted likelihood of trauma was higher among individuals under the age of 65; males; non-Hispanic whites; nonmarried or never married; and individuals living with comorbidities of stroke, joint pain, arthritis, and asthma. The most expensive of the top 10 ICD-9-CM trauma codes was dislocation of the knee. Significant differences in expenditure categories were found for office-based, outpatient, emergency department (ED), dental, and other medical care. After adjustment for comorbidities and demographics, the adjusted per-person burden of trauma was estimated to be $1,689 (95% confidence interval [CI] = $1,006 to $2,372), with an incremental burden on the U.S. population of $60.8 billion per year.

Conclusions

Trauma results in a significant healthcare expenditure burden, both per person and on the U.S.

Population

Clinicians should be aware that individuals in the U.S. population with certain comorbidities such as stroke, joint pain, arthritis, and asthma are more likely to have trauma and that differences exist in expenditures for office-based, outpatient, dental, and the ED.

### How accurate is ICD-10 coding for revision total knee arthroplasty? [^1163Q6HY]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) came into effect in October 2015. The new procedural codes (ICD-10-PCS) were designed to specify granular aspects of the procedure, including laterality and revised components. This specificity could improve data collection in institutional databases, large registries, and administrative claims data. Given these possible applications, this study's purpose was to assess the accuracy of ICD-10-PCS coding for revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA).

Methods

This multicenter retrospective analysis utilized the rTKA databases at four academic medical centers for all aseptic rTKAs between October 1, 2015 and July 3, 2019. Operative reports were reviewed to determine laterality and revised components (tibial, femoral, liner, and patellar component), which were then compared with the ICD-10-PCS codes associated with the billing records. Proper coding required both component removal and replacement codes. The correct series of removal and replacement codes was determined using the American Joint Replacement Registry's guidelines.

Results

In total, 1906 rTKAs were examined, and 98.0% had at least one proper ICD-10-PCS code, indicating an rTKA had occurred. Coding for components replaced was correct in 76.3% of cases. When examining both removal and replacement codes, accuracy dropped to 57.0%.

Conclusion

Nearly 25% of rTKA procedures were incorrectly coded for replaced components, and over 40% were incorrectly coded for removed and replaced components. ICD-10-PCS codes can accurately identify that an rTKA has occurred; however, the inaccuracy in identifying which specific components were revised should prompt further evaluation of the coding process before utilizing ICD-10-PCS codes to report granular rTKA data.

3. Results

3.1. Line coding

In total, the participants rated 2576 lines. They assigned more codes correctly using the ICD-11 (63.3%) than the ICD-10 (42.1%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 229.23, P < 0.001), encountered fewer difficulties assigning ICD-11 diagnoses (no difficulty 86.6%) than ICD-10 diagnoses (47.2%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 863.81, P < 0.001), and perceived fewer cases of ambiguity for the ICD-11 (no ambiguity: 75.5%) than for the ICD-10 (29.1%) (χ² [1, N = 2512] = 1003.84, P < 0.001).

Six of the lines referred to what is called "chronic primary pain" in the ICD-11 and 12 referred to chronic secondary pain. The diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly in the ICD-11 between chronic primary (62.2%) and secondary pain syndromes (63,8%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.64, P > 0.4) (Fig. 1). In the ICD-10, however, coding of chronic secondary pain was poor (27.2%) while existing chronic primary pain conditions were recognized correctly (70.8%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 722.51, P < 0.001). Regarding the perceived difficulty of the code assignment, primary and secondary pain did not differ in the ICD-11 (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.004, P > 0.9), but did so in ICD-10 (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 58.87, P < 0.001), with secondary pain being more difficult (refer to Fig. 1 for percentages). A parallel picture is revealed for ambiguity of code assignment. In the ICD-11, no difference between primary and secondary pain was observed (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.09, P > 0.7), but in the ICD-10, more ambiguity was reported for code assignments for secondary pain (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 49.14, P < 0.001).

4. Discussion

With this study, we supply comprehensive data of an evaluative field test demonstrating that the new chronic pain diagnoses conform to the WHO requirements for ICD-11 coding.

In the line coding, the new ICD-11 classification was tested against the established system of the ICD-10 and outperformed it in almost every way: With the ICD-11, coding was more accurate, easier, and less ambiguous to use than the ICD-10. In particular, chronic secondary pain was difficult to code in the ICD-10 (72.8% false). The lack of unique codes for these conditions in the ICD-10 required the co-selection of unspecific codes (R52) to indicate the presence of chronic pain. Most participants failed to use this code combination and offered a broad variety of codes and combinations instead, demonstrating that reliable coding of chronic pain conditions with the ICD-10 is difficult. This difficulty is reflected by the fact that these codes are rarely used in healthcare statistics. Here, the ICD-11 fared significantly better.

### Diagnostic discordance: we cannot agree when to call knee pain' osteoarthritis' [^1177xoQF]. Family Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Joint pain is common in community-dwelling older adults. Osteoarthritis is the most likely cause and the most common diagnosis made in this age group by GPs. However, the level of agreement between patients and their GPs in this diagnosis is questionable and may have important implications for clinical care.

Objectives

Our aim was to determine the level of agreement between GP diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis and patients' own attribution of osteoarthritis in older adults consulting their GP with knee pain.

Methods

Forty-five patients aged ≥ 50 years were recruited retrospectively from consecutive knee pain attenders at two general practices in North Staffordshire. All patients were assessed by trained research physiotherapists using standardized assessment procedures. Patients' attribution was assessed by the open-ended question "What do you think is the matter with your knee now?" Blind to the findings of the assessment, a researcher extracted the most recent knee-related Read code recorded by the patient's GP from the medical records to determine GP diagnosis. The physiotherapists also classified patients as osteoarthritis or non-osteoarthritis according to the American College of Rheumatology's clinical classification criteria.

Results

Agreement between GP diagnosis of 'knee osteoarthritis' or 'osteoarthritis NOS' and patient diagnostic attribution of knee 'arthritis' or 'osteoarthritis' was poor [kappa = -0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.32 to 0.26]. Neither the GP diagnosis nor the patient diagnostic attribution was strongly related to clinical classification using standard criteria (kappa = 0.28; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.56; and kappa = -0.39; 95% CI -0.66 to -0.13, respectively).

Conclusions

The level of agreement between a GP diagnostic code of osteoarthritis and patients' use of the term '(osteo)arthritis' is no greater than would be expected by chance alone. Discordance may be high in the use of the label osteoarthritis but is not direct evidence of a lack of shared understanding of this condition.

2.2.2. Case coding

The case coding examined the ICD-11 alone. The main objective was testing the morbidity rule application concerning the chronic pain diagnoses. For this purpose, 12 short case vignettes (mean length = 78 words, range: 50–113 words) were prepared. Each vignette featured 2 or more health conditions, at least one of which was a chronic pain condition. The vignette stated a main condition and an "other condition", without listing the ICD-11 codes. (Table 1, vignette texts, cf supplementary information S2, available at).

Table 1
Chronic pain and other conditions featured in the vignettes in the case coding.

In 10 of the vignettes, the main condition was specified correctly according to the morbidity rules; in 2 of the vignettes, the rules had been misapplied intentionally to test the participants' application of the rules in connection with chronic pain. In a first step, the participants had to provide the appropriate ICD-11 codes for each condition. In a second step, they had to judge whether the main condition was identified correctly (yes or no). For each diagnosis, we recorded whether they met with any difficulty in finding the code. At the end of each vignette, the participants rated the clinical utility of the new chronic pain code (0 = not at all to 5 = very useful) according to 3 questions: How useful is this classification (1) to describe this case in communications to colleagues (communication), (2) in facilitating the management of patients (management), and (3) for the collection of data, eg, for clinical or population databases (documentation)?

2.2.3. General evaluation

After the participant had completed rating the lines or cases, an additional questionnaire became available in which the participant rated the overall coverage of the conditions in the ICD-11 (5 = very good or 1 = very poor), the level of detail (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed), and the ease of use (5 = very easy or 1 = very difficult). In addition, textboxes were provided for the participants to mention whether they perceived gaps and redundancies.

### Ipsilateral lower extremity joint involvement increases the risk of poor pain and function outcomes after hip or knee arthroplasty [^112ohmyL]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The association of ipsilateral knee/hip involvement with poor pain and function outcomes noted in primary THA/TKA was also noted in patients who underwent revision THA/TKA. In particular, the strength of association after revision THA/TKA was similar to that noted in patients undergoing primary THA/TKA. In addition, we noticed little or no attenuation of the association noted at 2-year follow-up at the longer 5-year follow-up. These findings support the robustness of this association.

The study findings must be interpreted considering study strengths and limitations. Study strengths include a large cohort, prospective standardized data collection by dedicated clinical registry staff, adjustment for important covariates and confounders, and the robustness of findings across several sensitivity analyses. Our study also has several limitations, however. Non-response and referral bias may limit our ability to generalize these findings to other populations. However, patient demographics are similar to previously published studies of primary and revision THA and TKA. The response rate at 2 years is similar to the mean response rate of 60%, typical for large surveys of this size. The response rate at 5 years at 48% is low, and therefore these findings should be interpreted with caution. In general, non-responders were more likely to be younger, obese, higher comorbidity, higher ASA class and live at a greater distance from the Mayo Clinic, characteristics associated with poorer pain and/or functional outcomes after THA/TKA. However, it is unlikely that the association of ipsilateral joint involvement with index THA/TKA pain and function outcomes differed by these characteristics, in absence of any such published data. Therefore, the direction of impact of non-response bias on our findings is unclear.

The joint registry does not provide detailed data on disease pathology in all other joints, and may miss interval arthroplasty in the ipsilateral joint if performed at another institution and this was not reported by the patient in their mailed survey response or telephone interview. Therefore, we are unable to comment on the underlying disease/pathophysiology responsible for ipsilateral joint involvement. Another limitation is that diagnoses of comorbidities were based on the presence of respective ICD-9 codes, making underdiagnosis and misclassification bias likely. However, misclassification would bias our findings towards null; therefore our estimates are conservative. We made an ' a priori ' decision to combine moderate and severe categories based on our clinical judgment of what would be considered suboptimal by operating surgeons, but also to have enough events to analyze predictors of poor outcomes. Despite our efforts to include several important variables, residual confounding is possible.

Introduction

In the UK, the initial presentation and management of osteoarthritis (OA) most commonly occurs within primary care. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends application of a working diagnosis of OA in adults 45 years and older presenting with persistent joint pain, not associated with lasting morning stiffness, but excluding those with atypical features of OA. EULAR guidelines recommend making a diagnosis of knee OA based on knowledge of the underlying population prevalence and the presence of patient risk factors for OA, their symptoms, and physical examination. Whilst both guidelines infer that an OA diagnosis can normally be made without recourse to further investigation, there are likely to be instances of diagnostic uncertainty.

In primary care, health-related information including diagnosis is typically electronically recorded and coded. In the UK the most common system used is the Read code classificationwhich allows health care professionals to label a presenting complaint with a symptom or disease-based Read code. Thus, OA-related symptoms may be categorised as joint pain codes rather than as an OA diagnosis. A study assessing the completeness of recorded diagnoses in primary care found a low sensitivity of 63% for OA, with a major reason being use of alternative codes, such as knee pain, by clinicians. Even accounting for patients not seeking health care, there appears to be a wide discrepancy between the estimates of self-reported symptomatic OA and the prevalence of primary care recorded OA diagnosis. In the UK, it has been estimated that 53% of older adults report chronic joint pain, and 22% severe disabling pain, but only 13% of older adults in the same geographical region received an OA diagnosis over a 7 year period. A study in Sweden found only 63% of those with symptomatic knee OA had a recorded knee OA diagnosis within an 8 year period. A prior study of ours showed there may be 10 years between recording of initial symptoms of knee pain and a recorded OA diagnosis in primary care. The threshold for diagnosing and subsequently coding OA is likely to be variable, dependent on, for example, the individual practitioner's personal preference in coding, perceived reaction of the patient to receiving an OA diagnosis, or extent of uncertainty in diagnosis and wish for further confirmation such as radiographic evidence.

Serious conditions and inconsistent presentations — clinicians should recognize signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for them, and immediately initiate referral when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected; clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications associated with serious pathological conditions or psychosocial factors when patients' limitations are inconsistent with this guideline or when symptoms are not resolving with impairment-focused interventions.

### Classification of patients with osteoarthritis through clusters of comorbidities using 633 330 individuals from Spain [^116HCgxb]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design, setting and data sources

We conducted a population-based cohort study using the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) healthcare database, which collects de-identified patient records from 279 primary care providers in Catalonia, Spain, covering around 80% of the Catalan population, or 5.8 million people. Diagnosis of conditions in the primary care system in Catalonia, and therefore in SIDAP data as well, are based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10 codes), and has been internationally validated. This study forms part of the Comorbidities in Osteoarthritis (ComOA) project, the protocol for which has been published previously.

Participants and study size

We included all participants aged ≥ 18 years with at least one physician-recorded diagnosis of OA of the hip, knee, ankle/foot, wrist/hand, general or 'unspecified' site between 1 January 2006 and 31 June 2020, using ICD-10 codes. The index date (date of their first incidence diagnosis of OA) was identified for each participant, and participants were followed from this date. Participants were excluded if they did not have at least one year of data recorded prior to their index date, or if they had a specific non-OA diagnosis (soft-tissue disorders, other bone/cartilage diseases) at the same joint in the 12 months prior to or after the index OA/joint pain date.

Outcomes

The outcomes of interest were (i) clusters of comorbidities in people with OA and (ii) risk of mortality in 10 years. For mortality follow-up: individuals were followed from the date of OA diagnosis until the earliest of (i) date of death or (ii) date of transfer out of catchment area or end-date of data availability in SIDIAP.

### Vitamin D, chronic pain, and depression: linear and non-linear mendelian randomization analyses [^111vG8rB]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

We considered four outcomes: fibromyalgia, clinical fatigue, chronic widespread pain, and probable lifetime major depression.

Fibromyalgia was defined as ICD-9 code 729.1, ICD-10 code M79.7, or self-reported code (field 20002) 1542. Clinical fatigue was defined as ICD-9 code 780.7, ICD-10 code R53, or self-reported code 1482. Chronic widespread pain was defined as answering yes to the four questions "Have you had pain for more than 3 months?" relating to the neck or shoulder (field 3404), back (field 3571), hip (field 3414), and knees (field 3773).

Probable lifetime major depression was defined as the presence of four criteria: 1) answering yes to the question "Looking back over your life, have you ever had a time when you were feeling depressed or down for at least a whole week?" or "Have you ever had a time when you were uninterested in things or unable to enjoy the things you used to for at least a whole week?", 2) answering 2 weeks or more to the question "How many weeks was the longest period when you were feeling depressed or down?", 3) answering 2 or more to the question "How many periods have you had when you were feeling depressed or down for at least a whole week?", 4) answering yes to the question "Have you ever seen a general practitioner for nerves, anxiety, tension or depression?" or "Have you ever seen a psychiatrist for nerves, anxiety, tension or depression?".

### Chronic pain as a symptom or a disease: the IASP classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^11689P8b]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is a major source of suffering. It interferes with daily functioning and often is accompanied by distress. Yet, in the International Classification of Diseases, chronic pain diagnoses are not represented systematically. The lack of appropriate codes renders accurate epidemiological investigations difficult and impedes health policy decisions regarding chronic pain such as adequate financing of access to multimodal pain management. In cooperation with the WHO, an IASP Working Group has developed a classification system that is applicable in a wide range of contexts, including pain medicine, primary care, and low-resource environments. Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months. In chronic pain syndromes, pain can be the sole or a leading complaint and requires special treatment and care. In conditions such as fibromyalgia or nonspecific low-back pain, chronic pain may be conceived as a disease in its own right; in our proposal, we call this subgroup "chronic primary pain". In 6 other subgroups, pain is secondary to an underlying disease: chronic cancer-related pain, chronic neuropathic pain, chronic secondary visceral pain, chronic posttraumatic and postsurgical pain, chronic secondary headache and orofacial pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain. These conditions are summarized as "chronic secondary pain" where pain may at least initially be conceived as a symptom. Implementation of these codes in the upcoming 11th edition of International Classification of Diseases will lead to improved classification and diagnostic coding, thereby advancing the recognition of chronic pain as a health condition in its own right.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^117JU1Un]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

### Ipsilateral lower extremity joint involvement increases the risk of poor pain and function outcomes after hip or knee arthroplasty [^1143UjG3]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Covariates of interest

These were selected based on documented (or suspected) association with arthroplasty outcomes and included: (a) patient characteristics: age and gender (unmodifiable) and body mass index (BMI) and comorbidity (modifiable); (b) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score; (c) operative diagnosis; (d) preoperative moderate to severe pain and function; (e) implant fixation; (f) psychological morbidity: depression and anxiety; and (g) health care access: distance from the medical center.

These variables were categorized as follows: (1) age: categorized as previously into ≤ 60, 61 to 70, 71 to 80 and > 80; (2) gender (female vs. male); (3) BMI: categorized based on World Health Organization (WHO) classification into ≤ 25, 25.1 to 29.9, 30 to 34.9, 35 to 39.9 and ≥ 40; (4) comorbidity: continuous variable (5-point increase) measured by Deyo-Charlson score, a validated comorbidity measure and the most commonly used comorbidity measure consisting of a weighted scale of 17 comorbidities (including cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic disease, diabetes, cancer, AIDS and so on), expressed as a summative score where a higher score indicates more comorbidity; (5) ASA physical status score: a validated measure of perioperative and postoperative outcomes categorized as class I to II vs. III to IV; (6) operative diagnosis: categorized as osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis) or other for primary TKA; osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis), avascular necrosis or other for primary THA; loosening/wear/osteolysis, dislocation/fracture/instability/non-union, and failed prior arthroplasty/infection for both revision TKA and revision THA; (7) preoperative moderate to severe pain and function: assessed by similar questions as detailed above (under outcomes of interest) preoperatively (analyses for pain outcomes were adjusted for preoperative pain and function outcomes (activity limitation) for preoperative function); (8) implant fixation: cemented, hybrid or uncemented, only for primary THA and primary TKA; (9) depression: presence or absence of International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, common modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for depression preoperatively; (10) anxiety: presence or absence of ICD-9-CM code for anxiety preoperatively; and (11) distance from the medical center: < 100, 100 to 500 and > 500 miles/overseas: distance from the medical center was included, since Mayo Clinic provides TKA/THA to local residents and also a serves as a referral center for patients traveling from afar who may have different disease severity and expectations, and both can impact pain and function outcomes.

### Knee pain and mobility impairments: meniscal and articular cartilage lesions [^115mCBM3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Meniscal and articular cartilage lesions — methods of guideline development explain that the Orthopaedic Section, APTA appointed content experts as developers and authors and tasked them to use International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) terminology to identify impairments that could categorize patients into mutually exclusive impairment patterns to guide interventions and to serve as measures of change over an episode of care, and to summarize the supporting evidence for these classifications and interventions; the developers acknowledged that an evidence search limited to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems terminology would be insufficient and therefore directed experts to also search literature related to classification, outcome measures, and intervention strategies.

### Global, regional, and national burden of osteoarthritis, 1990–2020 and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^116aJUWY]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Two new osteoarthritis categories were added in GBD 2019, comprising hand osteoarthritis and a residual category of other osteoarthritis sites (eg, shoulder and elbow). Cases of osteoarthritis affecting the cervical spine, lumbar spine, or both sites were excluded from the 'other osteoarthritis' category, because pain in these sites is captured by the neck pain and lower back pain disease categories in the GBD Study. Existing osteoarthritis input data from previous GBD hip and knee modelling were rereviewed for mention of osteoarthritis present in the hand or other joints. In addition, we did a broad systematic review of epidemiological studies of osteoarthritis prevalence published in English between 1980 and end of 2019 in PubMed (appendix p 3).

Eight diagnostic criteria, six hand joints, and more than 20 combinations of different hand joints were reported in the literature. Affected hand joints were either evaluated independently, in some explicit combination (eg, the distal interphalangeal joints [DIP] and proximal interphalangeal joints [PIP]), or as generalised osteoarthritis, wherein a case had osteoarthritis present in the DIP, PIP, and first carpometacarpal joints (CMC) specifically. Other sources reported estimates of hand osteoarthritis present in any single joint or present in several joints without specifying joint type. We classified the case definitions of hand osteoarthritis in terms of the two dimensions of diagnostic criteria (presence of symptoms and diagnosis with or without radiography) and four categories of affected sites (appendix p 5). Consistent with hip and knee osteoarthritis modelling, symptomatic, radiographically confirmed osteoarthritis in any single joint of the hand was used as the reference case definition for hand osteoarthritis, to which alternative case definitions present in the literature were adjusted.

Given the paucity of survey data on other osteoarthritis joint sites, US insurance claims data from 2000 to 2016 constituted the sole source of other osteoarthritis data. Claims data cases of other osteoarthritis were identified using codes under ICD-10 M19 for cases of other and unspecified osteoarthritis that were not used in estimation of osteoarthritis hip, knee, or hand.

### Hospital costs in relation to body-mass index in 1. 1 million women in england: a prospective cohort study [^113jLcnZ]. The Lancet: Public Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Costs of hospital inpatient and day-case care

Each HES episode (defined as care under a particular consultant) was allocated to a health-care resource group, the classification system used to describe hospital activity in the UK. The associated costs depend primarily on any procedures done, diagnoses, hospital admission type (day-case, elective, or non-elective inpatient care), length of stay (when it exceeds a threshold specific to the health-care resource group and admission type), and patient characteristics such as age, and were calculated with 2011–12 NHS reference costs. We calculated the cost of each hospital admission (in UK 2012 prices) as the sum of the costs of all episodes within the admission. Episodes were regarded as part of the same admission if they had the same admission date, had overlapping durations, or if the admission date for one episode was the same as the discharge date for another. The costs do not include outpatient attendances or costs for prescription drugs individuals were taking outside of their hospital stay.

Categories of health conditions

Each hospital admission was allocated to an ICD-10 chapter on the basis of the recorded primary diagnosis of the admission episode. ICD-10 chapters with less than 10 000 hospital admissions during the follow-up period were combined into a category called other. ICD-10 chapter XIX (injury, poisoning, and some other consequences of external causes) was subdivided into fractures (ICD-10: S02, S12, S22, S32, S42, S52, S62, S72, S82, S92, T02), medical and surgical complications (ICD-10: T80–T88), and the remainder, which was incorporated into the existing other category. ICD-10 chapter XIII (musculoskeletal conditions) was subdivided for some analyses into arthropathies (ICD-10: M00–M25), dorsopathies (ICD-10: M40–M54), soft tissue disorders (ICD-10: M60–M79), and the remainder. Arthropathies were further subdivided into knee replacements (ICD-10: M17) and hip replacements (ICD-10: M16), identified using ICD-10 and OPCS code combinations specified by the National Joint Registry; other arthrosis (ICD-10: M15–M19 excluding knee and hip replacements with arthrosis); rheumatoid arthritis (ICD-10: M05–M06); and other arthropathies.

### Pain can' T be carved at the joints: defining function-based pain profiles and their relevance to chronic disease management in healthcare delivery design [^111HoV6H]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Each PheWAS examined a battery of associations with subject-wise pain scores with the 757 extracted phenotypes. By computing Pearson's correlation for each phenotype and pain score pair, we were able to extract both the association strength and accompanying statistical significance of the given phenotype-pain profile pairing. For each profile, two standard tests were used to adjust for the multitude of associations being assessed. First, we used Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons, adjusting for the number of tested phenotypes (0.05/757 = 6.6e-5). Second, we further evaluated the significance our correlation strength using the false discovery rate (FDR), another popular method of multiple comparison correction which is less stringent than Bonferroni's correction. The false discovery rate was set as 5% and computed for each asymmetry pattern in accordance with standard practice. For visualization purposes, phenotypes in Manhattan plots were colored and grouped according to the category membership defined by FUNPACK.

Diagnosis-wide Association Study (DiWAS) of participants' derived pain scores were defined by reference to a wide variety of almost 1,500 disease phecodes extracted from participants' electronic health records. Feature extraction for both ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnoses was carried out using the FMRIB UK Biobank Normalisation, Parsing And Cleaning Kit (FUNPACK version 2.5.0;) to extract ICD codes. Once extracted, ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes were grouped into 1477 hierarchical phenotypes which combine related ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes into a single "phecode", using previously established definitions. In addition to combining related ICD codes, we use built-in exclusion criteria to reduce case contamination of control groups. In our UKB subset of people with both pain variables and brain imaging (n = 34,337), 22 diseases were not represented in our subset. We excluded these 22 ICD codes from the final analysis. The final set of 1425 diagnostic phecodes was later compared to discovered pain profile expression to probe for relations between patient-reported pain profiles and clinical diagnoses.

### Global, regional, and national burden of osteoarthritis, 1990–2020 and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^113ZKYPo]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we only address the non-fatal burden of osteoarthritis; a growing body of evidence suggests an association between osteoarthritis and excess mortality. Future research should further examine this link and address potential confounding caused by shared risk factors between osteoarthritis and other diseases with associated fatality.

There are several important limitations in modelling osteoarthritis globally. First, we needed to adjust data that used non-reference case-ascertainment methods. As few input data sources provide data on our reference case definition of osteoarthritis requiring radiography in addition to pain, more than 80% of all sources, including approximately 70% of non-clinical sources, required adjustment to the reference definition. In particular, ICD-coded insurance-claims data systematically undercounted osteoarthritis cases, in agreement with previously reported analyses of claims data. Second, most surveys reporting on osteoarthritis prevalence were not nationally representative but often conducted purposively in a particular subpopulation for logistical reasons. As important risks for osteoarthritis might vary between people living in cities, suburban areas or rural areas, such subnational studies might not reflect the whole country for which we are making estimates. Third, we used the same severity distributions and disability weights for all osteoarthritis sites. Given that osteoarthritis symptoms can be lessened with physical therapy, physical activity, appropriate pain medication, or joint replacement surgery, a potential update would be to grade severity by access to care by location and over time, on the basis of coverage rates for the main types of intervention. Fourth, in the calculation of total osteoarthritis we assumed independence because of insufficient data on site overlap. More population-based data are needed to quantify the occurrence of several sites of osteoarthritis observed in the same individual in clinical practice. Fifth, although SDI was included as a predictor in forecasts for osteoarthritis, future iterations should incorporate other known risk factors such as high BMI. Sixth, because US claims data constitute a large proportion of available data, these data might unduly influence global age patterns, and might be affected by care-seeking behaviour differences across the age spectrum. For example, the decreased prevalence seen in knee osteoarthritis after age 80 years might be related to decreased use of the health-care system in older age. Seventh, estimates for osteoarthritis were limited by data availability and diagnostic heterogeneity, and this limitation was particularly true for other types of osteoarthritis, which solely used US insurance-claims data. Insurance claims only captured cases of osteoarthritis that intersected with the US health system. As such, model results likely underestimated the prevalence of other osteoarthritis to a greater extent than that of hip, knee, and hand osteoarthritis. To better model other osteoarthritis, access to datasets with granular diagnostic codes in diverse geographies will be imperative. Finally, estimates of osteoarthritis were limited by the absence of reliable predictive covariates, with the exception of BMI. There is also evidence to suggest that the normal range of BMI varies in different populations, and future analyses of the attributable burden to high BMI should account for these differences.

### Comparing the ICD-11 chronic pain classification with ICD-10: how can the new coding system make chronic pain visible? A study in a tertiary care pain clinic setting [^114PGvAC]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain is a frequent reason for patients to ask for medical services. However, systematic information about the extent and impact of pain, especially in developing countries, has not been available up to now. We evaluated whether the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) can fill this gap by coding all electronic out-patient medical records of the pain clinic at Siriraj Hospital in Thailand in 2019 (8714 visits), using the ICD-10 and ICD-11 browsers referenced on the WHO websites. The 3 most frequent pain-related codes in ICD-10 were R52.2 "other chronic pain" (29%), M54.5 "low back pain" (18%), and M79.6 "pain in limb" (13%). In ICD-11, the 3 most frequent codes were MG30.31 "chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain associated with structural changes" (28%), MG30.51 "chronic peripheral neuropathic pain" (26%), and MG30.10 "chronic cancer pain" (23%). Thus, using the currently valid ICD-10 system, roughly one-third of patient encounters were coded as "other chronic pain", and the next 2 were specifying the pain region rather than any underlying cause. By contrast, ICD-11 coding of the same patients identified underlying causes (bones and joints, somatosensory nervous system, cancer, or surgery), which provide guidance towards differential patient management. In our pain clinic, most patients suffered from chronic cancer pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain, which were poorly defined or nonexistent in the current ICD-10 coding system. Compared with the ICD-10, the ICD-11 provides more detailed diagnostic categories and is more informative for clinical use, research, and resource allocation for pain-related conditions.

### A seamless navigation to ICD-10-CM for interventional pain physicians: is a rude awakening avoidable? [^116SDQAQ]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Since October 1, 2015, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) was integrated into U.S. medical practices. This monumental transition seemingly occurred rather unceremoniously, despite significant opposition and reservations having been expressed by the provider community. In prior publications, we have described various survival strategies for interventional pain physicians. The regulators and beneficiaries of system-CMS, consultants, and health information technology industry are congratulating themselves for a job well done. Nonetheless, this transition comes at an immeasurable financial and psychological drain on providers. However, a rude awakening may be making its way with expiration of initial concessions from government and private payers. This manuscript provides a template for interventional pain management professionals with multiple steps for seamless navigation, including descriptions of the most commonly used codes, navigation through ICD-10-CM manual, steps for correct coding, and finally, detailed coding descriptions for various interventional techniques.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^115nQ3mU]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Knee pain is second only to the back as the most commonly reported area of pain in the human body. With an overall prevalence of 46.2%, its impact on disability, lost productivity, and cost on healthcare cannot be overlooked. Due to the pervasiveness of knee pain in the general population, there are no shortages of treatment options available for addressing the symptoms. Ranging from physical therapy and pharmacologic agents to interventional pain procedures to surgical options, practitioners have a wide array of options to choose from – unfortunately, there is no consensus on which treatments are "better" and when they should be offered in comparison to others. While it is generally accepted that less invasive treatments should be offered before more invasive ones, there is a lack of agreement on the order in which the less invasive are to be presented. In an effort to standardize the treatment of this extremely prevalent pathology, the authors present an all-encompassing set of guidelines on the treatment of knee pain based on an extensive literature search and data grading for each of the available alternative that will allow practitioners the ability to compare and contrast each option.

### Long-term pain management and health care resource use among an employed population in Japan with knee osteoarthritis combined with low back pain [^111LEB9N]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data Source

Data for this retrospective cohort study were derived from de-identified health insurance claims filed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, in the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) database. The database includes information predominantly of persons of working age (i.e. < 65 years old), employed by middle- to large-sized companies, as well as their dependents. At the time the study was conducted, the database included > 3 million unique persons from 2003 onward and represented approximately 2.5% of the total population of Japan.

Patient Selection and Study Cohorts

The study population was selected from patients more than 40 years of age with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis of KOA (ICD-10-CM code M17) that was documented between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. The date of first KOA diagnosis between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, defined the index date (Figure 1). Patients were excluded from the study if they had at least one diagnosis of OA with ICD-10 code M16 (hip), M18 (first carpometacarpal joint), or M19 (other and unspecified) at any point of study period or diagnosis of malignancy (ICD-10 codes C00–C97 and D00–D09) during the follow-up period. All patients were required to have a minimum of 1 year of enrollment before the index date (i.e. baseline period) and 5 years of enrollment after the index date (i.e. follow-up period). To ascertain the diagnosis, patients were further required to have at least one additional KOA diagnosis at any point during the 5-year follow-up period and no diagnoses for KOA during the baseline period. Patients with a diagnosis of malignancy during the 5-year follow-up period were excluded from the study to avoid the potential for the significant health care resources and costs associated with cancer treatment for these individuals to skew the health care resource use (HCRU) and cost estimates.

### American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons-endorsed comorbidity coding for total joint arthroplasty: how often did we hit the mark with international classification of diseases, ninth revision? [^112PmSoa]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Initiatives led by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) have indicated a number of clinical risk factors associated with total joint arthroplasty that might reflect the complexity of contemporary hip and knee care. This study sought to examine the prevalence of specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), coding with respect to an AAHKS-endorsed list of comorbidity codes.

Methods

An administrative data set from an academic arthroplasty referral center was analyzed in an attempt to measure the prevalence of clinical risk factors (ICD-9) endorsed by AAHKS. Total, partial, and revision joint arthroplasty procedures from January 1, 2012, to April 27, 2015, were included. Demographic data, along with diagnosis and procedural coding data, were collected and analyzed.

Results

Results analysis found a number of poorly coded variables. The following variables were omitted in the data: narcotic use, worker's compensation status, previous intra-articular infection, previous open reduction and internal fixation knee, and depression/psychiatric disease. Likewise, there was a discrepancy between the rate of ICD coding for obesity and body mass index measurements and categorization recorded in the clinic.

Conclusion

From this single-center study, there remain opportunities for coding to adequately reflect the comorbidities and complexities of patients undergoing arthroplasty.

### The impact of transitioning from international classification of diseases, ninth revision to international classification of diseases, tenth revision on reported complication rates following primary total knee arthroplasty [^112SF62N]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2015, the healthcare system transitioned from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10). We sought to determine the effect of this change on the reported incidence of complications following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods

The Humana administrative claims database was queried from 2 years prior to October 1, 2015 (ICD-9 cohort) and for 1 year after this date (ICD-10 cohort) to identify all TKA procedures. Complications occurring within 6 months of surgery were captured using the respective coding systems. Incidence of each complication was compared between cohorts using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

There were 19,009 TKAs in the ICD-10 cohort and 38,172 TKAs in the ICD-9 cohort. The incidence of each complication analyzed was significantly higher in the ICD-9 cohort relative to the ICD-10 cohort. Periprosthetic joint infection occurred in 1.9% vs 1.3% (RR 1.5, 1.3–1.9), loosening in 0.3% vs 0.1% (RR 2.7, 1.8–4.9), periprosthetic fracture in 0.3% vs 0.1% (RR 3.0, 1.6–4.5), and other mechanical complications in 0.7% vs 0.4% (RR 2.0, 1.5–2.5) (P < .05 for all).

Conclusion

The transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding has altered the reported incidence of complications following TKA. These results are likely due to the added complexity of ICD-10 which is joint and laterality specific. It is important to understand the differences between coding systems as this data is used for quality initiatives, risk adjustment models, and clinical research. Thoughtful methodology will be necessary when ICD-9 and ICD-10 data are being analyzed simultaneously.

### Cross-sectional brain-predicted age differences in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with high impact knee pain [^113csbct]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS)

The GCPS, a validated and reliable measure, was used to assess pain intensity and pain-related disability. Participants were asked to rate on a 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("pain as bad as could be") numerical rating scale (NRS) their current, average, and worst pain in the past 6 months. Similarly, pain-related disability items (ie, how much pain has interfered with daily activities, recreational/social/family activities, and ability to work) on average, over the past 6 months, were rated on a 0 ("no inference") to 10 ("unable to carry out activities") scale. Ratings were averaged and multiplied by 10 to yield a 0–100 score for each domain, with higher scores indicating greater pain intensity and pain-related disability. Another item asked "How many days in the last six months have you been kept from your usual activities because of pain?" Pain-related disability points were calculated from 1) the averaged ratings (ie, 0–29 = 0 points; 30–49 = 1 point; 50–69 = 2 points; ≥ 70 = 3 points) and 2) total number of disability days (ie, 0–6 days = 0 points; 7–14 days = 1 point; 15–30 days = 2 points; 31 days or more = 3 points). Disability points were summed. GCPS pain intensity and disability point scores were then combined as follows: Grade 0 = no reported pain intensity; Grade 1 = low pain intensity (ie, < 50) and low disability (ie, < 3 disability points); Grade 2 = high pain intensity (ie, ≥ 50) and low disability; Grade 3 = high disability-moderately limiting (ie, 3–4 disability points), regardless of pain intensity; Grade 4 = high disability-severely limiting (ie, 5–6 disability points), regardless of pain intensity. Consistent with the recommendations from the Task Force for the Classification of Chronic Pain consensus for the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) of the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale-Revised, Pain Grades were used to classify individuals without (ie, Grade 0), or with (ie, Grades 1–4) chronic pain, and as low-impact (ie, Grades 1–2), and high-impact (ie, Grades 3–4) chronic knee pain.

### Analysis of the cost and efficacy of intra-articular knee injections [^112N7WGy]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Database

This study was conducted within PearlDiver, a national administrative claims database with more than 25 million patients. Records span from the years 2008 to 2018. With medical, prescription, and laboratory data, records are searchable through physician billing codes, including Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10) codes.

Patient Selection

All patients who underwent an intra-articular knee injection were identified by CPT-20610. Because large joint injections may not be specific to the knee, a knee-related diagnosis code for knee pain, effusion, or OA was required to be present on the same day as the injection procedure. Patients were then stratified by the type of injection administered based on Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System J codes for either CS or HA injections. Laterality of the injection and the injection type were confirmed with CPT modifiers, and the number of injections administered within patients' record was determined using count codes with each instance of an injection counted as a single injection; a series of shots was counted as multiple shots in this study and not a single event. Patients lacking laterality modifiers or patients who received both injection types (CS and HA) were excluded. Any patient with a history of platelet-rich plasma injection into the knee joint was excluded as well. A comparator group was defined by patients with the knee-related diagnosis codes for knee pain, effusion, or OA who had no history of intra-articular knee injections at any point in their disease course. Finally, all patients were restricted to those between the ages of 50 and 70 years at the time of their first injection or knee-related diagnosis. The selected age range was chosen because it represents a time when patients are generally optimal candidates for both joint injection and TKA.

Because patients in PearlDiver are accessible through deidentified insurance records, data may not be reported secondary to a change of insurance, loss to follow-up, or death, for instance. To minimize the effect of reporting bias, when indicated, patients were excluded from further study when they were found to no longer have active records in the data set, with active records defined as uninterrupted enrollment with the insurance carrier.

### Use of non-surgical treatments on the journey to knee replacement in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a 10-year population-based case-control study [^1133FiVF]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Control definition

One control for each case was randomly selected among patients with knee OA (ascertained with ICD-10 codes). Controls were matched by sex, age at first knee OA diagnosis (± 1 year), quarter of the year of first knee OA diagnosis and healthcare level of first knee OA diagnosis (primary care vs specialist care). Controls were assigned the same index date as their 1:1 matched case. Controls could not have received a knee joint replacement up to their assigned index date. We selected controls using incidence density sampling, resulting in controls having equivalent at-risk time compared with matched cases.

'Exposure' definition: prior all-cause and OA-specific healthcare

We retrieved data on all exposure events during the 10 years preceding the index date. Main exposures were: (i) primary care visit (binary, yes/no); (ii) PT visit (binary, yes/no); (iii) NSAID dispensation (binary, yes/no); (iv) opioid dispensation (binary, yes/no); all for any cause (ie, not only for OA). We retained any primary care visits, except for the first visit where the diagnosis of knee OA was registered for the first time (used for matching). For PT and primary care, we considered only physical visits (not letters or telephone contacts, etc). PT visits were identified using the code for the profession 'physiotherapist' among visits within outpatient care. We used Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes to identify NSAID and opioid dispensations (online supplemental file 3). For opioids, we also calculated the Milligrams of Morphine Equivalent (MME) based on the dispensed dose recorded in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. In a secondary analysis, we used primary care visits for knee OA as exposure. We considered a primary care visit to be for knee OA when an ICD-10 code of M17 was registered during the visit.

### Age-and sex-specific incidence rates and future projections for hip fractures in Zimbabwe [^116XY5tU]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Hip fracture classification

Hip fractures were confirmed by reading radiographs wherever possible. Each radiograph was reviewed by two orthopaedic surgeons and classified as intracapsular (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] code S72.0), pertrochanteric (ICD-10 code S72.1) and sub-trochanteric (ICD-10 code S72.2). If a radiograph had been taken, but was not made available to the research team, the hip fracture classification was taken from the orthopaedic opinion documented in the hospital medical records. Where no radiograph (eg, due to X-ray equipment faults, interrupted electricity supply, unaffordability of radiographs), the case history was used by an orthopaedic surgeon to determine a clinical diagnosis of a hip fracture. This was defined as (i) a fall where the patient landed on their buttocks or side, after which (ii) they quickly experienced severe pain in the groin or hip with or without radiation down to the knee and (iii) a shortened and externally rotated leg was evident on examination.

Statistical analysis

Characteristics of the hip fracture population were described using numbers with percentages, and means with SD. χ² tests were used to determine associations between patient characteristics and (a) delayed presentation and (b) mechanism of injury.

### Knee osteoarthritis in community-dwelling older adults: are there characteristic patterns of pain location? [^1157nozv]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether there are characteristic patterns of pain location associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA) among community-dwelling older adults.

Design

Population-based, cross-sectional survey of 697 adults aged 50 years and over reporting knee pain within the past 6 months. Pain at 13 individual sites at or around the knee was coded. Pain locations in participants with and without "symptomatic knee OA" (defined as symptoms on most days in the past month, at least a definite osteophyte on plain X-ray, and current pain intensity of at least 2 out of 10) were compared. Participants were then grouped by pattern of knee pain location, and their clinical and radiographic characteristics compared.

Results

Generalised knee pain (n = 313) and medial knee pain (either in isolation or with peripatellar or lateral knee pain: n = 175) were the most common patterns. Medial knee pain and distally radiating pain were significantly more likely in those with symptomatic knee OA. Individuals with generalised knee pain with radiation had more persistent, severe pain, and a relatively high proportion had moderate or severe radiographic disease.

Conclusion

No single pattern of pain location is pathognomonic for knee OA. Attention towards the role of peripheral nociception and central sensitisation in producing medial knee pain and distally radiating knee pain is warranted.

### Chronic pain diagnosis before total knee arthroplasty leads to higher readmission risk, lower patient-reported outcome measures, and dissatisfaction at one year: an analysis of 13, 894 patients [^115gftN6]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who have chronic pain may experience worse outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), yet its impact on postoperative metrics remains unclear. This study evaluated the prevalence of chronic pain diagnoses and their association with healthcare utilization, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and satisfaction.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 13,894 primary unilateral TKAs performed from 2016 to 2022 at a tertiary center was conducted. Chronic pain diagnoses were identified via International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision (ICD-9) (338.2, 338.4) and 10 th Revision (ICD-10) (G89.2, G89.4) codes. Outcomes were compared using multivariable logistic regression. The PROMs included Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain, Physical Function Shortform (PS), Joint Replacement (JR), and Veterans RAND 12-Item Mental Component Score (VR-12 MCS). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) thresholds were assessed.

Results

Chronic pain was present in 23.4% (3,258 of 13,894) of patients. These patients had higher odds of 90-day readmission (OR [odds ratio] 1.27, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.1 to 1.46; P < 0.001), but were less likely to have a length of stay ≥ two days (OR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.95; P = 0.004). There was no significant association found with non-home discharge (P = 0.301). Patients who had chronic pain had increased odds of failing to reach MCID in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) JR (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.43; P = 0.049) and VR-12 MCS (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.29; P = 0.01). They were also more likely to fail PASS thresholds in KOOS Pain (OR 1.25; P < 0.001), PS (OR 1.22; P < 0.001), and JR (OR 1.28; P < 0.001). Additionally, chronic pain patients had higher odds of dissatisfaction at one year (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.32; P = 0.011).

Conclusion

Chronic pain was independently associated with increased 90-day readmission risk and poorer postoperative outcomes, including failure to reach clinically relevant pain relief, functional improvement, and satisfaction. These findings highlight the need for targeted preoperative optimization strategies for chronic pain patients undergoing TKA.

### Predictors of new-onset widespread pain in older adults: results from a population-based prospective cohort study in the UK [^1146oBcz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

General practice consultation data were used to provide an objective assessment of morbidities, for comparison. General practitioners in the study populations used the Read system to code all morbidities during actual consultations. Read codes are used in primary care by general practitioners in the UK to record morbidity data on clinical computer systems (35). The Read codes cross‐map to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9)/ICD‐10 codes (for diseases). Morbidity data (i.e. symptoms and diseases) in this system are grouped under 19 main Read chapters. Data collected at the second hierarchical level or above were used to identify morbidity, and were related to at least one consultation for a given morbidity category in the 18 months prior to baseline (repeat consultations for the same morbidity were not included). A simple count of the number of morbidities identified in a consultation was calculated.

To define diffuse OA, we first identified those participants for whom a potential diagnosis of OA was recorded as the reason for consultation in the general practice notes (code N05). Subjects with a recorded consultation for OA were asked about the presence of pain in the 4 most prevalent areas of OA (hands, hips, knees, and feet) in older adults (36). This classification satisfies the criteria for the clinical syndrome of OA (36). Individuals were categorized as having diffuse OA (consultation for OA and reported pain in at least 2 areas), single‐site OA (consultation for OA and reported pain in 1 area), or no OA (no consultation for OA).

Followup survey

Participants who returned the baseline questionnaire, who were free of WP at baseline, and who agreed to further contact were mailed a followup questionnaire 36 months later. To assess the presence of pain at followup, methods identical to those used in the baseline survey were utilized. Participants who reported having WP at followup were classified as having new‐onset WP, and those who reported having no WP at followup were classified as being WP‐free.

Ethics approval

Ethics approval was obtained from the North Staffordshire Local Research Ethics Committee. Consent was implied through the returned questionnaire, and participants provided additional consent to medical record review.

### Knee stability and movement coordination impairments: knee ligament sprain revision 2017 [^112C1ayM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) sprain — diagnosis/classification — The ICD diagnosis of a sprain of the PCL and the associated ICF diagnosis of knee stability and movement coordination impairments are made with a reasonable level of certainty when the patient presents with clinical findings such as a posterior-directed force on the proximal tibia (dashboard/anterior tibial blow injury), a fall on the flexed knee, or a sudden violent hyperextension of the knee joint; localized posterior knee pain with kneeling or decelerating; a positive posterior drawer test at 90° with a nondiscrete end feel or an increased posterior tibial translation (sensitivity, 90%; 95% CI not available and specificity, 99%; 95% CI not available); and posterior sag (subluxation) of the proximal tibia posteriorly relative to the anterior aspect of the femoral condyles (sensitivity, 79%; 95% CI: 57%, 91% and specificity, 100%; 95% CI: 85%, 100%).

### Real-world costs of obesity-related complications over eight years: a US retrospective cohort study in 28, 500 individuals [^112TzKtL]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity-related complications (ORCs) and comorbidities of interest

ORCs and comorbidities were identified via International Classification of Diseases Version 9 and 10 clinical modification diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) during the baseline period using data from PharMetrics Plus. A full list of ICD codes is available in Table S1. ORCs were obstructive sleep apnoea, HF, urinary incontinence, OA of the knee, T2D, prediabetes, asthma, psoriasis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, musculoskeletal pain, chronic kidney disease (CKD; including kidney failure) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). ASCVD included cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease and peripheral artery disease. These ORCs were previously identified as conditions with an established association with obesity and were the basis of the 2021 publication by Divino et al. determining 1-year complication-specific costs. The following ORCs were of particular interest and costs were investigated in detail: T2D, HF, CKD and OA of the knee. In addition, the following conditions or group of conditions were of interest: established CVD, ≥ 2 ORCs, ≥ 3 ORCs and high CV risk. Established cardiovascular disease (CVD) included ASCVD, HF, cardiomyopathies, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation and flutter, and atherosclerosis. Individuals at high risk for CV complications were defined as those with at least two CV risk factors out of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and T2D or prediabetes.

### Inequalities in primary care management of knee pain and disability in older adults: an observational cohort study [^113jxvi7]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

We linked self-reported survey data with 10-year primary and secondary care NHS medical records. The study was set within a larger study of knee pain. Everyone aged ≥ 50 years registered at three general practices in North Staffordshire, UK, were sent a questionnaire in 2000. Those who responded and still registered with the practices were sent a follow-up questionnaire 3 years later. Both questionnaires included the knee pain screening tool (KNEST) to identify knee pain and related health-care use in the past 12 months. Subjects were also asked whether they consented to viewing of their medical records. North Staffordshire Local Research Ethics Committee approved the study.

Identification of participants

Subjects were selected who: (i) responded to both baseline and follow-up surveys; (ii) consented to medical record review; (iii) reported knee pain on the follow-up survey; (iv) either self-reported a GP consultation for knee pain at baseline or follow-up, or had a recorded GP consultation for knee pain between 1997 and 2004; and (v) were still alive and registered at the practice at the end of 2006.

We defined a recorded GP consultation as an entry in the general practice computerized database in the study period. The practices undergo a cycle of assessment, feedback and training in the use of computerized morbidity Read coding. Read codes are a commonly used morbidity coding system in the UK. GPs can add information about a consultation (free text) alongside the code. Read-coded information and consultation text for consultations were searched to identify all consultations which had an allocated knee-related Read code or a musculoskeletal-related knee disorder mentioned in the text of the consultation.

### Patellofemoral pain in general practice: the incidence and management [^112wCus7]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a nontraumatic knee problem primarily observed in physically active adolescents. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and management of PFP in children and adolescents in general practice.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a regional primary care database containing full electronic health records of over 300,000 patients. Patients with a new PFP diagnosis between the years 2013 and 2019 were extracted using a search algorithm based on International Classification of Primary Health Care coding and search terms in free text. Data on the management of PFP were manually checked and analysed. In addition, a sub-analysis for chronic and nonchronic PFP patients was performed.

Results

The mean incidence of PFP over the study period was 3.4 (95% CI 3.2–3.6) per 1,000 person years in the age group of 7–24 years. Girls had a higher incidence rate (4.6 [95% CI 4.3–5.0]) compared to boys (2.3 [95% CI 2.1–2.5]). Peak incidence was at age 13 years for both sexes. The most commonly applied management strategy was advice (55.1%), followed by referral to physiotherapy (28.2%), analgesics prescription (10.4%), and referral to the orthopaedic surgeon (8.9%). No differences were found in age, sex, and treatment between chronic and nonchronic PFP patients.

Conclusions

The average Dutch general practitioner sees approximately 1.4 new child or adolescent with PFP per year. Overall management strategies were in concordance with current Dutch general practice guideline on nontraumatic knee problems. More insight should be gained in the population with chronic complaints.

### MRI for the evaluation of knee pain: comparison of ordering practices of primary care physicians and orthopaedic surgeons [^112Jarjw]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Knee pain is one of the most common reasons for outpatient visits in the U.S. The great majority of such cases can be effectively evaluated through physical examination and judicious use of radiography. Despite this, an increasing number of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the knee are being ordered for patients with incomplete work-ups or for inappropriate indications. We hypothesized that MRIs ordered by orthopaedic providers were more likely to result in changes in diagnoses and/or plans for care than those ordered by non-orthopaedic providers.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of all consecutive new patients seen at our orthopaedic outpatient office between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for meniscal or unspecific sprains and strains of the knee. A total of 1592 patients met our inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups: those initially evaluated and referred by their primary care physician (PCP) (n = 747) and those initially evaluated by one of our staff orthopaedic surgeons (n = 845).

Results

MRI-ordering rates were nearly identical between orthopaedic surgeons and PCPs (25.0% versus 24.8%; p = 0.945). MRIs ordered by orthopaedic surgeons, however, resulted in significantly more arthroscopic interventions than those ordered by PCPs (41.2% versus 31.4%; p = 0.042). Orthopaedic surgeons ordered MRIs for patients who were more likely to benefit from arthroscopic intervention, including patients who were younger (mean age, 45.1 years versus 56.5 years for those with PCP-ordered MRIs; p < 0.001), patients with acute symptoms (39.3% versus 22.2%; p < 0.001), and patients with a history of trauma (49.3% versus 36.2%; p = 0.019). Finally, orthopaedic surgeons were less likely than PCPs to order MRIs for patients with substantial osteoarthritis who subsequently underwent total knee arthroplasty (4.3% versus 9.2%; p = 0.048).

Conclusions

MRI utilization by orthopaedic surgeons results in more appropriate interventions for patients with symptoms and findings most amenable to surgical intervention.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^113coEMA]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Because chronic pain has been poorly represented in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) despite its significant contribution to the burden of disease worldwide, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) developed a classification of chronic pain that was included in the ICD-11 version as "MG30" and approved by the World Health Assembly in 2019. The objective of this field test was to determine how well the classification of chronic pain works in the context of the ICD-11. A web-based survey using the WHO-FiT platform recruited 177 healthcare professionals from all WHO regions. After a training on coding chronic pain hosted by the IASP Web site, participants evaluated 18 diagnostic codes (lines) of the 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 and 12 vignettes (cases) describing chronic pain conditions. Correctness, ambiguity, and perceived difficulty of the coding were compared between the ICD-11 and the ICD-10 and the applicability of the morbidity rules for the ICD-11 verified. In the line coding, 43.0% of correct chronic pain diagnoses assigned with the ICD-10 contrasted with 63.2% with the ICD-11. Especially in cases in which the chronic pain is regarded as the symptom of an underlying disease, the ICD-11 (63.5%) commanded more correct diagnoses than the ICD-10 (26.8%). The case coding was on average 83.9% accurate, only in 1.6% of cases any difficulty was perceived. The morbidity rules were applied correctly in 74.1% of cases. From a coding perspective, the ICD-11 is superior to the ICD-10 in every respect, offering better accuracy, difficulty, and ambiguity in coding chronic pain conditions.

### Influences on the decision to use an osteoarthritis diagnosis in primary care: a cohort study with linked survey and electronic health record data [^116h6gXU]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of recorded label also has public health implications. The electronic patient record and consequent collation of primary care consultation data has created opportunities for epidemiological studies to inform health care need and service provision. Studies focussing only on those with a recorded OA diagnosis will be identifying the older, more severe patients, and may underestimate the scale of the burden of OA in primary care, and ignore the group who may have fewer of the recognised risk factors but who may progress to a later OA diagnosis. Approaches to measure and improve quality of care could also be misguided if based only on those with a recorded diagnosis of OA.

The study was limited to one area of the UK, albeit with similar musculoskeletal prevalence figures to those shown nationally, including for OA and arthralgia. Whilst Read codes are the most common method of classification in general practice in the UK, they are not used elsewhere. However, we have previously matched Read codes for OA and joint pain to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and obtained very similar consultation prevalence figures for OA and for joint pain in patients aged 45 and over between the UK and Sweden. This suggests that the issues highlighted here may also be of relevance outside of the UK. One practice which showed high recording of OA had been trained to preferentially record diagnoses due to their inclusion in another research database. Excluding this practice did not change the associations shown. The potential differential diagnoses identified may relate to a different problem than the OA or joint pain record and so it is not known how many of these represent true differential diagnoses. Subsequent diagnoses were also not matched to the same body region as the index joint pain consultation. It is possible that the recording of an OA diagnosis may also be associated with referral to secondary care but we were unable to explore that in this study. Whilst the GP may have recorded the consultation with a joint pain symptom, it is possible they informed the patient it was OA. We only considered a period of 12 months prior to the survey so that self-reported information was not too long after the consultation. There will be other respondents to the survey who had consulted and been recorded with an OA diagnosis or joint pain symptom more than 12 months before the survey but not in the 12 month period considered here.

Methods

Dataset

The Swedish conscription cohort contains 49,132 male adolescents who underwent compulsory conscription examination for military service during the years 1969–70. Detailed parameters from health examinations, physiological tests, psychological assessment and self-reported questionnaires were used. The cohort is linked to national Swedish registers with prospectively registered diagnoses. The dataset originally consisted of 406 variables. An evaluation reduced this to 103 variables. Variables that were deemed to be unrelated to the aim of the study (e.g. social security numbers or astigmatism on a certain eye), had high rates of missing values, or assessed the same or a very similar construct as other variables, were removed. A list of the 103 variables is available in Supplementary Table 1. Multiple co-authors reviewed the dataset, focusing on variable types and category counts. Some categories were reduced when there were too few participants in extreme categories, or when simplifying the categories made interpretation easier. For example, we reduced 'Fired (work)' from three ordinal values (no, yes (once), yes (more than once)) to binary (no, yes) because too few participants fell into the third category, and it was considered easier to interpret the results. This review was completed prior to network construction.

Here we have used 80% of the data. The rest of the data has been locked away from those performing the data analysis, as future work intends to utilise the locked away subset as an independent test dataset for machine learning purposes.

Long-term pain cohort

Subjects with long-term pain were those who were in or out patients who had received a diagnosis code according to the Swedish version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Long-term pain was defined using the following ICD-10 codes: G43, G89, K58, M17, M51, M54, M79, and corresponding ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes. These codes represent diagnoses such as fibromyalgia, rheumatism, low back pain/lumbago, migraine and osteoarthritis of the knee.

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^117Bg7Cb]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^1128zxct]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Classification codes — there have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update, so ICD-10 content was not updated or revised; there is a transition plan to ICD-11 codes which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal); and changes to ICD-11 codes are likely in a future CPG update because directly coding chronic pain will noticeably impact clinical classification of low back pain (LBP).

### Is the American joint replacement registry able to correctly classify revision total knee arthroplasty procedural diagnoses? [^113H5jjX]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) is a powerful tool for the study of revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA). The AJRR uses International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10-CM) codes for recording surgical diagnoses. However, the validity of this methodology is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of ICD-10-CM codes, as used by AJRR, in classifying rTKA diagnoses.

Methods

There were 988 rTKAs performed from 2015 to 2021 identified in our institutional total joint registry (TJR). Revision diagnoses were obtained from TJR, in which trained abstractors prospectively record diagnoses independent of ICD-10-CM data. The ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes submitted to AJRR were retrieved for the same procedures. The accuracy of ICD-10-CM codes for classifying rTKA diagnoses as septic versus aseptic, aseptic loosening, instability, and periprosthetic fracture was assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistics, sensitivities, and specificities.

Results

Concordance between AJRR-submitted codes and TJR was excellent (97.3%, k = 0.9) for identifying septic versus aseptic revisions. Agreement for aseptic diagnoses varied from very good for loosening (k = 0.65) and instability (k = 0.64) to fair for periprosthetic fracture (k = 0.36). Specificity was high (> 94%) for all three diagnoses, but sensitivity was lower at 71%, 63%, and 28% for loosening, instability, and periprosthetic fracture, respectively.

Conclusion

The AJRR submitted ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes correctly classified rTKA cases as septic or aseptic with remarkable accuracy, but accuracy for more granular diagnoses varied. These data demonstrate the potential for diagnosis-specific limitations when using administrative claims data for registry reporting and have important implications for researchers using ICD-10-CM data.

3.1. Diagnosis

For participants with NP (n = 56), the most common ICD-10 codes were M79.2 (n = 25) and M79.29 (n = 22), both labelled as neuralgia and neuritis unspecified. With respect to the subtype of NP, 10 participants were post-trauma, 13 postsurgery (including 3 cancer-related surgery), 9 peripheral neuropathy, 4 trigeminal neuralgia, 4 occipital neuralgia, 3 radiculopathy, 3 rare diseases, 2 peripheral polyneuropathy, 1 postamputation, 1 spinal cord injury, 1 erythromelalgia, and 5 not specified. Of participants with CRPS (n = 57), the most common ICD-10 codes were G90.521 (n = 16; CRPS-1 in the right lower limb) and G90.7 (n = 13, CRPS-1 other, unspecified). Two of 57 participants with CRPS had CRPS-2 (4%). Of participants with other pain (n = 108), 49 participants had ICD-10 codes related to musculoskeletal pain, 26 migraine/headache, 20 visceral pain, 5 pelvic pain, and 1 fibromyalgia. See Supplementary Table 2, for a detailed description of participant ICD-10 diagnostic codes. The median number of days between ICD-10 diagnosis at the most recent clinic visit and completion of Pediatric PainSCAN was 401 days (IQR 304, 512) for participants with NP, 165 days (IQR 49, 308) for participants with CRPS, and 148 days (IQR 54, 510) for participants with other pain conditions.

### Pain trajectory defines knee osteoarthritis subgroups: a prospective observational study [^1174zNze]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, we found that functional limitations followed identical development to pain, indicating that people experienced these 2 outcomes very similarly or could not distinguish between them. Some studies examined functional limitation in knee OA, but none of these did not look into interplay between pain and functional limitation over time. Although the first 3 phenotypes were responsive to currently available analgesics, the fourth was not. OA phenotypes were not significantly associated with knee replacement during a 3-year follow-up because only a few replacements took place during the period. However, in the longer term — as the number of replacements increased — mild-increasing and moderate-treatment-sensitive phenotypes but not severe-treatment-insensitive had significant odds of having knee replacement when compared to the mild-fluctuating one. The severe-treatment-insensitive phenotype in the OAI study included the youngest women with the highest BMI and depression score, with more comorbidities, using analgesics, but without pain relief. The left and right knee trajectories and their dual model showed that most people develop the same pain pattern irrespective of laterality, probably due to central pain processing. The overlapping group percentage was likely lower due to individuals' unilateral pathologies.

The baseline clinical and lifestyle factors in our study were modest in differentiating the phenotypes. Overall, the variable with a consistently positive relationship to pain seemed to be BMI, indicating metabolic differences between phenotypes. The age effect was transposed between study samples. As previously discussed, the exclusion criteria in the OAI study likely led to a healthier population being selected. More generally, age effect can be a random observation unrelated to pain phenotypes, instead indicating time-dependent exposure and a molecular process to be detected. Interestingly, 75% of the fourth phenotype were women, indicating a sex-specific mechanism of severe-treatment-insensitive pain. Finally, the 9-year follow-up is the longest regular/annual follow-up so far in knee OA, and it has given us better insights into long-term pain, the slow-progressing character of OA, and its relation to OA end-stage.

### Influences on the decision to use an osteoarthritis diagnosis in primary care: a cohort study with linked survey and electronic health record data [^112uZ18U]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The North Staffordshire Osteoarthritis Project (NorStOP) was a longitudinal survey of all those aged 50 plus registered at 8 general practices. In the UK, most people are registered with a general practice and therefore the registers provide a convenient sampling frame for the local population. At baseline the general practitioners (GPs) at the practices excluded those with severe illness (for example, severe psychiatric or terminal illness) and questionnaires were then mailed to the remaining registered population aged 50 and over with reminders sent after 2 and 4 weeks. Further questionnaires were mailed at 3 years and 6–7 years. Self-reported survey data was linked to primary care records (with consent) with records collated from 24 months prior to the baseline survey to either the date of the 6–7 year survey or the date the participant dropped out of the study (for example, if the participant did not respond to the 3 year survey, collation of the records ended then). The primary care record follow up lasted a median of 6.4 years from the baseline survey (IQR 3.7, 6.9).

We previously identified through consensus of GPs a set of Read codes relating to non-specific joint pain (hand, hip, knee, foot) which could be used by GPs as an alternative to an OA diagnosis code for older patients presenting with likely OA, and are available from. Two groups were identified for this analysis from all NorStOP baseline respondents who consented to medical record review, based on their primary care consultation records for the 12 months before the baseline survey. Group 1 received an OA diagnostic code during the 12 months (OA group); group 2 received a joint pain symptom code but not an OA diagnostic code during those 12 months (joint pain group). Respondents who received both an OA diagnostic code and a joint pain code were included in the OA group. Both groups included patients with ongoing problems and those consulting with new problems. The index date was the date of the recorded OA/joint pain code nearest to the baseline survey within this 12 month time period. Respondents for whom a body region (knee, hip, hand/wrist, foot/ankle) at the index date consultation could not be allocated, either through the code given or recorded in the free text of the consultation, were excluded in order to allow comparison by individual site.

PATIENTS and methods

Study design and data source

This was a population-based, case–control study. We used four registers comprising the entire population of Skåne, the southernmost region in Sweden with approximately 1.4 million inhabitants (13% of the total Swedish population as December of 2020). The Skåne region, one of Sweden's most densely populated regions, encompasses both urban and rural areas. All levels of care are present in the region, and the demographic and socioeconomic structure is similar to that of the whole of Sweden. From the Swedish Population Register, we retrieved data on age, sex, residential address and deaths, while individual-level data on income, education, marital status and country of birth were retrieved from the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies (LISA by Swedish acronym). From the Skåne Healthcare Register (SHR) we extracted information about visits (to physicians or PTs) and diagnoses provided at healthcare visits to a physician. The SHR does not record contact with private healthcare providers or care delivered in elderly homes. Finally, from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, we extracted information on all NSAIDs and opioids prescribed and dispensed at a pharmacy or healthcare institution in the country. Data from the four registers were linked using patients' pseudo-anonymised personal unique identification number, which is assigned to all residents in Sweden by the Swedish Tax Agency.

We reported the study according to the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data guidelines. There was no patient or public involvement in this study.

Case definition

International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) M17 code and surgical codes (KVÅ codes in Swedish) were used to identify cases aged 45 years and over who underwent primary knee replacement between 1 July 2015 and 31 December 2019 (code lists available in online supplemental file 1). To be eligible for inclusion, subjects had to be registered in the healthcare database for a minimum of 10 years before their knee replacement (ie, index date) and had no knee replacement recorded between 1998 and 1 July 2015 (online supplemental file 2).
