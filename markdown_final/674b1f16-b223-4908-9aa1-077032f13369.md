## Question

Small fascia under a small area of the skin is what?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the "small fascia under a small area of the skin" is and how to name it anatomically and clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard layered anatomy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Then, I should verify which fascial layer lies immediately beneath the dermis and how it is termed. Next, I will consider regional variations and whether "small" implies a focal structure or simply a thin layer. After that, I should review histology and imaging characteristics to confirm the identity. Finally, I will synthesize a precise, clinically useful answer and note any exceptions or synonyms that might apply in different body regions.

> Let me first confirm the basic layers so I don't jump to conclusions: from superficial to deep, the skin has epidermis, dermis, and then subcutaneous tissue that includes fat and fibrous connective tissue. Beneath that lies the deep investing fascia overlying muscle, with the subcutaneous layer often termed the hypodermis in histology texts and the superficial fascia in surgical and anatomical literature [^115RY5gf] [^112bmnUU].

> Wait, let me verify the fascial layer immediately under the dermis. The connective tissue immediately deep to the dermis, interposed between skin and deeper structures, is the superficial fascia, also called the fascia superficialis or membranous layer of subcutaneous tissue; it is a fibrous, collagen-rich sheet that encloses fat lobules and connects superficially to the dermis and deeply to the deep fascia, forming a three-dimensional network rather than a single uniform sheet [^112bmnUU] [^112Cq2Rk].

> Hold on, I should verify whether "small" implies a distinct, tiny fascial structure or just a thin regional variant. In most contexts, "small fascia under the skin" corresponds to the superficial fascia itself, which varies in thickness by region and body habitus. For example, ultrasound studies show the superficial fascia in the lateral neck averages about 3.7 mm beneath the skin, while in the gluteal region the superficial fatty layer can exceed 20 mm, so "small" may simply reflect regional thinness rather than a different structure [^114meR4m] [^114Jg3CA].

> I need to check histology and imaging to ensure I'm naming the correct layer. Histologically, the superficial fascia is a fibrofatty connective tissue matrix with collagen and elastic fibers and fibroblasts, and on ultrasound it appears as a relatively echogenic band or sheet just deep to the hypoechoic subcutaneous fat, often continuous with denser retinacular fibers that tether skin to deeper layers; this matches the description of a thin, sheet-like fascia beneath the skin [^112bmnUU] [^1127tDzP] [^113QZpBR].

> But wait, what if the phrase refers to a specific named fascial specialization rather than generic superficial fascia? Regionally, surgeons encounter structures like Scarpa fascia in the lower abdominal wall, the superficial cervical fascia in the neck, and the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) in the face; these are all regional expressions of the superficial fascia system, so even then the correct umbrella term remains superficial fascia, with the regional name added when precision matters [^116svm6d] [^111WquFr] [^1179JxjF].

> Let me consider clinical implications briefly to ensure the terminology is practical. The superficial fascia is the plane of dissection in many aesthetic and reconstructive procedures, the target for certain energy-based skin-tightening devices, and a key layer in infection classifications that distinguish superficial from deep surgical site infections; recognizing and naming it correctly guides safe surgical planes and postoperative risk stratification [^115RBot3] [^115igDyq] [^112XpKn6].

> Synthesis: I should double-check that I'm not overlooking a synonym. The "small fascia under a small area of the skin" is the superficial fascia, also called the fascia superficialis or the membranous layer of subcutaneous tissue. It is the fibrous connective tissue sheet immediately deep to the dermis that encloses fat, bridges to the deep fascia, varies in thickness by region, and may carry regional names such as Scarpa fascia or SMAS depending on location [^112bmnUU] [^114meR4m] [^116svm6d] [^111WquFr].

The small fascia under a small area of skin is the **superficial fascia** (subcutaneous tissue), a thin, fibrous connective tissue layer beneath the dermis that contains fat, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves [^112bmnUU]. It provides insulation, cushioning, and mobility, and is continuous with deeper fascia and periosteum [^112Cq2Rk]. Clinically, it is the plane of dissection for many procedures and is involved in conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and cellulitis [^114eVQHn] [^1163CEaK].

---

## Anatomical structure and composition

- **Location**: The superficial fascia lies immediately beneath the dermis, separating skin from deeper muscle fascia [^112bmnUU].
- **Composition**: It is a fibrous connective tissue matrix with collagen and elastic fibers, fibroblasts, and adipocytes [^112bmnUU].
- **Fat content**: Variable fat content gives the subcutaneous layer its thickness and contour [^111CS42x].
- **Vessels and nerves**: Contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and sensory nerves supplying the skin [^112bmnUU].

---

## Functions of superficial fascia

- **Insulation**: Fat provides thermal insulation, helping regulate body temperature [^notfound].
- **Cushioning**: Absorbs mechanical shock and protects underlying structures [^113QZpBR].
- **Mobility**: Allows skin to glide over deeper tissues, enabling movement [^112TBY1H].
- **Support**: Anchors skin to deeper fascia and muscle, maintaining position and shape [^112apfCB].

---

## Clinical significance

- **Surgical plane**: The superficial fascia is a key dissection plane in procedures such as liposuction, abdominoplasty, and facelift surgery [^115sT4zc] [^1113Txzo].
- **Infections**: Necrotizing fasciitis and cellulitis often involve the superficial fascia, requiring prompt recognition and treatment [^114eVQHn] [^115RY5gf] [^1163CEaK].
- **Injections**: Subcutaneous injections target the superficial fascia for drug delivery and absorption [^114Jg3CA].

---

## Variations in superficial fascia

Thickness and composition vary by **region**, age, sex, and body habitus [^114FgWii] [^114meR4m] [^114Jg3CA]. In the face and neck, the superficial fascia includes the SMAS, which is important in aesthetic surgery [^111WquFr]. In the lower limbs, it contains the saphenous compartments that house the great and small saphenous veins [^114Zcngk].

## Clinical conditions involving superficial fascia

| **Condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| necrotizing fasciitis | Rapidly progressive infection of superficial fascia requiring urgent surgical debridement [^111KxkVQ] |
| cellulitis | Infection of superficial fascia and subcutaneous tissue, often requiring antibiotics [^notfound] |
| lipomas | Benign tumors arising from fat cells within superficial fascia [^notfound] |
| contusions | Bruising of superficial fascia due to blunt trauma |

---

The small fascia under the skin is the **superficial fascia**, a fibrofatty layer beneath the dermis that provides insulation, cushioning, and mobility, and serves as a key surgical plane; it varies by region and is involved in several clinical conditions.

Video 1.
This video is an animation of the effect of a deep plane dissection on the facial nerve branches within the masseteric fascia.

In areas where mimetic muscles are not present, the superficial fascia and deep fascia are in direct contact and macroscopically indistinguishable from each other notwithstanding loupe magnification. Microscopically, however, an important distinction exists, with the connective tissue architecture of the deep fascia being oriented parallel to the skin and that of the superficial fascia being oriented more perpendicular to the skin. These observations were confirmed by sheet plastination (Fig. 4, center and right) and by histologic analysis (Fig. 5). Not one but many sheets of connective tissue septae interspersed with adipose tissue were visualized dividing the deep fascia into more superficial and deeper layers (up to 18 different sheets in the neck). These different sheets generally merge at thinner areas, forming recognizable deep fascia entities (eg, masseter fascia, sternocleidomastoid fascia), and diverge at thicker areas, forming deep fat entities (eg, subplatysmal and interdigastric fat, deep cheek fat). Histologic analysis confirmed the arrangement of the multiple fascial sheets in a mille-feuille pattern, a pattern seen in multiple areas of the face (Fig. 5).

Wide excision depth and margin modification — MIS and invasive melanoma: There are no randomized trials to inform peripheral surgical margins or depth of wide excision for MIS. Depth of excision into the subcutaneous fat may be adequate and considered in anatomic locations where excision to fascia would cause significant morbidity. For invasive melanoma, wide excision involves removal of all tissue to the level of the fascia, which is typically preserved unless involved by tumor; peripheral resection margins may be modified to accommodate individual anatomic or functional considerations; however, narrower-than-recommended margins may increase the risk for margin positivity and/or local recurrence.

### Reverse-flow island sural flap [^115ESwHQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The reverse flow island sural flap is presented as an alternative to flaps currently used for reconstruction of small and medium substance losses in the distal third of the leg, ankle, and heel. This is a random type of flap, based on the reverse flow of the superficial sural artery, which mainly depends on the anatomy of the perforators of the peroneal artery system. The anatomic structures that constitute the pedicle are the superficial and deep fascias, the sural nerve, the short saphenous vein, and the superficial sural artery. The skin island and the subcutaneous cellular tissue complement the flap proper. This skin island was demarcated at any point of the median or distal thirds of the leg, having the short saphenous vein and the sural nerve on its central axis. The distal dissection limit of the pedicle is located 5 centimeters above the lateral malleolus. This limit is established so as to ensure the integrity of the perforators from the principal arteries of the leg, mainly the peroneal artery, responsible for the reverse flow nourishing the flap. These perforators will affect anastomoses with the superficial sural artery in charge of irrigating the structures compounding the flap. A total of 71 patients were operated on with this technique, some of them with basic pathologic abnormalities limiting the distal blood flow, such as diabetes mellitus, and some others having proven vascular insufficiency or displaying unstable areas attributable to problems such as pseudarthrosis and osteomyelitis, which needed to be covered. Fifteen flaps (21.1 percent) suffered partial necrosis, which did not compromise the final result, and another three (4.2 percent) showed total loss. The flap in question has great mobility and versatility, allowing the treatment of specific areas of the lower limb, without sacrificing important arteries or mobilizing structures that might bring about functional deficits.

### SMAS fusion zones determine the subfascial and subcutaneous anatomy of the human face: fascial spaces, fat compartments, and models of facial aging [^115YUcSU]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fusion zones between superficial fascia and deep fascia have been recognized by surgical anatomists since 1938. Anatomical dissection performed by the author suggested that additional superficial fascia fusion zones exist.

Objectives

A study was performed to evaluate and define fusion zones between the superficial and the deep fascia.

Methods

Dissection of fresh and minimally preserved cadavers was performed using the accepted technique for defining anatomic spaces: dye injection combined with cross-sectional anatomical dissection.

Results

This study identified bilaminar membranes traveling from deep to superficial fascia at consistent locations in all specimens. These membranes exist as fusion zones between superficial and deep fascia, and are referred to as SMAS fusion zones.

Conclusions

Nerves, blood vessels and lymphatics transition between the deep and superficial fascia of the face by traveling along and within these membranes, a construct that provides stability and minimizes shear. Bilaminar subfascial membranes continue into the subcutaneous tissues as unilaminar septa on their way to skin. This three-dimensional lattice of interlocking horizontal, vertical, and oblique membranes defines the anatomic boundaries of the fascial spaces as well as the deep and superficial fat compartments of the face. This information facilitates accurate volume augmentation; helps to avoid facial nerve injury; and provides the conceptual basis for understanding jowls as a manifestation of enlargement of the buccal space that occurs with age.

### Prefabricated thin flap using the transversalis fascia as a carrier [^112G5suf]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

To harvest a thin flap from the groin and hypogastric area, the authors developed a new prefabricated flap using the transversalis fascia as a carrier. The transversalis fascia is a very thin and abundantly vascularized tissue nourished by the deep inferior epigastric vessels. Flap prefabrication was performed by inserting the transversalis fascia between the thinly undermined skin flap and the tissue expander placed beneath the skin flap, followed by a pretransfer delay procedure around the flap. After a 3-week interval, the flap was transplanted with no complications, such as congestion and thrombus of anastomosis. By using this technique, it was possible to elevate an equally thin flap from the groin and hypogastric area while avoiding morbidity of the donor site.

### Influences of age, gender, and body mass index on the depth of the superficial fascia of the arm and thigh [^112R3Rxm]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonsurgical skin-tightening procedures are increasing in popularity because of their noninvasiveness as the energy is transdermally applied to the subcutaneous tissues.

Objective

To provide precise data on the depth of the superficial fascia for potentially safer and better targeted treatments of arms and thighs.

Methods

One hundred fifty Caucasian individuals were investigated with an equal distribution of men and women (each n = 75) and a balanced distribution of age (n = 30 per decade). Ultrasound-based measurements were conducted, measuring the distance between skin and the superficial fascia in the posterior arm and the anterior, medial, and posterior thigh.

Results

Deep to the skin, 5 layers were consistently and bilaterally identified in both sexes: skin, superficial fat, superficial fascia, deep fat, and deep fascia. The overall mean distance between the skin surface and the superficial fascia was for the posterior arm 4.38 ± 0.9 mm; range (2.60–6.70), for the anterior thigh 7.90 ± 2.3 mm range (3.50–13.20), for the medial thigh 5.74 ± 1.2 mm range (3.10–8.20), and for the posterior thigh 7.77 ± 3.2 mm range (3.60–14.50).

Conclusion

Knowing the precise depth of the superficial fascia for nonsurgical skin-tightening procedures could potentially guide practitioners toward safer and more effective outcomes.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116djHb9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on necrotizing fasciitis:

- **Definition**: Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening infectious disease involving the skin fascia and subcutaneous tissue.
- **Pathophysiology**: Typical microbiological etiologies include Group A Streptococcus (48%), S. aureus (22%), gram-negative bacteria (21%), Clostridium species (5%), and anerobic organisms (3%). A port of entry for infection may result from a traumatic injury, surgical intervention, or minor skin or mucosal breach (including skin tears, abrasions, lacerations, and insect bites).
- **Epidemiology**: The estimated incidence of necrotizing fasciitis is 4 cases per 100,000 person-years in the US. Immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and malignancy increase the risk of necrotizing fasciitis.
- **Disease course**: Exotoxins released by pathogens cause local tissue damage resulting in erythema and swelling, which further progresses to eccyhmoses and bullae. Platelet-leucocyte aggregation causes microvascular occlusion, with involvement of deeper tissues and larger venules and arterioles, leading to necrosis, sepsis, shock, multiorgan failure, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, the overall mortality rate for necrotizing fasciitis-related death is 0.48 per 100,000 person-years.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^117Wahhm]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Controversy exists over the superficial fascia of the breast and the nature of the anatomy of the inframammary fold. Much has been written in the past 200 years concerning the superficial fascia and inframammary fold, with major disagreement over whether or not it should be considered a ligament or not. – There is also disagreement in the literature over the existence of one or two layers of superficial fascia in the breast region of the chest. Haagenson, in his book Diseases of the Breast, states: "The superficial layer of this fascia is a very delicate but definite structure which will be seen only by the surgeon who looks sharply for it and who keeps the operative field dry enough to permit its identification. The anatomist in his dissecting room is usually unable to identify it". We have used tumescent anesthesia, injected both in the subglandular space and subcutaneously, to achieve the bloodless field required to find this layer throughout the breast. The only part of the breast where it is absent is the anterior lamina annulus.

### Fascial tissue research in sports medicine: from molecules to tissue adaptation, injury and diagnostics: consensus statement [^111YexyN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The fascial system builds a three-dimensional continuum of soft, collagen-containing, loose and dense fibrous connective tissue that permeates the body and enables all body systems to operate in an integrated manner. Injuries to the fascial system cause a significant loss of performance in recreational exercise as well as high-performance sports, and could have a potential role in the development and perpetuation of musculoskeletal disorders, including lower back pain. Fascial tissues deserve more detailed attention in the field of sports medicine. A better understanding of their adaptation dynamics to mechanical loading as well as to biochemical conditions promises valuable improvements in terms of injury prevention, athletic performance and sports-related rehabilitation. This consensus statement reflects the state of knowledge regarding the role of fascial tissues in the discipline of sports medicine. It aims to (1) provide an overview of the contemporary state of knowledge regarding the fascial system from the microlevel (molecular and cellular responses) to the macrolevel (mechanical properties), (2) summarise the responses of the fascial system to altered loading (physical exercise), to injury and other physiological challenges including ageing, (3) outline the methods available to study the fascial system, and (4) highlight the contemporary view of interventions that target fascial tissue in sport and exercise medicine. Advancing this field will require a coordinated effort of researchers and clinicians combining mechanobiology, exercise physiology and improved assessment technologies.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors… [^116e5Ety]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Lipomas Lipomas are slow-growing, benign mesenchymal tumors enclosed by a thin fibrous capsule. They closely resemble normal fat and are the most common type of soft tissue tumor. They are usually subcutaneous but may occur in any organ because they are mesenchymal. They are generally asymptomatic but may become irritated with trauma or produce local obstructive symptoms in the airway or gastrointestinal tract. Their prevalence is 1%. 9 Lipomas must be clinically differentiated from other tumors. The primary differential diagnosis in a subcutaneous mass is a sebaceous cyst or abscess. Lipomas are soft, flesh-colored nodules that are easily moveable under the overlying skin. Sebaceous cysts are generally identifiable by a central punctum, and abscesses can be identified by the presence of warmth, redness, and pain. Ultrasonography is increasingly used to aid in the diagnosis of lipomas.

High-frequency ultrasonography can provide high-resolution images of subcutaneous tumors and surrounding structures. They may grow to 1 to 2 cm over weeks or months. There is a slower involution phase over several months, leaving a scar if not excised early in its course. Keratoacanthomas generally occur later in life on sun-exposed areas, primarily the face, arms, and legs. They are attributed to sun exposure, cigarette smoking, human papillomavirus infection, genetic factors, trauma, and chemical carcinogens. Dermatofibromas Dermatofibromas result from idiopathic benign proliferation of fibroblasts. Generally located on the lower extremities, they may develop at any cutaneous site and range in size from 3 to 10 mm. They are four times more common in women, and most develop between 20 and 50 years of age. They are usually asymptomatic, although pruritus and tenderness can be present.

Epidermal Inclusion Cysts Epidermal inclusion cysts are the most common type of cutaneous cyst. They are discrete nodules resulting from the implantation and proliferation of epidermal elements within the dermis. However, they display no sebaceous component and are not truly sebaceous cysts. They typically present on the head, neck, or trunk, and may remain stable or enlarge over time.

### The superficial musculoaponeurotic system: does It really exist as an anatomical entity? [^113AKmcg]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

One might ask what exactly is lifted in a deep-plane face-lift dissection other than skin and subcutaneous fat in the absence of a layer 3 aponeurosis in the midcheek? A deep-plane dissection occurs within the most superficial part of the deep fascia (in which the facial nerves run more deeply) between its intrinsically horizontally oriented connective tissue (Fig. 9). This typical mille-feuille structure explains the ease of dissecting in the deep plane and lifting the surgical SMAS layer, which includes the most superficial part of the deep fascia. With the deep-plane dissection in the posterior midcheek area, it may be a delicate art to define the correct level, in the most superficial part of the deep fascia. This requires surgical experience; therefore, it requires teaching for surgeons in training. Anterior to the masseter, in the buccal and anterior midcheek, the dissection is simply "deep subcutaneous" as previously stated by Hamra.

Fig. 9.
Histologic sample of the midcheek demonstrating that the OOc is connected to the platysma muscle not by a distinct aponeurotic layer 3, but by the more three-dimensional connective tissue within the deep and superficial fascia layer. The red dotted line demonstrates the location of deep -plane dissection. A deep-plane face-lift dissection involves a dissection within the intrinsically horizontally oriented connective tissue of the deep fascia, but superficial to the level where the facial nerves run. The nerves are still safe, being situated deeper within the deep fascia (yellow arrows and circles). This typical deep fascial structure explains the ease of maintaining a horizontal dissection plane and lifting the surgical SMAS flap. The illustration of the deep and superficial fascia further elucidates the reality. Published with permission from Dr. Levent Efe. Copyright © 2023 Levent Efe.

### Three-dimensional radiofrequency tissue tightening: a proposed mechanism and applications for body contouring [^115igDyq]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fig. 8
Skin contraction behavior during RF energy delivery at different time points

Table 1 summarizes the results on subcutaneous tissue contraction. From the results one can see that the strongest contraction response was observed in adipose tissue containing septal connective tissue and reticular collagen fibers encasing fat cells. The contraction temperature threshold was the highest for dermis. It is clear that the immediate contraction of dermal collagen is not possible to achieve without a skin burn, which happened when the epidermal temperature exceeded 45°C. Fascia and septa can be heated to these high, optimal contraction temperatures, but it can be done only in a minimally invasive transcutaneous manner that deposits the thermal RF energy directly into the adipose tissue and subdermal space, thus avoiding heating the epidermal surfaces.

Table 1
Average displacement and contraction threshold

The contraction temperatures of collagen in our ex vivo study were in the same range reported for other collagenous tissues. We observed tissue contraction in the area with a diameter of 2 cm, which corresponds to a spherical contraction volume of 4.2 cm³. Knowing the tissue volume and deposited energy before the start of contraction, we can estimate the energy density required for each cubic centimeter of treated tissue to reach tissue contraction effects. We can calculate that for 1 L of adipose tissue up to 48.3 kJ is required to start to see immediate and significant collagen contraction. These calculations of tissue energy needed to initiate adipose contraction are consistent with empirical data obtained with LAL treatment where energy from 50 up to 100 kJ is recommended for treatment of the abdominal area.

In vivo clinical monitoring of temperature in the adipose tissue and on the epidermal surface should allow the physician to predict more accurately the thermal treatment times and reduce the risk of thermal injuries.

### Understanding the interplay between skin, fascia, and muscles of the midface in facial aging [^115Tin9E]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical, minimally-invasive, and non-invasive aesthetic procedures try to ameliorate the signs of facial aging, but also focus on enhancing various individual features of beauty in each patient. Herein, the midface plays a central role due to its location but also its importance for the aesthetic perception and facial expression.

Objective

To date, no study has investigated the interplay between facial muscles and its connecting subdermal architecture during facial aging to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the middle face.

Materials and Methods

A total of 76 subjects, consisting of 30 males (39.5%) and 46 females (60.5%) with a mean age of 42.2 (18.7) years [range 19–80] and a mean BMI of 24.6 (3.7) kg/m² [range 18–35], were enrolled in this investigation. Cutometry (skin aging), 3D skin displacement analyses (subdermal connective tissue aging), and sEMG (muscle aging) analyses were utilized.

Results

The results revealed that overall skin firmness increased, and skin elasticity decreased (p < 0.001), sEMG signal of the investigated muscles decreased (p < 0.001), whereas midfacial mobility remained unaltered (p = 0.722).

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that midfacial aging is a measurable effect when utilizing individual measurement modalities for assessing skin, subdermal fascia, and midfacial muscles. The function of midfacial muscles revealed a potential threshold effect, which is not reached during midfacial aging due to the unchanged soft tissue mobility at older age. However, to understand its clinical presentation all midfacial soft tissues need to be factored in and a holistic picture needs to be created.

### Reflections on osteopathic fascia treatment in the peripheral nervous system [^115wXywD]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The peripheral nerves are composed of several layers of fascial tissue, which can become a source of pain if they fail in their ability to slide. It is only recently that fascial osteopathy research has been aimed at understanding what happens to the fascia following treatment and, as a result of the first studies, it has been possible to highlight some of the benefits, including a reduction in local pain and inflammation. The osteopathic approach to the fascial system of the peripheral nerve does not have a grounding in scientific research, being based only on the clinical experience of individual operators, despite the use of peripheral nerve palpation as a method for the evaluation and testing of the nerve's function. The authors wish to encourage the initiation of new research in the fields of academic and clinical osteopathy that is aimed at quantifying the possible benefits a patient may derive from osteopathic treatment of the peripheral nerve.

### Multicenter evaluation of frequency and impact of activity infiltration in PET imaging, including microscale modeling of skin-absorbed dose [^111CS42x]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Critical to the dosimetric context of radiopharmaceutical infiltration is an understanding of the macroanatomy and microanatomy of the skin, as well as their respective thicknesses and associated fluid dynamics. The highly proliferative and radiation-sensitive epidermis, with a thickness of 50–70 μm, is the dose-critical structure. Beneath the epidermis are the largely acellular papillary dermis (∼15 μm) and reticular dermis (∼1,000 μm). The papillary dermis and reticular dermis consist primarily of dense, fibrous connective tissue with little volumetric expansion capability. Beneath the dermis lies the subcutaneous fat layer, with a small proportion of structural connective tissue. Subcutaneous tissue is lightly cellular and highly deformable. Its thickness increases with patient fat content, varying between 1 and 10 mm or more. Veins with diameters large enough for cannulization lie at the base of the subcutaneous tissue and are just superior to muscle fascia. The skin anatomy and dimensions used are illustrated in Figure 1. Monte Carlo simulations performed in this work, accounting for the anatomic distribution of infiltrating activity on absorbed dose to different skin components, should provide a deeper understanding of the potential for deterministic radiation effects after radiopharmaceutical infiltration.

FIGURE 1.
Schematic of skin anatomy with primary dimensions used in Monte Carlo absorbed dose calculations.

We hypothesize that the quantitative analysis of this large and diverse PET imaging patient cohort will better define the frequency and clinical impact of infiltrations, specifically as relates to the 3 adverse event categories (tissue damage, diminished diagnostic image quality, and quantitative accuracy). We further hypothesize that Monte Carlo–based absorbed dose calculations using patient-specific infiltration activities and geometry will better inform potential tissue damage models both in PET and, by inference, in other nuclear medicine applications.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^115MtzjA]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The system of fascia that surrounds the corpus mammae, and encases it in two layers of fat and fascia, is named the superficial fascia system of the breast. Its anchorage to the deep fascia of the chest at the breast's perimeter is the circummammary ligament. The Cooper ligaments, which are specialized vertical cutaneous ligaments, travel from the posterior lamina fascia, through the breast gland and anterior lamina, to anchor in the skin. The circummammary ligament acts as the passage that arteries and nerves travel through on their way to the breast parenchyma and nipple-areola. The superficial fascia system is responsible for the shape of the breast. Stretching and relaxing of the superficial fascia system, through aging or after surgery, along with variable amounts of support from the underlying chest wall, leads to breast ptosis. An intimate knowledge of this system is foundational to both reconstructive and cosmetic breast surgery.

### Reflections on osteopathic fascia treatment in the peripheral nervous system [^1133rRQ7]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^115rTuxd]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The first reports of superficial fascia began in the early nineteenth century with the description by Scarpa and Camper of layers of fascia and fat between the muscle and skin. In 1840, Sir Astley Cooper published his book, On the Anatomy of the Breast. Cooper wrote, concerning the fascia mammae, that it contained two layers, one anterior to the breast gland and one posterior to it. He described "ligamenta suspensoria", which connected to the skin and muscle. On the anterior surface of the breast, these ligaments, "form little petals, like a blooming rose, turned forwards to the skin, in the depressions between them the fat is lodged". On the borders of the breast he said, "[The] clavicular and sternal margin makes smooth radii, but the axillary and abdominal margin turns upon itself and forms a hem".

In another passage from his book he states, "In a large and fat person, the breast is far removed from the skin, and from the pectoralis major muscle, by the immense quantity of adipose matter placed before and behind the gland, and in the intervening structures". These "intervening structures" were further described: "The fat is also deposited behind the breast, in the posterior layer of fascia, and in the ligamentous or fascial loops which connect the breast to the aponeurosis of the pectoralis major muscle".

This concept of superficial fascia fusing with deep structures is not new in other anatomical regions, such as the face and neck. Stuzin et al. described zones of adherence in the face, between the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) and deep fascia and periosteum, in the justification of the face lift techniques popularized in the 1990s. More recently, Pessapublished his research on facial anatomy and concluded: "SMAS fusion zones exist as bi-laminar membranes, travel from the deep to superficial fascia, and determine the anatomic boundaries of the fat compartments and anatomic spaces". Elsewhere, he states that these zones of adherence are the location of nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatics, which travel from deep to superficial planes into the SMAS fat and mimetic muscles. The zones of adherence thus prevent shearing of these structures with movement.

### Abdominal wall partitioning (the accordion effect) for reconstruction of major defects: a retrospective review of 10 patients [^116sSJtX]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Ten patients underwent abdominal wall reconstruction using the technique of abdominal wall partitioning. All defects were closed in the midline by approximating fascia to fascia with the assistance of a general surgeon. One patient had skin grafted small bowel. Five patients had chronically infected mesh and previous failed attempts at repair. Four patients had large ventral hernias following gastric reduction operations and massive weight loss. No defect in any dimension was less than 20 cm. All patients had secure abdominal wall repair by reconstruction of a midline anchor for the abdominal wall musculature. One patient was lost to follow-up after 3 weeks. The average follow-up time for the remaining nine patients was 18.6 months (range, 6 months to 4.7 years). One patient required readmission to the hospital for management of a limited area of skin necrosis. Two patients had minor wound infections, and three patients had subcutaneous seromas, all of which were managed on an outpatient basis. One patient developed a 2 × 2 cm subxiphoid hernia recurrence. Technical details include subcutaneous undermining of the abdominal skin to the anterior axillary lines bilaterally, mobilization of the viscera to expose the white lines of Toldt bilaterally, and parallel, parasagittal, staggered releases of the transversalis fascia, transversalis muscle, external oblique fascia, external oblique muscle, and rectus fascia. These multiple releases allow expansion and translation of the abdominal wall by an accordion-like effect. This accordion-like effect allows closure of abdominal wall defects that are substantially larger than what can be closed with current techniques.

### Salvage of ear framework exposure following autologous microtia reconstruction: repair strategy for each location of exposure [^113gMoLq]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complications of total auricular reconstruction is exposure of the ear framework. Various reconstruction methods have been reported depending on the location and size of exposed cartilage. This report describes a safe reconstruction method for each exposed part of the grafted ear framework. From January 2019 to August 2021, 2 cases (4 areas) of framework exposure were observed following autologous microtia reconstruction. The first case developed 2 small areas of skin necrosis on the anterior helix and lower antihelix to concha. The former was reconstructed with a temporal fascia flap and the latter with a local transposition flap. The second case also developed 2 small areas of skin necrosis on the posterior helix and lower antihelix to concha. The former was sutured directly and the latter with a local transposition flap. However, both wounds recurred due to flap necrosis and the cartilage was exposed again. The 3rd operation was performed by covering both wounds with a posterior auricular turnover flap and skin graft. In both cases, the exposed framework was completely covered with the flaps, and the reconstructed ears showed well-defined convolutions. Covering exposed cartilage with a local flap with a random pattern of blood circulation is convenient because no additional skin grafts are required. However, the blood circulation of the flaps is inadequate when an elongated flap is required; consequently, flap necrosis may occur. On the other hand, a temporal fascia flap and posterior auricular flap, which have axillary pattern blood circulation, are considered to be safer. We believe that it is safe to use a temporal fascia flap for cartilage exposure in the upper half of the auricle, and a posterior auricular turnover flap for the lower half.

### Clinical evaluation of 310 abdominoplasties and measurement of scar level [^115sT4zc]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The hypothetical basis for Scarpa fascia preservation is that a dissection plane superficial to the Scarpa fascia preserves vascular and lymphatic structures. Anatomic studies have examined this possibility. Friedman et alfound that most lymphatic vessels are located superficially; only 9.4% of the lymphatic vessels were contained within the Scarpa fascia. Tourani et al, in a cadaveric study, concluded that Scarpa fascia preservation would not preserve the lower abdominal lymphatic collectors.

There is a downside to Scarpa fascia preservation. By leaving this fatty layer intact, the abdominal flap must be draped over a bulge, limiting its mobility and making it more difficult to achieve a low flap repair (Fig. 12). Proponents of Scarpa fascia preservation suggest that this layer is not very thick, which may be true in a thin patient. However, this is not the case in a patient who is overweight. Patients with body mass indices greater than 25 kg/m² represent a large number of patients who present for abdominoplasty, including this study (mean body mass index, 28.1 kg/m²). Saldanha et aldescribe open liposuction to reduce the bulk created by the preserved tissue layer.

The quality of the wound closure may be compromised. Costa-Ferreira et alreported a trend toward more wound healing problems among patients treated with Scarpa fascia preservation. Indeed, a suboptimal scar is apparent in a photograph depicting this method (Fig. 9). Even if there was a benefit in preserving the Scarpa fascia and reducing the risk of a temporary fluid collection that can be easily managed in the office, that advantage must be weighed against a long-term aesthetic compromise.

### Subcutaneous closure versus no subcutaneous closure after non-caesarean surgical procedures [^113G98kf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Most surgical procedures involve a cut in the skin that allows the surgeon to gain access to the surgical site. Most surgical wounds are closed fully at the end of the procedure, and this review focuses on these. The human body has multiple layers of tissues, and the skin is the outermost of these layers. The loose connective tissue just beneath the skin is called subcutaneous tissue, and this generally contains fat. There is uncertainty about closure of subcutaneous tissue after surgery: some surgeons advocate closure of subcutaneous tissue, as they consider this closes dead space and leads to a decrease in wound complications; others consider closure of subcutaneous tissue to be an unnecessary step that increases operating time and involves the use of additional suture material without offering any benefit.

Objectives

To compare the benefits (such as decreased wound-related complications) and consequences (such as increased operating time) of subcutaneous closure compared with no subcutaneous closure in participants undergoing non-caesarean surgical procedures.

Search Methods

In August 2013 we searched the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 29 August, 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to August Week 3 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations August 28, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 34); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 23 August 2013). We did not restrict studies with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing subcutaneous closure with no subcutaneous closure irrespective of the nature of the suture material(s) or whether continuous or interrupted sutures were used. We included all RCTs in the analysis, regardless of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing binary (dichotomous) outcomes between the groups and calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model and random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Six of the trials provided data for this review and all of these were at high risk of bias. Six trials randomised a total of 815 participants to subcutaneous closure (410 participants) or no subcutaneous closure (405 participants). Overall, 7.7% of participants (63/815 of participants) developed superficial surgical site infections and there was no clear evidence of a difference between the two intervention groups (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; very low quality evidence). Only two trials reported superficial wound dehiscence, with 7.9% (17/215) of participants developing the problem. It is not clear whether the lack of reporting of this outcome in other trials was because it did not occur, or was not measured. There was no clear evidence of a between-group difference in the proportion of participants who developed superficial wound dehiscence in the trials that reported this outcome (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.41; very low quality evidence). Only one trial reported deep wound dehiscence, which occurred in 8.3% (5/60) of participants. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants who developed deep wound dehiscence between the two groups (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.11; very low quality evidence). Three trials reported the length of hospital stay and found no significant difference between groups (MD 0.10 days; 95% CI -0.45 to 0.64; very low quality evidence). We do not know whether this review reveals a lack of effect or lack of evidence of effect. The confidence intervals for these outcomes were wide, and significant benefits or harms from subcutaneous closure cannot be ruled out. In addition, none of the trials assessed the impact of subcutaneous closure on quality of life, long-term patient outcomes (the follow-up period in the trials varied between one week and two months after surgery) or financial implications to the healthcare provider.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently evidence of very low quality which is insufficient to support or refute subcutaneous closure after non-caesarean operations. The use of subcutaneous closure has the potential to affect patient outcomes and utilisation of healthcare resources. Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary.

### Surgical technique used in the UK for native tissue anterior pelvic organ prolapse repair (VaST) [^1172xZJM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Surgical terminology

Most surgeons used the term 'fascia' to describe the tissue they were repairing. However, the concept of fascia was not uniform amongst surgeons. Some described fascia as being part of the vaginal skin (Surgeon X), others described it as a separate entity (Surgeon L) and some expressed uncertainty about what the tissue was or what planes they were operating in (Surgeon J).

Surgeon X: It's part of the skin; there are two layers of the fascia.

Surgeon L: Well it's a layer and you can separate it off the skin.

Surgeon J: I can get into a plane quite comfortably… I think I'm leaving most of the 'fascia' on the bladder, but would I describe it as a bladder tissue or a vaginal tissue? I don't know. Can I sit on the fence on that one?

For the purpose of the above descriptions the histological terms were used to ensure clarity of the plane being described. From observations and later video analysis it was concluded that when surgeons used the term 'fascia' this corresponded to the layer of the vagina which in histological terms is called the vaginal muscularis. There were cases however, where the verbal description of infiltration placement and depth of dissection did not match the investigator's view. Despite surgeons' description of infiltration placement in a specific plane, it was the investigators' view that just over a third of surgeons placed the fluid in multiple planes rather than in one distinctive plane (Table 2).

As outlined in the descriptions above, surgeons used varying terms to describe the caudal and cephalic aspects of the incisions, the lateral extent of dissection and the fascial and skin suture methods. The terms used to describe the repair of the vaginal muscularis included plication, buttressing and repair; in some instances these terms were used interchangeably by the same surgeon.

### The fascial structure of the breast: new findings on the anatomy of the inframammary fold [^111dmMPq]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The inframammary fold defines the shape and structure of the breast, especially in women. As the inframammary fold is placed between the fifth and sixth ribs, the ligaments or fascia are thought to attach from these ribs. However, the previous literature on what structures constitute the inframammary fold does not provide sufficient knowledge for reconstructing the natural form of the fold. This study aimed to clarify the structure that involves the inframammary fold. Ten sides of five formalin-fixed, adult Asian cadaveric breasts were studied. Upon dissection of the breast, including the ribs, the fat lobules were removed while preserving the septal structures under the microscope. The fascial structures were observed grossly and radiographically. A multilayered fascial structure was noted from the dermis near the inframammary fold, anchored to the deep fascia of the pectoralis major muscle mainly at the height of the fourth rib and partially of the fifth rib, from the outside of the nipple to the linea axillaris media, where the fold could be clearly observed. Additionally, the fat lobules around the inframammary fold were subdivided by thin septa closer to the dermis, and they fused posteriorly and upward to form this fascial structure. The inframammary fold was not formed by an adhesion directly under the sixth rib, but by the skin "hanging" from the height of the fourth and fifth ribs due to the multilayered fascial structure that repeatedly fused and dissociated and the changes in the size of the fat lobules. This new anatomical finding may help in inframammary fold reconstruction.

### The deep fascia of the head and neck revisited: relationship with the facial nerve and implications for rhytidectomy [^114pdUQE]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This cadaver study clearly demonstrated that the layer deep to the superficial fascia, called the deep fascia, is not a thin aponeurotic layer but a thick, multilamellar layer that includes the deep fat and embeds the facial nerve branches.

Subdivision of the deep fascia into a more superficial "areolar layer" (layer 4, spaces and deep fat layer) and a "deep fascia proper" (layer 5) (eg, masseter fascia) is not possible because they are inseparable as complete layers, even with microscopic magnification of the histologic specimen (Fig. 5 second from right, and Fig. 6). Thus, the conclusion that the layer deep to the superficial fascia and mimetic muscles ("SMAS") is the deep fascia as the classic anatomical descriptions had previously described: simply, the deep subcutaneous fat layer. In contrast to elsewhere in the body, where the deep fascia is relatively thin, the variation of space between the flat mimetic muscle and the more complex deeper structures in the face and neck might secondarily stipulate the deep fascia to be locally thicker.

### Viewpoints on the way to the consensus session: where does insulin resistance start? The adipose tissue [^1164rQpY]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Adiposity and fat topography

In humans, white adipose tissue is found in the subcutaneous, intra-abdominal, epicardial, extramyocellular, perivascular, lymphnodal, retroorbital, and facial regions. It also is present in bone marrow and mammary gland. Brown fat occurs during fetal development, with some remnants in the mediastinal, paravertebral, and neck areas in adults. Each depot has specific gene expression and different responsiveness to nutrients, hormones, and temperature, thereby reflecting specific tasks. Metabolically active fat in the intra-abdominal, intermuscular, perivascular, and epicardial areas may serve for the immediate provision of energy to respective vital organs (i.e. liver, heart, vessels, and skeletal muscle). By directly providing FAs to the liver, visceral fat also represents a source of ketones for the brain. Omental fat acts as a sensor that regulates the disposal of ingested nutrients and directs their delivery from the liver to the rest of the body, with feedback to the brainstem through autonomic neurons. Deep subcutaneous adipose tissue in the trunk is restrained by the fascia superficialis and can nourish the underlying extensive muscle apparatus. These adipose depots share similarities in adipocytokine and FA release patterns and display resistance to insulin. Compared with visceral adipocytes, superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue primarily serves as a storage organ, consistent with its anatomical location, response to the anabolic action of insulin, and its more efficient proliferation and differentiation in vitro. Thus, relative insulin resistance in intra-abdominal fat and intrathoracic and intermuscular depots optimizes their ability to release energy to proximal organs, while limiting the expansion upon surrounding structures.

### Fascial tissue research in sports medicine: from molecules to tissue adaptation, injury and diagnostics: consensus statement [^112Cq2Rk]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Terminology and definitions

The term fascia was originally used to describe a sheet or band of soft connective tissue that attaches, surrounds and separates internal organs and skeletal muscles. Advancing research on the physiological and pathophysiological behaviours of a range of connective tissues has revealed that this definition is too restrictive. Understanding of mechanical aspects of connective tissue function depends on consideration of a host of interconnected and interwoven connective tissues beyond these sheets or bands, and there is enormous potential gain from understanding the convergence of biology underpinning adaptation, function and pathology.

The fascial system includes adipose tissue, adventitia, neurovascular sheaths, aponeuroses, deep and superficial fasciae, dermis, epineurium, joint capsules, ligaments, membranes, meninges, myofascial expansions, periostea, retinacula, septa, tendons (including endotendon/peritendon/epitendon/paratendon), visceral fasciae, and all the intramuscular and intermuscular connective tissues, including endomysium/perimysium/epimysium.

With its diverse components, the fascial system builds a three-dimensional continuum of soft, collagen-containing, loose and dense fibrous connective tissue that permeates the body and enables all body systems to operate in an integrated manner (figure 1). In contrast, the morphological/histological definition describes fascia as 'a sheet, or any other dissectible aggregations of connective tissue that forms beneath the skin to attach, enclose, and separate muscles and other internal organs'. The proposed terminology distinguishing the terms 'fascia' and 'fascial system' allows for the precise identification of individual structures as well as grouping them for functional purposes.

Figure 1
Components of the fascial system. The fascial system includes large aponeuroses like the first layer of the thoracolumbar fascia (A), but also a myriad of enveloping containers around and within skeletal muscles (B) and most other organs of the body. The internal structure of fascial tissues is dominated by collagen fibres which are embedded in a semiliquid ground substance (C).

### Understanding the three-dimensional anatomy of the superficial lymphatics of the limbs [^111DPFRd]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are minimal data in the current literature regarding the depth of the superficial lymphatic collectors of the limbs in relation to the various subcutaneous tissue layers.

Methods

Injection, microdissection, radiographic, and histologic studies of the superficial lymphatics and the subcutaneous tissues of 32 limbs from 15 human cadavers were performed.

Results

Five layers were consistently identified in the integument of all the upper and lower limb specimens: (1) skin, (2) subcutaneous fat, (3) superficial fascia, (4) loose areolar tissue, and (5) deep fascia. Layer 2 was further divided into superficial (2a) and deep (2c) compartments by a thin, transparent, horizontal septum (layer 2b). The main superficial veins and the superficial nerves coursed in layer 4. The lymphatic collectors were found at layer 2c and layer 4.

Conclusions

The use of consistent nomenclature to describe the subcutaneous tissue layers facilitates a greater understanding and discussion of the anatomy. In lymphovenous anastomosis for the treatment of lymphedema, indocyanine green lymphography is an unreliable method for identification of the superficial collectors of the thigh. The medial proximal leg, the dorsum of the wrist over the anatomical snuffbox, and the volar proximal forearm provide suitable areas for locating superficial collectors with nearby matching size veins. In vertical medial thigh lift, choosing a dissection plane superficial to the great saphenous vein is unlikely to preserve the collectors of the ventromedial bundle.

### The deep fascia of the head and neck revisited: relationship with the facial nerve and implications for rhytidectomy [^111WquFr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The deep subcutaneous layer is called simply the deep fascia of the region where situated, e.g. deep cervical fascia.

— B. B. Gallaudet (1931)

The fascial layers of the head and neck have been the subject of controversy since their first description by Burns in 1811. From a functional and surgical perspective, the soft tissue of the head and neck is considered in five concentric layers (Fig. 1): layer 1, skin; layer 2, subcutaneous fat; layer 3, superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS)–platysma; layer 4, the deep plane with spaces and ligaments; and layer 5, the deep fascia. As a convention, the superficial fascia is considered as layers 2 and 3 together. The deep fascia (layer 5) is situated deep to the mimetic muscles (SMAS-platysma, layer 3), separated only by a virtual plane of spaces and ligaments (layer 4), which is understood to provide both gliding movement and stability. There is some ambiguity of the nomenclature, with layer 4 recently described as the "loose areolar connective tissue layer" including the deep fat compartments.

Fig. 1.
Traditional textbook description of the layered anatomy of the face (left) and our current understanding (right). Traditionally, the concentric layers were as follows: layer 1, skin; layer 2, subcutaneous fat; layer 3, SMAS-platysma; layer 4, deep plane with spaces and ligaments; and layer 5, deep fascia. It is currently understood that the SMAS is not a complete anatomical layer and is only present in the form of the mimetic muscles but not the aponeurosis between the muscles. The deep fascia is not only a thin fibrous fascia, but a three-dimensional layer with fibrofatty and areolar tissue areas (spaces). The deep plane dissection (layer 4) is not a separate anatomical layer, but a potential dissection in the most superficial part of the deep fascia.

### CDC-cercarial dermatitis-frequently asked questions (FAQs) [^115481B4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What is swimmer's itch. Swimmer's itch, also called cercarial dermatitis, appears as a skin rash caused by an allergic reaction to certain microscopic parasites that infect some birds and mammals. These parasites are released from infected snails into fresh and salt water. While the parasite's preferred host is the specific bird or mammal, if the parasite comes into contact with a swimmer, it burrows into the skin causing an allergic reaction and rash. Swimmer's itch is found throughout the world and is more frequent during summer months. If the eggs land in or are washed into the water, the eggs hatch, releasing small, free-swimming microscopic larvae. These larvae swim in the water in search of a certain species of aquatic snail. If the larvae find one of these snails, they infect the snail, multiply and undergo further development.

Infected snails release a different type of microscopic larvae into the water. This larval form then swims about searching for a suitable host to continue the lifecycle. Although humans are not suitable hosts, the microscopic larvae burrow into the swimmer's skin, and may cause an allergic reaction and rash. Because these larvae cannot develop inside a human, they soon die. What are the signs and symptoms of swimmer's itch. Symptoms of swimmer's itch may include:

- tingling, burning, or itching of the skin
- small reddish pimples
- small blisters Within minutes to days after swimming in contaminated water, you may experience tingling, burning, or itching of the skin. Small reddish pimples appear within twelve hours. Pimples may develop into small blisters. Scratching the areas may result in secondary bacterial infections. Itching may last up to a week or more, but will gradually go away.

Who is at risk for swimmer's itch. Anyone who swims or wades in infested water may be at risk. Larvae are more likely to be present in shallow water by the shoreline. Children are most often affected because they tend to swim, wade, and play in the shallow water more than adults. Also, they are less likely to towel dry themselves when leaving the water. Is it safe to swim in my swimming pool. Yes. As long as your swimming pool is well maintained and chlorinated, there is no risk of swimmer's itch. The appropriate snails must be present in order for swimmer's itch to occur.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^113hYpof]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome — key diagnostic features include pain with passive stretch and paraesthesias, and in patients with an unreliable or unobtainable clinical exam measurement of intracompartmental pressures may be beneficial; a gradient of < 30 mmHg between the diastolic blood pressure and intracompartmental pressure is predictive of patients who would benefit from a fasciotomy. When a compartment syndrome is suspected, early fasciotomies should be performed using long, generous skin and fascial incisions to release all the compartments of the involved limb, and those incisions should be left open at the conclusion of the procedure.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^1154rPcS]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The corpus mammae is itself in a fascial layer that separates the anterior and posterior lamina fat, and is referred to as the corpus lamina (Fig. 4). (See Video, Supplemental Digital Content 9, which demonstrates breast reduction, showing the corpus lamina at the inframammary fold, available in the "Related Videos" section of the full-text article on PRSJournal.com or, for Ovid users, available at.) The entire structure of fat and fascia, surrounding the corpus mammae, is the superficial fascia system, which is responsible for the shape of the breast and thus is the key to breast aesthetics.

Fig. 4.
Corpus lamina. The corpus lamina is a layer of fascia separating the anterior and posterior lamina, and is the layer of fascia that the corpus mammae develops in. Inferior to the corpus, at the inframammary fold, it can be seen as a layer of fascia (being held up with forceps).

The circummammary ligament provides a fixed passage for nerves, lymphatics, and large-caliber blood vessels. Just as it is in the face, the zone of adherence surrounding the breast is the channel that blood vessels and nerves travel through on their way to the breast. The major arterial supply comes from the chest wall and travels through the collagen fibers of the circummammary ligament before entering the breast (Figs. 5 and 6).

### Superficial fascia in the cheek and the superficial musculoaponeurotic system [^1179JxjF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The origins and validity of the term "superficial musculoaponeurotic system" (SMAS) is reviewed. Gray stated the superficial fascia connects the skin with the deep or aponeurotic fascia and consists of fibro-areolar tissue. Hollinshead wrote superficial fascia exists throughout the body and contains a variable amount of fat. In the head and neck, it encloses voluntary muscles in its deep portion. Skoog found superficial fascia was fixed to the dense, deep fascia by fibrous adhesions in the temporal, preauricular, and parotid area. Mitz stated "There is a 'superficial muscular and aponeurotic system' (SMAS) in the parotid and cheek areas". SMAS has an intimate relationship with the entire superficial fascia of the head and neck and divides the subcutaneous fat into 2 layers. Wassef found a continuous fibromuscular layer at the deep limit of the "subcutis", which corresponded to the "superficial fascia". Nakajima reported the subcutaneous adipofascial tissue was made up of 2 adipofascial layers. Macchi found 2 different fibroadipose connective layers bounded to the laminar connective tissue layer (SMAS). In the cheek, Hwang found horizontal fibrous connective tissues (membranous layer of superficial fascia) divided the superficial fascia into the superficial fatty layer and the deep fatty layer. Recently, Mitz explained the reason for the term SMAS. The "musculo+aponeurotic" component is based on histology of muscle cells, including the risorius, in the same structure to be surgically consistent. The aponeurotic cells belong to the same surgical layer. SMAS is not sufficient to replace the old term "superficial fascia" of the cheek area.

### Anatomy of the facial glideplanes, deep plane spaces, and ligaments: implications for surgical and nonsurgical lifting procedures [^111N5d34]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Mobility and Glideplanes

In contrast to traditional descriptions of a separate anatomic layer 4, containing spaces and ligaments and providing gliding, no separate layer 4 can be distinguished from the deep fascial layer 5 by anatomic dissection, histologic analysis, or sheet plastination. Apart from local exceptions in the midcheek, the mimetic muscles (layer 3), where present, separate the subcutaneous fat of the superficial fascia (layer 2) from the deeper fat within the deep fascia (layer 5). The connective tissue of the superficial fascia features fibrous retinacula cutis that are oriented perpendicular to the skin as they connect the mimetic muscles to the skin, and inherently have limited mobility. In contrast, the connective tissue of the deep fascia features deep retinacula fibers that are oriented largely parallel to the skin in an arrangement of multi-lamellated sheets. Because of this arrangement, deep fascial movement is a multiplanar phenomenon: a minor amount of gliding between adjacent sheets adds up to significant range of motion with a collective of sheets. (See Video [online], which demonstrates the mobility of the deep fascia in the area of the premasseter space.) The deep fascia usually features fat interspersed between the sheets (fibrofatty), whereas in the specialized areas of the spaces, these sheets are closely stacked without fat interspersion (mille-feuille–like) (the term mille-feuille is French for "1000 petals or sheets", referring to the layering of pastry, the effect of which in pastry is to be airy and light).

### The deep fascia of the head and neck revisited: relationship with the facial nerve and implications for rhytidectomy [^112bBNQB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

The deep fascia is important in face-lift surgery, as it is relied on for protection of the facial nerve during surgical dissection. Lack of consistency with the term may be attributable to the term deep fascia having two different meanings. It is a specific type of connective tissue, classically thin, fibrous, and flat, whereas in the description of the layers of the face and neck, the deep fascia layer includes all the connective tissue deep to the superficial fascia layer. This cadaver study was undertaken to clarify the layered anatomy of the face and neck and its relationship with the facial nerve branches.

Methods:

Preliminary dissections and macrosectioning, followed by a conclusive series of standardized layered dissections, histologic analysis, and sheet plastination, were performed on 50 cadaver heads.

Results:

The deep fascia is thin in convex areas of the face and neck, and thicker in concave areas; it is interspersed with deep fat. The facial nerve branches, after emerging from the parotid gland, are embedded within the deep fascia, not deep to it. They transition from deep within the deep fascia at specific locations to course in the most superficial part of the deep fascia where they underlie their target superficial fascia muscles and are at risk from deep plane face-lift dissection.

Conclusions:

The deep fascia layer is a multilamellar fibrofatty layer of variable thickness, which includes the deep fat in which the facial nerve branches are embedded. In deep plane face-lift surgery, dissection must be performed in the most superficial level of this deep fascia layer.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112XpKn6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — incidence, classification, and timing: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common adverse events affecting hospitalized surgical patients, with an average incidence of SSI of 2.6%, accounting for 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSIs are divided into the categories of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ/space SSI. Superficial incisional SSIs involve only the subcutaneous space between the skin and underlying muscular fascia, occur within 30 days of the surgery, and are documented with at least 1 of the following: purulent incisional drainage; positive culture of aseptically obtained fluid or tissue from the superficial wound; local signs and symptoms of pain or tenderness, swelling, and erythema after the incision is opened by the surgeon; or diagnosis of SSI by the attending surgeon or physician. A deep incisional infection involves the deeper soft tissue and occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if a prosthesis was inserted, and an organ/space SSI has the same time constraints and evidence for infection and may involve any part of the anatomy other than the original surgical incision. Flat, erythematous skin changes can occur around or near a surgical incision during the first week without swelling or wound drainage, most resolve without any treatment, and the cause may relate to tape sensitivity or other local tissue insult not involving bacteria. Antibiotics begun immediately postoperatively or continued for long periods after the procedure do not prevent or cure this inflammation or infection; therefore, the suspicion of possible SSI does not justify use of antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and measures such as opening the wound. SSIs rarely occur during the first 48 hours after surgery and are almost always due to S. pyogenes or Clostridium species when they do; after 48 hours, SSI is a more common source of fever and, by 4 days after surgery, a fever is equally likely to be caused by an SSI or by another infection or other unknown sources.

### The superficial musculoaponeurotic system: does It really exist as an anatomical entity? [^116U46uo]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethical approval for the project was granted by the Human Ethics Advisory Groups of the University of Melbourne for the feasibility study and the Queensland University of Technology for the conclusive study (project nos. 14243 and LR 2021–4306–4761, respectively). First, a review of the articles retained by the search "(superficial musculoaponeurotic system[title] or SMAS [title] or superficial fascia[title]) AND (anatomy or morphology or histology)" in PubMed was completed in May of 2021 to study what proportion of authors used each definition of SMAS. This review was updated in January of 2022.

A feasibility study was performed on 21 cadavers, 15 embalmed and six fresh-frozen (male, n = 10; female, n = 11; mean age, 76 years; SD, 14 years), to learn how to most effectively study this area of complex anatomy. This involved layered dissections, face-lift dissections, and band-saw macrosectioning in various planes.

Based on this feasibility study, a definitive study was set up on 29 cadavers. A series of standardized dissections was performed with loupe magnification on 15 fresh (nonfrozen) cadavers and one embalmed cadaver (male, n = 9; female, n = 7; mean age, 78 years; SD, 13 years; body mass index, 26 kg/m²; SD, 5 kg/m²). The two sides of the same cadaver were dissected using a different technique to better record the fascial layers. To establish the surgical presentation of the SMAS layer, a surgical composite face-lift dissection was performed on the first side using the technique of the senior author (B.C.M.), as described previously. On the contralateral side, the previously described methodologic sharp layered dissection technique was used to investigate the layered anatomy and, specifically, layer 3. By dissecting at the superficial surface and subsequently the deep surface of the platysma upward, and the galea, frontalis, superficial temporal fascia (STF), and orbicularis oculi (OOc) downward to the midcheek and zygomaticus major (ZMa), the extent, continuity, and connections of this layer could be investigated. Finally, objective technical investigations were used to complement the dissection findings and provide evidence at a microscopic level:

### Management of gynecomastia in patients with different body types: considerations on 312 consecutive treated cases [^1173ESH1]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The most attractive standard of male chest shows extreme definition of the pectoralis major especially at the inferior lateral border of the muscle, where the muscle clearly imprints the skin with an edge which marks the chest obliquely from the sternum upward up to the axilla. To respect this standard, the adipocutaneous flap must be as thin as possible to get the maximum contouring of the pectoralis area even if the low percentage of fatty tissue leaves any postoperative irregularities more visible and, consequently, more frequent in groups A and B rather than in overweight patients. In this group, the thickness of the flap must take into consideration the rest of the pectoralis area so as to place the nipple areola complex in an appropriate position. However, direct adhesion between the dermis and the muscular fascia must be strictly avoided to reduce the incidence of postoperative irregularities, especially during muscular contraction. Liposuction is absolutely helpful to regularize the surrounding area reducing the recurrence of irregularities. To achieve a more masculine appearance of the chest, all the patients required small areolas with low nipple projection. When the skin elasticity is optimal, it may be achieved through an aggressive thinning of the subdermal tissue that usually makes it shrink almost instantly, so that the need of full-circle incision is less frequent. Obviously, the respect of the dermal plexus is mandatory in order to avoid necrosis. This procedure also decreases modifications of the areola in terms of widening and shrinking related to temperature variations. Complete excision of the gland seems to be the most appropriate treatment of gynecomastia in order to avoid recurrence. Incomplete excision means that the remaining breast tissue may continue to act as a hyperactive target organ in the face of continued endogenous hormonal stimulation. We retain that en bloc excision helps to perform the complete removal of the gland allowing, at the same time, a more regular harvesting of the adipocutaneous flap. Postoperative scarring may represent a very sensitive issue for the patients and may cause permanent embarrassment. Wide undermining of the skin flap ensures better readaptation of the flap to the new pectoralis profile even in case of abundant skin. The exuberant skin may be fixed to the deep fascia through 3 quilting polyglactin absorbable stitches, placed at 9 to 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock above the areola, distributing the redundancy onto the wider area, reducing at the same time the dead space, namely, hematomas, seroma, and the recurrence to extra-areola scars. Maintaining the gland inside the pocket, until completely detached, makes also the shortest surgical access comfortable for the surgeon during the procedure. A circumareolar approach may be reserved to lift upwards the nipple areola complex in case of ptosis, to shrink wider areolas or to reduce redundant skin in case of inelastic tissue thus limiting the vertical incision to a small number of cases.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, more specifically with respect to management of local disease, surgical excision, BAD 2021 guidelines recommend to ensure at least a 1-mm histological clearance of CSCC excisions at all margins by including sufficient peripheral and deep tissues:

- ensure the deep margin is within the next clear surgical plane for mobile lesions, and the excision includes the galea on the scalp

- consider including fascia, muscle, bone, and/or other underlying structures, determined clinically and/or by imaging, to achieve an uninvolved deep histological margin in patients with deeply infiltrating or fixed lesions at any site

- consider performing excision of a further, orientated, deep-margin specimen where possible in case of clinical concern at the time of resection that the resection is close or incomplete.

### The relationship of the fronto-temporal branches of the facial nerve to the fascias of the temporal region: a literature review applied to practical anatomical dissection [^116SF8W5]. Neurosurgical Review (2007). Low credibility.

The understanding of the course of the facial nerve and its relationship to the different connective tissue layers in the temporal area is paramount to preserving this nerve during surgery. But the use of different nomenclatures for anatomical structures such as for the different fascial layers or fat pads in the temporal region as well as the difference in description of the course of the fronto-temporal branches of the facial nerve in relationship to the fascial layers can lead to confusion. Therefore we have reviewed the literature about this topic and tried to apply the information to practical anatomical dissection.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^1164FtmN]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Würinger et al. commit the same error, seeing the breast supported by three ligaments forming a suspensory sling, which their dissection technique artificially creates by dividing the circummammary ligament and ignoring the connective tissue adherence of the superior breast. Furthermore, their anatomical studies were on postmenopausal female cadavers in their seventies and eighties. These specimens undoubtedly had parenchymal involution and fatty replacement, and ptosis and connective tissue decline. They may have mistaken an atrophic anteroinferior capsule of the corpus mammae for a septum. In a fatty depleted, postmenopausal breast, this could seem to divide the breast gland into a superior two-thirds and an inferior third. In obese patients with large breasts, the anterior lamella fat below could be confused for additional breast tissue. Studies by Carlson et al. in the mid 1990s showed less than 0.02 percent of breast glandular tissue present in this region. We believe Würinger et al. found a portion of the "ligamentous suspension of the mammary gland", that does not travel through the gland, but instead underneath it.

This vision of breast anatomy, supported by our videos, fits into the greater scheme of anatomical order seen in the rest of the body. It suggests opportunity for further study of the ontology of the breast, and the dynamic forces that change the shape of the breast throughout life.

### Plication of the brachial fascia: an important step in dermolipectomy procedures of the arm [^114ajK58]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Both the aging process and postobesity deformities of the upper extremities are associated with lipodystrophy, loss of muscular mass, weakening of the fascia, and skin laxity. Many different surgical procedures have been described to correct these deformities, but most of them have limitations, particularly with respect to postsurgical scarring.

Objectives

The authors present a technique in which plication of the brachial fascia is performed before dermolipectomy in order to obtain greater flap advancement and limit tension on the final scars, thereby diminishing postoperative complications.

Methods

From 1997 to 2007, the authors retrospectively followed 41 female patients who had undergone brachial dermolipectomy procedures associated with plication of the fascia on the internal aspect of the arm. This technique permitted greater advancement of the entire thickness of the flap, creating a better support for the flap with larger skin resection. The distance between the two incisions was also shortened, reducing dead space between the two planes, the incidence of seromas, and tension on the suture line.

Results

The scarring complications caused by tension on the skin were eliminated. Therefore, our complication rate was low, with only three cases of small foci of dehiscence, two cases of seroma, and four cases of hypertrophic scars in certain areas. The mean follow-up period was seven years, during which 92% of the patients were pleased with their outcomes.

Conclusions

The described surgical approach provided excellent overall extremity contour with favorable scars while simultaneously addressing axillary contour and forearm deformities when present.

### Skin and wound infections: an overview… [^1163CEaK]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Bacterial Skin Infections Skin infections are often the result of a break in the integrity of the skin. Bacterial skin infections include erythrasma and related diseases, impetigo, ecthyma, folliculitis, erysipelas and cellulitis. While there are certainly other bacterial skin infections, they are either uncommon or result from systemic illness. These types of bacterial skin infections are not discussed in this article. Staphylococcus aureus or streptococci. Patients report skin lesions, often with associated adenopathy, but have minimal systemic signs and symptoms. Impetigo may present in two forms: small vesicles with a honey-colored crust or purulent-appearing bullae. Bullous impetigo is less common than small-vesicle impetigo. S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and, in coastal areas, halophilic Vibrio species. Cellulitis is a relatively deep infection, generally resulting from a break in the skin. It involves subcutaneous spaces in addition to the dermis.

The patient presents with pain, redness, warmth and systemic symptoms such as fever. The affected area appears red and is warm to the touch, but the erythema does not have a sharply demarcated border. Lymphangitic streaking and lymphadenopathy are commonly present. Lymphatic drainage is damaged by cellulitis, which renders the area predisposed to subsequent infections. Plantar warts may be quite painful when they occur on weight-bearing surfaces. Multiple plantar warts may combine to become a large "mosaic wart. " Flat warts are small, 1- to 4-mm papules, often occurring on the face and legs of children and adolescents. While inconspicuous at first, they propagate rapidly, often into the hundreds. Tinea Capitis. Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp, generally occurring in infants and children.

The lesions have three characteristic appearances: diffuse, fine scaling; patchy alopecia with broken hairs and inflammatory, boggy, purulent nodules. Diffuse scaling is associated with Microsporum audouinii and is more common in white boys than in other patient groups. With Microsporum infections, the hair shaft fluoresces under black light, and this test is useful in distinguishing this infection from seborrheic dermatitis.

### Fasciae of the musculoskeletal system: normal anatomy and MR patterns of involvement in autoimmune diseases [^1154pvGf]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Definition of the fascial system

Fasciae were defined as " masses of connective tissue large enough to be visible to the unaided eye " according to the Grey's Anatomy textbook. This historical concept has evolved depending on the variable importance attributed to the gross or microscopic anatomy, to the histological composition and to the functions of the fascial system. According to a most recent definition, "the fascial system consists of the three-dimensional continuum of soft, collagen-containing, loose and dense fibrous connective tissues that permeate the body. It incorporates elements such as adipose tissue, adventitiae and neurovascular sheaths, aponeuroses, deep and superficial fasciae, epineurium, joint capsules, ligaments, membranes, meninges, myofascial expansions, periostea, retinacula, septa, tendons, visceral fasciae, and all the intramuscular and intermuscular connective tissues including endo-/peri-/epimysium. The fascial system interpenetrates and surrounds all organs, muscles, bones and nerve fibers, endowing the body with a functional structure, and providing an environment that enables all body systems to operate in an integrated manner". This holistic approach emphasizes the links between all membranous components of the skeleton from the skin to the periosteum and from the body to the limb extremities.

### The superficial musculoaponeurotic system: does It really exist as an anatomical entity? [^112MYm6r]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

A review of the literature concluded that what defines the SMAS is the presence of a distinct aponeurotic/membranous layer (layer 3) connecting the different mimetic muscles that separates the subcutaneous fat of the superficial fascia from the deeper fibroareolar fat of the deep fascia. Because such a layer is absent except over part of the parotid gland (which is not even undermined in most deep plane or sub-SMAS techniques), the SMAS as a distinct anatomical entity does not exist.

The term SMAS continues to have a surgical "meaning", as it is the name given to a surgically created multilayer flap that is formed between variable level subcutaneous plane dissection and a deep-plane dissection. This SMAS flap includes the deep part of the subcutaneous fat (of the superficial fascia) and the superficial part of the deep fat (of the deep fascia) together with the flat superficial mimetic muscles, such as the platysma and the OOc.

### Peripheral nerve microanatomy: new insights into possible mechanisms for block success [^111Xn2Sy]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Postmortem histology and in vivo, animal-based ultra-high-definition microultrasound demonstrate a complex array of non-communicating adipose tissue compartments enclosed by fascia. Classic nerve block mechanisms and histology do not consider this tissue. Injected local anesthetic agents can occupy any of these adipose compartments, which may explain the significant differences in outcomes such as success rates, onset time, block density, duration of nerve block, and secondary continuous block failure. Furthermore, these adipose tissue compartments may influence injection pressures, making conclusions about needle tip location unreliable. This educational review will explain the neural anatomy associated with these fatty compartments in detail and suggest how they may affect block outcomes.

Fig. 12.
Artist illustration of the general architecture, variable thickness, and connectedness of the deep fascia. Note the variation of thickness of the deep fascia from over the masseter (MM) and SCM regions to more anteriorly. In the area of the lower masseter, this creates the so-called lower premasseter space, an area that is easy to dissect. However, in the area over the SCM, this results in the so-called cervical retaining ligaments, an adhesion zone between the muscle fascia of the platysma and the SCM.

The understanding that the PAF is part of layer 3 (SMAS) explains why inadvertent dissection deep to the PAF leads into the subplatysmal plane more anteriorly and not in a plane deep to the masseter fascia, which would be the case were the PAF continuous with the masseteric fascia. The continuity between the platysma and the PAF gives the surgeon the option to include this part of the fascia in the composite flap, provided the parotid capsule and parenchyma are preserved [See Video 2 (online), which demonstrates how an incision and dissection of the PAF leads to a subplatysmal plane and not a plane deep to the masseter fascia. (Courtesy of Dr. Andres Freschi.)] Although the PAF provides a strong handle to suspend the face-lift flap, it implicates the need for precise dissection with the potential risk for the development of parotid fistula. Moreover, the posterior part of the PAF is commonly used as the place to secure the mobilized composite face-lift flap and might therefore be more useful if left in situ.

### The care of patients with varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^1134YSKr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Lower-limb superficial venous anatomy and terminology — great saphenous vein (GSV) and small saphenous vein (SSV): Superficial veins of the lower limbs are located between the deep fascia and the skin, and the main superficial veins are the GSV and the SSV. The GSV originates from the medial superficial veins of the dorsum of the foot and ascends in front of the medial malleolus along the medial border of the tibia next to the saphenous nerve; posterior and anterior accessory saphenous veins exist in the calf and thigh. The saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is the confluence of superficial inguinal veins comprising the GSV and the superficial circumflex iliac, superficial epigastric, and external pudendal veins, and in the thigh the GSV lies in the saphenous subcompartment between the saphenous fascia and the deep fascia. The SSV originates from the lateral side of the foot and drains into the popliteal vein usually just proximal to the knee crease, and the intersaphenous vein (vein of Giacomini) in the posterior thigh connects the SSV with the GSV.

### Foot care in epidermolysis bullosa: evidence-based guideline [^117FEyqu]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperkeratosis may be defined as hard, thickened areas of the skin located on the tip of toes or between the toes and soles underneath the metatarsal heads. 3 If the skin is hard and yellow with a nucleus or plug of keratin, it is called a corn or helom. 3 A corn or callus will appear red if it is inflamed. 3 The central core of a corn extends downwards in a cone‐shaped point and can cause notable pain and discomfort. Patients will often compare this to walking on a small stone or pebble. 3 A corn or callus enlarges if there is continuing friction as a direct hyperproliferative response of keratinocytes. 3 Hyperkeratosis is, to a limited extent, protective. 3 However, in EB, blisters can form under the thickened tissue and painful cracks can develop (Appendix S1 a; see Supporting Information). The FHSQ is currently being used in studies with patients with EB with hyperkeratosis (Quality evidence level 1−). 10

### In vivo analysis of the superficial and deep fascia [^114FgWii]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Key risk factors for hypertrophic scarring and surgical-site infections are high-tension wounds, fat necrosis, and dead space. All could be prevented by appropriate superficial fascia suturing. However, the as-yet poorly researched anatomy of the superficial fascia should be delineated. This study is the first to quantify the superficial fascia throughout the human body in vivo.

Methods

Ultrasound was used to analyze the superficial and deep fascia of 10 volunteers at 73 points on 11 body regions, including the upper and lower trunk and limbs. Number, thickness and percentage of superficial fascia layers, and deep fascia and dermis thickness, were measured at each point.

Results

Seven hundred thirty ultrasound images were analyzed. Body regions varied markedly in terms of subcutaneous variables. Posterior chest had the thickest deep fascia and dermis and the highest average superficial fascia layer thickness [0.6 mm (95 percent CI, 0.6 to 0.7 mm)]. Anterior chest had the most superficial fascia layers [3.7 (95 percent CI, 3.5 to 3.8)]. Posterior and anterior chest had among the highest percentage of superficial fascia. Abdomen and especially gluteus had a low percentage of superficial fascia. Covariate analyses confirmed that posterior and anterior chest generally had higher superficial fascia content than gluteus and abdomen (both p < 0.001). They also showed that the dermis in the posterior and anterior chest increased proportionally to total fascia thickness.

Conclusions

The superficial fascia, deep fascia, and dermis tend to be thick in high-tension areas such as the upper trunk. A site-specific surgical approach is recommended for subcutaneous sutures.

Clinical Relevance Statement

Understanding the anatomical distribution of the superficial fascia and deep fascia will help surgeons optimize subcutaneous fasciae suturing, thereby potentially reducing the incidence of surgical-site infections and hypertrophic scars.

### Chimeric free flaps based on end-to-side anastomosis for complex lower extremity reconstruction [^117Ff59L]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Flap Selection

ALTF and PAPF have different features. ALTFs have a large area, thick fat, sufficient muscle, and long pedicles, whereas PAPFs have a relatively small area, thin fat, donor bone, and short pedicles. Therefore, for patients with less than 4-cm bone defect, we choose autogenous bone transplantation. If the defect size is ≥ 4 cm, chimeric PAPF is preferred; for large area defect, chimeric ALTF can be added. Defects with small/medium soft tissue defects and pedicles < 8 cm can be covered by chimeric PAPF. Small/medium defects requiring pedicles ≥ 8 cm and large/multiple defects are flexibly reconstructed with chimeric ALTF (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1
Flap selection.

The chimeric flaps included independent skin, fascia, muscle, or bone flaps containing individual paddles supplied by separate perforators with no restriction on each pedicle rotation. The flap dimensions were designed larger than the defects with a slightly longer pedicle. Skin flaps were used to cover exposed vessels and bones; fascia flaps were used to cover tendinous tissues. Bone flaps and muscle flaps were designed to eliminate dead space or enhance resistance to infection.

Anterograde flaps have an angle of less than 90 degrees between the blood flow direction of donor blood vessels and recipient blood vessels, whereas retrograde flaps have an angle of more than 90 degrees between them. Because the perforation point of the anterior tibial artery (aTA) is often located in the upper third of the tibia, the ETS anastomosis in tibial plateau fractures is often selected below this, resulting in a retrograde blood supply. The distal 2/3 of the aTA and dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) were usually selected as recipient arteries because of the easy dissection. Other arteries, such as the posterior tibial artery (pTA) and peroneal artery (PA), can also be selected (Fig. 2).

### Anatomy of the facial glideplanes, deep plane spaces, and ligaments: implications for surgical and nonsurgical lifting procedures [^112apfCB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Retaining Ligaments

All superficial tissues are connected to the deeper tissues by fascial connective tissue. The skin is connected to the mimetic muscles and the deep fascia by retinacula cutis within the subcutaneous fat of the superficial fascia (layer 2); the superficial fascia including the mimetic muscles are connected to the deeper structures by deep retinacula of the deep fascia (layer 5). These retinacula fibers are dispersed throughout the entire face, not only in the locations of the retaining ligaments.

Two types of ligamentous attachments — real retaining ligaments (not necessarily osteocutaneous) and adhesion zones — are present in the face; the other ligaments are classified as pseudoligaments (surgical artifacts).

Retaining ligaments could be considered dense collections of deep retinacula, which make them stand out against the surrounding tissues. Being more substantial, they are encountered using any type of dissection (sharp or blunt) and are seen on histologic images and occasionally on sheet plastination. The periorbital ligaments, including the lateral orbital thickening, orbicularis retaining, and tear trough ligaments, as well as the main zygomatic ligaments and lower key masseteric ligaments, are true anatomic retaining ligaments. The superior temporal septum is the origin of the auriculares muscles on the superior temporal crest just beyond the border of the temporalis muscle. The inferior temporal septum marks the inferior boundary of the temporal space and marks the zone where the nerve transitions from within the deep fascia of the midcheek (deep to the deep plane dissection) to within the innominate fascia of the temple (superficial to the deep plane dissection).
Adhesion zones are larger areas where the mimetic muscle layer is adherent to the deep fascia or to the skin. Deep plane gliding cannot occur in these zones. A posterior adhesion zone and a perioral adhesion zone are present (Fig. 6). The posterior adhesion zone comprises (1) the platysma–auricular fascia (PAF), where the primitive platysma adheres to the preauricular parotid capsule; (2) the platysma–auricular ligament (PAL), where the primitive platysma adheres to the mastoid process; and (3) the cervical retaining ligaments (CRLs), where the platysma fascia adheres to (or fuses with) the sternocleidomastoid fascia as the platysma obliquely crosses superficial to sternocleidomastoid. The perioral adhesion zone comprises the adhesion of all layers from mucosa to the skin in the area around the mouth. Its boundaries are the alar base superiorly, the nasolabial crease and labiomandibular crease laterally, and the submental crease inferiorly. This includes the chin.
Pseudoligaments (surgical artifacts) are areas featuring retinacula that are not stronger or denser than the surrounding connective tissue but can be isolated with a particular technique. They are not encountered with sharp layered anatomic dissection, nor are they visualized with technical investigations (histologic analysis and sheet plastination). Some pseudoligaments reflect the rigidity of the underlying structure to which the deep end of these retinacula cutis attach. An example of this is the mandibular ligament: the subcutaneous mandibular osteocutaneous ligament underlying the anterior portion of the jowl is simply the retinacula cutis attaching to the platysma, DLI, and DAO at their insertion on the mandible, while the anterior border of the jowl is the result of the direct insertion of these perioral muscles into the dermis, as described previously. Some pseudoligaments mark the border of the easily dissected mille-feuille deep fascia (spaces) where further blunt dissection is limited by the fibrofatty deep fascia. An example of this is the mandibular septum, which marks the end of the mille-feuille premasseter space and the start of the fibrofatty investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. Some pseudoligaments mark where the deep fascia curves deeper instead of its usual horizontal orientation. An example of this is the vertical row of masseteric ligaments at the anterior border of the masseter that appears this way because the masseter fascia follows the anterior border of the masseter to go deep to the buccopharyngeal fascia (Fig. 7). Because a deep plane dissection is within this deep fascia, the row of masseteric ligaments marks the border of the deep plane, anterior to which only a subcutaneous plane exists. Some pseudoligaments result from surgical blunt dissection within the regular fibrofatty deep fascia because blunt dissection in a connective tissue matrix causes compaction of the connective tissue toward the walls of the dissection, making these walls stouter and septum-like. Examples of this are the mandibular septum and the cervico-mental angle suspensory ligament.

Block histology showing the layered microanatomy of the facial soft tissues. In areas previously described as spaces, the deep retinacular fibers are arranged in multilamellated sheets that are parallel to the skin.

This block histology shows a specimen with the facial soft-tissue spaces opened while leaving the retaining ligaments located between these spaces intact. In areas of fixation by retaining ligaments, the dense collection of deep retinacular fibers are orientated more vertically, fixating the superficial fascia at these locations.

The deep plane face lift is very effective in Asian patients and delivers natural and long-lasting aesthetic results.– The main barrier to more widespread adoption of the deep plane face-lift technique in Asian patients is the perceived higher risk of facial nerve injury. With the step-by-step dissection approach explained in this article, the risk of nerve injury is minimized. The refined dissection, mobilization, fixation, and skin inset allows the surgeon to predictably harness the potential of this procedure for Asian patients. The greater tendency for hypertrophic scarring in Asian patients is a significant problem. Conventional techniques that place tension on the skin closure often result in widened hypertrophic scars and pixie ear deformities. With the deep plane technique, the lifting tension is distributed across multiple points along the superficial fascia, which is securely anchored to the deep fascia. The skin flaps are quilted down with sutures, ensuring a tension-free skin closure. As demonstrated here, the incisions heal well, resulting in inconspicuous scars.

### Does the deep layer of the deep temporalis fascia really exist? [^1155RNDu]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

It has been widely accepted that a split of the deep temporal fascia occurs approximately 2 to 3 cm above the zygomatic arch and extends into the superficial and deep layers. The deep layer of the deep temporal fascia is between the superficial temporal fat pad and the temporal muscle. However, during procedures, the authors noted the absence of the deep layer of the deep temporal fascia between the superficial temporal fat pad and the temporal muscle. This prospective study was conducted to clarify the presence or absence of a deep layer of the deep temporal fascia.

Materials and Methods

Anatomic layers of the soft tissues of the temporal region, with reference to the deep temporal fascia, were investigated in 130 cases operated on for zygomaticofacial fractures using the supratemporal approach from June 2013 to June 2017.

Results

Of 130 surgeries, the authors found the absence of a thick, obviously identifiable, fascial layer between the superficial temporal fat pad and the temporal muscle. In fact, the authors found nothing above the temporal muscle in most cases. In a few cases, the authors observed only a small amount of scattered loose connective tissue between the superficial temporal fat pad and the temporal muscle.

Conclusions

This clinical study showed the absence of a thick, obviously identifiable, fascial layer between the superficial temporal fat pad and the temporal muscle, which suggests that a "deep layer of the deep temporal fascia" might not exist.

### The postauricular fascia: classification, anatomy, and potential surgical applications [^113LkEyT]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

In recent times, there has been evolving interest in the fascial structure of the ear, especially in relation to otoplasty techniques. Although the fascial tissues used in these procedures are referred to as "postauricular/retroauricular fascia", the sparse anatomical studies that exist use this terminology to describe what is the adjacent thicker and more fibrous structure of the superficial temporal area continuous with the mastoid region, rather than the tissue actually used in these procedures which is adherent to the posterior surface of the ear. There are clear clinical differences in the properties of these two structures, and this study set out to identify the anatomical nature of these differences, looking in detail at the anatomy and vascularity of the fascia directly posterior and adherent to the ear itself, highlighting its unique properties, and how it interfaces with the rest of the fascia. We provide a nomenclature to differentiate the fascia adherent to the posterior of the ear (the intrinsic postauricular fascia) from the more fibrous tissues continuous with the scalp fascia (the extrinsic postauricular fascia). Clinical applications for the fascia are suggested based on the vascularity and anatomy described, and our clinical experience.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^114eVQHn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What are necrotizing infections?

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are life-threatening, invasive, soft-tissue infections with a necrotizing component involving any or all layers of the soft-tissue compartment, from the superficial dermis and subcutaneous tissue to the deeper fascia and muscle. The latter is most commonly called "necrotizing fasciitis".

The necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection should be always specified when classifying patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

Delay in diagnosis and delay in treatment of these infections increase the risk of mortality. Because of its aggressive character, NSTIs should always be differentiated from non-necrotizing infection. Several definitions were published over the last few years, and all these definitions can be confusing. NSTIs are defined by the presence of a spreading infection in any of the layers of the soft tissues (skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, deep fascia, or muscles) which is associated with the presence of necrosis of the layer(s) involved and hence requires surgical debridement. All NSTIs fulfill this definition and have common features in their clinical presentation and diagnosis, and most importantly, all of these infections by definition require surgical debridement. Therefore, labeling them with different terms does not serve a useful purpose and may in fact complicate management by delaying diagnosis and/or delaying surgical debridement.

### The deep fascia of the head and neck revisited: relationship with the facial nerve and implications for rhytidectomy [^114hQyBN]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The term deep fascia has two different meanings. For surgeons, deep fascia entities refer to thin but robust sheet-like connective tissues (eg, deep temporal fascia, sternomastoid fascia), which are typically depicted in standard anatomical illustrations as thin sheets of uniform thickness, in contrast to the surrounding adipose tissue of varying thickness. It is not well appreciated in the surgical literature that this description of sheet-like fascias differs from how classic anatomists of the nineteenth century originally used the term deep fascia, which was in the context of layers. Classically, the term superficial fascia was ascribed to the superficial subcutaneous fat layer, which also contains the mimetic muscle layer (eg, the platysma muscle in its deep portion in the cervical area). – The term deep fascia, in contrast, referred to the connective tissue layer deep to the superficial fascia, surrounding and supporting the viscera (eg, investing layer of the deep cervical fascia).

In face-lift surgery, the deep fascia of the face and neck is of fundamental importance, as surgeons rely on this fascia to protect the facial nerve branches during dissection. Traditional teaching describes the facial nerve branches as being located deep to the deep fascia, – although in certain locations, facial nerve branches have been described to be superficial to, or even within, the deep fascia. – The facial nerve branches are usually reported from a two-dimensional perspective (ie, their course and relationship with anatomical structures are reported), and the depth of the nerve relative to the fascial layers has remained less well described. From a surgical perspective, the depth of the branches throughout their trajectory from the parotid gland to the mimetic muscles is of major importance, as surgical dissection is "safe" up to the point where the dissection plane encounters the nerve.

To improve the safety of deep plane face-lift procedures, the course of the facial nerve was studied, specifically, its three-dimensional relationship with the layered fascias of the face. This study elucidates the structure of the deep fascia and explains the difference, if any, between the deep fascia and the deep fat layer (Fig. 1). The relationship of each facial nerve branch to the deep fascia is examined.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^1129kZMn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

Overall, we found no strong evidence of effect for either the use of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin suture, or closure versus non-closure if the subcutaneous fascia. There was very weak evidence to suggest that the combination of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with a non-absorbable skin suture was associated with a reduced risk of infection, but this finding should be interpreted with caution as no statistical adjustment has been made for multiple comparisons. Given low event rates and likelihood that any effect of the interventions is of small magnitude, future trials would have to be very large to properly investigate differences while accounting for any possible effect modification.

Comparison with published literature

We have shown that there is some weak evidence to suggest that the combined intervention of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin suturing with absorbable monofilament suture (Caprosyn™), is associated with an increased risk of postoperative wound infection, in comparison with subcutaneous fascia closure and skin suturing with non-absorbable monofilament suture (Prolene™). While previous studies have shown no statistically significant difference in wound infection rates when comparing the use of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin sutures, the combination of subcutaneous fascia closure (or non-closure) with different skin sutures has not been considered.

One possible reason for our findings is that the burden of absorbable suture material is related to the increased relative risk of wound infection, among women who underwent subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with absorbable suture. Both the suture used for subcutaneous fascia closure (Vicryl®), and the suture used for skin closure (Caprosyn™) are absorbable. Vicryl® is a poly-filament, braided absorbable synthetic suture, which is completely absorbed within 56–70 days. Caprosyn™ is a short-term absorbable monofilament suture, which is completely absorbed within 56 days. Whenever a foreign body such as a suture, is placed within tissue, it induces an inflammatory reaction. Absorption of absorbable suture material Vicryl® can cause tissue reactions that consist of free fluid, that may facilitate bacterial growth, and the congregation of macrophages and fibroblasts, lymphocytes and plasma cells, which gradually reduce in number and concentration postoperatively. Optimal wound healing requires an appropriate amount of tissue inflammation, however it is possible that the additive burden of concurrent tissue inflammatory responses is sufficient to result in excessive inflammation, decreased efficiency of removal of contaminating micro-organisms, and an increased risk of clinical wound infection.

### Identification, discrimination and heterogeneity of fibroblasts [^113tZZw3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Fibroblasts were first described in 1858 by Rudolf Virchow as cells located in connective tissue, a term coined already in 1830 by Johannes Peter Müller for the matter that connects and mechanically supports other tissues. In 1879, Matthias Duvall distinguished fibroblasts from epithelial cells within the mesenchyme of chick embryos, thereby adding to their demarcation. Progressively, it became clear that fibroblasts reside within all dense and loose fibrous connective tissues. Dense fibrous connective tissue makes up tendons, ligaments and fasciae of the musculoskeletal system. Loose fibrous connective tissue is located at many sites, including visceral organ capsules, beneath the epithelial linings of airways, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (laminae propria) and skin (dermis), in central nervous system meninges, and between parenchymal cells in muscle and adipose tissue. Fibroblasts are thus a major cellular component of the diverse fibrous connective tissues that disperse throughout our organs. Alongside endothelial and blood cells, fibroblasts are one of the most common and widespread cell types in our bodies.

The term fibroblast, used already more than 100 years ago by Ernst Zieglerand Alexander Maximow, deserves a comment, as the "-blast" suffix refers to morphological hallmarks of active protein synthesis. A key research goal of the early 20th century was to identify the cellular source of extracellular matrix (ECM) during tissue repair. In these studies, the quiescent fibroblasts of uninjured organs were sometimes referred to as fibrocytes, which displayed a small cytoplasm, few ribosomes and condensed chromatin, together suggesting low levels of protein synthesis. It was assumed that fibrocytes give rise to fibroblasts upon wounding, and conversely that fibroblasts differentiate into fibrocytes during healing. Perhaps due to limited interest in the quiescent cells, the original meaning of fibrocyte was progressively lost and fibroblast adopted as the common name irrespective of its state of activity. Fibrocyte later reappeared as the name for a circulating monocytes/macrophages-related antigen-presenting cell involved in tissue repair, (for review see ref.).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1151HDCN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — diagnosis and microbiology emphasize polymicrobial involvement and tissue-based confirmation. Numerous different anaerobic and aerobic organisms can be cultured from the involved fascial plane, with an average of 5 pathogens in each wound, and most originate from bowel or genitourinary flora. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show edema along the fascial plane, but sensitivity and specificity are ill defined, and in practice, clinical judgment is the most important element in diagnosis. A definitive bacteriologic diagnosis is best established by culture and Gram stain of deep tissue obtained at operation or by positive blood cultures; Gram-positive cocci in chains suggest Streptococcus and large gram-positive cocci in clusters suggest S. aureus. If there is no necrosis on exploratory incision, the procedure can be terminated with very little risk or morbidity, and while biopsy for frozen section analysis may be used, gross inspection usually suffices and biopsy alone may produce a false-negative result.

### The deep fascia of the head and neck revisited: relationship with the facial nerve and implications for rhytidectomy [^113c5gHg]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The deep fascia is important in face-lift surgery, as it is relied on for protection of the facial nerve during surgical dissection. Lack of consistency with the term may be attributable to the term deep fascia having two different meanings. It is a specific type of connective tissue, classically thin, fibrous, and flat, whereas in the description of the layers of the face and neck, the deep fascia layer includes all the connective tissue deep to the superficial fascia layer. This cadaver study was undertaken to clarify the layered anatomy of the face and neck and its relationship with the facial nerve branches.

Methods

Preliminary dissections and macrosectioning, followed by a conclusive series of standardized layered dissections, histologic analysis, and sheet plastination, were performed on 50 cadaver heads.

Results

The deep fascia is thin in convex areas of the face and neck, and thicker in concave areas; it is interspersed with deep fat. The facial nerve branches, after emerging from the parotid gland, are embedded within the deep fascia, not deep to it. They transition from deep within the deep fascia at specific locations to course in the most superficial part of the deep fascia where they underlie their target superficial fascia muscles and are at risk from deep plane face-lift dissection.

Conclusions

The deep fascia layer is a multilamellar fibrofatty layer of variable thickness, which includes the deep fat in which the facial nerve branches are embedded. In deep plane face-lift surgery, dissection must be performed in the most superficial level of this deep fascia layer.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^112v5XB6]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The final clue to the superficial fascia system of the breast, and its relation to the underlying chest wall, comes from an article published in 2001, by Rohrich et al.which described five "zones of adherence" between superficial fascia and underlying deep fascia of the thigh and buttocks. They state that the superficial fascia system, with its anchorage to deep fascia, shapes the soft tissue into buttocks, hips, saddlebag areas, and upper medial thigh fat pad. These discoveries laid a foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the superficial fascia system of the breast. This article attempts to connect the dots, so to speak, for the reader and expose the three-dimensional fascial network that encases, shapes, and supports the breast.

### Acupotomy for musculoskeletal pain: exploring therapeutic potential and future directions [^114W8PAe]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Role of Fascia in Musculoskeletal Pain Generation

The role of fascia in pain generation extends beyond its structural function. Fascia contains a rich supply of sensory nerve fibers, including thinly-myelinated Aδand unmyelinated C fibers. These nerve fibers detect and transmit nociceptive signals, contributing to pain perception. Fascia also mediates neurogenic inflammation, whereby neuropeptides and inflammatory mediators released from sensory nerve fibers trigger local inflammation and sensitization in musculoskeletal tissues. Relevant studies, have found that patients with fibromyalgia syndrome have higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels than those in the healthy population. Higher hs-CRP levels were significantly associated with higher symptom burden and more tender points. Recent research has also highlighted the concept of musculoskeletal chains, emphasizing the interconnectedness and continuity of musculoskeletal structures throughout the body. The musculoskeletal chains absorb the concept of myofascial chains and emphasizes the interconnectedness and continuity of musculoskeletal structures throughout the body. This challenges the traditional view of fascia as separate entities and underscores the importance of considering the entire musculoskeletal network in musculoskeletal pain assessment and treatment. Dysfunction or imbalance in one area of the chain can potentially impact other regions, contributing to pain and dysfunction. Understanding myofascial's role in pain generation is crucial for developing effective management strategies for musculoskeletal pain. Therapeutic interventions targeting myofascial aim to restore musculoskeletal mobility, release adhesions, and modulate pain signaling within musculoskeletal tissues. Addressing fascia dysfunction may offer an alternative treatment approach to reduce the musculoskeletal pain burden. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interplay between fascia and nociception.

### Fascial plane blocks: a narrative review of the literature [^112dKvVA]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fascial plane blocks (FPBs) are increasingly numerous and are often touted as effective solutions to many perioperative challenges facing anesthesiologists. As 'new' FPBs are being described, questions regarding their effectiveness remain unanswered as appropriate studies are lacking and publications are often limited to case discussions or technical reports. It is often unclear if newly named FPBs truly represent a novel intervention with new indications, or if these new publications describe mere ultrasound facilitated modifications of existing techniques. Here, we present broad concepts and potential mechanisms of FPB. In addition, we discuss major FPBs of (1) the extremities (2) the posterior torso and (3) the anterior torso. The characteristics, indications and a brief summary of the literature on these blocks is included. Finally, we provide an estimate of the overall level of evidence currently supporting individual approaches as FPBs continue to rapidly evolve.

### Preshaping DIEP flaps: simplifying and optimizing breast reconstruction aesthetics [^116svm6d]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

One key component of a successful autologous breast reconstruction is insetting the flap to accurately resemble an aesthetic breast. The authors describe a novel technique used to shape a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap into a coned breast mound before introducing it into the breast pocket. With the flap perfusing on the chest wall, an area of skin estimating the size and location of the skin paddle is marked. The skin to be buried is then deepithelialized. Once hemostasis is ensured, the shaping is performed. Two 2–0 polydioxanone sutures are anchored in the Scarpa fascia at the 10- and 2-o'clock positions and then run at the level of the Scarpa fascia to the 6-o'clock position. The two sutures are then cinched together to achieve the desired shape and then tied. The flap is then placed in the breast pocket and secured into place at the inferomedial and inferolateral corners, and at its cranial aspect. The size of the skin paddle can then be finalized. In the authors' series of 21 breast reconstructions in 11 patients using flap preshaping, they have not seen any compromise in flap perfusion, with one patient showing a small area of secondary fat necrosis. In addition, the flaps maintained their aesthetic breast shape throughout follow-up. The authors believe this technique for shaping inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps before inset into the breast pocket to be both safe and predictable, simplifying one of the more tedious aspects of autologous breast reconstruction.

### Head and neck fascia and compartments: no space for spaces [^115jFErc]. Head & Neck (2014). Low credibility.

An accurate understanding of the arrangement of cervical fascia and its associated compartments is essential for differential diagnosis, predicting the spread of disease, and surgical management. The purpose of this detailed review is to summarize the anatomic, clinical, and radiological literature to determine what is known about the arrangement of cervical fascia and to highlight controversies and consensus. The current terminology used to describe cervical fascia and compartments is replete with confusing synonyms and inconsistencies, creating important interdisciplinary differences in understanding. The term "spaces" is inappropriate. A modified nomenclature underpinned by evidence-based anatomic and radiologic findings is proposed. This should not only enhance our understanding of cervical anatomy but also facilitate clearer interdisciplinary communication.

### The anterior saphenous vein. part 2. anatomic considerations in normal and refluxing patients. endorsed by the American Vein and Lymphatic Society, the American Venous Forum, and the International Union of Phlebology [^114Zcngk]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, endovascular ablation has emerged as the best technique to treat truncal reflux whereas phlebectomy or sclerotherapy are the best option for varicose tributaries. Accordingly, the distinction between a truncal and a tributary vein is increasingly important in the treatment of superficial venous disease. This distinction was not well defined until the late 1990s. All superficial veins in the lower limbs were considered as surrounded by the amorphous subcutaneous fat until 1997 when it was demonstrated that the Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) courses for its entire length in a proper fascial compartment, deeply located in the subcutaneous tissue, known as the so-called " Saphenous Compartment " (SC). This compartment is delineated deeply by the muscular fascia and superficially by a portion of the Membranous Layer of the Subcutaneous Tissue that was called " saphenous fascia " (SF) (Figure 1). In 2001 the same planar anatomy and fascial relationships were demonstrated for the Small Saphenous Vein (SSV). The compartment of the GSV continues on the dorsum of the foot along the medial marginal vein, the dorsal arcuate vein and the lateral marginal vein to connect itself to the compartment of the SSV.

### Fascial tissue research in sports medicine: from molecules to tissue adaptation, injury and diagnostics: consensus statement [^117Db5ex]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Currently used diagnostic methods to examine fascial tissue structure and function

Producing a distortion of the measured tissue (eg, through compression or shear waves), elastography provides ultrasound images reflecting the relative hardness of the targeted area. Recently, the technique has been increasingly applied in musculoskeletal research. However, the existence of several different methods, lack of standardisation and frequent appearance of artefacts during measurements threaten the validity of achieved results. Without the use of elastography, the conventional ultrasound image can be reliably used to display and measure the morphology of fascial tissues, such as myofascial tissues, ligaments and tendons. Some initial studies have, moreover, attempted to quantify relative movement (eg, sliding of fascial layers and shear strain) using cross-correlation calculations.

Despite some initial applications to myofascial tissues, most data on ultrasound imaging are available for tendon measurements (figure 5). In the late 1990s, advancements made in the application of B-mode ultrasonography allowed quantification of the tensile deformation of human tendons, in vivo, based on tracking of anatomical features in the tendon when pulled on by the force exerted in the in-series muscle during static contraction. Unfortunately, the in vivo stiffness and Young's modulus results often disagree with findings from in vitro material tests, when forces and elongations are precisely controlled and measured. Errors are likely being caused by in vivo measurement simplifications in the quantification of both tendon deformation and the loading applied during the static muscle contraction. The former includes simplifications regarding the tendon's resting length, line of pull and uniformity in material properties. The latter includes simplifications regarding the effect of loading on tendon moment arm length, the effect of antagonist muscle coactivation and the uniformity in tendon cross-sectional area. Most of these simplifications can be avoided by appropriate measurements to quantify the neglected effects. In addition, recent developments in ultrasound shear-wave propagationand speckle trackinghave the potential to substantially improve experimental accuracy and physiological relevance of in vivo findings.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^116hmcHR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Excision depth guidance for invasive CM: The consensus opinion is that invasive CM should generally be excised to the depth of (but not including) the underlying muscular fascia, except in rare instances of deep primary CM that involves the fascia or underlying structures. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested whether shallower excision to the deep adipose layer affects local recurrence or survival. The working group acknowledges that most melanomas in situ and many thin T1 melanomas are excised within the adipose layer rather than to muscle fascia, but no data confirm whether this practice is safe or appropriate, particularly for invasive CM.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^116r8Ak2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

It has been two centuries since Petrus Camper identified superficial fascia and over 175 years since Sir Astley Cooper wrote his book on the anatomy of the breast. In the 1990s, Ted Lockwood taught us the importance of the superficial fascia layers in body contouring procedures he pioneered. These descriptions, however, fail to explain the three-dimensional fascial system in the breast. The authors set out to discover and describe a theory of superficial fascia structures responsible for breast shape.

Methods

The nature of the superficial fascia system that surrounds the breast and its attachments to the chest were studied in 12 cadaver breast dissections and in clinical cases of both cosmetic and reconstructive breast procedures.

Results

The authors found a three-dimensional, closed system of fascia and fat surrounding the corpus mammae, which attaches to the skin by means of specialized vertical cutaneous ligaments, or Cooper ligaments, and which attaches to the chest wall by means of a three-dimensional zone of adherence at the breast's periphery.

Conclusions

The breast is shaped by a three-dimensional, fibrofatty fascial system. Two layers of this system surround the corpus mammae and fuse together around it, and anchor it to the chest wall in a structure we have called the circummammary ligament.

### Anatomy of the facial glideplanes, deep plane spaces, and ligaments: implications for surgical and nonsurgical lifting procedures [^112TBY1H]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The History of Facial Stability and Mobility

Skoog, who was the first to access the deep plane surgically, concluded: "The undersurface of the platysma is not fixed to the deeper structures, and a potential space is present between the smooth fascia of the platysma and the external cervical fascia. This anatomic configuration allows the superficial layers to glide with the platysma over the deeper, fixed structures". With this report, the idea that a space existed beneath the mimetic muscles was born. An early attempt to explain the complex facial mobility by Mitz and Peyroniein the 1970s investigated the mimetic muscle layer and its connections to the skin. The description of the SMAS detailed the connectivity within the superficial fascia to the skin, but not its gliding over the deeper tissues.

With the introduction of the retaining ligaments, Furnasproposed that a select group of retaining ligaments provided the retaining function of the face, stating "they restrain the facial skin against gravitational changes", suggesting that the areas between the retaining ligaments did not help in retaining the overlying soft tissues. This hypothesis, which rapidly gained popularity in the plastic surgery community, went against the general anatomic principle in which countless small retinacula cutis fibers retain the superficial tissues to the deeper structures, as is the case in the rest of the body.

With the description of spaces by Mendelson et al.in 2002, the aforementioned hypothesis of facial areas without attachments was strengthened, with spaces being described as part of the human facial anatomy, evolved to allow mobility of the overlying mimetic muscles. The first space described was deep to the orbicularis oculi, which also marked the area of a black eye and a malar mound: "For the prezygomatic space to function to allow a gliding movement of the overlying orbicularis, the roof itself must be mobile and not directly attached to the underlying deep fascia". Later, the lower, middle, and upper premasseter spaces and the premaxillary space were described, followed by the deep pyriform space. – Recently, superior and inferior cervical spaces have been proposed.

### The availability of perifascial areolar tissue graft for deep cutaneous ulcer coverage [^115AK23R]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Soft tissue defects or skin ulcers associated with tendon or bone exposure located distally on the extremities are always difficult to treat. The introduction of the vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) and dermal templates has led to major changes in ulcer treatment strategies. However, it is necessary to find an alternative method to treat these defects when VAC is not available. Perifascial areolar tissue (PAT) is the loose connective tissue on the deep fascia that could be a candidate for repairing soft tissue defects or skin ulcers. Grafting PAT on the exposed bone or tendon, including a wide coverage of well-vascularized tissue surrounding the granulation tissue, can prepare the wound to be subsequently closed by a skin graft. In this study, the PAT was used in various situations and its optimal usage and outcomes were evaluated. A total of 13 PAT grafts were performed and were especially useful for covering narrow ulcers with narrow tendon exposure and filling fistula areas. In comparison to other cases, covering the exposed cortical bone ulcers seemed to be more difficult to perform. However, an option for these ulcers could be the exposure of bone marrow and usage of intraosseous blood flow. It was also possible for the simultaneous engraftment of PAT and skin in narrow areas and could be an alternative in cases of small concave ulcers or fistulae. The PAT graft is a simple and minimally invasive procedure that can be a good alternative when VAC is not available.

### Influence of age, sex, and body mass index on the depth of the superficial fascia in the face and neck [^114meR4m]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonsurgical skin-tightening procedures are increasing in popularity, as patients seek aesthetic interventions that are safe with minimal downtime.

Objective

This study was designed to provide precise data on the depth of the superficial fascia-the structure of action-of the face and neck.

Methods

One hundred fifty Caucasian individuals (75 men and 75 women) were investigated with a balanced distribution of age (n = 30 per decade: 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60–69 years) and body mass index (BMI) (n = 50 per group: BMI ≤ 24.9 kg/m², BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m², and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). The distance between skin surface and the superficial fascia was measured through ultrasound in the buccal region, premasseteric region, and lateral neck.

Results

The mean distance between skin surface and superficial fascia was for the buccal region 4.82 ± 0.9 mm, range (2.60–6.90); for the premasseteric region 4.25 ± 0.6 mm, range (2.60–5.80); and for the lateral neck 3.71 ± 0.5 mm, range (2.0–5.0). The depth of the superficial fascia increased with increasing BMI, whereas it decreased with advanced age.

Conclusion

Knowing the precise depth of the superficial fascia for nonsurgical skin-tightening procedures will guide practitioners toward safer and more effective outcomes.

### Anatomy of the breast fascial system: a systematic review of the literature [^11792Mg9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding the anatomy of the fascial and ligamentous structures of the breast is important in both aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery. Several structures have been identified that play a significant role in the aesthetic qualities and support of the breast warranting consideration in the context of breast reconstruction.

Methods

The authors performed a systematic review of anatomical, clinical, histologic, and radiologic studies that have described, characterized, and named these structures. The authors have summarized and critically appraised prior research to clarify and define the key fascial structures of the breast, their anatomical function, and their clinical significance in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery.

Results

Through their review, six distinct breast fascial structures were encountered consistently in the literature. The authors have organized them into intraglandular and extraglandular structures and have reviewed their significance in the context of reconstructive breast surgery.

Conclusions

The primary fascial structures of the breast are important anatomical landmarks with numerous clinical applications. Cooper ligaments divide the breast parenchyma. The superficial and deep layers of the superficial fascia encase the breast in a "pocket", condensing into one thickened layer of fascia along the peripheral breast footprint. The inframammary fold supports and defines the inferior pole. The horizontal septum is a reliable neurovascular landmark. The vertical septum is a newly discovered fascial structure. There are certainly clinical implications that have yet to be described because of the relatively limited and disputed information on the fascia of the female breast and, ultimately, more research is warranted.

### Strongyloidiasis… [^1151cvGG]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Parasitic cycle: Filariform larvae in contaminated soil penetrate human skin when skin contacts soil, and migrate to the small intestine. It has been thought that the L3 larvae migrate via the bloodstream and lymphatics to the lungs, where they are eventually coughed up and swallowed. However, L3 larvae appear capable of migrating to the intestine via alternate routes. Rhabditiform larvae in the gut become infective filariform larvae that can penetrate either the intestinal mucosa or the skin of the perianal area, resulting in autoinfection. Once the filariform larvae reinfect the host, they are carried to the lungs, pharynx and small intestine as described above, or disseminate throughout the body.

The significance of autoinfection in Strongyloides is that untreated cases can result in persistent infection, even after many decades of residence in a non-endemic area, and may contribute to the development of hyperinfection syndrome. The free-living adults mate and produce eggs, from which more rhabditiform larvae hatch and eventually become infective filariform larvae. The filariform larvae penetrate the human host skin to initiate the parasitic cycle. These larvae migrate via the bloodstream to the lungs, where they are eventually coughed up and swallowed, or reach the intestine via migration through connective tissue or abdominal viscera. In the small intestine, larvae molt twice and become adult female worms. Parasitic females embedded in the submucosa of the small intestine and produce eggs via parthenogenesis.

Clinical Presentation The initial sign of acute strongyloidiasis, if noticed at all, is a localized pruritic, erythematous rash at the site of skin penetration. Patients may then develop tracheal irritation and a dry cough as the larvae migrate from the lungs up through the trachea. After the larvae are swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract, patients may experience diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Strongyloides stercoralis are 180 — 380 µm long, with a short buccal canal, a rhabditoid esophagus extending 1/3 of the body length, and a prominent genital primordium. Second-stage rhabditiform larvae are longer and have a smaller esophagus/intestine ratio.

### Forehead ultrasound anatomy: the current debate and a way to consensus [^1127tDzP]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

ULTRASOUND CONCEPTS

The appearance of tissues on ultrasound is consistent.
Subcutaneous fat is hypoechoic, with linear hyperechoic septae. Muscle is hypoechoic as well. Bone and fascial layers are hyperechoic.
The dermis is a hyperechoic layer that frequently appears as 2 bands: the hypoechoic upper (subepidermal low-echogenicity band) and the hyperechoic lower. The subepidermal low echogenicity band develops over time and becomes more prominent with photoaging changes (elastosis). It should not be confused with subcutaneous fat.
Ultrasound images display the accurate position of structures, allowing for the measurement of depth and thickness of objects. However, ultrasound images may be affected by artifacts.
The layers appear similar, albeit with small variations, on different devices (Figure 2).

### Zones of adhesion of the abdomen: implications for abdominoplasty [^115RBot3]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The elucidation of the superficial fascial system (SFS) by Lockwood in 1991 has been the cornerstone of our understanding of abdominal excisional dynamics for the last 25 years. The SFS can be used for closure and, appropriately mobilized, for tension transmission in abdominoplasty, and lower body lifts. The pattern of SFS adhesion to muscle fascia and the zones of adhesion was also described but there are inconsistencies between the description and clinical experience.

Objectives

This study was performed to better describe the pattern of subcutaneous tissue adhesion to the trunk.

Methods

Twenty pre-abdominoplasty patients were studied. A series of points were marked around the trunk and the skin moved in four opposing directions. The excursions were measured and the median plotted on a diagram. Two fresh cadavers were also dissected, removing all subcutaneous tissue circumferentially from the trunk muscle fascia and marking the strength of the adhesion with a colored pin. Three grades of adhesion were mapped.

Results

In the current study, maximal laxity was shown in the mid-lower abdomen and the anterior and lateral chest. Laxity was limited in the anterior and posterior midlines, over the lower back, and the lateral upper thigh. The cadaver dissection mapped adhesion which correlated with the skin laxity diagram.

Conclusions

The detailed skin adhesion map better explains features of surface anatomy. Incorporating this understanding a tension vector of abdominoplasty closure obliquely inwards is proposed to maximally harvest the laxity of the anterior and lateral chest and to create further lowering and narrowing of the waist.

### Dermal shift umbilical reconstruction: an innovative and simple technique [^115ySMWB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Umbilical reconstruction is a procedure with widespread indications in the setting of congenital or postsurgical loss. Reconstruction of the umbilicus when no remnant of the natural umbilicus is present is also called neoumbilicoplasty. Numerous neoumbilicoplasty techniques have been published, including cartilage grafts, full-thickness skin grafts, and multiflap reconstruction. No consensus has been reached regarding an optimal technique, and many procedures involve complicated designs with small flaps that are difficult to reproduce or explain. The authors divide patients into three types depending on the thickness of the adipose layer of the abdomen. With appropriate patient selection and minor variations depending on patient type, the technique can be applied to all patients. The umbilicus is marked in the appropriate position. Local anesthesia is infiltrated, and the area beneath the skin is defatted. The dermis is then applied to the underlying fascia with a superior shift. The authors describe the technique and its variations and present one illustrative case with additional supplemental digital content. The authors have gone through a progression of techniques to find a simple surgical method yielding consistently reproducible results with minimal complexity, limited morbidity, and an aesthetic final outcome. The authors believe that the technique described here achieves those goals. It can be performed under local anesthetic and with a simple occlusive dressing so that the patient can go on with most of his or her daily activities. There is no scar to suggest a surgical procedure, and patients are extremely happy with the aesthetic outcomes.

### Forehead ultrasound anatomy: the current debate and a way to consensus [^115dzSai]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

ANATOMIC CONCEPTS

Forehead layers include the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous fat, frontalis muscle surrounded by fascia, loose connective tissue with fat, and periosteum.
The epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat are continuous across the face, including the forehead, temples, and cheeks.
The frontalis muscle extends laterally to the temporal crest and may end slightly lateral or medial to it. It does not continue into the temple or into the cheek area. A midline attenuation of the frontalis muscle in the upper forehead is present occasionally and can be appreciated on ultrasound examination.
In surgery, anatomic dissections, and histologic images, we usually see a thick middle layer of subcutaneous fat, and a thin deep layer of the frontalis muscle.
Thin loose connective tissue layer gets thicker in the inferolateral portion and is known here as retro-orbicularis oculi fat.

With this information in mind, we can review the images again, including panoramic images across the forehead and temple (Figure 3; Video), and definitively identify the layers as follows:

A thin hyperechoic line, about 0.1 mm thick, representing the epidermis.
Hypoechoic and hyperechoic layers with a combined thickness of about 1.0 mm, continuous into the temples (Figure 3; Video), consistent with the definition and thickness of the dermis.
A thick hypoechoic layer below the dermis, continuous into the temples and cheeks (Figure 3; Video). The thickness of this layer, its location just below the dermis, and its extension beyond the forehead, confirm it as subcutaneous fat and not frontalis muscle.
A thin hyperechoic suprafrontalis fascia.
A hypoechoic layer, 0.5 to 1.0 mm thick (Figures 1–4; Video), located deep above the bone superiorly and more superficially in the inferolateral forehead. Ultrasound images show this layer ending above the temporal crest, while other layers continue into the temple. This, combined with echogenicity, thickness, and position above the bone, confirms this layer as the frontalis muscle, and corresponds to histologic images.
A loose connective tissue layer seen in the inferolateral forehead, as dense retro-orbicularis oculi fat with increased echogenicity (Figures 3, 4; Video).
A hyperechoic periosteum and frontal bone, with an acoustic shadow and artifacts of mirror-imaging and reverberation below.

### Subcutaneous fat patterning in athletes: selection of appropriate sites and standardisation of a novel ultrasound measurement technique: ad hoc working group on body composition, health and performance, under the auspices of the IOC medical commission [^112n4QnP]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A series of US images of a female gymnast, after a phase of reduced training, is shown in figure 3, while figure 4 A displays the corresponding SAT thickness values, and figure 4 B shows the SAT pattern of the athlete 4 months before when she was in full training. In figure 3, the structures of relevance are easily identifiable: skin, SAT and muscle fascia. At the LA, an intermediate fascia structure is visible (Camper's fascia). In order to determine the precise location of the muscle fascia (the lower border of SAT) in this case, the US probe was applied with varying pressure on the skin (with just a thin layer of gel) before starting the measurement without compression (using a thick layer of gel). The compressibility of SAT is higher than that of muscle tissue and the associated changes in the image due to changing compression enabled the observer to distinguish clearly between them. At the ES site, the thicker skin of the posterior trunk can be seen below the black layer of gel, followed by an almost homogeneous (almost black) SAT layer, and finally the fascia above the muscle appears as a light band. An intermediate fascia is present in this athlete at the FT and MC sites. The seeds from which the SAT contour detection algorithm started are also shown in the images.

### The deep fascia of the head and neck revisited: relationship with the facial nerve and implications for rhytidectomy [^1113H8RC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Deep Fat Compartments

Rohrich and Pessa introduced the concept of deep fat compartments, as a sequel to their previous body of work in defining and expanding on the series of superficial fat compartments based on dye injection studies. – The existence of a deep fat layer in the face was previously proposed by Macchi et al. who termed it the deep adipose tissue, in contrast to the subcutaneous superficial adipose tissue. This was remarkably also mentioned by Mitz and Peyronie in their original article on the SMAS. The existence of a deep fat layer is consistent with similar findings in other areas of the body. – In addition, it is consistent with other mammals, as the superficial fascia reportedly invests the panniculus carnosus (evolutionary ancestor of inter alia (latin for "among other things") mimetic muscles), whereas the deep fascia invests the deeper muscles.

The current study confirms the existence of a deep fat layer. However, whereas some previous studies suggested that the deep fat layer or compartment is situated superficial to the deep fascia, our study confirms that the deep fat layer is part of the deep fascia, similar to the original descriptions by classic anatomists (Fig. 12). The definitive implication of this study is the recognition that in the layered system of the face, there is not a separate layer 4 as described. What was considered as a surgical layer 4 is actually a potential dissection plane within the superficial part of the deep fascia, which when dissected, opens up as the surgical spaces, a finding that will be elaborated on further in a separate article.

### Technical note: an alternative method for AV access superficialization [^112YGcMn]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An arteriovenous fistulae for dialysis access is only functional if superficial enough for reliable cannulation. We describe a previously unreported technique to superficialize arteriovenous fistulae too deep for reliable cannulation.

Method

The path of the fistula is marked using ultrasound, and three to four transverse incisions are made along this path. The subcutaneous tissue is separated from the dermis over this entire area. The fistula is then accessed through transverse incisions and by dividing the overlying adipose tissue. The mobilized vein is then "trapped" directly under the dermis by closing the superficial fascia and adipose tissue beneath it and using this tissue to elevate the fistula. No anastomotic revisions are necessary, and moderate straightening can be performed.

Results

We have performed this procedure on 20 patients with 100% technical success. One fistula had thrombosis within 8–10weeks of the superficialization procedure and one patient refused access due to pain, but all other fistulas were successfully cannulated. Two patients were lost to follow-up, and one patient developed skin breakdown in the area of the flap which delayed cannulation. Our 3-month patency was 94.4% with a functional patency, defined as a clinically patent fistula successfully being used for hemodialysis, of 87.5%.

Conclusion

The technique described allows elevation of the vein to the level of the dermis without division and re-anastomosis or re-tunneling, through several small incisions maintaining virgin skin and normal contour for easier cannulation.

### Calculating the thickness of the superficial fatty layer of the body using age, gender, and body mass index [^114Jg3CA]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Injections of biostimulator agents are increasing in popularity as an alternative to surgical or energy-based skin tightening procedures. The present study was designed to develop a formula that helps to guide health care providers injecting biostimulators into the correct plane to enhance effectiveness and longevity by targeting precisely the superficial fascial system.

METHODS: 150 Caucasian individuals (75 males and 75 females) were investigated with a balanced distribution of age (n = 30 per decade: 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60–69 years) and body mass index (n = 50 per group: BMI ≤ 24.9 kg/m², BMI between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m² BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²). The distance between skin surface and the superficial fascia was measured via ultrasound in the buccal region, premasseteric region, the lateral neck, posterior arm, abdomen, buttocks, anterior thigh, medial thigh, and posterior thigh.

RESULTS: Mean thickness of the superficial fatty layer is variable between the different locations investigated with smallest values for the lateral neck of 3.71mm ± 0.55 [range, 2.00–5.00mm] and greatest values for the gluteal region with 20.52mm ± 10.07 [range, 6.10–38.40mm]. A formula was developed to estimate the thickness of the superficial fatty layer based on the targeted region, age, gender, and body mass index of the patient: Thickness of superficial fatty layer (mm): Region constant + (XX* BMI) - (YY*Age).

CONCLUSIONS: Injections of biostimulators deeper than the calculated values might result in reduced efficacy as the superficial fascial system is not targeted and the effected collagen neogenesis does not affect the skin surface.

### Anatomical basis of fascial plane blocks [^113QZpBR]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fascial plane blocks (FPBs) are regional anesthesia techniques in which the space ("plane") between two discrete fascial layers is the target of needle insertion and injection. Analgesia is primarily achieved by local anesthetic spread to nerves traveling within this plane and adjacent tissues. This narrative review discusses key fundamental anatomical concepts relevant to FPBs, with a focus on blocks of the torso. Fascia, in this context, refers to any sheet of connective tissue that encloses or separates muscles and internal organs. The basic composition of fascia is a latticework of collagen fibers filled with a hydrated glycosaminoglycan matrix and infiltrated by adipocytes and fibroblasts; fluid can cross this by diffusion but not bulk flow. The plane between fascial layers is filled with a similar fat-glycosaminoglycan matric and provides gliding and cushioning between structures, as well as a pathway for nerves and vessels. The planes between the various muscle layers of the thorax, abdomen, and paraspinal area close to the thoracic paravertebral space and vertebral canal, are popular targets for ultrasound-guided local anesthetic injection. The pertinent musculofascial anatomy of these regions, together with the nerves involved in somatic and visceral innervation, are summarized. This knowledge will aid not only sonographic identification of landmarks and block performance, but also understanding of the potential pathways and barriers for spread of local anesthetic. It is also critical as the basis for further exploration and refinement of FPBs, with an emphasis on improving their clinical utility, efficacy, and safety.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111KxkVQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — definition, clinical features, and bacteriology are detailed. Necrotizing fasciitis is "an aggressive subcutaneous infection that tracks along the superficial fascia", and "it is the superficial fascia that is most commonly involved". The initial presentation "is that of cellulitis", progressing with "systemic toxicity, often including high temperatures, disorientation, and lethargy", and a distinguishing feature is "the wooden-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues". In the monomicrobial form, pathogens "are S. pyogenes, S. aureus, V. vulnificus, A. hydrophila, and anaerobic streptococci (Peptostreptococcus)", with most infections "community acquired and present in the limbs, with approximately two-thirds in the lower extremities". Cases after varicella or trivial injuries are "usually due to S. pyogenes", and in group A streptococcal disease with hypotension and organ failure, mortality is "ranging from 30% to 70%". Among S. pyogenes cases, "Nearly 50%" have "no portal of entry" and instead develop deep infection at a site of nonpenetrating trauma. Polymicrobial infection is "most commonly associated with 4 clinical settings" including perianal/abdominal sources, decubitus ulcers, injection sites in illicit drug users, and spread from genital sites.

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^113E7vu6]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cooper is credited with the discovery of the suspensory ligaments of the breast that bear his name; however, Brinkman and Hage rightly point out that Andreas Vesalius described the superficial fascia of the breast, which he called "the fleshy membrane", in 1543. Vesalius understood that the superficial fascia system of the breast was a special modification of a system found throughout the entire body. In the 1990s, Ted Lockwood led the way in establishing the importance of the superficial fascia in breast and body contouring. Many others have laid the groundwork for describing the superficial fascia as a continuous organ between the skin and deep fascia. Rohrich et al. described zones of adherence between the superficial fascia and the deep fascia and their role in shaping the soft tissues. We observed a similar zone of adherence surrounding the breast and anchoring it to the chest, which we named the circummammary ligament. Studies performed by Würinger et al.and Matousek et al.come very close to describing the superficial fascia system of the breast, but miss the three-dimensional "big picture". They state that the literature is full of conflicting results concerning the ligamentous anatomy of the breast, because of various dissection techniques causing artifacts. We agree, and feel their use of frozen sagittal and horizontal cadaver sections makes it difficult to visualize the delicate three-dimensional network of the superficial fascia system. We are in agreement about the existence of a fascial ring around the breast, which the neurovascular supply to the breast crosses. Matousek et al. however, focus on seven separate ligamentous structures; they fail to see that the ring of attachment is continuous with an entire three-dimensional system of fascia and fat.

### Innocuous pressure sensation requires A-type afferents but not functional ρ ι ε ζ ο 2 channels in humans [^114Gvkf1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Interoceptive signals from deep tissues are powerful modulators of our physiological state and serve as important indicators of potential tissue damage, inflammation or disease. Sensory innervation of our muscles, joints and connective tissues provide a wealth of conscious and unconscious information about the state of our bodies when at rest or in motion. Additionally, pressure sensation is a major component of our affective interactions, from the pleasure and comfort associated with hugs to the health benefits of stretching and massage therapy. While our mechanistic understanding of touch perception has grown significantly in recent years, how deep tissue sensations are detected and encoded remain less clear.

The somatosensory system detects both external and internal stimuli. Afferent projections of primary sensory neurons innervate sites throughout the skin and body where they are activated by a wide range of physical and chemical stimuli. The diverse nature of these stimuli is reflected by the heterogeneity of sensory neuron subtypes, their anatomical specializations, physiological properties, and the receptor molecules they express. For example, gentle cutaneous touch sensation is mediated by several types of mechanoreceptors, each having unique ending types, molecular profiles, and physiological properties. Generally speaking, thickly myelinated Aα and Aβ fibers are fast conducting and critically important for proprioception and touch, respectively, whereas the thinly myelinated Aδ and unmyelinated C fibers conduct more slowly and play prominent roles in thermosensation, chemosensation, and nociception. There are notable exceptions to this generalization; for example, a prominent subtype of C fibers is activated by gentle stroking stimuliand a subset of Aβ fibers have been recently characterized that respond only to painful mechanical stimuli.

The majority of our understanding of peripheral somatosensory neurons comes from studying the afferents that target skin. What is known about non-cutaneous mechanosensation? Most research on interoception focuses on the vagal system. Interest in visceral sensation occurring via dorsal root ganglion neurons has largely centered on pain in relation to disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Crohn's Disease. Similarly, investigations of muscle sensation have mainly focused on either Aα-type proprioceptors that are required for tracking body positionor on the Aδ and C-type nociceptors that signal muscle pain. Far less is known about non-painful pressure sensations from muscle, fascia, and deep tissues, despite the unique purposes they clearly serve. Intriguingly, some evidence exists suggesting that both myelinated and unmyelinated sensory afferents innervating muscles can respond to innocuous muscle pressures –. Nevertheless, the contributions of specific types of afferents to deep tissue sensations remain unknown.

### Basic histological structure and functions of facial skin [^115RY5gf]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The skin and its appendages that derive from the epidermis (hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, nails, and mammary glands) establish the integumentary system. Histologically, skin has two main layers-the epidermis and the dermis-with a subcutaneous fascia called the hypodermis, which lies deep in the dermis. The epidermis is formed of four to five layers of cells made mostly out of keratinocytes, along with three other different and less abundant cells. The dermis underlies the epidermis. The hypodermis is a looser connective tissue that is located beneath the dermis. It blends to the dermis with an unclear boundary.

### Fascial tissue research in sports medicine: from molecules to tissue adaptation, injury and diagnostics: consensus statement [^112KK9gT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Consensus meeting

The Second International CONNECT Conference was held at the University of Ulm, Germany, on 16–19 March 2017, as part of a conference series aimed at fostering scientific progress towards a better understanding and treatment of fascial tissues in sports medicine. After the conference, a meeting was held with conference speakers and other field-related experts to discuss and find consensus regarding the role of fascial tissue in the field of sports medicine.

Injuries to a variety of fascial tissues cause a significant loss of performance in sportsand have a potential role in the development and perpetuation of musculoskeletal disorders, including lower back pain. A major goal of clinicians is to return athletes and patients to activity, training and competition after injury.

This consensus statement reflects the current state of knowledge regarding the role of fascial tissues in the discipline of sports medicine and will be updated as part of a consensus meeting during the CONNECT conference. This paper aims to summarise the contemporary state of knowledge regarding the fascial system from the microlevel (molecular and cellular responses) to the macrolevel (mechanical properties), and the responses of the fascial system to altered loading (physical exercise), to injury and other physiological challenges including ageing, methods available to study the fascial system, and the contemporary view of interventions that target fascial tissue in sports medicine. This document was developed for scientists and clinicians to highlight common traps and truths of fascial tissue screening and imaging techniques and intervention methods, and to present a multidisciplinary perspective of future research in the field.

Molecular adaptation of fascial tissues: effects of physical exercise, ageing, sex hormones and inflammation

Molecular crosstalk between extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and cellular components is an important determinant of fascial tissue physiology and pathophysiology. A molecular chain, characterised by high functional and structural plasticity and bidirectional molecular interactions, connects the cellular cytoskeleton to the ECM (figure 2). Small functional and structural alterations in the ECM result in complex cellular adaptation processes and, vice versa, changes in cell function and structure leading to ECM adaptation. Therefore, fascial tissue homeostasis is the result of a complex interplay and dynamic crosstalk between cellular components and the ECM. Especially under dynamic conditions such as growth and regeneration, strong alterations of the local ECM microenvironments are necessary to allow cellular adaptation and rebuilding of fascial tissues. All factors influencing cell or ECM behaviour can result in changes in the structure and homeostasis of tissues and organs.

Anatomy

In the current review, anatomical dissection of a cadaveric leg with histopathological correlation of selected specimens will be used to illustrate the anatomy of the fascial system (Fig. 1). Dissections were performed on a body that had been donated for science research to the Laboratory of Anatomy of Lille, France, in accordance with the ethical standards and French law. All histological images used in this review are stained with Masson's trichrome stain, which stains connective tissue (collagen) blue.

Muscles of the lateral compartment were separated (arrowheads). Colored squares indicate areas that correspond to Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6

Anatomists, surgeons and radiologists tend to use different terms to describe the components of the fascial system (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Schematic drawing of a transverse section of the thigh illustrating its fascial anatomy

The term "fascia superficialis" is used to designate either the entire hypodermis or a layer of connective tissue located immediately deep to the dermis. This layer of connective tissue of variable thickness (stratum membranosum) is attached through fibrous tracts to the dermis (retinacula cutis superficialis) and to the deeper components of the fascial system (retinacula cutis profondis). It is composed by interwoven collagen fibres, loosely packed and mixed with abundant elastic fibres. Its extent, thickness and topography vary according to the body segment. In this review we use the term "fascia superficialis" to designate the complex formed by this subcutaneous layer of connective tissue and the fibrous tracts that connect it superficially to the dermis and deeply to the underlying deeper components of the fascial system. The so-called fascia superficialis constitutes a three-dimensional connective tissue network in the hypodermis that contains fat lobules and superficial nerves and vessels (Fig. 3).

Participant flow through the Closure randomised trial

Overall, 851 eligible women were randomised to one of four groups: Group 1–216 women; Group 2–212 women; Group 3–212 women; and Group 4–211 women. Two women were excluded from the final analysis, one who was lost to follow up (randomised to Group 1) and one who did not undergo a caesarean birth (randomised to Group 2), leaving 849 women for whom primary outcome data was available.

Baseline demographic characteristics of women were comparable between treatment groups (Table 1). The mean age of participants was 31.48 years (SD 5.62 years), with mean early pregnancy BMI 28.60 kg/m² (SD 7.36 kg/m²). The majority of women underwent an elective caesarean section (701 women [82.57%]), at 38.50 weeks (SD 1.85 weeks) gestation. Most women were in their second or subsequent ongoing pregnancy (656 women [77.27%]), with a previous caesarean birth (562 women [66.20%]).

### Anatomy of the superficial fascia system of the breast: a comprehensive theory of breast fascial anatomy [^1154cBAE]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Video 8.
Supplemental Digital Content 8 demonstrates small breast reduction, illustrating the anterior lamella annulus, available in the "Related Videos" section of the full-text article on PRSJournal.com or, for Ovid users, available at.

The circummammary ligament surrounds the breast and defines its perimeter. The circummammary ligament is a three-dimensional, roughly circular structure composed of superficial fascia collagen fibers that encase a ring of fat and attach it to the deep fascia of the chest, as a circular zone of adherence (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 4). The circummammary ligament is consistently found in every patient, but varies in characteristics depending on the body habitus of the person. People with more body fat have larger lobules of fat between the fibers of collagen and therefore a larger ring of attachment. This ring of fascia and fat that composes the circummammary ligament varies in thickness, depending on what part of the circle one is looking at. Inferiorly is the inframammary ligament portion which is strong, thick, and wide in patients with more body fat. The sternal portion lacks the fat seen inferiorly, so it is more narrow in comparison. It has a high density of collagen fibers attaching to the deep fascia covering the parasternal area and therefore is the zone with the strongest anchorage. Laterally, the circummammary ligament collagen and fat are less dense and cover a larger area. Superiorly, the circummammary ligament is very thin and contains virtually no fat and therefore is difficult to see. It runs between the clavicular head of the pectoralis major and its sternocostal head (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 5). The fascial cleft under the breast and within the confines of the circummammary ligament is known as the "subglandular" space, and is filled with loose areolar connective tissue. The circummammary ligament fuses to the deep fascia covering the chest wall and anchors the breast in place; the subglandular space allows for breast movement and prevents its attachment from being rigid.

### Anatomy and physiology of the lower-extremity deep and superficial veins [^111rRM29]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

A thorough understanding of venous anatomy and physiology is foundational to the diagnosis and management of venous disease. Compared with the arterial system, there is significantly greater developmental variation in the venous system. The veins of the lower extremity include the superficial and deep veins, which are defined by their respective relationships to the muscular fascia. Perforating veins traverse the muscular fascia to connect superficial and deep veins. Communicating veins connect veins within the same venous compartment, either deep to deep or superficial to superficial. The deep veins of the lower extremities primarily drain muscles and are encompassed by muscular fascia. The veins located between the skin and the muscular fascia are considered superficial veins. Superficial veins drain the cutaneous microcirculation. The pelvic venous system is a complex transitional outflow pathway between the lower extremities, the pelvic structures, and the inferior vena cava. The terminology used to describe lower-extremity, pelvic, and abdominal vasculature conforms to published international standards.
