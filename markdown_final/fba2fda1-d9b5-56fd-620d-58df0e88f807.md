## Question

Lymphatic system and chylothorax

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the lymphatic system and chylothorax. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions and the clinical significance of chylothorax. Then, I should verify the relevant lymphatic anatomy and physiology that explain laterality and pathophysiology. Next, I will classify etiologies and map them to mechanisms. After that, I need to check the diagnostic criteria and imaging hierarchy, including when to use MR lymphangiography versus conventional lymphangiography. Then, I will review management algorithms, including conservative therapy, pharmacologic adjuncts, and interventional/surgical options, and I should confirm thresholds and outcomes. Finally, I will consider special populations, complications, and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why chylothorax matters clinically. Chylothorax is the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, typically milky and rich in triglycerides and lymphocytes, which can cause respiratory compromise, malnutrition from protein and fat loss, and immunodeficiency from lymphocyte depletion, so timely recognition and treatment are essential to prevent morbidity and mortality.

> I need to verify the lymphatic anatomy that explains laterality and leak patterns. The thoracic duct arises from the cisterna chyli at approximately T12–L2, ascends through the aortic hiatus into the right hemithorax, and crosses to the left at T4–T5 to drain into the left subclavian–internal jugular venous junction; thus, leaks above T5 tend to be left-sided, while leaks below T5 are right-sided, which aligns with the frequent right-sided predominance of chylothorax and helps anticipate surgical approaches.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without distinguishing traumatic from nontraumatic causes. Traumatic chylothorax, especially iatrogenic after thoracic surgery, is common, whereas nontraumatic causes include malignancy (notably lymphoma), congenital lymphatic anomalies, and systemic diseases; obstruction or direct injury to the thoracic duct or its tributaries increases intralymphatic pressure and promotes extravasation of chyle into the pleural space [^114rnw3G].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria and confirm the biochemical thresholds. The diagnosis rests on pleural fluid triglycerides greater than 110 mg/dL or the presence of chylomicrons, with triglycerides less than 50 mg/dL essentially excluding chylothorax; in intermediate ranges, lipoprotein electrophoresis helps distinguish true chylothorax from pseudo-chylothorax, which is cholesterol-rich and has different implications for management [^113QGrTx].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging hierarchy because this often drives therapy. Chest radiography identifies effusions and lateralizes them, ultrasound guides thoracentesis, and CT/MRI characterize masses or nodes; however, for localizing the leak and planning intervention, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography (DCMRL) is increasingly preferred in children and complex cases due to high-resolution depiction of central lymphatics without radiation, while conventional lymphangiography remains valuable for mapping and can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in select centers [^1145hNGK] [^114w3AD1] [^1123itxd].

> I will now examine conservative management, since most cases start here. The cornerstone is reduction of lymphatic flow via a low-fat or fat-free diet with medium-chain triglycerides, which are absorbed directly into the portal circulation and bypass lymphatic transport, thereby decreasing chyle production; total parenteral nutrition is reserved for refractory cases or when enteral feeding is not feasible, and pleural drainage is used to relieve respiratory symptoms while monitoring output [^1158vVkq].

> Let me consider pharmacologic adjuncts and confirm dosing ranges. Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, reduces lymphatic flow via splanchnic vasoconstriction and possible direct effects on lymphatic vessels; typical pediatric dosing starts around 1 mcg/kg/h and may be titrated up to 10–20 mcg/kg/h, with responses often seen within 2–3 days, though randomized data are limited and heterogeneity is substantial, so expectations should be tempered and individualized [^114R7Q56].

> But wait, what if conservative therapy fails or the output remains high? I should double-check the thresholds that trigger escalation. Many centers use a daily chyle output above 500–1000 mL in adults as a trigger for definitive intervention, recognizing that persistent high-output leaks risk malnutrition and immunosuppression; options include thoracic duct embolization, surgical ligation (open or VATS), pleurodesis, and, in select refractory cases, lymphovenous anastomosis or decompressive strategies in Fontan physiology, with choice tailored to etiology, anatomy, and patient factors [^114rnw3G] [^115kv6sG] [^115sfQoW].

> I should confirm outcomes for interventional options. Thoracic duct embolization has pooled technical success around 94% and clinical success near 79% in meta-analyses, with low major complication rates, though success varies by etiology and anatomy; in children, conservative therapy succeeds in roughly 70–80%, and surgical ligation remains effective when embolization is not feasible or fails, underscoring the need for multidisciplinary planning and access to lymphatic imaging [^notfound] [^114R7Q56].

> Let me think about special populations and nuances. In neonates and infants, congenital chylothorax is a major cause and may be associated with genetic syndromes; MCT-based formulas are standard, and some centers advocate early pleurodesis for partial responders to avoid prolonged TPN and central venous complications, while in single-ventricle physiology, abnormal lymphatics and elevated central venous pressures predispose to chylothorax and plastic bronchitis, making DCMRL and targeted decompression strategies increasingly important [^114R7Q56] [^112zku9b] [^112HWLU6].

> Hold on, I should verify complications and monitoring needs. Beyond respiratory compromise, prolonged chyle loss can cause hypoproteinemia, lymphopenia, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, so serial assessment of nutritional status, electrolytes, immune function, and micronutrients is essential; infections are less common in chyle due to its bacteriostatic properties, but vigilance remains prudent [^113QGrTx] [^112zku9b].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure internal consistency. A practical algorithm is to confirm the diagnosis biochemically, image to characterize effusion and screen for malignancy or structural disease, initiate conservative therapy with MCT diet and drainage, add octreotide if output remains high, and escalate to lymphatic imaging and definitive intervention if output exceeds 500–1000 mL/day for several days or if complications emerge, all within a multidisciplinary framework that includes surgery, interventional radiology, nutrition, and pediatrics as indicated [^114rnw3G] [^116vr1wk].

> In summary, chylothorax reflects a disruption of normal lymphatic drainage with substantial systemic consequences; understanding thoracic duct anatomy explains laterality, biochemical confirmation anchors diagnosis, modern lymphatic imaging guides therapy, and a stepwise algorithm balancing conservative and definitive measures optimizes outcomes while minimizing morbidity, with outcomes improving when management is centralized and multidisciplinary [^114w3AD1] [^114rnw3G].

The lymphatic system returns chyle from the gut to the venous circulation via the thoracic duct; **chylothorax results when the thoracic duct is disrupted or obstructed**, causing chyle to leak into the pleural space [^1129W9sK]. Diagnosis relies on pleural fluid triglycerides > 110 mg/dL or chylomicrons, with imaging (CT/MRI, lymphangiography) to localize the leak [^1129W9sK] [^116vr1wk]. Management is **stepwise**: conservative measures (low-fat/MCT diet, TPN, octreotide, drainage) for low-output leaks, and definitive interventions (thoracic duct embolization, surgical ligation, pleurodesis) for high-output or refractory cases [^114rnw3G] [^1145hNGK]. Early recognition and multidisciplinary care are essential to prevent malnutrition and immunodeficiency [^114rnw3G].

## Anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system

The lymphatic system comprises lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, tonsils, Peyer patches) [^112BDwmh]; it maintains fluid balance, absorbs dietary fats, and supports immunity [^111AsfkR]. Lymphatic capillaries absorb interstitial fluid and chyle from the intestines, forming lymph that is transported through progressively larger vessels to the venous circulation [^111AsfkR].

---

### Thoracic duct anatomy

- **Origin**: The thoracic duct begins at the cisterna chyli (T12–L2) and ascends through the aortic hiatus into the thorax [^111j99UY].
- **Course**: It ascends on the right between the aorta and azygos vein, crosses to the left at T4–T5, and continues to the neck.
- **Termination**: It drains into the venous system at the junction of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins [^111j99UY].
- **Function**: It carries ~75% of lymphatic fluid, including chyle from the intestines, back to the bloodstream [^111j99UY].

---

## Pathophysiology of chylothorax

Chylothorax arises from **disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct or its tributaries**, causing chyle to leak into the pleural space [^1129W9sK]. The mechanism depends on the cause:

| **Etiology** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Traumatic (iatrogenic, penetrating) | Direct injury to the thoracic duct or tributaries [^1129W9sK] |
| Non-traumatic (malignancy, congenital, idiopathic) | Obstruction or intrinsic lymphatic vessel abnormalities [^1129W9sK] [^114xqtGm] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Respiratory symptoms**: Dyspnea, cough, chest pain from pleural effusion [^1129W9sK].
- **Nutritional complications**: Malnutrition, hypoproteinemia, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies from protein and fat loss [^1129W9sK].
- **Immunological complications**: Lymphocyte depletion and immunodeficiency from chronic chyle loss [^1129W9sK].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Laboratory diagnosis

Laboratory diagnosis relies on **pleural fluid analysis** showing triglycerides > 110 mg/dL or the presence of chylomicrons; triglycerides < 50 mg/dL exclude chylothorax, and intermediate values warrant lipoprotein analysis [^1129W9sK] [^113QGrTx].

---

### Imaging modalities

- **Chest radiography/ultrasound**: Detects effusion and guides thoracentesis [^115QL3ji].
- **CT/MRI**: Identify masses, lymphadenopathy, or structural abnormalities [^116vr1wk].
- **Lymphangiography**: Gold standard for localizing leaks; conventional, intranodal, or MR lymphangiography [^116vr1wk] [^114w3AD1].
- **MR lymphangiography**: Noninvasive, radiation-free, and increasingly used in pediatrics [^1123itxd].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **individualized** based on etiology, output, and patient factors:

---

### Conservative management

Conservative management includes a **low-fat diet with medium-chain triglycerides** or total parenteral nutrition to reduce lymphatic flow [^1158vVkq]. Octreotide (somatostatin analog) decreases lymphatic flow and is often used with pleural drainage [^117NjGHX]. Serial thoracentesis or chest tube drainage relieves symptoms and monitors output [^1129W9sK].

---

### Definitive interventions

- **Thoracic duct embolization**: Minimally invasive, first-line for high-output or refractory leaks; high success and low complication rates [^1145hNGK] [^115TSX3D].
- **Surgical ligation**: Thoracic duct ligation (open or VATS) for failed conservative/embolization or intraoperative leaks [^113vz4Ti].
- **Pleurodesis**: Chemical pleurodesis (e.g. talc, OK-432) for persistent leaks [^114R7Q56].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on etiology, output, and timeliness of intervention. High-output leaks carry higher morbidity and mortality, and **early definitive therapy improves outcomes** [^114rnw3G]. Complications include malnutrition, immunodeficiency, respiratory compromise, and delayed wound healing [^1129W9sK].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric patients have a higher incidence of congenital or postoperative chylothorax; **conservative therapy is often effective**, but refractory cases may need embolization or surgery [^114R7Q56] [^115kv6sG]. In malignancy-related chylothorax, management includes treating the underlying cancer alongside pleural control [^1128Foid].

---

The lymphatic system returns chyle to the venous circulation; **chylothorax results from thoracic duct disruption or obstruction**, causing chyle to leak into the pleural space. Early diagnosis and stepwise management — conservative measures for low-output leaks and definitive interventions for high-output or refractory cases — are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes [^114rnw3G].

### Chylothorax in infants and children [^116xcf8r]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Chylothorax, the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, is a relatively rare cause of pleural effusion in children. It can cause significant respiratory morbidity, as well as lead to malnutrition and immunodeficiency. Thus, a chylothorax requires timely diagnosis and treatment. This review will first discuss the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system and discuss various causes that can lead to development of a chylothorax in infants and children. Then, methods of diagnosis and treatment will be reviewed. Finally, complications of chylothorax will be reviewed.

Chylothorax is a rare condition that results from thoracic duct damage with chyle leakage from the lymphatic system into the pleural space, usually on the right side. It has multiple aetiologies and is usually discovered after it manifests itself as a pleural effusion. Diagnosis involves cholesterol and triglyceride measurement in the pleural fluid. Complications include malnutrition, immunosuppression and respiratory distress. Treatment may be either conservative or aggressive depending on the clinical scenario. In this review, we discuss the aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of chylothorax. English language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1, 1980 to February 28, 2008 were reviewed. Keywords searched were chylothorax, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaChylothorax treatment planning [^115QL3ji]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is an uncommon but serious medical condition, which arises when intestinal lymphatic fluid leaks into the pleural space. Treatment strategies depend on the daily output and underlying etiology, which may be due to direct injury to lymphatic vessels or a nontraumatic disorder. Chest radiographs confirm the presence of pleural fluid and lateralize the process. In the setting of direct injury, lymphangiography can often be both diagnostic and facilitate a minimally invasive attempt at therapy. CT and MRI in this setting may be appropriate for cases when lymphangiography is not diagnostic. When the etiology is nontraumatic or unknown, CT or MRI can narrow the differential diagnosis, and lymphangiography is useful if a minimally invasive approach to treatment is desired. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Multidisciplinary management of chylothorax [^114rnw3G]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax, the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, is usually caused by the disruption of the thoracic duct or its tributaries. Etiologies are broadly divided into traumatic, including postsurgical, and nontraumatic, most commonly in the setting of malignancy. The management of chylothorax largely depends on the cause and includes dietary modification and drainage of the pleural space. A definitive intervention, whether surgical or a percutaneous lymphatic intervention, should be considered in patients with a persistently high volume of chylous output and in those with a prolonged leak, before complications such as malnutrition ensue. No methodologically robust clinical trials guiding management are currently available. In this article, we review the current literature and propose a stepwise, evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with both traumatic and nontraumatic chylothorax.

### Lymphovenous hemostasis and the role of platelets in regulating lymphatic flow and lymphatic vessel maturation [^111u7C77]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Aside from the established role for platelets in regulating hemostasis and thrombosis, recent research has revealed a discrete role for platelets in the separation of the blood and lymphatic vascular systems. Platelets are activated by interaction with lymphatic endothelial cells at the lymphovenous junction, the site in the body where the lymphatic system drains into the blood vascular system, resulting in a platelet plug that, with the lymphovenous valve, prevents blood from entering the lymphatic circulation. This process, known as "lymphovenous hemostasis", is mediated by activation of platelet CLEC-2 receptors by the transmembrane ligand podoplanin expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells. Lymphovenous hemostasis is required for normal lymph flow, and mice deficient in lymphovenous hemostasis exhibit lymphedema and sometimes chylothorax phenotypes indicative of lymphatic insufficiency. Unexpectedly, the loss of lymph flow in these mice causes defects in maturation of collecting lymphatic vessels and lymphatic valve formation, uncovering an important role for fluid flow in driving endothelial cell signaling during development of collecting lymphatics. This article summarizes the current understanding of lymphovenous hemostasis and its effect on lymphatic vessel maturation and synthesizes the outstanding questions in the field, with relationship to human disease.

### Imaging findings of thoracic lymphatic abnormalities [^112ovt5X]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

The lymphatic system plays an important role in balancing fluid compartments in the body. It is disrupted by various disease processes in the thorax, including injury to the thoracic lymphatic duct after surgery, as well as malignancy and heart failure. Because of the small size of lymphatic vessels, imaging of the lymphatics is relatively difficult, and effective imaging methods are still being optimized and developed. The standard of reference for lymphatic imaging has been conventional lymphangiography for several decades. Other modalities such as CT, noncontrast or contrast-enhanced MRI, and lymphoscintigraphy can also demonstrate lymphatic abnormalities and help in treatment planning. Imaging findings associated with lymphatic abnormalities can be seen in the pulmonary parenchyma, pleural space, and mediastinum. In the pulmonary parenchyma, common findings include interlobular septal thickening as well as reversal of lymphatic flow with intravasation of contrast material into pulmonary lymphatics. In the pleural space, findings include chylous pleural effusion and occasionally nonchylous pleural effusion. In the mediastinum, thoracic duct leak, plexiform thoracic duct, lymphatic malformations, and lymphangiectasis may occur. Management of chylothorax includes conservative or medical treatment, surgery, and interventional radiology procedures. The authors discuss thoracic lymphatic anatomy, imaging manifestations of lymphatic abnormalities in the various anatomic compartments, and interventional radiology treatment of chylothorax. Radiologists should be familiar with these imaging findings for diagnosis and to help guide appropriate management. © RSNA, 2022.

The lymphatic system is perhaps the most complicated system of Homo sapiens. An introduction to the anatomy, embryology, and anomalies of the lymphatics is presented. The overall anatomy and drainage of the lymphatic vessels in outlined.

### Mediastinal lymphangioma and intestinal lymphangiomatosis presenting with chylothorax: a systematic review of therapeutic modalities [^112dRW5o]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Mediastinal lymphangioma is an uncommon source of chylothorax and is infrequently mentioned in the medical literature. Its presence may or may not coexist with other mediastinal lymphatic abnormalities and genetic disorders. Managing chylothorax in these cases can be challenging through conservative methods, often necessitating surgical intervention. It is still unclear whether patients with isolated mediastinal lymphangioma would benefit from lymphoscintigraphy to identify other lymphatic abnormalities or if genetic counseling would be appropriate. The rarity of such cases complicates the study of the potential risk factors and the environmental exposures associated with these abnormalities. Furthermore, there is no established consensus on therapeutic modalities for patients with this diagnosis, leading to a highly individualized treatment.

### Chylothorax: diagnosis and management in children [^117Pkvh7]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, as a result of damage to the thoracic duct. Chyle is milky fluid enriched with fat secreted from the intestinal cells and lymphatic fluid. Chylothorax in children, is most commonly seen as a complication of cardiothoracic surgery but may occur in newborns or conditions associated with abnormal lymphatics. The diagnosis is based on biochemical analysis of the pleural fluid, which contains chylomicrons, high levels of triglycerides and lymphocytes. Investigations to outline the lymphatic channels can prove helpful in some cases. Initial treatment consists of drainage, dietary modifications, total parenteral nutrition and time for the thoracic duct to heal. Somatostatin and its analogue octreotide may be useful in some cases. Surgery should be considered for patients who fail these initial steps, or in whom complications such as electrolyte and fluid imbalance, malnutrition or immunodeficiency persist. Surgical intervention may be attempted thoracoscopically with repair or ligation of the thoracic duct.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chylothorax treatment planning: 2024 update [^116vr1wk]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chylothoraces are encountered at a rate of up to 1 in 6,000 in all hospital admissions. The etiology of these chylothoraces can be categorized into traumatic or nontraumatic. Traumatic or iatrogenic chylothorax can be seen in up to half of all chylothoraces with nontraumatic or unknown etiology constituting the remaining majority. Treatment planning is essential in chylothorax due to the varying etiologies. Lymphangiography continues to be usually appropriate, as it is both an effective diagnostic and a therapeutic intervention. Additionally, with development in MR technology, MR lymphangiography has advanced rapidly in the last decade and is an additional radiological procedure that is usually appropriate in all etiologies of chylothoraces. Ultrasound is not appropriate for treatment planning in all etiologies and CT chest without contrast is not appropriate in nontraumatic etiologies of chylothoraces. All other radiological procedures may be appropriate based on individual cases. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Nontraumatic chylothorax: diagnostic algorithm and treatment options [^115qioRm]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Nontraumatic chylothorax is a relatively rare condition in which the intestinal lymph (chyle) leaks into the pleural cavity. Nontraumatic chylothorax is more difficult to treat than the more common traumatic chylothorax because the site of chylous leak may occur in less predictable locations. In the past, patients with nontraumatic chylothoraces were offered traditional fluoroscopically guided lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization similar to traumatic chylothorax. However, the observation that thoracic duct embolization outcomes for nontraumatic chylothorax differed based on the imaging findings during lymphangiography has led to the development of a treatment algorithm, which incorporates noninvasive diagnostic studies, such as magnetic resonance lymphangiography. The development of this systematic approach allows better delineation of the source of the chylous leak and selection of the appropriate method of embolization. In this article, we will review the etiologies of nontraumatic chylothorax, the diagnostic work-up for managing this condition, and the treatment algorithm to care for these patients.

### Lymphedema (PDQ ®)-NCI-national cancer institute… [^111AsfkR]. NCI (2008). Low credibility.

Anatomy of the Lymphatic System The human lymphatic system generally includes superficial or primary lymphatic vessels that form a complex dermal network of capillary-like channels. Primary lymphatic vessels lack muscular walls and do not have valves. They drain into larger, secondary lymphatic vessels located in the subdermal space. Secondary lymphatic vessels run parallel to the superficial veins and drain into deeper lymphatic vessels located in the subcutaneous fat adjacent to the fascia. Unlike the primary vessels, the secondary and deeper lymphatic vessels have muscular walls and numerous valves to accomplish active and unidirectional lymphatic flow. An intramuscular system of lymphatic vessels that parallels the deep arteries and drains the muscular compartment, joints, and synovium also exists. The superficial and deep lymphatic systems probably function independently, except in abnormal states, although there is evidence that they communicate near lymph nodes.

Lymph drains from the lower limbs into the lumbar lymphatic trunk. The lumbar lymphatic trunk joins the intestinal lymphatic trunk and cisterna chyli to form the thoracic duct, which empties into the left subclavian vein. The lymphatic vessels of the left arm drain into the left subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the left subclavian vein. The lymphatic vessels of the right arm drain into the right subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the right subclavian vein. The formation of interstitial fluid comes from the movement of intravascular fluid across the capillary membranes due to arteriolar blood pressure. Much of the interstitial fluid returns to the intravascular fluid via the postcapillary venules. The dynamics of fluid production are influenced by arterial and venous hydrostatic pressures, tissue pressure, oncotic pressures of the intravascular and interstitial fluid, and membrane permeability.

Normally, the dynamics favor a net gain of interstitial fluid, with the excess removed via lymphatic channels. Because lymphatic vessels often lack a basement membrane, they can resorb molecules too large for venous uptake as well. In short, the lymphatic system controls the pressure, volume, and composition of the interstitial fluid. Lymphatic obstruction leads to increased interstitial fluid, which often contains large proteins and cellular debris. Through mechanisms not fully understood, the increased interstitial fluid induces inflammation, destruction or sclerosis of the lymphatic vessels, fibrosis, and, ultimately, adipose tissue hypertrophy.

### Lymphatic interventions for chylothorax: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145hNGK]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the efficacy of lymphatic interventions for chylothorax.

Materials and Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for English-language studies until March 2017 that included patients with chylothorax treated with lymphangiography (LAG), thoracic duct embolization (TDE), or thoracic duct disruption (TDD). Exclusion criteria were as follows: a sample size of less than 10 patients, no extractable data, or data included in subsequent articles or duplicate reports.

Results

The cases of 407 patients from 9 studies were evaluated. The pooled technical success rates of LAG and TDE were 94.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.4%-97.2%; I² = 46.7%) and 63.1% (95% CI, 55.4%-70.2%; I² = 37.3%), respectively. The pooled clinical success rates of LAG, TDE, and TDD, on a per-protocol basis, were 56.6% (95% CI, 45.4%-67.2%; I² = 5.4%), 79.4% (95% CI, 64.8%-89.0%; I² = 68.1%), and 60.8% (95% CI, 49.4%-71.2%; I² = 0%), respectively. The pooled major complication rate of LAG and TDE was 1.9% (95% CI, 0.8%-4.3%; I² = 0%) and 2.4% (95% CI, 0.9%-6.6%; I² = 26.4%), respectively. The pooled overall clinical success rate of lymphatic interventions, on an intention-to-treat basis, was 60.1% (95% CI, 52.1%-67.7%; I² = 54.3%). Etiology of chylothorax was identified as a significant source of heterogeneity for the pooled clinical success rate of TDE and overall clinical success rate.

Conclusions

Lymphatic interventions have a respectable efficacy for the treatment of chylothorax.

### Magnetic resonance lymphangiography in children: what the radiologist needs to know [^1123itxd]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) has revolutionized the evaluation of lymphatic system disorders in pediatric patients, offering unparalleled details without the risks of ionizing radiation. This imaging modality is pivotal for diagnosing congenital lymphatic anomalies, chylothorax, lymphedema, and vascular malformations, which require precise characterization for optimal management. Pediatric radiologists must understand MRL's technical nuances, including contrast protocols, imaging sequences, and postprocessing techniques, as well as its role in guiding therapeutic interventions. This article provides a comprehensive overview of MRL in children, highlighting its indications, interpretative challenges, and the integration of findings into multidisciplinary care for this complex patient population.

### Modern techniques of lymphangiography and interventions: current status and future development [^115TSX3D]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

One of the crucial functions of the lymphatic system is maintenance of fluid balance. Nonetheless, due to lack of clinical imaging and interventional techniques, the lymphatic system has been under the radar of the medical community. The recently developed intranodal lymphangiography and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography provide new insight into lymphatic pathology. Thoracic duct embolization has become the method of choice for the treatment of patients with chylous leaks. Interstitial lymphatic embolization further expanded the lymphatic embolization approaches. Liver lymphatic lymphangiography and embolization allow treatment of postsurgical liver lymphorrhea and protein-losing enteropathy. The potential for further growth of lymphatic interventions is vast and includes liver lymphatic procedures and advanced thoracic duct interventions, such as thoracic duct externalization and stenting. These current and future advances will open up a realm of new treatments and diagnostic opportunities.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, more specifically with respect to management of chylothorax, ERS 2010 guidelines recommend to decide on the decision to intervene and the choice of technique for symptomatic chylous pleural effusions on an individual basis based on clinical evaluation, including the amount of chyle collected, recurrence of chylothorax, respiratory condition of the patient, and consideration of future lung transplantation.

### Clinical characteristics, evaluation and outcomes of chylopericardium: a systematic review [^1152cmBP]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chylopericardium (CPE) or chylous pericardial effusion is a rare disease associated with accumulation of triglyceride-rich fluid in the pericardial space. The aetiology of CPE is multifactorial. The primary causes are idiopathic/viral, whereas the secondary causes include postcardiothoracic surgery, radiation exposure, trauma, malignancy and infection. The proposed mechanism of CPE is attributed to lymphatic system damage, leading to abnormal communication between the thoracic duct and the pericardial lymphatic channels. This results in the outflow of chyle into the pericardial space from the lymphatic duct and subsequent accumulation. There is a paucity of literature describing the epidemiology, natural history and outcomes in CPE, and to our knowledge only one prior systematic review on CPE exists. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review to study the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with CPE, specifically investigating their clinical course and the role of multimodality imaging in diagnosis and management.

### Liver lymphatic anatomy and role in systemic lymphatic disease [^113jeewn]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Previously, a few different etiologies of chylothorax and PB have been described and predominately originate from retrograde PLP from the central lymphatics. However, there have been several patients in our study that have PB and/or chylothorax with no significant PLP identified from the thoracic duct, suggesting another possible lymphatic source. With organ-specific intrahepatic lymphangiography, we identified a subset of patients who have abnormal connections from the liver lymphatics with direct connections to the pulmonary lymphatics bypassing the central lymphatic system. Liver lymphatic imaging should likely be performed in all patients with chylothorax and PB when central lymphatic imaging is normal.

One unique group that has not been previously reported was the abnormal connection/flow from the hepatic lymphatics to the mesentery (hepatomesentery). It is unclear how these abnormal connections or reversal of flow develops or how this affects the drainage of intestinal lymphatics. It could result in bowel edema or even potentially ascites with the dilated and congested lymphatics leaking into the peritoneum. However, in our small group of patients with these findings, there was no clear association with any specific type of lymphatic disorder.

Subsets of PLE, particularly patients that have congenital heart disease, are known to have abnormal hepatoduodenal connections that were seen in a small series of patients. In our larger cohort of 47 patients with PLE, hepatoduodenal connections were almost pathognomonic in our study population. This will need further investigation, but it does suggest that abnormal hepatic connections could be much more common in this patient population than previously thought.

In addition to the identification of the four abnormal compartment connections from the liver lymphatics in disease states, we have also determined that the presence of these connections has a clinically significant implication in their disease course. In patients who underwent lymphatic interventions, those with abnormal liver lymphatics required more interventions, had a longer time for symptom resolution, and were more likely to have a failure of treatment with symptoms present 6 months after the intervention. This could be caused by the delayed diagnosis of liver involvement in disease as there were a significant number of patients that had previous lymphatic interventions in this study. In addition, there may be individual differences between each subgroup of abnormal lymphatics and disease presentation that this study was not powered to detect. Even with the early identification and intervention, it is still likely there are differences between this etiology of these diseased vessels, such as the number/density/location of the abnormal lymph vessels as well as their response post-treatment that are unknown.

### MR lymphangiography: congenital lymphatic flow disorders [^116xfHN9]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Congenital lymphatic flow disorders collectively refer to a heterogeneous group of diseases that manifest as chylothorax, chylous ascites, intestinal lymphangiectasia, protein-losing enteropathy, and peripheral extremity or genital lymphedema, all in the absence of identifiable injury to the lymphatic system. We have only recently begun to understand congenital lymphatic flow disorders through the ability to image lymph flow dynamically. Intranodal dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography (DCMRL) is a crucial technique for imaging lymphatic flow in pediatric patients with congenital lymphatic flow disorders. However, as lymphatic imaging is still a nascent discipline with many uncertainties regarding optimal imaging and treatment, effective patient management requires a comprehensive understanding of imaging techniques, disease pathophysiology, and multidisciplinary treatment approaches. Above all, a fundamental understanding of the physiological lymphatic flow of the central conducting lymphatics is essential for the correct interpretation of DCMRL images. This knowledge helps to avoid unnecessary examinations, erroneous diagnoses, and potentially harmful treatment approaches. This review provides an overview of the methods, advantages, and precautions for interpreting the DCMRL examination, a state-of-the-art lymphatic system imaging technique, and shares various case studies.

### Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography [^114A3sF5]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic flow disorders include a broad spectrum of abnormalities that can originate in the lymphatic or the venous system. The development of these disorders is multifactorial and is most commonly associated with congenital heart diseases and palliative surgeries that these patients undergo. Central lymphatic disorders might be secondary to traumatic leaks, lymphatic overproduction, conduction abnormalities or lymphedema, and they can progress to perfusion anomalies. Several imaging modalities have been used to visualize the lymphatic system. However, the imaging of central lymphatic flow has always been challenging. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography (DCMRL) allows for visualization of central lymphatic flow disorders and has been recently applied for the assessment of plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy, chylothorax and chylopericardium, among other lymphatic disorders. The hepatic and mesenteric accesses are innovative and promising techniques for better identification and understanding of these abnormalities. The main objectives of this review are to discuss the physiology and anatomy of the lymphatic system and review the current uses of DCMRL in the diagnosis and management of lymphatic flow disorders.

Introduction

The main function of the lymphatic system is to remove proteins and fluid from the interstitial space and deliver them back to the venous circulation. The liver is one of the largest contributors of lymphatic fluid, comprising up to 50% of thoracic duct flow and in diseases causing liver congestion, such as heart failure, liver lymphatic flow increases exponentially. There are three categories of liver lymphatic vessels characterized by location: capsular, sublobular, and portal. Liver lymph is generated from hepatic sinusoids in the space of Disse and is connected with the peri-portal space of Mall where the lymphatic capillary vessels begin. The deep portal lymphatics converge at the liver hilum and drain into a complex network of peripancreatic and paraaortic lymph nodes that ultimately connect with the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. The sublobular lymphatics travel along the hepatic veins toward the wall of the inferior vena cava and the capsular lymphatics drain into the mediastinum (convex surface) or toward the liver hilum (concave surface). All of these networks are essential for efficient lymphatic drainage but can become deranged in various pathological conditions.

Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) or primary lymphatic disorders can develop lymphatic complications, such as protein losing enteropathy (PLE), chylothorax, chylous ascites, and plastic bronchitis (PB), which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Recent advancements in lymphatic imaging using dynamic MRI have greatly advanced our understanding of the abnormalities present in these patient populations. However, there remains a paucity of literature reports describing the liver lymphatic circulation in humans. Conventional liver lymphangiography has demonstrated abnormalities in patients with liver cirrhosis and chylous ascites as well as PLE and hepatic lymphorrhea and the original liver lymphatic descriptions relied on standard lymphangiography as well as post-mortem analysis. More recently, non-contrast MR liver lymphography has been described as a new technique to noninvasively visualize similar components of the liver lymphatics and changes that occur in portal hypertension. However, this technique only provides a static visualization and does not provide dynamic information that is crucial for possible interventions in systemic lymphatic diseases. Recently, Biko et al. have described the development of intrahepatic dynamic contrast MR lymphangiography (IH-DCMRL). This technique has several important advantages over conventional liver imaging in that it is 3-dimensional, has good tissue contrast, provides perfusion information, and can visualize well the distal perfused structures.

The purpose of this article is to investigate the anatomy and flow of the efferent liver lymphatic circulation in patients with systemic lymphatic disease.

Primary isolated chylopericardium is a rare condition with little known cause. This is the case of a 22-year-old woman in whom idiopathic chylopericardium developed. A lymphangiogram followed by a computed tomographic scan demonstrated occlusion of the thoracic duct and multiple lymphatic collaterals abutting the pericardial sac. Thoracic duct ligation resulted in the complete cure of the patient's condition. We theorized that the development of the pathologic lymphatic ducts in close proximity to the pericardium resulted in the development of the slowly accumulating chylopericardium.

Introduction

Chylothorax is defined by the presence of chyle in the pleural space. Chyle represents the lymphatic fluid mainly absorbed by the digestive tract, which is rich in fat and white blood cells, and normally transported back to the circulation by the thoracic duct. Chylothorax has a characteristic milky appearance with lymphocytic predominance. It is further defined by triglyceride levels above 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and low cholesterol levels. The expected pleural to serum triglyceride ratio is above 1 and that of cholesterol is inferior to 1. A pleural triglyceride level below 50 mg/dl excludes chylous effusion. Although this entity is quite rare, it can cause serious mortality and morbidity. Most chylous effusions are exudative in nature, but in rare instances they can be transudative. The majority are right sided (up to 50%), with a minority presenting bilaterally.

Failing Fontan continues to be major problem for patients on the univentricular pathway. Failing Fontan is often complicated by chylothorax, plastic bronchitis and protein loosing enteropathy. The role of lymphatic circulation in Fontan circulation is still being researched. Newer imaging modalities give insight into the role of abnormal dilatation and retrograde flow in lymphatic channels post Fontan. Interventional strategies targeting abnormal lymphatic channels, provides an alternative management strategy for patients with failing Fontan. This review focuses on the role of lymphatic system in adaptations to Fontan circulation.

Chylothorax

Chylothorax is the presence of lymphatic or chylous fluid in pleural space. Milky pleural fluid with a triglyceride concentration greater than 110 mg/dl or the presence of chylomicrons on lipoprotein electrophoresis confirms the diagnosis of chylothorax. The most common cause is due to iatrogenic trauma during surgery, chylothorax has been reported in 0.42% of cases of thoracic surgery. Non-traumatic causes have also been described, with malignant disorders being the most frequent, especially in patients affected by lymphoma or pulmonary cancer. As a consequence of invasion or compression by the tumour, the pressure in the lymph vessels increases, making them more susceptible to lymphatic extravasation. Other causes are idiopathic, congenital, autoimmune or infectious (mainly tuberculosis).

Management of chylothorax depends on its severity. Chylothorax is considered to be low output when there is a loss of less than 500 cc per day, and it can be treated conservatively, with a low-fat diet, parenteral nutrition, octreotide administration and pleural drainage tubes. These conservative measures are successful in up to 50–60% of the cases.

High output chylothorax is defined when there is loss of more than 1000 cc of lymph in 24h; and often is not controlled with conservative measures. In these cases, patients suffer loss of nutrients, immune cells and proteins, resulting in a high morbidity and mortality. Traditionally it has been approached surgically by attempting TD ligation by means of video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Conversion to open thoracotomy is performed when it is not possible to locate the TD thoracoscopically but it is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates (2.1% vs. 38.8%respectively). Reported surgical success rates are 70% in children and range between 70% and 100% in adults. Other surgical alternatives are the creation of a pleuroperitoneal shunt and pleurodesis.

LA, with or without TD embolization, offers a less invasive approach supported by growing evidence demonstrating favourable outcomes in both adult and paediatric populations, including patients that recurred post-surgery. Decision-making typically hinges on individual patient evolution following conservative interventions when chyle output falls within the range between two breakpoints (> 500cc and < 1000cc/day) (Fig. 4 b, c).

### Liver lymphatic anatomy and role in systemic lymphatic disease [^1134jVTV]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using novel lymphatic imaging techniques, this study has identified an under-appreciated role of liver lymphatics in systemic lymphatic diseases. Five different imaging categories (normal, hepatoperitoneal, hepatopulmonary, hepatomesenteric, and hepatoduodenal) were identified and further observed that they were substantially correlated with disease presentation (normal – chylothorax/PB, hepatoperitoneal – ascites/chylothorax, hepatopulmonary – chylothorax/PB, hepatoduodenal – PLE). In addition, the presence of abnormal patterns correlated with increased morbidity of their disease.

Liver lymphatics are a major contributor to central lymphatic flow and while their role in systemic diseases such as liver cirrhosis and heart failure have been studied previously, there is little information about the involvement in systemic lymphatic disorders. This has in part been limited by the inability to clinically visualize the liver lymphatics. However, with recent advancements in imaging modalities and techniques, we can now visualize organ-specific lymphatic connections such as those from the liver. We have used these new modalities and now report on the role of the liver lymphatics in chylothorax, ascites, PB, and PLE.

The identification of normal hepatic lymphatic connections has been predominately studied from traditional lymphangiography and anatomic studies and have been limited in their ability to describe a 3D relationship and distal connections with the central lymphatic system. In our cohort, we had a significant number of patients with anatomically normal connections via perihepatic/peripancreatic/paraaortic lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes that drain into the central thoracic duct. This is the largest known cohort to show the detail of these connections. Furthermore, using the normal anatomy as a baseline we identified four types of abnormal connections.

We identified that abnormal hepatoperitoneal connections were most commonly observed in patients with underlying ascites consistent with previously reported case studies. In this group, standard intranodal lymphangiography did not elucidate the mechanism and was only visualized with hepatic lymphatic imaging. While there have been previous reports of abnormal hepatic lymphatic drainage in ascites, our results indicate this could be a much more common mechanism than previously thought and would suggest considering an evaluation of liver lymphatics in all patients with ascites.

### Chyluria and chylothorax after posterior selective fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^116FjjUN]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe and discuss the diagnostic and treatment complexity of lymphatic system complications after scoliosis surgery.

Methods

Surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is very commonly performed with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. Complications of the anteriorly based lymphatic system are, therefore, rare. We present a case with complications related to the lymphatic system, which have not been reported before after this type of surgery.

Results

After standard Th3 to Th12 posterior spinal reduction and fusion of a moderate thoracic curve, chyluria and a chylothorax developed in an adolescent girl. This appeared to be caused by an obstruction of the thoracic duct. Thorax drainage and finally thoracoscopic intervention prevented further pulmonal impairment. The exact cause could not be identified and the persistent lymph drainage problems had to be treated with a medium chain triglyceride diet.

Conclusion

With this report, we aim to create awareness of the lymphatic system in general and the possibility of severe complications, even after a posterior only approach of the vertebral column.

### Chyloptysis in adults: presentation, recognition, and differential diagnosis [^111TWKwx]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Chyloptysis is a rare finding, and the accompanying respiratory symptoms are usually nonspecific. The recognition of the chylous nature of the sputum is requisite for proper diagnosis, especially if chyloptysis is not accompanied by chylous pleural effusion. The key to the differential diagnosis of chyloptysis is to consider illnesses that can induce reflux of chyle into the bronchial tree. There are two mechanisms postulated: the first requires the presence of an abnormal communication between the bronchial tree and the lymphatic channels, and the second requires a bronchopleural fistula in the context of a chylous pleural effusion. Chyloptysis in adults should prompt assessment for evidence of lymphatic obstruction from trauma, radiation, and malignancy, and to exclude diseases with known association with chyloptysis, ie, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, yellow nail syndrome, or thoracic lymphangiectasis. A lymphangiogram is recommended to define the abnormality. In the case of lymphangiectasis, patients respond to either dietary modification and/or ligation of the thoracic duct.

### Mediastinal lymphangioma and intestinal lymphangiomatosis presenting with chylothorax: a systematic review of therapeutic modalities [^116cKHw8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax can also present in some congenital diseases such as Down Syndrome, Noonan Syndrome, and Yellow Nail Syndrome. Other known entities are Gorham's disease, diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Primary lymphatic disease such as mediastinal lymphangioma is an unusual cause.

Mediastinal lymphangiomas can be present in infants as well as in adults, are benign, extremely rare, and account for 4.5% of mediastinal tumors. There are three histological subtypes: capillary, cystic and cavernous. Lymphangiomas occur solely or in conjunction with systemic lymphatic disorders such as lymphangiomatosis. Lymphangiomatosis, which is a congenital benign malformation of the lymphatic system, is believed to be secondary to a miscommunication between the main lymphatic and the peri lymphatic vessels. It can affect multiple organs including mediastinum, pleura, lung, bones, mesentery, peritoneum and retroperitoneum. Mediastinal lymphangiomas can cause infections, SVC syndrome, and airway compromise. Chylothorax and chylopericardium can also develop with subsequent signs of tamponade and heart failure. We present herein a case of intestinal lymphangiomatosis associated with mediastinal lymphangioma presenting with a left sided chylothorax.

### Nontraumatic chylothorax: nonenhanced MR lymphography [^114xqtGm]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax is a rare cause of pleural effusion, secondary to accumulation of lymph in the pleural space. Diagnosis is based on the triglyceride and cholesterol content of pleural fluid obtained with thoracentesis. Because the lymphatic system plays an essential role in fat absorption and immune response, lymphatic leak associated with chylothorax may cause life-threatening malnutrition and immunodeficiency. Chylothorax is usually described as traumatic or nontraumatic. The main cause of chylothorax is traumatic, typically postsurgical, secondary to iatrogenic direct puncture of the thoracic duct during thoracic surgery. Causes of nontraumatic chylothorax include a wide range of differential diagnoses. Lymphoma and thoracic malignancies are the most common causes and are responsible for chylothorax by extrinsic compression or invasion of the thoracic duct. Other rare causes include primary and secondary diffuse lymphatic diseases, responsible for chylothorax by lymphatic vessel wall dysfunction. Imaging the lymphatic system remains a challenge in the days of modern imaging. Nonenhanced MR lymphography is a noninvasive technique based on heavily T2-weighted sequences, thus enabling visualization of the lymphatic circulation. This technique allows diagnosis and differential diagnosis, evaluation of disease severity, and guidance of therapeutic management in nontraumatic chylothorax. Furthermore, it may offer radiologic classification of primary lymphatic diseases on the basis of morphologic features of lymphatic vessels. The authors describe the anatomy and physiology of the thoracic lymphatic system, present the technique of nonenhanced MR lymphography, and discuss pathophysiologic mechanisms and imaging features in different causes of nontraumatic chylothorax. © RSNA, 2020.

### Recurrent chylothorax in a patient with serositis as the only manifestation of IgG4-related disease: the diagnostic challenge and consideration [^113VX2Ht]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic fibroinflammatory disorder characterised by IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration into different tissues and organs. Among the heterogeneous clinical features of IgG4-RD, serositis, including pleural and pericardial effusions, is a rare and poorly understood presentation. We described a woman in her late 70s who developed recurrent chylothorax and failed to respond to corticosteroids, immunosuppressives and intrapleural octreotide injection while being treated for newly diagnosed IgG4-RD with serositis as the only manifestation. Her chylothorax was thought to be due to fibroinflammatory damage of the lymphatic duct system from her IgG4-RD, as other differential diagnoses have been largely excluded. We demonstrate the difficulty in establishing the diagnosis of IgG4-RD when only serositis is present, the importance of meticulous workup ruling out other causes and clinical judgement in identifying disease complications versus evaluating alternative diagnoses.

### Abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow in patients with paediatric pulmonary lymphatic disorders: diagnosis and treatment [^116ZgXoC]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary lymphatic disorders are characterized by the presence of the abnormal lymphatic tissues in the thoracic cavity, presenting clinically as chylothorax, chylopericardium, chyloptysis, interstitial lung disease and plastic bronchitis. These conditions include: neonatal chylothorax, cardiac and non-cardiac plastic bronchitis, non-traumatic chylothorax, post congenital cardiac surgery chylothorax and complex lymphatic malformations. Recently developed lymphatic imaging techniques, such as intranodal lymphangiography and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography demonstrated abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow from thoracic duct into pulmonary parenchyma as a pathophysiological mechanism of these diseases. Novel minimally invasive lymphatic interventions, such as thoracic duct embolization, interstitial lymphatic embolization and surgical lympho-venous anastomosis, provide an effective treatment of these conditions.

### Recurrent chylothorax: a clinical mystery [^115LZRJ7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion is a common clinical problem, with estimated 1–1.5 million new cases in the USA each year. It is defined as an excess of fluid in the pleural cavity and is a consequence of imbalance of pleural fluid production, absorption or both. Chylothorax is a rare cause of pleural effusion that results from thoracic duct damage with chyle leakage from the lymphatic system into the pleural space. Chylothoraces contain a high concentration of triglycerides in the form of chylomicrons, lymphocytes and immunoglobulins.

Iatrogenic injury from thoracic surgery is the most common traumatic cause, while non-traumatic causes include various aetiologies such as malignancy, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, congenital duct abnormalities and diseases of the lymph vessels such as yellow nail syndrome and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Clinically, dyspnoea, chest pain and cough are the most common symptoms of chylothorax. Malnutrition from loss of protein and immunosuppression from loss of immunoglobulins into pleural space might lead to weight loss and infections.

Imaging typically shows pleural effusion that is most often right-sided due to the anatomy of thoracic duct. Thoracic duct crosses from the right to left posterior mediastinum at level of T5; thus, damage to the duct above T5 typically leads to left-sided effusion, whereas damage below leads to a right-sided effusion.

Pleural fluid appearance might be the first clue to diagnosing chylothorax. The appearance of fluid from a chylothorax is typically milky; however, it can be serous or sanguineous. Cholesterol pleural effusion and empyema might appear similar. Supernatant of the pleural fluid from a chylothorax typically fails to clear after centrifugation, whereas empyema fluid clears.

### Chylothorax in infants and children… [^112FZkdD]. publications.aap.org (2014). Low credibility.

Chylothorax, the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, is a relatively rare cause of pleural effusion in children. It can cause significant respiratory morbidity, as well as lead to malnutrition and immunodeficiency. Thus, a chylothorax requires timely diagnosis and treatment. This review will first discuss the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system and discuss various causes that can lead to development of a chylothorax in infants and children. Then, methods of diagnosis and treatment will be reviewed. Finally, complications of chylothorax will be reviewed. Copyright © 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics 2014 Comments Congenital Chylothorax. Recently, we widely discussed various mechanisms that are claimed to be possibly involved in congenital chylous effusion by changing transpleural pressure balance, impairing lymphatic drainage and increasing mesothelial and capillary endothelial permeability.

Furthermore, we described the origin and the unique structure of the pleural lymphatics and concluded that the specific architecture has important consequences on pleural fluid formation and removal. In a muliticenter retrospective multinational study from 8 centers we followed 33 neonates with visceral chylous effusion of whom 31 had chylothorax and two had chylous ascites 3. Among infants born with chylothorax the male/female ratio was about 2: 1 and pleural fluid accumulated more frequently on the right side. When the diagnosis was made in near term or at term, delivery and postnatal drainage was preferred 4. Eight patients were treated with Octreotide to reduce accumulation of chyle at dosages ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/kg/hour for 8 to 38 days. All patients showed decreased chylous production. Following the cessation of fluid accumulation, the clinical course was mostly dependent on the associated medical problems.

Cases of demise were during the primary hospitalization due to congenital malformations. None of the patients died once they reached suitable general clinical conditions allowing enteral feeding. At follow up, now up to the age of 14 years the neonates discharged are mostly within normal weight and height percentiles, and unless suffering from medical conditions associated with mental retardation are apparently functioning as expected for their age with regards to feeding and cognitive milestones3.

### Interventional radiology in the management of thoracic duct injuries: anatomy, techniques and results [^113fuP39]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Disruption of the thoracic duct can have devastating consequences and be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Conservative therapies have been attempted to treat chylothorax without much success. Surgical management has traditionally been necessary to provide definitive treatment at the expense of increased morbidity. Lymphatic interventions have recently emerged as a new frontier for interventional radiologists to add value and provide minimally invasive therapies for debilitating conditions. The goal of this manuscript is to review the anatomy of the thoracic duct, describe various percutaneous techniques for accessing the duct, and briefly discuss outcomes as reported in the literature.

### Chylothorax as a complication of pulmonary tuberculosis in children [^115C1XLQ]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is a rare clinical entity characterized by a milky white aspirate with increased triglyceride levels. The commonest aetiology is malignancy and trauma. Pulmonary tuberculosis is an extremely rare cause of chylothorax. Two children with chylothorax and pulmonary tuberculosis are described. One child had bilateral and the other unilateral chylous effusions. Extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy was demonstrated. Diseased lymph nodes may infiltrate other intrathoracic structures such as the thoracic duct, and they can also obstruct the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. A possible explanation for the development of a chylothorax in our patients is obstruction of the thoracic duct by tuberculous lymphadenopathy with subsequent increase in pressure in the surrounding lymphatic system and leaking of chyle into the pleural space.

The purpose of nutritional management is to decrease lymphatic flow. Treatment options include a delayed feeding strategy and MCT formula. Long-chain fatty acids are transported in the form of chylomicrons by the lymphatic system. High fat intake increases lymphatic flow significantly. An MCT formula contains little-to-no fat, thus by passing intestinal lymphatic processing and are absorbed directly into the portal venous system. An MCT formula is gradually introduced by the end of the first week after birth. An MCT formula is often continued for a period of 6 months until a pleural effusion does not recur.

Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that is also commonly used to reduce lymphatic flow. Octreotide is introduced when pleural drainage and diet modification are ineffective. The recommended therapeutic dose and response of octreotide reported in the literature are mixed, often with intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 1 μg/kg/h and gradually increasing to 10 μg/kg/h, according to the therapeutic response. Side effects and complications include hyperglycemia, abdominal distension, bloody stools, and pulmonary hypertension. It has been suggested that high doses of octreotide can be used to treat refractory chylothorax, and the dose of octreotide can be safely titrated to a maximum of 20ug/kg/h with no significant side effects.

Tamaoka et al. successfully eliminated effusion by using midodrine, an oral alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonist, in a patient with refractory chylothorax. Tomobe et al. used combination therapy with etilefrine and pleurodesis for refractory CC. The emergence of these new drugs provides more options for the clinical treatment of refractory chylothorax, but most are reports of individual cases. The efficacy and safety of these drugs need to be further evaluated.

Surgical intervention, including chemical pleurodesis, is the final treatment to cure CC. Most CC infants achieve complete remission 3–4 weeks after birth. Surgical intervention should be considered around 6 weeks when conservative treatment fails. OK-432 is an inactivated preparation of human-derived Streptococcus pyogenes with immunological activity and is often used to induce aseptic inflammation of the pleura. In addition to extrauterine treatment, OK-432 pleurodes is also successfully used for fetal pleural effusions in utero.

### Milky pleural effusion in a neonate and approach to investigating chylothorax [^113QGrTx]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Chyle is a non-inflammatory, alkaline, bacteriostatic fluid composed of immunoglobulins, lymphocytes and dietary lipids. The thoracic duct transports a comparatively large volume of chyle daily, resulting in a rapid, significant accumulation of fluid within the pleural cavity in case of disruption to the flow. The lymphatics from the lower half of the body converge behind the aorta to form the thoracic duct, which runs on the right side of the vertebral column, locating the largest part of the thoracic duct within the right hemithorax, explaining the reason for chylothorax being frequently right sided. During the natural course of chylothorax, a chyloma (collection of chyle below the pleura) develops, which eventually bursts through the pleura to accumulate within the pleural space. Clinical manifestations of chylothorax depend on the rate of chyle leakage and the duration of chylothorax. Rapid considerable chyle accumulation can lead to significant cardiorespiratory morbidity by creating a positive pressure within the pleural cavity, as observed in the index patient. When long-standing, due to chronic loss of lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, chylothorax can lead to immunodeficiency, while chronic loss of fat and fat-soluble vitamins leads to malnutrition. However, infections rarely occur in the extravasated chyle due to its bacteriostatic nature.

The diagnosis of chylothorax is based on the demonstration of chylomicrons and lymphocytes in the pleural fluid. The presence of chylomicrons can be confirmed by the elevated fluid triglyceride levels above the established cut-off limit of 1.24 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) or by the gold standard lipoprotein electrophoresis. Fluid triglyceride levels < 0.56 mmol/L typically exclude chylothorax. Therefore, lipoprotein electrophoresis is essential, especially when the triglyceride levels are inconclusive (0.56–1.24 mmol/L or 50–110 mg/dL), as observed in this patient. Identification of chylomicrons by lipoprotein electrophoresis is based on the separation of lipoprotein particles according to their charge and mass under an electrical field. Due to the low protein content, chylomicrons are uncharged and remain at the origin (point of application), while any other lipoproteins present will demonstrate electrophoretic mobility.

### MR lymphangiography in children: technique and potential applications [^113J1KkT]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

The lymphatic system, an important component of the circulatory system with essential physiologic functions, can be affected by various disease processes. There has been a delay in the development of effective imaging methods for the lymphatic system due to its small size, which limits visualization as well as introduction of contrast material. Traditionally, the lymphatic system has been imaged by injecting contrast material or radiotracers into the feet or hands. This is not sufficient for assessment of the central conducting lymphatics (CCLs) (such as the thoracic duct or the cisterna chyli). Fluoroscopic intranodal lymphangiography with injection of oil-based contrast material into groin lymph nodes improves visualization of CCLs but is limited in practice owing to the use of radiation and the potential risk for paradoxical embolization in children with left-to-right shunt. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography, which is performed by injecting gadolinium-based contrast material into groin lymph nodes, overcomes these limitations. T2-weighted imaging plays a complementary role to DCE MR lymphangiography in the assessment of CCLs. DCE MR lymphangiography demonstrates preserved integrity or any abnormality of the CCLs (including blockage or leak). The technique has recently been used in evaluating pulmonary lymphatic perfusion syndrome in children with plastic bronchitis, neonatal lymphatic flow disorders, and nontraumatic chylothorax. It is useful in identification of the source of chylous ascites and contributes to understanding of the anatomy of lymphatic malformations. It is successfully used for planning of embolization of aberrant lymphatic channels in a variety of lymphatic flow disorders. This review discusses the anatomy and function of the lymphatic system, the evolution of imaging of the lymphatic system, and DCE MR lymphangiography technique and its applications in children. © RSNA, 2017.

The lymphatic system (LS) is susceptible to be affected by various diseases, stemming from both malignant and benign origins. Among the primary causes of lymphatic leakages, we can find congenital anomalies and traumatic injuries affecting the LS. Non-traumatic chyle leaks are frequently secondary to processes causing lymphatic obstruction, such as malignant occlusion, lymphatic vessel abnormality, systemic or congenital diseases, or idiopathic obstruction.

The most frequent causes of chyle leakage are iatrogenic injuries, mostly secondary to thoracic or abdominal surgery, with chylothorax rates as high as 3.9% after oesophagectomy Typically, lymphatic leaks manifest in two scenarios: during surgical resections, particularly in oncological cases necessitating extensive lymphadenectomy, or in surgeries where the operative field intersects with major lymphatic vessels.

Traditionally, managing such complications leaned towards conservative measures. However, persistent lymphatic leaks often prompted recourse to aggressive open or laparoscopic surgical interventions, albeit with associated morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays and patient recovery periods.

Initially, diagnostic procedures involved injecting blue dye between the toes, exposing a lymphatic vessel on the foot dorsum for cannulation after dissection, followed by ethiodized oil injection and serial radiography from the foot to the thorax to track contrast progression.

Conventional lymphangiography (LA) emerged as a diagnostic tool in the 1950s, but with the advent of advanced imaging modalities such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR), it was relegated to the background transitioning to a therapeutic modality with the introduction of thoracic duct (TD) embolization for chylothorax by Dr. Constantine Cope in the 90's. During 2011 and 2012 intranodal lymphangiography surfaced as a simpler alternative. Over recent decades, LA has ascended as a minimally invasive procedure, yielding favourable outcomes and witnessing technique refinements from pedal LA to encompass the treatment of diverse conditions like chylous ascites, paediatric chylothorax, plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy, lymphoceles, and thoracic duct stenting.

### Postoperative chylothorax [^111TsMNe]. Chest Surgery Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is an unusual complication of surgical procedures within the chest. Early recognition is important so that appropriate conservative measures can be applied. Operative intervention after a short course of supportive therapy will control most chyle fistulas. Methods of diagnosis in the postoperative setting and literature supporting various treatment options are the focus of this article.

### Outcomes of conservative management for chylothorax following minimally invasive lung cancer surgery [^111pj134]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax, a rare but serious complication of lung cancer surgery, results from lymphatic injury during mediastinal lymph node dissection. If untreated, it can cause nutritional and immunologic deficits, impairing recovery and increasing infection risk. The incidence of chylothorax is relatively low (approximately 0.5–3%). Although our study focused on patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery, we retrospectively reviewed the incidence of chylothorax among patients who underwent thoracotomy during the same period. Among 337 thoracotomy cases, 3 patients developed chylothorax, corresponding to an incidence of 0.9%. While this analysis was not part of the original study design and no statistical comparison was performed, this rate is consistent with previously reported ranges and provides context for the incidence observed in our MIS cohort. The standard treatment paradigm involves initiating conservative management, including dietary modifications, TPN, and pleurodesis, and progressing to surgical re-intervention only when conservative measures fail. Many studies have used a pleural drainage threshold of 500 mL/day to assess the likelihood of conservative treatment success and recommend surgery if significant reductions in output are not observed over a defined period; however, the role of surgical intervention, particularly thoracic duct ligation, as an alternative to failed conservative treatment remains controversial. Owing to the anatomical variability and complexity of the thoracic duct pathways, ligation alone often fails to produce dramatic improvements in chylous effusion. Although surgery remains a last-resort option, it may not always be optimal.

### Mediastinal lymphangioma and intestinal lymphangiomatosis presenting with chylothorax: a systematic review of therapeutic modalities [^1151MrJN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chylothorax is defined by the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, characterized by triglyceride levels exceeding 110 milligrams per deciliter. The clinical presentation of chylothorax varies depending on its acuity and underlying etiology. Mediastinal lymphangiomas are extremely rare and benign lesions that can affect both infants and adults. They may occur independently or in association with other lymphatic disorders and can lead to complications such as chylothorax.

Case report

A 60-year-old male patient presented with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with left-sided chylothorax secondary to mediastinal lymphangioma, accompanied by intestinal lymphangiomatosis. Conservative approach was unsuccessful, and surgical therapy was needed.

Materials and methods

We conducted a thorough search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar databases. The search parameters we used included the following Boolean terms: [("lymphangioma" OR "mediastinal lymphangioma" OR "cavernous lymphangiomas" OR "cystic hygromas" OR "capillary lymphangioma" OR "lymphangioma simplex") AND ("chylothorax" OR "chylous pleural effusion" OR "chylous effusion" OR "chylous lung")]. Our search yielded 166 articles in total, out of which we selected 17 articles for inclusion. We included patients who presented to the hospital with chylothorax secondary to mediastinal lymphangioma and those who developed chylothorax after the removal of mediastinal lymphangioma. The primary outcome was the total number of reported cases of chylothorax secondary to mediastinal lymphangioma. The secondary outcomes included patient characteristics, fluid characteristics, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic modalities.

Results

The systematic review encompassed seventeen case reports. Most patients were male, spanning ages from six weeks to 82 years, with an average age of 28.35 years. Most pleural effusions were on the left side. Few cases were asymptomatic, while the most reported symptom was shortness of breath. The mean pleural triglyceride level was 708 mg/dl, with cystic hygroma being the most common subtype. The anterior mediastinum was the most frequent location. The primary treatment involved surgical removal of the lymphangioma along with thoracic duct ligation.

Conclusion

Mediastinal lymphangioma is an infrequent etiology of chylothorax and is scarcely documented in the literature. It may be present in isolation or may be associated with extra mediastinal lymphatic anomalies. The management of chylothorax in such cases is challenging with conservative measures often being ineffective, necessitating surgical intervention. The rarity of these conditions complicates the study of potential risk factors and genetic predispositions. Furthermore, there is no established consensus on the therapeutic modalities for patients with similar diagnoses which vary based on patient characteristics.

### Idiopathic chylothorax in a young man [^112nPB1g]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Chylothorax refers to the presence of chyle in the pleural space owing to disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct or one of its tributaries. We present a case of non-traumatic, idiopathic chylothorax in an 18-year-old man. Lymphoscintigraphy was used to identify the site of leak. We tried the full armamentarium of available non-surgical therapy on him, including a modified diet, chest tube insertion, total parenteral nutrition and octreotide. Yet, despite optimal medical therapy, his effusion continued to persist. He eventually required thoracic duct ligation, which resulted in resolution of the effusion.

### Octreotide and chylothorax [^117NjGHX]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the current literature concerning the role of somatostatin and its synthetic analogue, octreotide, in the treatment of chylothorax.

Recent Findings

Management of chylothorax includes evacuation of the pleural cavity through a chest tube to alleviate dyspnoea, and dietary fat restriction aimed at reducing lymph flow. When these measures fail to control lymph flow, surgical interventions are employed to achieve definite closure of the thoracic duct leak. Several case reports and series have shown that octreotide is safe and probably effective in both children and adults with chylothorax of different origins. The property of somatostatin and octreotide to induce leak closure is attributed to a decelerating effect on lymph flow, although their exact mechanism of action is not well defined. In successful cases, a substantial reduction of lymph drainage through the chest tube is evident within the first few days of commencing the drug, and treatment lasts for 1–2 weeks. Treatment failure has been also reported, however.

Summary

Accumulating evidence suggests that octreotide is a putative novel therapeutic intervention for chylothorax. It is imperative that randomized controlled studies are conducted in order to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of this treatment.

Discussion and Conclusions

This case report presents excessive coughing as a probable cause of chylothorax and suggests a successful multimodal treatment strategy. There is a lack of comprehensive studies for chylothorax in children and many issues concerning diagnostic strategies and treatment algorithms remain (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Our algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of chylothorax in young children

For the proper diagnosis of chylothorax biochemical fluid analysis is essential. Pseudo-chylothorax, which has similar appearance and consistency, needs to be distinguished due to the completely different therapeutic approaches required. The latter is commonly associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and is cholesterol-rich (cholesterol > 200 mg/dL, triglyceride < 110 mg/dl, cholesterol/triglyceride ratio > 1 and pleural/serum cholesterol ratio > 1) when compared to chylothorax. After the diagnosis of chylothorax has been established, underlying malignancies (in particular lymphoma) must be ruled out by histopathological analysis. Further diagnostic approaches, for example MR-lymphangiography, need to be considered critically in terms of feasibility, patient safety, and clinical benefit. Imaging of the lymphatic system remains challenging. Recently, non-enhanced MR-lymphography has been attempted in nontraumatic chylothorax, which, although non-invasive, still requires sedation in young children. It has also been reported that "dual imaging lymphangiography", combining intermittent digital X-rays and live near-infrared imaging with microsurgical techniques, might be an option for refractory chylothorax. However, as conservative treatment is effective in 80% of pediatric patients, such imaging techniques should be kept for unresponsive or complicated cases.

### The thoracic duct: clinical importance, anatomic variation, imaging, and embolization [^111j99UY]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The thoracic duct is the body's largest lymphatic conduit, draining upwards of 75% of lymphatic fluid and extending from the cisterna chyli to the left jugulovenous angle. While a typical course has been described, it is estimated that it is present in only 40–60% of patients, often complicating already challenging interventional procedures. The lengthy course predisposes the thoracic duct to injury from a variety of iatrogenic disruptions, as well as spontaneous benign and malignant lymphatic obstructions and idiopathic causes. Disruption of the thoracic duct frequently results in chylothoraces, which subsequently cause an immunocompromised state, contribute to nutritional depletion, and impair respiratory function. Although conservative dietary treatments exist, the majority of thoracic duct disruptions require embolization in the interventional suite. This article provides a comprehensive review of the clinical importance of the thoracic duct, relevant anatomic variants, imaging, and embolization techniques for both diagnostic and interventional radiologists as well as for the general medical practitioner.

Key Points

- Describe clinical importance, embryologic origin, and typical course of the thoracic duct.
- Depict common/lesser-known thoracic duct anatomic variants and discuss their clinical significance.
- Outline the common causes of thoracic duct injury and indications for embolization.
- Review the thoracic duct embolization procedure including both pedal and intranodal approaches.
- Present and illustrate the success rates and complications associated with the procedure.

### Lymphovenous anastomosis for the treatment of chylothorax in infants: a novel microsurgical approach to a devastating problem [^115kv6sG]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

With the expanding horizon of microsurgical techniques, novel treatment strategies for lymphatic abnormalities are increasingly reported. Described in this article is the first reported use of lymphovenous anastomosis surgery to manage recalcitrant chylothoraces in infants. Chylothorax is an increasingly common postoperative complication after pediatric cardiac surgery, with a reported incidence of up to 9.2 percent in infants. Although conservative nutritional therapy has a reported 70 percent success rate in this patient population, failed conservative management leading to persistent chylothorax is associated with a significant risk of multisystem complications and mortality. Once conservative medical strategies are deemed unsuccessful, surgical or radiologic interventions, such as percutaneous thoracic duct embolization or ligation, are often attempted. However, these procedures lack high-level evidence in the infant population and remain a challenge, given the small size of the lymphatic vessels. As such, we report our experience with performing lymphovenous anastomoses in two infants who had developed refractory chylothoraces secondary to thoracic duct injury following cardiac surgery for congenital cardiac anomalies. In addition, this article reviews the relevant pathophysiology of chylothoraces, current treatment algorithm following failed conservative management, and potential role of the microsurgeon in the multidisciplinary management of this life-threatening problem. As part of the evolving microsurgery frontier, physiologic operations, such as lymphovenous anastomosis, may have a considerable role in the management of refractory pediatric chylothoraces. In our experience, lymphovenous anastomosis can restore normal lymphatic circulation within 1 to 2 weeks, liberate patients from mechanical ventilation, and enable expeditious return to enteral feeding.

### Idiopathic congenital chylothorax treated with octreotide [^117HFsSF]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic congenital chylothorax is defined as an abnormal accumulation of lymphatic fluid within the pleural space and is a relatively rare condition. It is a cause of progressive respiratory distress with nutritional and immunological consequences. Treatment of congenital chylothorax has been conservative management and cases unresponsive usually require surgery. We report a case of idiopathic congenital chylothorax treated with octreotide (a somatostatin analogue), avoiding surgery after failed conservative medical treatment. The patient promptly improved after initiation of endovenous octreotide treatment (10 µg/kg/h) with no observed side effects.

### Clinical approach and review of causes of a chylothorax [^1129W9sK]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A chylothorax, also known as chylous pleural effusion, is an uncommon cause of pleural effusion with a wide differential diagnosis characterized by the accumulation of bacteriostatic chyle in the pleural space. The pleural fluid will have either or both triglycerides > 110 mg/dL and the presence of chylomicrons. It may be encountered following a surgical intervention, usually in the chest, or underlying disease process. Management of a chylothorax requires a multidisciplinary approach employing medical therapy and possibly surgical intervention for post-operative patients and patients who have failed medical therapy. In this review, we aim to discuss the anatomy, fluid characteristics, etiology, and approach to the diagnosis of a chylothorax.

### Comparison of postoperative chylothorax in infants and children with trisomy 21 and without dysmorphic syndrome: is there a difference in clinical outcome? [^113QNunz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Children with trisomy 21 are prone to postoperative chylothorax, caused by malformation of the lymphatic system, after cardiac surgery. The clinical course of patients diagnosed with postoperative chylothorax and trisomy 21 was compared to that of patients without dysmorphic syndromes. Additionally, differences between the groups in composition, amount, and duration of chyle were analyzed to better understand chylothorax in patients with trisomy 21.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective cohort study using inpatient clinical databases during a 10-year period.

Results

A total of 2255 patients underwent cardiac operations during the period, of whom 160 (7.1%) patients were diagnosed with trisomy 21. Chylothorax developed in 122 children; 89 patients were included in our study. Of 160 trisomy 21 patients, 27 (16.9%) developed postoperative chylothorax compared to 62 (3%) of 2095 patients without dysmorphic syndromes (p = < 0.001). Time on ventilation, stay in intensive care, hospital stay, mortality, and composition of chylous effusion did not differ between groups. The rate of thrombosis was significantly lower (p = 0.02) in the trisomy 21 group.

Conclusion

Children with trisomy 21 and congenital heart disease are more prone to developing chylothorax after heart surgery than those without dysmorphic syndromes. However if they develop this postoperative complication, mortality, chylous composition, time in ICU, and duration of hospital stay is not different to from that of other infants or children with this complication. This is important information for the medical specialists involved and is helpful in counseling parents of children with trisomy 21 undergoing heart surgery.

### Magnetic resonance lymphangiography [^114w3AD1]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography is a novel technique to image central conducting lymphatics. It is performed by injecting contrast into groin lymph nodes and following passage of contrast through lymphatic system using T1-weighted MR images. Currently, it has been successfully applied to image and plan treatment of thoracic duct pathologies, lymphatic leaks, and other lymphatic abnormalities such as plastic bronchitis. It is useful in the assessment of chylothorax and chyloperitoneum. Its role in other areas such as intestinal lymphangiectasia and a variety of lymphatic anomalies is likely to increase.

Conclusions

Lymphatic abnormalities in the neck and thorax can be seen on T2‐weighted MRI in children with single‐ventricle physiology before their Glenn operation. In individuals with a high lymphatic grading, mortality and chylothorax are more prevalent. Further studies are needed to identify those who are prone to lymphatic abnormalities in CHD as well as how early, perhaps even prenatally, these abnormalities occur.

### Pulmonary manifestations of congenital heart disease in children [^112zTEBz]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

This review addresses how anomalous cardiovascular anatomy imparts consequences to the airway, respiratory system mechanics, pulmonary vascular system, and lymphatic system. Abnormal formation or enlargement of great vessels can compress airways and cause large and small airway obstructions. Alterations in pulmonary blood flow associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) can cause abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics and limitation of exercise. CHD can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Lymphatic abnormalities associated with CHD can cause pulmonary edema, chylothorax, or plastic bronchitis. Understanding how the cardiovascular system has an impact on pulmonary growth and function can help determine options and timing of intervention.

### Lymphatic abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging in single-ventricle congenital heart defects before glenn operation [^116JuAo7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Children born with single‐ventricle physiology benefit tremendously from staged palliations but are at risk of serious long‐term complications. Some complications are related to the lymphatic system. Lymphatic abnormalities and congestion are seen in the neck and thorax on T2‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients following Glenn operation and before Fontan operation, but an understanding of when and how these lymphatic changes occur is sparse.

The lymphatic system consists of a widespread network of lymphatic vessels throughout the body that drain and transport lymphatic fluid from the interstitial space and back into the venous system. The largest lymphatic vessels return the lymphatic fluid to the great veins of the neck and thorax. Besides maintaining fluid homeostasis by returning filtered fluid from the blood circulation and the interstitial space, the lymphatic system is involved in protein transport, lipid transport, and immune response. Increased filtration of interstitial fluid and insufficient drainage or return of lymphatic fluid may lead to lymphatic fluid accumulation.

The circulatory changes during the staged palliations adversely affect the lymphatic system, and more severe lymphatic abnormalities on noncontrast MRI imaging at the Glenn stage, correlate with worse outcomes following the Fontan operation.

In patients with a Glenn operation (superior cavopulmonary connection) the lymphatics and veins of the neck and thorax drain against a higher superior cavopulmonary connection pressure. Increased central venous pressure (CVP) in the Glenn and Fontan circulation is believed to lead to increased lymphatic production, compromised drainage, and potentially also development or opening of new anomalous lymphatic vessels. These changes may in some cases lead to chylothorax, plastic bronchitis, or protein‐losing enteropathy.,

The anomalous lymphatic vessels can be visualized on T2‐weighted MRI and categorized according to their anatomical location in the neck and thorax. Lymphatic changes on T2‐weighted MRI have been demonstrated after Glenn operation as well as following Fontan surgery, but the exact timing of the development of the anomalous lymphatic vessels is unknown, although lymphatic changes have been described as early as in utero in fetuses with cardiac defects. We investigate if lymphatic changes are already present before the Glenn operation to better understand the occurrence of these lymphatic abnormalities in children with single‐ventricle physiology.

### Lymphatic intervention for various types of lymphorrhea: access and treatment [^113cC4Qt]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Traumatic lymphorrhea is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Postoperative lymphorrhea is the leading cause of traumatic lymphorrhea and can arise anywhere within the lymphatic system. Leaks arising from the aortoiliac region to the thoracic duct (TD) and from hepatic lymphatics can be identified with intranodal lymphangiography and transhepatic lymphangiography, respectively. Therefore, an appropriate lymphangiography technique is essential for identifying the sources of leaks. Chylothorax resulting from damage to the TD can be serious because the TD transports large amounts of lymphatic fluid from the gastrointestinal, hepatic, and aortoiliac regions. Percutaneous TD embolization-comprising access to the TD followed by embolization-has recently become a minimally invasive alternative to surgical TD ligation for high-output chylothorax. The selection of access routes to the TD depends on its anatomy. If the TD cannot be approached by such means, other options include TD needle interruption or drainage of lymphatic fluid adjacent to the leakage point followed by sclerotherapy. Most cases of abdominal lymphorrhea arise from the aorta-iliac lymphatic system, and lymphangiography alone or computed tomography-guided sclerotherapy might be useful. Rarely, leakage may arise from hepatic lymphatics due to a damaged gastroduodenal ligament and can be visualized and embolized transhepatically. This article comprehensively reviews clinically relevant anatomic TD variations, lymphangiography techniques and criteria for their selection, and treatment strategies for lymphorrhea. © RSNA, 2016.

### Chylothorax and constrictive pericarditis in a woman due to generalized lymphatic anomaly: a case report [^1172qq35]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chylothorax, the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, can result in significant respiratory morbidity and immunodeficiency. There are several causes of chylothorax, including trauma, tumors, congenital diseases and granulomatous infections, among others. GLA is a rare disease characterized by diffuse or multicentric proliferation of dilated lymphatic vessels resembling common lymphatic malformation. It is also typically responsible for chylothorax. Although GLA is different from Gorham–Stout disease, kaposiform lymphangiomatosis and lymphangiectasis, proper diagnosis is still difficult. Here, we present a case of GLA with chylothorax and constrictive pericarditis in a 29-year-old woman. The purpose of this paper is to describe a patient with rapidly progressing GLA. Clinicians should exclude lymphatic anomalies whenever nonmalignant thoracic disorders are found. Aggressive pericardial surgery should be performed in GLA cases with constrictive pericarditis (CP), and this procedure is important for both diagnosis and treatment.

### Outcomes of conservative management for chylothorax following minimally invasive lung cancer surgery [^112jUjJu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 5 summarizes key studies since the 1990 s on the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of chylothorax following lung cancer surgery. A conservative approach remains the standard first-line treatment, incorporating dietary modifications (low- or no-fat diets) and TPN to reduce lymphatic flow and promote healing. Reported success rates for conservative management range from 70 to 80%, often supported by pleurodesis.

Table 5
Published studies on chylothorax management in lung cancer surgery

Surgical intervention is typically reserved for high-output chylothorax, especially when drainage exceeds 500 mL/day and conservative measures are unlikely to succeed due to nutritional depletion and complications. Approximately 10–20% of patients may require reoperation to ligate the leaking lymphatic vessel or thoracic duct, which, when successful, can markedly reduce pleural output. Patient-specific factors, including high BMI, large BSA, and severe hypoalbuminemia, may prompt earlier surgery even with moderate drainage. Conversely, stable patients with gradually decreasing output (e.g. 500–800 mL/day) may continue conservative treatment.

### Abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow in patients with lymphatic anomalies and respiratory compromise [^111sUQ7K]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary involvement in lymphatic anomalies (LA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography (DCMRL) is capable of imaging the lymphatic system in a variety of pulmonary lymphatic disorders.

Research Question

The objective of this study is to describe the central lymphatic anatomy in patients with LA and pulmonary involvement on DCMRL.

Study Design and Methods

This prospective observational study enrolled 16 patients with LA (mean age, 17 years; range, 6–63 years; ratio of female to male patients, 9:7) with pulmonary involvement. All patients underwent DCMRL. The lymphatic system was assessed for the presence of mediastinal masses, interstitial lung disease, size and tortuosity of the thoracic duct (TD), and presence of abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow.

Results

T2-weighted imaging showed the following: mediastinal soft tissue masses in 10 patients, diffuse pulmonary interstitial thickening in 13 patients, and bone involvement in 15 patients. DCMRL revealed abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow in 14 of 16 patients. Abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow originated from the TD in three of 14 patients, the retroperitoneum in six of 14 patients, and both the TD and retroperitoneum in four of 14 patients. In nine of 16 patients, the TD was dilated and tortuous. In two patients the TD was not identified, and in five patients it was normal.

Interpretation

Abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow/perfusion from the TD or retroperitoneum into the lung parenchyma occurred in the majority of patients in this study. These findings can explain the interstitial lung disease and chylothorax resulting in deterioration of respiratory function in these patients. Future studies will determine whether mechanical cessation of this abnormal flow can improve pulmonary function and prolong survival in patients with LA.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^115yYjT1]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study of the lymphatic system, compared to that of the other body systems, has been historically neglected. While scientists and clinicians have, in recent decades, gained a better appreciation of the functionality of the lymphatics as well as their role in associated diseases (and consequently investigated these topics further in their experimental work), there is still much left to be understood of the lymphatic system. In this review article, we discuss the role lymphatic imaging techniques have played in this recent series of advancements and how new imaging techniques can help bolster this wave of discovery. We specifically highlight the use of lymphatic imaging techniques in understanding the fundamental anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system; investigating the development of lymphatic vasculature (using techniques such as intravital microscopy); diagnosing, staging, and treating lymphedema and cancer; and its role in other disease states.

### Surgical management of central lymphatic conduction disorders: a review [^117P35RU]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Recent advances in lymphatic imaging allow understanding the pathophysiology of lymphatic central conduction disorders with great accuracy. This new imaging data is leading to a wide range of novel surgical interventions. We present here the state-of-the-art imaging technology and current spectrum of surgical procedures available for patients with these conditions.

Method

Descriptive report of the newest lymphatic imaging technology and surgical procedures and retrospective review of outcome data.

Results

There are currently two high-resolution imaging modalities for the central lymphatic system: multi-access dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiogram (DCMRL) and central lymphangiography (CL). DCMRL is done by accessing percutaneously inguinal and mesenteric lymph nodes and periportal lymphatics vessels. DCMRL provides accurate anatomical and dynamic data on the progression, or lack thereof, of the lymphatic fluid throughout the central lymphatic system. CL is done by placing a catheter percutaneously in the thoracic duct (TD). Pleural effusions are managed by pleurectomy and intraoperative lymphatic glue embolization guided by CL. Anomalies of the TD are managed by TD-to-vein anastomosis and/or ligation of aberrant TD branches. Chylous ascites and organ-specific chylous leaks are managed by intraoperative glue embolization, surgical lymphocutaneous fistulas, and ligation of aberrant peripheral lymphatic channels, among several other procedures.

Conclusion

The surgical management of lymphatic conduction disorders is a new growing field within pediatric general surgery. Pediatric surgeons should be familiar with the newest imaging modalities of the lymphatic system and with the surgical options available for patients with these complex surgical conditions to provide prompt treatment or referral.

### Lymphatic disorder management in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease in European pediatric cardiology centers: current status, disparities, and future considerations [^114qHEU5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

For decades, the treatment and management of lymphatic disorders in patients with involvement of a single ventricle have been limited. However, recent advancements in imaging technology have led to the introduction of new therapeutical approaches for these complex conditions. Our study presents the current number of lymphatic disorders and lymphatic interventions performed throughout the 31 European centers included in this study. Despite this progress, the evidence supporting these strategies is often limited to case reports, case series, or expert opinions. While some centers have reported promising short to midterm treatment outcomes for lymphatic interventions, the absence of controlled studies is notable. Furthermore, indications for such lymphatic interventions have likely varied among centers, leaving the ultimate role of lymphatic interventions in the treatment of these patients yet to be conclusively determined.

When considering the reported number of patients with chylothorax per year in this study, it is crucial to recognize that these figures encompass all cases in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease, rather than exclusively those with Fontan circulation. Data from the Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium registry and the Pediatric Health Information System databases indicate that the overall incidence of chylothorax in pediatric patients after congenital heart surgery or heart transplantation ranges from 1.5% to 7.6% and 2% to 3.8%, respectively. Among the 31 centers involved in this study, the incidence of chylothorax varied from 0.5% to 8.5%, with a median incidence of 2.9%. Consequently, the reported numbers are consistent with previously reported data.

As clinicians gain a deeper understanding of the lymphatic system and its complications, it is evident that this patient population is growing, with patients presenting with a diverse variety of lymphatic‐associated complications. The current management of lymphatic disorders involves patient‐tailored medical, interventional, and surgical strategies requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Conducting lymphatic interventions requires specialized medical personnel including 1 or 2 interventional pediatric cardiologists or radiologists, an anesthesiologist/intensivist, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/echocardiogram/ultrasound experts, gastroenterologist or bronchoscopist, surgeon, and specialist nurses. Additionally, specialized equipment, which may include a hybrid catheterization–MRI laboratory or a cardiac catheterization laboratory and MRI scanner physically close to each other, are required. Our study reveals that several centers have started performing lymphatic interventions in Europe. However, there is considerable variability in the treatment options available across the different centers.

About 80% of patients respond to conservative management with a low-fat, high-protein diet or intraperitoneal injection of sclerotherapy such as silver nitrate, povidone iodine or dextrose, about 22% relapse within 2 years. Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe chyluria patients who fail to respond to conservative management or have short-term relapses. Successful surgery requires clear identification and accurate location of the site of chyle leakage, especially the relationship between lymphatic vessels and the renal collection system or vascular system.

Imaging studies in patients with severe chyluria generally include cystoscopy and LPG. LPG is more successful than cystoscopy in detecting bilateral lymphatic renal pelvis fistulas than cystoscopy. The appearance of LPG images in these chyluria patients was wire-like, with semicircular or coralline-shaped shadows that were primarily distributed in the renal pelvis and parenchyma (Fig. 2a). The renal hilus was distorted and dilated, lumbar or iliac lymph vessels could be seen, and obviously dilated truncus lumbalis lymph vessels were occasionally observed. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT or MRI may be useful in the location of lymphatic ducts and chyle leakage sites, but LPG remains the most widely used method. Evaluation of abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphatic abnormalities, including lymphatic leaks, using MRI lymphography with heavily T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences. Nonenhanced MRI lymphangiography is a safe and effective method for imaging the central lymphatic system, and can contribute to differential diagnosis and appropriate preoperative evaluation of chylothorax or lymphangioma. However there been few reports have described its use in chyluria patients.

### Innominate vein turn-down procedure: killing two birds with one stone [^116nvcm1]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

The Need for a Multidisciplinary Approach — Future Development

Although new imaging techniques have shed light on the etiology and pathophysiology of lymphatic complications such as PLE, PB, and chylothorax, many questions remain. More research is needed into understanding the genetic and anatomic susceptibility in patients with single-ventricle physiology and lymphatic failure. In contrast to cardiovascular disease, which has been extensively studied, leading to the development of many interventional and medical therapy options, the lymphatic system is in its infancy, and there are currently no known lymphatic targeted medical treatments.

With the development of new TD-decompression procedures, it is becoming clearer that TD occlusion seems highly inadvisable. However, there is clearly value to perform SLDE of the tributaries documented to be the source of leak, as this will enhance the efficacy of therapeutic decompression, as pressure in a leak basin may be (likely is) lower than that in the atrium — so decompression alone may not stop the leak.

The InV turn-down procedure is designed to target impaired lymphatic drainage in Fontan circulation. Contrary to the fenestrated Fontan circulation, in which the TD is drained into the high-pressure Fontan circulation, turn-down of the InV to the common atrium effectively decompresses the TD to the lower-pressure system with "diastolic suctioning" of lymph. At the same time, the preload of the single ventricle is increased at the expense of the right-to-left shunt, which works as a fenestration, with subsequent acceptable desaturation. This connection offers an entrance for catheterization or electrophysiologic studies. An expected disadvantage is the gradual desaturation owing to the development of venovenous collaterals, which might be controlled by catheter intervention.

InV turn-down may be considered for medical and interventional-refractory post-Fontan lymphatic complications of persistent chylothorax, PB, and protein-losing enteropathy (Figure 5). If TD outlet or InV are occluded and intervention fails to establish patency, one should consider creating a lymphovenous anastomosis to collateral vein (Figure 6) (V. Hraska, personal communication, 2020). Prophylactic InV turn-down may also be considered at time of the Fontan operation for patients with thoracic lymphangiectasia type 3 or 4 pattern at pre-Fontan MRI lymphangiography. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriate indication for this procedure.

### Chylothorax and constrictive pericarditis in a woman due to generalized lymphatic anomaly: a case report [^117FkZTe]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) is characterized by diffuse or multicentric proliferation of dilated lymphatic vessels resembling common lymphatic malformations. Compared with soft tissue or bone involvement, thoracic involvement may be associated with a worse prognosis.

Case presentation

We reported a case of GLA with chylothorax and constrictive pericarditis in a 29-year-old woman. This patient exhibited remarkable features, including a continuously hemorrhagic chylothorax, constrictive pericarditis, and involvement of bone and neck lymph nodes. After attempting to manage her condition with conservative treatment, the patient underwent pericardial stripping surgery. Exploration revealed abundant hyperplasia of tubular tissue in the aortopulmonary window in both pleural cavities.

Conclusions

This case highlights the importance of maintaining the clinical suspicion of GLA during the follow-up of chylothorax patients. Aggressive pericardial surgery, which is important for both diagnosis and treatment, should be performed in patients with GLA with constrictive pericarditis.

### Chyloperitoneum… [^114x3Ufx]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Few clinicians have the opportunity in a lifetime of practice to observe a case of massive chyloperitoneal effusion. This is evidenced by the multiplicity of single case reports, with few exceptions. 2, 12, 41–43 Chylous ascites is a manifestation and not a disease entity; it represents an "obstructive phenomenon". Although the etiology is unknown, there is usually some distinct pathologic condition appearing simultaneously in the patient to account for the effusion. An abnormal accumulation of chyle occurs in the pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal cavities and is seldom diagnosed preoperatively in the last two sites. The purpose of this paper is to review some of the data pertaining to the lymphatic system and to report three cases of chylous ascites recently encountered. Since Aselli discovered the lymphatic system in 1622, considerable information has been brought forth relative to the properties and function of lymph. Bartholin, in 1651, described the first case of chylothorax.

### Persistent low-output neonatal chylothorax: how long are we justified to wait for pleurodesis in partial responders? [^112zku9b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Neonatal chylothorax represents a pleomorphic, multifactorial, sometimes life‐threatening condition. The lymphatic leakage in the pleural cavity may cause respiratory distress, hypovolemia, hypoproteinemia, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic acidosis, lymphocyte depletion, hypogammaglobulinemia, immunodeficiency, and coagulation disorders. The diagnosis is confirmed with pleural fluid analysis.

First‐line management is based on Medium‐Chain Fatty acids (MCT), skimmed human milk diet, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with or without octreotide administration. In the case of medium‐large pleural effusion associated with respiratory symptoms, further procedures such as needle line management, on the basis of lymphatic output, patients can be categorized into three categories: good responders < 2 ml/kg/day, partial responders 2–10 ml/kg/day, and non‐responders > 10 ml/kg/day or > 100 ml/day for at least 5 days in the presence of complications. In our experience, if the management of good and non‐responders is standardized, consisting of the continuation of conservative therapy in the former and treatment in the latter (chemical pleurodesis, thoracic duct ligation, pleuroperitoneal shunt placement, and pleurectomy), the management of partial responders remains challenging. For this group of patients, the literature suggests 3–4 weeks of conservative treatment before considering an invasive approach. However, the persistent lymphatic leak, the prolonged fasting, and the presence of a central venous line and TPN may expose these patients to potential life‐threatening complications, in particular sepsis. At our institution, we have consistently observed that partial responders face a more challenging path than non‐responders, and we have successfully treated them early with bedside chemical pleurodesis using iodopovidone, leading to positive outcomes. Over a decade ago, we implemented iodopovidone for chemical pleurodesis, with favorable results, as documented by other institutions worldwide.

Our hypothesis was that this difference between partial responders and non‐responders may be attributed to the different delay and type of approaches after failure of conservative first‐line treatment (3‐4 weeks of bowel rest and TPN, vs. bedside chemical pleurodesis with iodopovidone). However, to this day, this aspect has never been studied in detail.

The aim of our study was to review our experience regarding the management of neonatal chylothorax, with particular focus on outcomes of partial responders.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^114XRY5v]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The pertinent anatomy involved in the development of a chylothorax begins with the cysterna chyli, which is a confluence of lymphatics located in the retroperitoneum, just to the right of the posteromedial aorta at the level of the renal arteries. The thoracic duct ascends from this level and enters the chest through the aortic hiatus into the right hemithorax. The duct crosses over to the left chest at the fourth and fifth thoracic levels and enters the neck anterior to the left subclavian artery to join the venous system at the junction of the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Knowledge of this anatomy should alert the physician to the possibility of a thoracic duct injury with thoracic spine fractures or any associated upper abdomen or chest injury involving this trajectory.

As in this case, the diagnosis of a chyle leak was supported by a pleural fluid triglyceride level greater than 110 mg/dL. A pleural fluid triglyceride concentration less than 50 mg/dL excludes a chylothorax. An intermediate level between 50 and 110 mg/dL should be followed by lipoprotein analysis to inspect the pleural fluid for chylomicrons or cholesterol crystals. The presence of chylomicrons and the absence of cholesterol crystals confirm a chyle leak. In addition, a ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to triglyceride of less than 1 is also diagnostic.

### Minimally invasive percutaneous lymphangiography and embolisation for spontaneous chyle leaks in patients with lymphoma [^115TJzWf]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present, this targeted approach not only supported the continuation of appropriate anti‐lymphoma therapy but also reduced the need for repeated invasive interventions, such as thoracentesis or paracentesis, thereby improving patients' quality of life, as previously shown.

We acknowledge several limitations of our study, including its retrospective nature with a small sample size and absence of a control group receiving conservative management only. As a tertiary cancer centre, our data reflect only patients referred for interventional management after failure of conservative therapy. We therefore cannot capture the broader denominator of all patients with chylous effusions, including those successfully managed without intervention.

In conclusion, the combination of these novel minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic techniques may revolutionise the management of chylous ascites, chylothorax and lymphatic anomalies, offering new possibilities for treating lymphatic disorders. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

### Understanding lymphatic anatomy and abnormalities at imaging [^116TBMw4]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic abnormalities encompass a wide range of disorders spanning solitary common cystic lymphatic malformations (LMs) to entities involving multiple organ systems such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Many of these disorders are rare, yet some, such as secondary lymphedema from the treatment of malignancy (radiation therapy and/or lymph node dissection), affect millions of patients worldwide. Owing to complex and variable anatomy, the lymphatics are not as well understood as other organ systems. Further complicating this is the variability in the description of lymphatic disease processes and their nomenclature in the medical literature. In recent years, medical imaging has begun to facilitate a deeper understanding of the physiology and pathologic processes that involve the lymphatic system. Radiology is playing an important and growing role in the diagnosis and treatment of many lymphatic conditions. The authors describe both normal and common variant lymphatic anatomy. Various imaging modalities including nuclear medicine lymphoscintigraphy, conventional lymphangiography, and MR lymphangiography used in the diagnosis and treatment of lymphatic disorders are highlighted. The authors discuss imaging many of the common and uncommon lymphatic disorders, including primary LMs described by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies 2018 classification system (microcystic, mixed, and macrocystic LMs; primary lymphedema). Secondary central lymphatic disorders are also detailed, including secondary lymphedema and chylous leaks, as well as lymphatic disorders not otherwise easily classified. The authors aim to provide the reader with an overview of the anatomy, pathology, imaging findings, and treatment of a wide variety of lymphatic conditions. © RSNA, 2022.

### Outcomes of conservative management for chylothorax following minimally invasive lung cancer surgery [^1135QzPo]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The surgical treatment paradigm for lung cancer has undergone a rapid shift toward minimally invasive surgery (MIS), including multiport video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (MVATS), single-portal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (SVATS), and robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS), which reduce incision size, expedite postoperative recovery, lower complication rates, and improve patient satisfaction. Prospective studies have established that MIS provides oncological outcomes comparable to open thoracotomy, reinforcing its role as the mainstay of lung cancer care.

Despite the advantages of MIS, it does not eliminate the possibility of complications. An uncommon but clinically significant issue is chylothorax, which arises when the thoracic duct or major lymphatic vessels are injured and causes lymphatic fluid to accumulate in the pleural space. If left unmanaged, the loss of protein, fat, and electrolytes can lead to delayed wound healing, malnutrition, and cardiovascular or neurological compromise. Chylothorax is traditionally managed via conservative measures, such as dietary modification, pleurodesis, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), or more invasive surgical reintervention.

Many centers have favored a nonsurgical approach for chylothorax following MIS, which frequently achieves high treatment success rates; however, strict adherence to conservative therapy may prolong hospital stay, exacerbate nutritional deficiencies, and delay recovery in certain cases, prompting the consideration of more proactive surgical re-exploration or other interventions.

The present study aimed to identify the risk factors for chylothorax, define its clinical course after MIS, evaluate the efficacy and limitations of a predominantly conservative treatment algorithm, and investigate the perioperative changes in nutritional status of patients. By doing so, we sought to determine whether conservative management alone was sufficient for all patients, or whether early surgical intervention might benefit select patients. Ultimately, we aimed to develop more refined evidence-based guidelines for chylothorax management in the MIS setting, thereby improving overall patient outcomes.

### Lymphatic disorder management in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease in European pediatric cardiology centers: current status, disparities, and future considerations [^112HWLU6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Current Diagnostic and Treatment Recommendations for Lymphatic Disorders

Current diagnostic and treatment recommendations for lymphatic disorders were initially outlined by Dori et al 41 from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2022 with the latest updated recommendations published in a recent review article by Bauer et al in 2023. Noncontrast MRL, using heavily weighted T2 sequences to image slow‐moving nonbloody fluids such as lymphatic fluid, has demonstrated a strong correlation between high‐grade thoracic lymphatic abnormalities and poor Fontan outcomes (Figure 5). It is a fast and noninvasive diagnostic tool suitable for inclusion during routine cardiac MRI and has previously been suggested as a screening tool for all thoracic lymphatic abnormalities in patients with single‐ventricle involvement before Fontan completion. Currently, our study shows that only 4 of the 31 included centers perform MRL screening in all patients before the Fontan procedure. Additionally, it is recommended that all patients with suspected lymphatic abnormalities undergo cardiac catheterization to exclude systemic obstruction and assess hemodynamics. If symptoms persist despite optimized medical treatment and percutaneous procedures addressing potential obstructions, DCMRL is recommended as the gold standard method to evaluate the lymphatic system and its flow characteristics (Figure 6). This minimally invasive testing technique involves dynamic and static contrast‐enhanced MRI following ultrasound‐guided and radiographically guided contrast injections at different access points: intranodal DCMRL for central lymphatics, intrahepatic DCMRL for hepatosystemic lymphatics, and intramesenteric DCMRL for peritoneal/mesenteric lymphatics. Since contrast is visible only in parts of the lymphatic system within the contrast pathway, different access points are used depending on the clinical presentation. This diagnostic examination can be followed by appropriate lymphatic intervention while the patient is still under general anesthesia. Lymphatic intervention can be categorized into those aimed at occluding abnormal lymphatic ducts (using glue, coils, or a combination) and those intended to decompress the entire lymphatic system (surgical or catheter‐based Hraska interventions). Based on case series and case report studies, algorithms have been proposed for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with chylothorax, PLE, PB, and multicompartment disorders, defined as lymphatic perfusion abnormalities involving at least 2 compartments, including the thorax, abdomen, and soft tissue. A more detailed description and flowcharts can be found elsewhere.

### Unilateral pedal lymphangiography with non-contrast computerized tomography is valuable in the location and treatment decision of idiopathic chylothorax [^117KnGgE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Idiopathic chylothorax is a rare condition with unclear cause. It can develop as a result of ruptured of dilated thoracic duct, with or without proximal occlusion, or as a result of rupture of diaphragmatic or intercostal lymphatic collaterals, or as a result of pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis. Patients who failed to thoracic duct ligation tended to be obscure and difficult cases, requiring accurate identification and location of the chylous leakage.

Lymphoscintigraphy is performed by injecting technitium-99 m labeled Sb2-S3 colloid or labeled human albumin into the interdigital space of the foot or hand. By employing semiquantitative transport index, a 92% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity can be achieved in diagnosing lymphedema. Since lymphoscintigraphy is a functional study, we performed LAG with non-contrast CT to define lymphatic anatomy and the site of lymphatic leak.

Recently, the feasibility of MR lymphography has been established by performing multistation imaging of the lower extremities with three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo sequences after a cutaneous injection of gadodiamide. It has proved to be a safe, noninvasive, high-resolution technique for depicting lymphatic abnormalities without using ionizing radiation. Evaluation of abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphatic abnormalities, including lymphatic leaks, has also been described through MR lymphography through heavily T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences. Despite these advances, conventional LAG remains the gold standard in the evaluation of chyle leaks due to its ability to opacify the lymphatic channels and highlight the presence of lymphatic fistulae or leakage.

Although bipedal LAG is recommended to demonstrate the anatomy of the thoracic duct and to indicate the cause of the chylothorax, the diagnostic capabilities of unilateral pedal LAG has also been demonstrated. Fistulas can often be identified by way of crossover channels that divert lymphatic flow from the contralateral lymphatics toward the fistula. Koga et al. reported lymphatic vessels crossing from the injected to the uninjected side occurred in all 106 patients with chyluria. The direction of flow in the lymphatic channels, being a closed circulation system with a positive pressure, will converge to the point where the integrity of the channels has been breached. So unilateral LAG can detect chyle leakage even when it is on the side opposite that where contrast is injected. The advantages of unilateral over bilateral LAG are that it is easy to identify crossover channels, and there is less discomfort for the patient because of fewer incisions and quicker procedure.

### Retrograde thoracic duct embolization in an idiopathic case of chylopericardium [^1162Mmdg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Chylopericardium is a rare pathological condition, and idiopathic thoracic duct leakage causing reflux into the pericardial cavity is even rarer. Only 10% of chylothorax cases are idiopathic. In our case, the patient had a history of COVID-19 prior to presentation, although it is unclear whether this contributed to his case of chylopericardium. There has been one report of a case of idiopathic chylopericardium in a patient postulated to be in a prothrombotic state due to COVID-19, leading to venous congestion and lymphatic pressure buildup. These uncommonly observed conditions can be difficult to diagnose and treat but can be potentially life-threatening due to severe malnutrition and disruption of the immune system. This case is an accurate account of a series of investigations that helped diagnose and formulate a treatment plan. Compared with novel minimally invasive lymphatic interventions, traditional open thoracic duct ligation after failed dietary therapy and pleurodesis is invasive and may be a less attractive option. Thoracic duct embolization is associated with a lower risk of morbidity and better clinical success than both conservative and surgical management in traumatic and nontraumatic cases of chylothorax. Moreover, thoracic duct embolization may be the preferred option for patients with a complex thoracic duct anatomy, such as the plexiform type.

### Chylothorax and constrictive pericarditis in a woman due to generalized lymphatic anomaly: a case report [^113v4nxm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

The clinical course and intraoperative findings of this case are consistent with a diagnosis of GLA. The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) approved new guidelines for the classification of lymphatic disorders at the 20th ISSVA Workshop in Melbourne, Australia in 2014. Disorders of the pulmonary lymphatic system include macrocystic, microcystic, and mixed lymphatic malformations, GLA (formerly known as diffuse lymphangiomatosis), channel-type lymphatic malformations, lymphatic malformations in Gorham-Stout disease (GSD), and primary lymphedema. GLA may affect superficial soft tissues, the skin, bone, and abdominal and thoracic viscera. Lymphangiomas usually occur at the age of 2, but they may not be discovered until adulthood. Due to their scarcity, these latter situations are often misdiagnosed and their management is also difficult.

Although lymphangioma is a benign neoplasm, it rarely undergoes spontaneous remission and often progresses to cause serious morbidity and even death. Because of its slow growth, it is believed that the performance of thoracic lymphangiomas occurs after the incubation period. Thoracic lymphangiomas are still asymptomatic for many years and become apparent only when the patient has problems due to compression of vital structures. Thoracic lymphangiomas can cause pleural/pericardial effusions, compressive symptoms, or dyspnea.

In this report, GLA affected the neck, thorax, pericardium, and bone. Chylothorax and pericarditis were the chief symptoms. Our patient was an adult woman who had no symptoms in the first 28 years of her life. This particular case is interesting in many ways. Rapid progression of the disease, as observed in this patient, has never been reported previously. The patient showed uncontrollable hypoproteinemia. The cardiac surgery was performed to treat CP and persistent chylothorax. Histopathological analysis of the thoracoscopic biopsy specimens in this case could not distinguish the disease from other lymphatic disorders. Therefore, a PET-CT scan and multidisciplinary consultation were necessary for this patient with multiorgan involvement. Lymphangioscintigraphy helps evaluate lymphatic truncal anatomy. The lymphangioscintigraphy and PET-CT results in this patient allowed us to exclude the presence of lymphatic obstruction and tumors. We strongly recommend lymphangioscintigraphy in cases of unexplained chlothorax, since it is a non-invasive means of identifying a lymphatic leak and the eventual presence of anatomic aberrations.

### Respiratory failure in noonan syndrome treated by microsurgical thoracic duct-venous anastomosis [^112SRYje]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Noonan syndrome is a disorder characterized by central and peripheral lymphatic conducting anomalies, leading to chylothorax, chylous ascites, and metabolic derangement. Novel imaging methods, including dynamic contrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography and intranodal lymphangiography, have allowed for increased visualization of lymphatic pathology. Severe pulmonary insufficiency and chylothoraces developed in a 61-year-old man with Noonan syndrome. Dynamic contrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography and intranodal lymphangiography demonstrated central thoracic duct (TD) occlusion. The patient's condition significantly improved after a microsurgical TD-venous anastomosis assisted by TD catheterization for imaging guidance, resulting in decompression of the lymphatic system and resolution of the pulmonary symptoms.

### Term infant formula macronutrient composition: an update for clinicians [^1158vVkq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Clinical indications for high MCT formula

Conditions leading to fat malabsorption are associated with high risk of malnutrition and growth failure. High MCT formula is defined as 30% or more by weight and may be indicated in certain clinical settings (Table 1). Cholestasis is one of the most common indications for higher MCT formula as cholestasis leads to decreased secretion of bile salts and in return malabsorption of fat, in particular LCTs which require bile salts for emulsification, lipolysis, and absorption through the lymphatic system. MCTs are partially water soluble and are passively absorbed and metabolized through the portal system without the need for extensive emulsification or chylomicron formation. No consensus exists on the optimal percentage of MCT recommended in the diet of cholestatic infants. A range of 30%–75% MCT is supported by clinical studies and associated with improved fat absorption, though the effect on growth and clinical outcomes remains unclear. MCT as > 80% of triglycerides is not advised due to concern for essential fatty acid deficiency.

MCT also improves fat absorption in patients who have undergone resection of their small intestine leading to short bowel syndrome, particularly when the colon remains intact. A preserved colon allows improved absorption of medium‐chain fatty acids and short‐chain fatty acids, which are water‐soluble in contrast to lipophilic long‐chain fatty acids, which can only be absorbed in the small intestine.

High MCT formulas play a therapeutic role in chylous effusions as they are directly absorbed into the portal circulation and not through the lymphatic system. Chylous effusions may be congenital or iatrogenic, such as postoperative chylothorax. Postoperative chylothorax may be due to traumatic injury to lymphatic vessels during thoracic or abdominal surgery, but may also be seen in systemic venous obstruction, dysfunction of the right ventricle, and lymphangiectasia. Formulas with higher MCT content have a similar effect to skimmed human milk on the resolution of chylous effusion and associated hospital measures, including mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and recurrence. High MCT formulas are low in LCTs and when used patients should be monitored for signs of essential fatty acid and fat‐soluble vitamin deficiencies.

### Lymphangiography in the diagnosis and localization of various chyle leaks [^116c8GY2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chyle leaks are rare entities infrequently encountered by most physicians. However, large centers providing advanced surgical care are inevitably confronted with chyle leaks as a complication of surgery, an extension of disease, or as a primary disorder. Regardless of the etiology, proper diagnosis and localization are paramount in the management of any chyle leak.

Materials and Methods

Here we present 16 patients with 17 chyle leaks (5 chyluria, 8 chylothorax, and 4 chylous ascites) who underwent bipedal lymphangiography (LAG) and postprocedure computed tomography (CT) imaging.

Results

In each case, the source of the chyle leak was identified and properly localized to guide further treatment. Of the 16 patients who underwent LAG and postprocedure CT imaging, the initial LAG alone provided the diagnosis and localized the chyle leak in 4 patients (25%); the postprocedure CT imaging provided the diagnosis and localized the chyle leak in 6 patients (37.5%); and the two modalities were equal in the diagnosing and localizing the chyle leak in the remaining 6 patients (37.5%)

Conclusion

These cases highlight the unparalleled abilities of LAG and the added benefit of post-LAG CT imaging in the diagnosis and fine anatomic localization of chyle leaks. In addition, these cases demonstrate the retained utility of LAG in these investigations despite the development of alternative tests involving CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine imaging.

### Unilateral pedal lymphangiography with non-contrast computerized tomography is valuable in the location and treatment decision of idiopathic chylothorax [^117P8Z6p]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chylous pleural effusion, or chylothorax, is defined as the accumulation of chyle-containing lymphatic fluid within the pleural space. It has various causes and is usually attributable to 1 of the 4 categories: malignancies, trauma (including surgery), miscellaneous disorders and idiopathic. Idiopathic chylothorax is rare, which may occupy 6.4% of all chylothorax patients, and includes most cases of congenital variety as well as other cases with no clear cause.

Despite of its rarity, extensive chyle leakage from idiopathic chylothorax can also have deleterious physiologic consequences in the form of hypovolemia and hypoproteinemia resulting from severe fluid and protein loss. Historically, fluid sampling, surgical exploration, and various imaging modalities, including lymphangiography (LAG), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear imaging have all contributed to the diagnosis and localization of chylothorax. However, LAG combined with post-LAG CT imaging is superior in depicting and precisely localizing chylous abnormalities, while LAG has also been shown to be therapeutic in some instances. Although bipedal LAG is recommended to demonstrate the anatomy of the thoracic duct and to indicate the cause of chylothorax, the diagnostic capabilities of unilateral pedal or monopedal LAG has also been demonstrated in the literature.

If conservative treatment of chylothorax is unsuccessful, or in the event of high flow chylothorax surgical ligature of the thoracic duct must be undertaken. The purpose of our study was to analyze the results of unilateral LAG with post-LAG non-contrast CT scan in idiopathic chylothorax patients after failure of right supra-diaphragmatic thoracic duct ligation, aiming to identify its value in proper location and treatment guidance of these refractory cases.

### Lymphatic system… [^112BDwmh]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic System The major components of the lymphatic system are lymphatic vessels, lymph, lymph nodes, and some other lymphatic organs. Lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a colorless liquid, throughout the body. Along lymph vessels are small bean-shaped glandular nodules called lymph nodes. Other lymphatic organs are:…
- **Tonsil**: clusters of lymphatic tissues just under the mucous membranes that line the nose, mouth, and pharynx.
- **Spleen**: it is similar to a lymph node in shape and structure but it is much larger.
- **Thymus**: a soft organ with two lobes that is located anterior to the ascending aorta and posterior to the sternum.
- **Peyer patch**: lymphoid tissue on the visceral surface of the small intestine.

### Cough-induced chylothorax in a two-year-old boy-case report and review of the literature [^113y1gKC]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Besides pleural drainage for acute respiratory rescue, long-chain fatty acid-free MCT oral diet, total parenteral nutrition, and the use of somatostatin or its analogue octreotide are common therapeutic approaches. As most reports are based on cases of post-operative chylothorax in children undergoing heart surgery, evidence on the effectiveness of treatment strategies in spontaneous or traumatic chylothorax is still lacking. It seems reasonable to begin therapy with a non-invasive fat-free oral diet and supplementation of medium chain triglycerides in clinically stable patients. Medium-chain triglycerides (saturated fatty acids of eight to twelve carbon chain lengths) are absorbed directly into the portal venous system and bypass the lymphatic drainage, thereby not further enhancing the lymphatic flow. In our patient, we used octreotide early in the treatment algorithm after diet alterations alone did not lower the fluid output (Fig. 2 A). In doing so it is important to note that we abstained from beginning a total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which is typically considered the next therapeutic step. The implementation of TPN for toddlers, potentially for periods of several weeks, is particularly arduous and often not feasible in the long term. To the best of our knowledge, this case report is the first to describe foregoing this therapeutic option, in an attempt to avoid potentially stressful effects on young children with spontaneous chylothorax.

Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue which, in comparison to somatostatin, has a longer half-life in circulation and the beneficial option of subcutaneous administration. Both somatostatin and octreotide are routinely used in combination with chest tube drainage and enteric rest in postoperative adult patients with chyle leaks. This has been shown to decrease the need for surgical intervention. In most reports, the benefit of octreotide treatment was seen within 2–3 days. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it is known that octreotide reduces intestinal blood flow due to vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, thus reducing gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions. Furthermore, fat absorption from the intestine is also reduced. It has also been shown that somatostatin receptors SSTR2 and SSTR5 are expressed in the human thoracic duct and that their stimulation may decrease lymphatic flow as well as lymph production. As published recently in a case series, orally administered propranolol, commonly used to treat infantile hemangiomas, seems to be an alternative treatment for chylothorax in children. Benefits of a therapy with propranolol include its easy administration, broad experience, and easy accessibility.

### Chyloptysis with chylopericardium, a rare case and mini-review [^116yLnQt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chyloptysis is caused by chylous reflux from the thoracic duct into the lung; it can be caused by high peribronchial lymphatic pressure if the thoracic duct is obstructed above the midmediastinal level or may be due to incompetence of the lymphatic valves. Obstruction of the thoracic duct can cause retrograde flow from the thoracic duct into the bronchomediastinal trunks and the peribronchial lymphatic plexus. When the peribronchial lymphatics are subjected to a circulatory overload of chyle plus lymph fluid from the lungs, the overloaded peribronchial and pulmonary lymphatic tubes become dilated and engorged. Mediastinal tumors, particularly lymphomas, are the main cause of mechanical obstructions of the thoracic duct. The main causes of chyloptysis is listed in Table 1. Chyloptysis is typically seen with lymphangiomatosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis(LAM), thoracic lymphangiectasis, yellow-nail syndrome, Behçet's disease, and iatrogenic injury (Table 1). Incompetence of the lymph valves is often congenital (lymphatic dysplasia) and can lead to chylous pleural effusion, chylous ascites, chyluria, and lymphedema of the lower extremities. In the present case, chyloptysis was due to rupture of the primary dilated lymphatic vessels, and subsequent reflux of thoracic lymphatics into the tracheobronchial tree caused by the compression of neighboring tissue. We found chylothorax after surgery but not before. We think that there was no bronchopleural fistula in the context of concurrent chylous pleural effusion before surgery. Compared with directly mechanical obstruction, chyloptysis in LAM can occur due to the generation of abnormal communication between lymphatic channels and the bronchial tree since LAM cells proliferate along the bronchial trees and gradually destroy the airway.

### Non-contrast 3D MR lymphography of retroperitoneal lymphatic aneurysmal dilatation: a continuous spectrum of change from normal variants to cystic lymphangioma [^114WfJZ4]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The retroperitoneal lymphatic system is markedly complex and characterised by numerous anatomical variants.

For a long time X-ray lymphography performed by injecting a radio-opaque material into a lymphatic vessel, surgically exposed and cannulated, has been the single method to explore the lymphatic system. Presently, X-ray lymphography, which is an invasive procedure, is uncommonly performed in particular selected indications, such as preoperative evaluation before surgery for chylothorax

Non-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) lymphography with very heavily T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences appears to be a useful non-invasive technique without the need of contrast medium injection to obtain a unique evaluation of the lymphatic system.

In this pictorial review, we analyse the characteristic features of retroperitoneal lymphatic aneurysmal dilatation with three-dimensional (3D) MR lymphography.

### Chylopericardium following esophagectomy: a case report and systematic review [^1148mji3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chylopericardium is a rare disorder that can occur either as a primary (idiopathic) condition or, more commonly, as a secondary condition resulting from injury to the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct serves as a conduit for transporting chyle from the intestinal tract and closely passes by the pericardium as it travels from the cisterna chyli to the jugular and subclavian veins. Any disease capable of compressing, obstructing, or rupturing the thoracic duct and its branches can be the underlying cause of chylopericardium. The most common secondary causes include trauma, cardiac surgery, and congenital lymphangiomatosis. However, chylopericardium following esophagectomy is an exceedingly rare occurrence, with only a few cases having been previously reported.

The pathogenesis of post-surgical chylopericardium is not entirely clear. The prevailing theory suggests that the primary mechanism involves a direct injury to the thoracic duct and mediastinal lymphatic vessels. This injury can result in the establishment of a communication between the lymphatic system and the pericardium, leading to the leakage of chyle into the pericardial cavity. Additionally, if there is an obstruction or disruption of the thoracic lymphatic ducts, this can lead to a significant increase in intraductal pressure, causing a reflux of lymphatic fluid back into the pericardial space. In situations where chylopericardium is a consequence of direct injury, it may precipitate a specific point source leakage of chyle. On the other hand, if the condition ensues from obstructions that foster increased pressure, it may exhibit as diffuse leakage of chyle. In the instance of our patient who presented with sudden onset of postoperative chylopericardium, the condition was hypothesized to be associated with a localized surgical trauma. Lymphangiography can offer valuable insights into determining the cause, but regrettably, it is not a diagnostic procedure that our institution can provide. Furthermore, during the second surgery, the pericardium was not specifically examined in order to avoid further injury and that a further exploration would not change the management. Therefore, we are unable to ascertain the exact etiology of chylopericardium in this case.

### Decompression of the thoracic duct: a novel transcatheter approach [^115sfQoW]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with total cavopulmonary connections, elevated central venous pressures (CVP) have detrimental effects on the lymphatic system causing an imbalance in fluid production and drainage of the interstitium. This combination may result in life-threatening lymphatic complications including plastic bronchitis (PB), protein losing enteropathy (PLE), chylothorax, and ascites. While embolization of the abnormal lymphatics has greatly improved outcomes from these complications, alternative treatment strategies have been proposed that would result in improved lymphatic drainage while leaving the lymphatic system intact. We report two novel transcatheter approaches for thoracic duct (TD) decompression in two patients who developed PLE after completion of the Fontan procedure as part of staged palliation for congenital heart disease. In addition, one patient had severe concurrent PB. In both patients, a connection was created between a left superior vena cava (LSVC) to the left atrium allowing for a nonsurgical method to decompress the TD. This procedure resulted in significant clinical and laboratory improvement of both patients' PLE and other symptoms of lymphatic dysfunction.

### Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography and percutaneous lymphatic embolization for the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent chyloptysis [^111QJK8X]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chyloptysis, or the expectoration of triglyceride-rich sputum, is rare and typically treated with diet modification and thoracic duct ligation. This article describes 2 patients with prolonged histories of chyloptysis who failed conservative treatment and thoracic duct ligation. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging delineated the lymphatic anatomy and identified the abnormal pulmonary lymphatic perfusion pathways in both patients. This imaging provided guidance for successful percutaneous lymphatic embolization which resulted in resolution of symptoms in both patients.

### Recurrent chylothorax: a clinical mystery [^1128Foid]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

WM as a cause of chylothorax has previously been only described in seven cases in literature. In the only other case in English literature by Poisson et al, the patient was an 82-year-old man with a known diagnosis of WM and had moderate infiltration of bone marrow with lymphoma. Similar to our case, he presented with dyspnoea and large pleural effusion. CT imaging revealed lymphadenopathy in the left posterior costomediastinal angle associated with a predominantly left-sided effusion. He was treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone with resolution of the chylothorax.

The predominant mechanism in malignancy-induced chylothorax is thoracic duct obstruction. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy compresses the lymphatic vessels and prevents drainage of lymph from the lung periphery resulting in extravasation of chyle into the pleural space. However, other mechanisms might be involved. In the aforementioned case, the authors concluded that rather than obstruction of thoracic duct, direct pleural invasion of lymphoplasmacytic cells in pleura causing dilatation and proliferation of the lymph vessels might have played a role, as protein electrophoresis of chylous fluid showed the presence of pleural protein.

In our case, we believe that obstruction of the thoracic duct was the main mechanism of pleural effusion. CT revealed significant lymphadenopathy near the confluence of the thoracic duct and left subclavian left internal jugular vein. However, effusion was mostly right sided as opposed to expected left-sided effusion from presumed damage above T5; therefore, other mechanisms might have played a role.

A unique aspect of our case is that treatment with ibrutinib led to complete resolution of the effusion and symptoms. Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of WM. A phase II trial of ibrutinib in 63 patients with symptomatic WM reported an overall response rate of 91% (10 very good partial response, 36 partial response, 11 minor response, none complete). Such immunotherapy agents may allow treatment of WM-related — and perhaps other malignancy-related — chylothorax without necessitating surgical intervention.

### Novel subdiaphragmatic ligation of left thoracic duct for refractory postoperative left chylothorax [^111VrgBQ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

A postoperative chylothorax is an uncommon but problematic surgical complication in 0.5% to 4.0% of surgical cases that nevertheless still plagues every busy thoracic surgeon. Fortunately, most chylothoraces are low volume and are readily controlled by conservative measures. A high-volume chylothorax (> 1 L/24 h) fortunately occurs in less than one-third of patients, usually responding to the published treatment algorithms and generally requiring invasive techniques. We report a case of a postlobectomy high-volume, left-sided chylothorax refractory to all the usual recommended interventions that ultimately was successfully treated by novel computed tomography lymphangiography-guided transabdominal surgical ligation of the aberrant left-sided lymphatics with complete, prompt chylothorax control.

### Chylothorax and constrictive pericarditis in a woman due to generalized lymphatic anomaly: a case report [^115jb5UH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In our patient, proper diagnosis was difficult because of the overlapping findings and because it was easy to misdiagnose the previous pathological results. The differential diagnosis included lymphangioleiomyomatosis(LAM), lymphangiectasis and GLA. LAM was ruled out based on the negative staining with HMB45 and melan-A. Open- thorax surgery showed evidence of the characteristic proliferation and dilation of the lymphatic vessels. Intraoperatively, macroscopic findings and histologic examination of biopsy specimens confirmed the diagnosis of lymphangioma rather than lymphatic dilatation.

GLA is usually typically on the basis of clinical signs, imaging examinations, and histological findings. Open-lung biopsy may be considered the gold standard diagnostic test for GLA. The aim of medical management for chylothorax is to relieve respiratory symptoms by drainage of the pleural effusion, the treatment of underlying causes, and the prevention of, or treatment for malnutrition and immunodeficiency. The treatment of problems associated with chylothorax involves chest-drainage, a medium –chain triglycerides diets, and administration of octreotide andsomatostatin. This patient did not show any improvement after conservative treatment. Finally, pericardial stripping surgery was performed, and hyperplastic lymphatic tissue found in the mediastinum and pleural cavity was resected. After surgery, the patient gradually improved.

In summary, we report a case of GLA with chylothorax and constrictive pericarditis in a 29-year-old woman. This patient exhibited remarkable features, including a continuously hemorrhagic chylothorax, constrictive pericarditis, and involvement of bone and neck lymph nodes. After attempting to manage her condition with conservative treatment, the patient underwent pericardial stripping surgery. Therefore, an open- lung biopsy and surgical intervention are necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

### Unilateral pedal lymphangiography with non-contrast computerized tomography is valuable in the location and treatment decision of idiopathic chylothorax [^111aEQLL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

From year 2000 to 2011, twenty-four patients aged 9–84 year old (median 44 yr) who had idiopathic chylothorax were involved in this series, including 10 males and 14 females. All patients failed to their previous right supra-diaphragmatic thoracic duct ligations. Main clinical manifestations were dyspnea, shortness of breath or unavailable of prostration. The presence of chylothorax was defined by 1 or more of the following inclusion criteria: (1) a pleural fluid triglyceride level of 110 mg/dL or greater; (2) the presence of chylomicrons in the pleural effusion. Other causes of chylothrax, such as malignancies, trauma, tuberculosis or filariasis, were excluded. After their previous thoracic duct ligations, 20 patients had unilateral (9 in left and 11 in right side) and 4 patients had bilateral chylothorax with duration of 3 days to one year. Conventional unenhanced MRI was done for each patient but only located suspected leak sites of thoracic duct in 4 patients. Thus, patients were screened for contraindications to LAG, including cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (i.e. right-to-left shunts, pulmonary insufficiency, etc.). Risks, benefits, and alternative procedures were discussed with each patient or custodian, and written informed consent was obtained in accordance with institutional ethical policy before performing LAG. This study was approved by the ethics committee of all authors' hospitals, and informed consent was obtained from all patients at the time of enrolment.

### Milky pleural effusion in a neonate and approach to investigating chylothorax [^113cgQau]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Given the similarities in the macroscopic appearance, pseudo-chylothorax, empyema and extravasated parenteral lipids administered via a central line are the other primary differential diagnoses in patients presenting with 'milky' pleural effusions. The onset of chylothorax is usually acute or subacute, whereas pseudo-chylothorax and empyema are insidious. Pseudo-chylothorax usually develops in long-standing pleural effusions due to cholesterol crystal formation without disturbance to the thoracic duct. Adding 1–2 mL of ethyl ether can clear the 'milky' appearance in pseudo-chylothorax but not in chylothorax, whereas in empyema, the turbidity is due to suspended pus cells, thus produces a clear supernatant following centrifugation. The characteristic findings of chylothorax, pseudo-chylothorax and empyema are compared in table 4.

Table 4
Comparison of characteristic findings in three 'milky' pleural effusions

During the biochemical analysis, the impact of high triglyceride on the analytical methods needs to be considered as triglyceride in the chylous fluid causes analytical interference by spectral interference, non-homogeneity of the sample and volume displacement effect. Spectral interferences may be alleviated by serial dilutions, analysis of the infranatant or using LipoClear (a liquid polymer reagent clearing lipaemia). Non-homogeneity and volume displacement may be lessened by centrifugation and using the infranatant with fewer chylomicrons for the analysis. Presence of lipids in the fluid results in spuriously high protein levels when using the sulfosalicylic acid method to analyse chylous fluid protein.

Congenital causes of neonatal chylothorax include congenital lymphatic malformations (pulmonary lymphangiomatosis, lymphangiectasia, thoracic duct atresia) and chylothorax-associated syndromes (such as Down, Noonan, Turner, Gorham-Stout, X-linked myotubular myopathy). Although up to 50% of neonatal chylothorax may be associated with a genetic syndrome, diagnosing a defined syndrome may be difficult. Acquired causes of neonatal chylothorax include thoracic surgical interventions and perinatal trauma due to hyperexpansion/stretching of the chest wall during resuscitation or birth. Considering the clinical presentation, pleural effusion of traumatic chylothorax can have a latent period of 2–10 days, as observed in the index patient. In contrast, congenital chylothorax usually manifests antenatally as a space-occupying lesion restricting lung development, with 50% presenting with pleural effusion on day 1 of life.
