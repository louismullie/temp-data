## Question

Test to assess hemorrhage to the groin area

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which test is most appropriate to assess hemorrhage to the groin area. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is stable or unstable. Then, I should verify the highest-yield first-line test for stable patients. Next, I will consider when to escalate to CT angiography and why. After that, I need to check special scenarios like suspected retroperitoneal hemorrhage or post-procedural femoral access complications. Finally, I will review limitations and alternatives, and synthesize a concise, evidence-based recommendation with caveats for unstable patients and contrast contraindications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the imaging choice hinges on hemodynamic stability and suspected source of bleeding. In unstable patients with junctional or pelvic hemorrhage, immediate hemorrhage control and resuscitation take precedence, whereas in stable patients with suspected groin hematoma or active extravasation, targeted imaging is appropriate to define anatomy and guide therapy [^112JzC64] [^117Eo3gp].

> For a stable patient with suspected groin hemorrhage, I should verify the first-line test. Duplex ultrasound is the recommended initial modality because it is rapid, noninvasive, bedside-available, and reliably detects hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula at the femoral access site, with high appropriateness ratings in vascular access complication scenarios and strong support in cardiology and electrophysiology guidance for groin pain or mass after procedures [^112JzC64] [^1161kCGL] [^112h9mwH].

> Wait, let me verify the specific ultrasound features I'm relying on. For pseudoaneurysm, the classic "yin-yang" color flow and to-and-fro Doppler waveform in the neck confirm arterial communication, whereas hematoma appears as a non-pulsatile, compressible collection without arterial flow, and duplex can also identify AV fistula by early venous arterialization, which directly informs whether conservative management or endovascular therapy is indicated [^116RUKEM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. If ultrasound is negative or equivocal but clinical suspicion remains high, or if there are signs of deep or retroperitoneal extension, I need to escalate to CT angiography because it provides panoramic anatomic coverage from pelvis to thigh, detects active extravasation, quantifies hematoma extent, and precisely maps feeding tracts for pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula, enabling definitive planning for endovascular or surgical intervention [^112gvy4C] [^11359QMh].

> I should double-check the CT protocol details. A multiphasic study with an unenhanced phase helps identify hyperattenuating hematoma and a contrast-enhanced arterial or portal venous phase can reveal active contrast extravasation, with delayed imaging sometimes helpful, and MIP or 3D reconstructions improve visualization of the bleeding source and tract, which is particularly valuable when ultrasound windows are limited by body habitus or pain [^111iZ6hP] [^11359QMh] [^114WJdFd].

> But wait, what if I suspect retroperitoneal hemorrhage or the patient has back pain and anemia after a femoral procedure? In that scenario, I should confirm that CT angiography is the correct test because it can rapidly identify retroperitoneal blood and active extravasation that are not reliably detected by bedside ultrasound, aligning with ACR Appropriateness Criteria for suspected retroperitoneal bleeding and electrophysiology guidance for evaluating retroperitoneal hematoma after ablation or access procedures [^112gvy4C] [^112aAU8M].

> I need to ensure I address unstable patients. If there is exsanguinating groin hemorrhage or hemodynamic instability, immediate direct pressure, junctional tourniquet or FemoStop, and operative or endovascular control take priority, and while FAST may be used broadly in torso trauma, it is not designed to evaluate femoral access site bleeding, so definitive hemorrhage control should not be delayed for imaging in this setting [^117Eo3gp] [^112z4yEf].

> Let me consider alternatives and limitations. Plain radiographs are not useful for acute groin hemorrhage assessment, MRI is generally too slow and impractical in the acute setting, and formal catheter angiography is reserved for unstable patients with ongoing bleeding or when endovascular therapy is planned, typically after CT has localized the culprit vessel, so I should avoid delaying care with low-yield tests in this context [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ultrasound might miss all retroperitoneal extensions, but I should correct that. While ultrasound can occasionally suggest deeper spread, its sensitivity for retroperitoneal hematoma is limited by depth and bowel gas, so a negative ultrasound does not exclude retroperitoneal bleeding when clinical suspicion is high, reinforcing the role of CT angiography as the problem-solving modality in that scenario [^111iZ6hP].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the final recommendation. For a stable patient with suspected groin hemorrhage, start with duplex ultrasound of the groin to rapidly identify hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula and guide initial management, and if ultrasound is non-diagnostic or if there is concern for deep, retroperitoneal, or complex bleeding, proceed to CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis with arterial and venous phases to define the full extent of hemorrhage, detect active extravasation, and plan definitive endovascular or surgical therapy, while in unstable patients prioritize hemorrhage control and resuscitation without delay for imaging [^112JzC64] [^111iZ6hP].

The best test to assess hemorrhage to the groin is **duplex ultrasound** for initial evaluation because it is non-invasive, bedside, and rapidly detects hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula [^112JzC64] [^1161kCGL]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or there is suspicion of deep or retroperitoneal bleeding, **CT angiography** is the next best test, providing comprehensive delineation of active bleeding, hematoma extent, and vascular injuries [^111iZ6hP] [^11359QMh]. In unstable patients, proceed directly to **CT angiography** or angiography without delay [^notfound].

---

## Clinical assessment and initial evaluation

Before imaging, perform a focused **clinical assessment** to guide test selection and urgency:

- **Vital signs**: Assess for hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of shock [^111UPgFM].
- **Physical examination**: Inspect for swelling, ecchymosis, pulsatile mass, bruit, or thrill [^112JzC64].
- **Neurovascular status**: Evaluate pulses, capillary refill, and neurological deficits [^1153w7YE].

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Stable patients

For stable patients, **duplex ultrasound** is the first-line test to rapidly identify hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula [^112h9mwH]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or deep/retroperitoneal bleeding is suspected, obtain **CT angiography** for detailed vascular assessment and treatment planning [^111iZ6hP] [^11359QMh].

---

### Unstable patients

In unstable patients, **CT angiography** or **digital subtraction angiography** should be performed urgently to rapidly identify and treat the bleeding source [^116Y8gMh] [^1119YPbt].

---

## Conclusion

Duplex ultrasound is the **preferred initial test** for groin hemorrhage because it is non-invasive, bedside, and rapidly identifies key complications [^112JzC64] [^112h9mwH]. CT angiography is the **best second-line test** when ultrasound is inconclusive or deep bleeding is suspected, offering high sensitivity and detailed vascular mapping [^111iZ6hP] [^112h9mwH]. In unstable patients, proceed directly to CTA or DSA without delay [^113mFi5X] [^116Y8gMh].

Groin pain is a commonly encountered problem in musculoskeletal radiology. The diagnosis can be difficult to establish, based on the complex interconnected anatomy at the pubic symphysis and surrounding structures. The differential diagnosis is therefore broad, and diagnostic imaging is crucial in reaching the correct diagnosis, thus allowing appropriate therapy to be instituted. This article reviews the relevant anatomy and differential diagnoses encountered in overuse injuries of the groin. The common mechanisms of injury, presenting symptoms, and imaging findings for each diagnosis are addressed.

Summary of the second document: clinical evaluation document consensus

Before describing the second document concerning clinical evaluation we would like to briefly describe the signs and symptoms of GrPS.

It is estimated that 5–18% of athletes seek medical care due to an activity-restricting GrPS. Within the same sport men had greater GrPS incidence than women with a risk ratio of 2.45. In effect, the proportion of GrPS is higher in men (12.8%) than in women (6.9%). In male club football GrPS accounted for 4–19% of all injuries, and only 2–14% in female club football. Symptoms are bilateral in 12% of the cases, it involves the adductor region in 40% of the cases, and the perineal region in 6% of the cases and for the remaining cases the inguinal zone. The pain onset occurs insidiously in 2/3 of the patients, and acutely in the remaining 1/3, while a certain number of patients report an acute event after a period of functional overload GrPS, or LSGrPS. The clinical presentation is characterised by spontaneous and evoked symptoms. Subjective symptoms are mainly represented by pain and functional deficits. From an objective point of view the patient may report of pain on palpation, during resisted muscle contraction, and during passive and active stretching. Clinical examination of the hip and its role in GrPS represents a challenge in clinical practice. To date we are seeing a growing interest concerning the hip labral pathology and FAI especially of CAM type. The CAM deformity (CAM comes from the Dutch word meaning 'cog') describes the femoral head and neck relationship as aspherical or not perfectly round. Unfortunately, at the moment there is no consensus on a gold standard for history and examination, and most tests show low diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In any case the clinical examination must therefore be based on a series of tests focused on muscle contractions (isometric, concentric and eccentric), on the active and passive stretching manoeuvresand on palpation of some specific anatomical points.

Assessment of endovascular treatment efficacy

We assessed technical success, overall success, and complications. Technical success was defined as the disappearance of pseudoaneurysm or extravasation by final arteriography. Overall success was defined as complete hemostasis during the follow-up. Complications were defined as significant complications that required additional treatment. Follow-up studies were performed using ultrasound and enhanced CT.

As many as 10% of all patients with a pelvic injury will experience bleeding from an arterial source; in the setting of an unstable pelvic ring injury, arterial injuries can occur in as many as 60% of patients, and an arterial source of hemorrhage is identified in more than 70% of patients with no response to fluid resuscitation or transfusion. When active contrast agent extravasation is shown on contrast-enhanced CT, angiography demonstrates active arterial hemorrhage with sensitivity ranging from 80% to 90% and specificity ranging from 85% to 98%.

A 30-year-old man was referred to us after 48 days of gunshot injury to left groin, with torrential bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm of the left external iliac artery. He was successfully managed with a team of specialists involving trauma surgeon, vascular and plastic surgeon, general surgeons and intervention radiologist with the help of critical care specialists. He required judicious debridement, a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap, stenting of the external iliac artery, repair of the external iliac vein and ligation of the bilateral internal iliac artery. He had prolonged intensive care unit stay with open abdomen requiring specialised care. Errors in regular assessment of patient by clinical and radiological examination along with failure in early adequate debridement were responsible for trauma suffered by him. Though it is a rare injury, these devastating complications can occur after any gunshot injury and proper management guidelines must be established.

Finally, there was consensus that an experienced multidisciplinary approach is important in the clinical evaluation of GrPS. Since GrPS can be caused by orthopaedic, visceral, and organic disorders and the fact that a rehabilitation programme is an important aspect of disease management, the involvement of orthopaedicians, surgeons, sport physicians, physiotherapists and physical trainers is vitally important.

Summary of the third document: imaging document consensus

The third document discussed and approved during the consensus involved imaging protocols. The protocols regarding conventional radiology (X-ray), ultrasound (US) examination, and MRI were discussed. No distinction was made between first-level and second-level examinations, because it was considered that each examination has a specific role. A correct imaging documentation is extremely important to help the clinical process. For this reason, these two aspects must be strongly correlated in order to avoid misinterpretation of radiological signs that are only incidental, and not related to the actual symptoms of the patient. The ideal situation is the development of a standard protocol that creates the greatest intraobserver and interobserver agreement, which are crucial factors in determining the reliability of radiological results. In any case, a well-defined imaging protocol is strongly recommended for all patients with GrPS.

Therefore based on the literature reviewand on expert opinion of the specialists present, the third document concerning the imaging assessment was approved, and is composed of the following routine examinations:
X-ray examination

The radiography routinely discussed and approved includes the following exams:
Anterior posterior view in upright position (AP1)

### Clinical examination, diagnostic imaging, and testing of athletes with groin pain: an evidence-based approach to effective management [^111AsBuh]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Synopsis Groin pain is common in athletes who participate in multidirectional sports and has traditionally been considered a difficult problem to understand, diagnose, and manage. This may be due to sparse historical focus on this complex region in sports medicine. Until recently, there has been little agreement regarding terminology, definitions, and classification of groin pain in athletes. This has made clear communication between clinicians difficult, and the results of research difficult to interpret and implement into practice. However, during the past decade, the field has evolved rapidly, and an evidence-based understanding is now emerging. This clinical commentary discusses the clinical examination (subjective history, screening, physical examination); imaging; testing of impairments, function, and performance; and management of athletes with groin pain in an evidence-based framework.

### Routine use of ultrasound guidance in femoral arterial access for peripheral vascular intervention decreases groin hematoma rates in high-volume surgeons [^114m5HaC]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is a documented learning curve when adopting ultrasound guidance (UG) to aid vascular access. In the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE), routine UG during percutaneous femoral artery access was shown to protect against the complication of groin hematoma. We sought to confirm this finding in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI), a data set with a larger sample size and broader geographic distribution, and to evaluate the effects of ultrasound usage and interventionalist volume on hematoma rates following peripheral vascular interventions (PVIs).

Methods

The VQI PVI database (2010–2014) was queried to identify the complication of groin hematoma after 43,947 PVIs performed via femoral artery access. Both procedure- and interventionalist-level analyses were performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with hematoma. Multivariable Poisson regression analyses were used to compare hematoma rates between routine (≥ 80% of PVIs) and selective (< 80% of PVIs) users of UG in the adjusted overall sample and in subgroups based on interventionalist volume (low: < 10 PVIs/year; medium: 10–50 PVIs/year; high: > 50 PVIs/year).

Results

The overall groin hematoma rate was 3.2%, and lower hematoma rates correlated with increasing annual interventionalist volume (low vs. medium vs. high volume: 3.7% vs. 3.4% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.011). UG was associated with increased risk of hematoma (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–1.47, P < 0.001), but this risk was isolated to patients treated by selective (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17–1.53, P < 0.001) rather than routine users of UG (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.55–1.33, P = 0.484). In the overall interventionalist-level analysis, routine UG was not found to be protective against hematoma (rate ratio [RR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.85–1.11, P = 0.677), in contrast to what was previously reported from the VSGNE. However, subgroup analysis revealed that routine UG was further protective against hematoma among high-volume interventionalists (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54–0.97, P = 0.030).

Conclusions

UG in percutaneous femoral artery access may decrease the complication rate of groin hematoma, especially as an interventionalist's volume increases and as selective use transforms into routine adoption. With repetition and practice, interventionalists likely overcome the learning curve associated with adoption of an unfamiliar technology and potentially improve patient outcomes.

When it came to abdominal imaging, these included 1 gastrointestinal bleed and 4 access site complications: 1 access site hematoma, 1 case of necrotizing fasciitis (Figs. 6), 1 pseudoaneurysm (Figs. 7) and 1 femoral artery thrombus. Most commonly, these patients reported some form of localized groin (swelling, infection, bleeding) or leg symptoms (leg pain, swelling). However, some presented with non-specific signs such as GI discomfort (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) or weakness. Of note, 1 case of pneumonia was also found on abdominal imaging.

The most common imaging finding from cardiac imaging (ECHO) was heart failure. There were 8 total cases in this population. The most common patient presentation was shortness of breath, which was found in 5 of 8 patients. Other presenting symptoms included hypotension, fatigue, abnormal ICD firing, chest pain, and hyponatremia.

In imaging of the extremities such as duplex ultrasounds (n = 40) and extremity MRI (n = 1), common imaging findings include 1 deep vein thrombosis and 4 access site complications: 3 cases of access site hematoma and one access site thrombus. These patients commonly presented with localized leg swelling or pain.

Ultimately, while echocardiograms and duplex extremity vasculature ultrasounds were the most abundant types of studies ordered with 47 and 40 studies respectively, CTA chest and echocardiograms were the 2 study modalities that most commonly resulted in acute findings of significance with 12 and 8 findings respectively (Table 5).

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management… [^113jgKdN]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal contents becoming trapped within the hernial sac, leading to incarceration, is a risk of watchful waiting. Over time, this can impede the blood flow in the incarcerated hernial contents. Richter hernia, a rare complication with a high mortality rate, occurs when part of the intestinal circumference is entrapped and strangulated in the hernial sac. Watchful waiting is also commonly used in pregnant patients because groin swelling can be caused by self-limited round ligament varicosities. 23 Color flow Doppler imaging can be used to distinguish between a true hernia and round ligament varicosities. In a 2017 cohort study of 20, 714 pregnant patients, only 25 had inguinal hernias and none underwent elective or emergency hernia repair during pregnancy. In 10 patients, the groin bulge disappeared spontaneously after delivery.

24 For reducible inguinal hernias in pregnant patients, it seems safe and cost-effective to wait until after delivery to attempt repair. Although nonmesh techniques have fallen out of favor in the United States, they are still acceptable internationally. Mesh techniques are strongly recommended because of lower recurrence rates compared with nonmesh techniques. 19 If mesh is unavailable, a 2009 European guideline suggests that an open anterior nonmesh technique is most favorable. 19, 25. The use of laparoscopic techniques has been shown to be superior to tension-free mesh repair for postoperative pain outcomes. 19 Common laparoscopic techniques include the total extraperitoneal approach and transabdominal preperitoneal approach. In both of these approaches, mesh is placed in the preperitoneal space, but access starts at different anatomic points. Laparoscopic repair of groin hernias is preferred over open repair because of better recovery outcomes.

26–29 Guidelines specifically recommend laparoscopic approaches in women to decrease the risk of chronic pain and avoid missing femoral hernias. Laparoscopic approaches can also be used in patients with previous hernias that were repaired with an open approach to avoid significant scar tissue. 19 A Cochrane review comparing open and laparoscopic repair found that laparoscopic repair took longer and was associated with a higher rate of vascular, colonic, or bladder injury; however, overall, laparoscopic surgery was associated with shorter recovery, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates. 29.

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^112aAU8M]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

10.2.6. Vascular Injury

The incidence of vascular injury after VT ablation ranges from 0% to 8.6% and is the most common major complication reported after VT ablation procedures. Vascular complications after VT ablation are typically related to vascular access and include hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, and dissection or occlusion of the artery accessed. Prior to sheath deployment, confirmation that the guide wire used for arterial access is indeed in the lumen and not in the arterial wall is important to avoid retrograde dissection of the iliac artery and aorta. This can be accomplished with techniques such as ultrasound or angiography. Furthermore, longer sheaths are preferable in the setting of tortuous peripheral vessels to avoid damage of the vessel wall with the catheter tip. Imaging of the aortic arch (with transesophageal echocardiography or CT) prior to ablation using a retrograde approach could help to identify patients at risk for thromboembolic events in the presence of mobile atheromas or thick plaque material. ICE can also be beneficial to identify plaque material in the ascending aorta prior to a planned retrograde approach. Many electrophysiologists curve the ablation catheter to a "J" shape in the descending aorta to minimize trauma to the aortic valve when mapping the LV with a retrograde approach. The catheter is then prolapsed into the LV.

In higher-risk patients, such as those with high body mass index, body surface area < 1.6 m², hypertension, age > 70 years, baseline anemia, and known peripheral vascular disease, ultrasound-guided percutaneous access and careful management of anticoagulation status should be strongly considered. Reversal of heparin with protamine before sheath removal can also be useful to prevent groin hematoma. There are no conclusive data demonstrating that the use of vascular closure devices decreases this complication compared with manual compression.

Large hematomas after sheath removal are the most common complication and are usually self-limited, but they can be large enough to result in blood transfusion. When femoral arterial pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistulas are suspected, ultrasound Doppler or CT scan are useful imaging tools for diagnosis. A CT scan can also be useful in patients with back pain and acute anemia after ablation to evaluate for retroperitoneal hematoma. Percutaneous thrombin injection, surgical repair of pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula, and surgical evacuation of large hematomas are possible interventions for these vascular complications.

### Groin pain syndrome Italian consensus conference on terminology, clinical evaluation and imaging assessment in groin pain in athlete [^113L3uPR]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The reality is that large terminological variations are still present in the contemporary literature. More recently Serner et al emphasised the need to standardise the terminology in order to facilitate the comparison of results from different studies. In this review the authors systematically reviewed 72 studies on GrP in athletes and found that 33 different conditions were referred to as 'groin pain'. The lack of agreement concerning terminology can be explained, but not justified, by the fact that GrP symptoms can result from musculoskeletal, skeletal, gastrointestinal, urogenital, neurological and gynaecological problems.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^112f2Tka]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The number and complexity of endovascular procedures performed via either arterial or venous access are steadily increasing. Albeit associated with higher morbidity compared to the radial approach, the traditional common femoral artery remains the preferred access site in a variety of cardiac, aortic, oncologic and peripheral vascular procedures. Both transarterial and venous cannulation (for electrophysiology, intravenous laser ablation and central catheterisation) at the groin may result in potentially severe vascular access site complications (VASC). Furthermore, vascular and soft-tissue groin infections may develop after untreated VASC or secondarily to non-sterile injections for recreational drug use. VASC and groin infections require rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment to avoid further, potentially devastating harm. Whereas in the past colour Doppler ultrasound was generally used, in recent years cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists increasingly rely on pelvic and femoral CT angiography. Despite drawbacks of ionising radiation and the need for intravenous contrast, multidetector CT rapidly and consistently provides a panoramic, comprehensive visualisation, which is crucial for correct choice between conservative, endovascular and surgical management. This paper aims to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with iatrogenic and self-inflicted VASC and infections at the groin by presenting examples of haematomas, active bleeding, pseudoaneurysms, arterial occlusion, arterio-venous fistula, endovenous heat-induced thrombosis, septic thrombophlebitis, soft-tissue infections at the groin, and late sequelae of venous injuries.

Teaching Points

- Complications may develop after femoral arterial or venous access for interventional procedures.
- Arterial injuries include bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, occlusion, arteriovenous fistula, dissection.
- Endovenous heat-induced thrombosis is a specific form of iatrogenic venous complication.
- Iatrogenic infections include groin cellulitis, abscesses and septic thrombophlebitis.
- CT angiography reliably triages vascular access site complications and groin infections.

### Sonographic evaluation of inguinal lesions [^116X9qwM]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in the inguinal region are varied. The most common abnormality in the inguinal region is the hernia: direct or indirect inguinal hernia and femoral hernia. There are many hernia-mimicking lesions, such as spermatic cord hydrocele, undescended testis, hematoma, inflammation, abscess, benign or malignant tumors, metastatic or benign lymph node enlargement, round ligament varicosities or mesothelial cyst, and herniated ovary. Ultrasonography is currently the primary imaging modality used in assessing inguinal lesions and helpful for the differential diagnosis of a broad spectrum of these diseases. Familiarity with clinical setting and certain ultrasonography details will facilitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Adult abdominal hernias [^115BLbep]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Educational Objectives and Key Points. 1. Given that abdominal hernias are a frequent imaging finding, radiologists not only are required to interpret the appearances of abdominal hernias but also should be comfortable with identifying associated complications and postrepair findings. 2. CT is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of a known adult abdominal hernia in both elective and acute circumstances because of rapid acquisition, capability of multiplanar reconstruction, good spatial resolution, and anatomic depiction with excellent sensitivity for most complications. 3. Ultrasound is useful for adult groin assessment and is the imaging modality of choice for pediatric abdominal wall hernia assessment, whereas MRI is beneficial when there is reasonable concern that a patient's symptoms could be attributable to a hernia or a musculoskeletal source. 4. Fluoroscopic herniography is a sensitive radiologic investigation for patients with groin pain in whom a hernia is suspected but in whom a hernia cannot be identified at physical examination. 5. The diagnosis of an internal hernia not only is a challenging clinical diagnosis but also can be difficult to diagnose with imaging: Closed-loop small-bowel obstruction and abnormally located bowel loops relative to normally located small bowel or colon should prompt assessment for an internal hernia.

Vascular complications after venous cannulation and interventions

Following endovascular interventions performed via femoral venous access, haemorrhage (Fig. 3 D-F) occurs rarely (0.3–1% of all procedures) compared to transarterial ones. Conversely, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is relatively common (reported in up to 21% of patients) and often asymptomatic. In the electrophysiology setting, the incidence of DVT is lower (0.33% versus 2.38%) following treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) compared to non-AF procedures, due to routine periprocedural anticoagulation. Albeit most instances are initially diagnosed using CDUS, using an appropriate CT-venography technique with delayed post-CM acquisition, multidetector CT effectively detects DVT in iliac and femoral veins with the usual appearance as luminal non-opacification and filling defects, causing variable degrees of venous enlargement. A peculiar form of DVT is endovenous heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT), which represents the most feared complication (1% incidence within 72 h) of endovenous laser ablation (ELA), and requires anticoagulation to prevent development of pulmonary embolism. ELA is a minimally invasive treatment for lower-extremity venous insufficiency, which achieves venous obliteration by heat-induced irreversible damage to the vein lining, followed by fibrotic sealing of the lumen. CT allows for a comprehensive evaluation of EHIT proximal extension, which is categorised as grade 1 (thrombosis below the saphenous-femoral junction), 2, 3 and 4 respectively corresponding to thrombus occupying < 50%, > 50% or occluding the femoral vein diameter (Fig. 9).

Multiplanar contrast-enhanced CT images (A, B) panoramically showed the full extent of iliac-femoral EHIT including the ipsilateral inferior hypogastric and obturator veins, with mild dilatation, luminal non-opacification and prominent enhancement of venous walls (arrows). One week later, repeated CT (C) showed persistent thrombosis of proximal femoral and obturator veins with disappeared mural enhancement (arrows) and increased mass effect on the urinary bladder. Follow-up CT three months later (D) showed recanalisation of the left femoral vein and persistence of chronic obturator vein thrombosis [Adapted from Open Access ref. no.]

### Groin pain syndrome Italian consensus conference on terminology, clinical evaluation and imaging assessment in groin pain in athlete [^115Artjf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The nomenclature and the lack of consensus of clinical evaluation and imaging assessment in groin pain generate significant confusion in this field. The Groin Pain Syndrome Italian Consensus Conference has been organised in order to prepare a consensus document regarding taxonomy, clinical evaluation and imaging assessment for groin pain. A 1-day Consensus Conference was organised on 5 February 2016, in Milan (Italy). 41 Italian experts with different backgrounds participated in the discussion. A consensus document previously drafted was discussed, eventually modified, and finally approved by all members of the Consensus Conference. Unanimous consensus was reached concerning: (1) taxonomy (2) clinical evaluation and (3) imaging assessment. The synthesis of these 3 points is included in this paper. The Groin Pain Syndrome Italian Consensus Conference reached a consensus on three main points concerning the groin pain syndrome assessment, in an attempt to clarify this challenging medical problem.

It is important to underline that, given the anatomical complexity of the pubic region, functional overload GrPS and LSGrPS can often be caused by overlapping clinical entities. In this case the diagnosis definition will change to: 'traumatic or overuse GrPS, or LSGrPS caused by overlapping… '.

Furthermore it is important to note that it is useful to leave the classification open to other different diagnoses and an 'idiopathic cause category' represents an occurrence to consider.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — vascular complications and incidence: Vascular complications are the most common complications of AF ablation and include groin hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, femoral arterial pseudoaneurysm, or femoral arteriovenous fistula. The published incidence of vascular complications varies from 0% to 13%, with a literature review describing a 1% incidence of hematoma and a 1% incidence of an arteriovenous fistula at the puncture site; a worldwide survey of 8745 procedures reported femoral arterial pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula rates of 0.53% and 0.43%, respectively. In most EP laboratories, patients are fully anticoagulated during and following the ablation procedure with interruption of anticoagulation for less than 4–6 hours to allow sheath removal. The approach to femoral venous access may impact risk, and when a superior approach is used there is a potential for a retroperitoneal bleeding complication where substantial blood loss can occur before becoming clinically evident.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^112pCgVk]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Despite the shift towards establishing vascular access via the radial artery instead of the CFA, cannulation of the latter remains frequent in coronary and non-cardiac interventions. In recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in urgent requests for pelvic and femoral CT angiography studies in patients with suspected iatrogenic injuries. Despite the disadvantages of ionising radiation and need for intravenous contrast, multidetector CT provides rapid and effective triage of troublesome groin complications secondarily to femoral arterial or venous access, which is required for correct choice between conservative, endovascular and surgical treatment. Familiarity with CT findings of iatrogenic and self-inflicted VASC and infections at the groin is warranted.

Consensus Conference literature review process

Prior to the Consensus Conference two senior authors (GNB and PV) performed a literature review concerning the classification, clinical evaluation and imaging assessment of GrP. The review process was conducted as follows:
The research was performed independently by two authors, no language limitation was applied.
Databases used were MEDLINE, EMBASE, EXCERPTA MEDICA, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Review. The so-called 'grey literature' (ie, conferences, abstracts, thesis and unpublished reports) was not considered.

After a preliminary review of titles and abstracts of selected studies, the authors obtained full text of the studies which were most applicable to the three clinical issues mentioned above. Following review, all studies that did not report relevant information to these three specific clinical questions were excluded.

On the basis of the studies of major interest, the authors provided a comprehensive summary document divided into three distinct sections: diagnostic classification, clinical presentations, and imaging assessment. The document was delivered to each expert participating at the Consensus Conference, and was considered as a starting point for the discussion.

### Groin complications in endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: a 10-year single center experience [^1148gdQa]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Patient radiological reports were reviewed for evidence of ultrasound imaging of the groin or CT of the abdomen and/or pelvis, up to 30 days post-procedure. EMR were also examined for descriptions of complications at the groin site. Groin complications were sub-classified into 'definite' or 'possible'. A definite groin complication was defined as groin hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma or femoral artery pseudoaneurysm meeting any of the following criteria: (a) requiring surgical or radiological intervention to treat, (b) requiring at least 1 unit of blood transfusion, (c) causing > 3 g drop in hemoglobin, (d) causing a 10% drop in hematocrit, (e) requiring surgical intervention to correct vessel injury due to vascular closure device deployment, or (f) contributing to or resulting in the death of the patient. A possible groin complication was defined as blood transfusion within 72 h of the thrombectomy procedure without a clear documented explanation as to the reason for the transfusion. Other hematomas not meeting the above criteria were not included the analysis.

Finally, patients in our neurointerventional database were cross-checked with the hospital blood-bank records for a specified time period (2005–2014) to identify any patient who may have had a blood transfusion during their admission for stroke treatment. This was carried out to minimize the possibility of the EMR failing to document a significant groin hematoma. This study was approved by the local institutional review board.

Pseudoaneurysm

Iatrogenic PA develop secondarily to failed sealing of an arterial puncture, from which blood dissects nearby causing the formation of a perfused "sac" contained by the media or adventitia, sometimes by soft tissues only. PA differs from haematoma because it is encapsulated and communicates with the arterial lumen.

Sometimes clinically silent, PSA often manifest with tenderness and swelling at the site of arterial puncture. A pulsatile mass with associated palpable thrill or audible bruit is strongly suggestive for the diagnosis. Traditionally, the hallmark CDUS appearance is the "to-and-from" waveform through the feeding tract (FT). At CT angiography PA are demonstrated as round-shaped, peripherally haemorrhagic structures, internally perfused by CM from the CFA (Fig. 5). The length and calibre of the FT should be assessed, as it may impact the therapeutic choice.

A-B) In a 66-year-old man with severe peripheral artery disease (PA), shortly after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting of the left femoral artery with ipsilateral vascular access, precontrast (A) CT images showed high-attenuation subperitoneal effusion (*) along the left iliac muscle, without active bleeding at CT-angiography (B), which was treated conservatively. C-F) In a 75-year-old woman with obliterating PAD, following PTA and stenting of the right superficial femoral artery via left CFA access, precontrast images (C, D) showed extensive, mass-like left retroperitoneal haematoma (*) with characteristic fluid-fluid levels (thin arrows), mild haemoperitoneum (+) in the pelvic cul-de-sac. CT angiography with maximum-intensity projection (MIP) images (E, F) showed extraluminal CM flowing from the site of arterial injury, indicative of active bleeding. Note displaced ipsilateral kidney. Emergency surgery including retroperitoneal decaillotage was required to seal the leaking femoral artery

If not contraindicated by impaired renal function or history of allergy, administration of iodinated contrast medium (CM) is warranted to detect ongoing bleeding, a finding which requires directed endovascular or surgical treatment. Arterial CT angiography is better acquired using high-flow (> 3 ml/s) injection and automatic bolus-triggering technique with the region of interest placed in the infrarenal aorta and > 100 HU cut-off. Active CM extravasation (Figs. 2, 3, 4) may be identified on either arterial or portal venous phase acquisitions depending on the injured vessel, and is best visualised using maximum intensity projection (MIP) or three-dimensional volume-rendering reconstructions.

What would you do?

A middle-aged (fifth decade) patient was brought to the emergency department after a motorcycle collision during which the lower abdomen-to-pelvis area was trapped between a traffic sign pole and the motorcycle. On admission, vital signs were normal. The patient complained of left groin and buttock pain. Primary and secondary evaluations revealed subcutaneous hematoma and tenderness in the groin bilaterally and left buttock. Left dorsal pedis arterial pulse was slightly diminished compared with that on the right. No neurological deficits were apparent in bilateral lower extremities (LEs). Laboratory test results were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a defect in the left common femoral artery (CFA) with normal runoff. Scans also identified a sacral bone fracture with contrast medium extravasation and a pseudoaneurysm with a large subcutaneous hematoma in the left gluteus maximus muscle (figure 1A, B).

Figure 1
(A) Contrast-enhanced CT shows that the left common femoral artery is not visible (circle). (B) Gluteal hematoma (thick arrow) with extravasation of contrast medium from the left inferior gluteal artery (thin arrow).

As the vascular surgery, interventional radiology, and orthopedic departments were planning treatment, the patient, now tachycardic and diaphoretic, complained of worsening pain and numbness in the left buttock and LEs. Examination showed that the subcutaneous hematoma in its left gluteal region had expanded significantly and was firmer. The left LE was cold and pale, with no palpable pulses or Doppler signals. Left ankle dorsal flexion was impaired. These neurological deficits were compatible with sciatic nerve palsy and ischemia. On palpation, left LE muscles were soft and tender. Since admission, the hemoglobin level decreased from 12.1 to 10.2 g/dL, and lactic acid level increased from 2.0 to 5.9 mmol/L. We suspected left LE ischemia secondary to left CFA occlusion and left gluteal compartment syndrome causing left sciatic nerve palsy due to the expanding gluteal hematoma and active arterial hemorrhage.

The initial diagnosis of retroperitoneal bleeding can be challenging by physical examination and clinical presentation. Prompt imaging can make the diagnosis and be lifesaving. When selecting appropriate imaging for these patient's, consideration must be made for sensitivity and ability to image the retroperitoneum, as well as speed of imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Idiopathic scrotal hematoma in newborns: a case report and literature review [^112V7ybY]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

While Davenport et al. emphasized the need for surgical exploration to differentiate idiopathic scrotal hematoma from testicular torsion and to drain the hematoma, Yeh et al. raised the question of whether surgery was always necessary, especially in neonatal patients with well-known anesthesia-associated risks. Acknowledging that distinguishing idiopathic scrotal hematoma from testicular torsion can be challenging, they proposed that, unlike testicular torsion, idiopathic scrotal hematoma typically does not present with discoloration in the groin, and the spermatic cord appears normal on palpation. Additionally, they suggested that imaging techniques such as radioisotope testicular scanning and Doppler US could evaluate testicular perfusion, aiding in the differentiation between idiopathic scrotal hematoma and testicular torsion.

In recent decades, significant advancements in US techniques have made it increasingly possible to avoid surgery, with diagnostic accuracy now reaching up to 92%. In addition to the absence of blood flow, indicators of testicular torsion include heterogeneity in echogenicity, thickening of the tunica albuginea, irregular margins, and the presence of hydrocele. Our literature review shows that all patients reported over the past 25 years, including our case, underwent testicular Doppler US, but only three (33%) cases of torsion could not be excluded, requiring exploratory surgery. Some researchers also recommend abdominal US to rule out intra-abdominal causes of acute scrotum, such as intra-abdominal bleeding (particularly adrenal hemorrhage) or perforation (e.g. meconium peritonitis). In our review, abdominal US was performed in 15 out of 16 cases (94%) and was negative in all of them.

Based on a testicular doppler US negative for testicular torsion and an abdominal US negative for intra-abdominal causes of acute scrotum, a diagnosis of idiopathic scrotal hematoma can be made by exclusion. Recent studies in the literature consistently support that in such cases surgery can be avoided and a conservative approach can be safely adopted. Exceptions include compressive hematomas that compromise testicular vascularization and those that become infected. In all cases of conservatively treated cases of idiopathic scrotal hematoma reported in the literature, follow-up examinations have shown normal testicular development.

In conclusion, idiopathic scrotal hematoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute scrotum in the neonatal period. Doppler testicular US and abdominal US are usually sufficient to distinguish idiopathic scrotal hematoma from other potential causes, particularly testicular torsion, thereby preventing unnecessary surgical exploration.

Lower and upper extremity arterial testing — appropriate indications and uncertain scenarios: For lower extremity testing using multilevel physiological methods alone or duplex ultrasound with single-level ankle–brachial index (ABI) and pulse volume recording (PVR), reviewers delineated 6 appropriate and 4 inappropriate indications and none were uncertain; nocturnal leg cramps, neuropathy, lower extremity swelling or hair loss in the setting of normal pulses are not clinical scenarios that support ordering lower extremity artery tests. For ABI-only evaluation, appropriate indications were diminished pulses, femoral bruit, age > 50 years with diabetes or smoking, and age > 70 years, while evaluation with ABI only for those age ≤ 50 years with diabetes was uncertain. For duplex ultrasound only, appropriate indications included a pulsatile groin mass, bruit or thrill, significant hematoma, or groin pain postprocedure, whereas the presence of ecchymosis only was an uncertain indication. For upper extremity arterial testing, appropriate indications included claudication, ulcer, unilateral cold painful hand, suspected positional arterial obstruction, and trauma with suspicion of vascular injury, and a preoperative evaluation such as radial artery harvest or suspected complication after an upper extremity arterial intervention, while Raynaud's phenomenon was an uncertain indication.

Junctional hemorrhage remains a difficult source of bleeding to control with the groin being the most common location. FemoStop devices are a well established tool for achieving hemostasis in post cardiac catheterization femoral access site hemorrhage. Massive hemorrhage is a traumatic presentation well known to emergency physicians and trauma surgeons alike. We describe a case of traumatic proximal femoral artery injury with expanding hematoma and hemorrhage control with a FemoStop device applied in the emergency department.

Management

Traditionally, manual compression represented the "gold standard" in achieving haemostasis at an arterial access site. In the majority of VASC cases, further endovascular or surgical treatment is unnecessary, and a watchful conservative approach is sufficient. Most bleeding complications are self-limiting and are treated by re-application of pressure dressings. In major haemorrhage, haemodynamic stabilisation with blood transfusions is required. Endovascular therapies effectively use covered stents to seal active CFA bleeding, but may be limited by the considerable risk of bend-induced stent deformation at the level of the groin.

According to the American College of Cardiology guidelines, in small-sized asymptomatic PA (up to 3 cm) and AVF a conservative approach is generally justified. PA with shorter (> 1 cm) and wider FT close less easily compared to thin, long (> 1 cm) ones. Therapeutic options include ultrasound-guided compression, percutaneous instillation of procoagulants (thrombin) into the aneurysmal sac, and stent implantation. Surgical revision is nowadays reserved for those cases refractory to conservative treatment. Finally, iatrogenic dissections may heal spontaneously or require endovascular treatment via contralateral or brachial access. Whereas self-expanding stents are used in the external iliac arteries, CFA dissection requires balloon angioplasty, since stents placed there are at high risk of fracture.

Use of vascular closure devices (VCD)

During the last decade, VCD have been extensively investigated to improve haemostasis. Compared to manual compression, CD consistently achieved earlier mobilisation, and decreased patient discomfort and hospital stay. Although discussion of VCD types is beyond the scope of this article, they can be categorised as metal clips, suture-based, and collagen-plug devices. However, use of first-generation VCDs remains controversial due to a combination of factors, namely: a) the increased risk of local infections reported with AngioSeal and Perclose; b) the possibility of masking an ongoing bleeding; c) the possible development of lower limb ischaemia from device entrapment, dissection or thrombosis secondary to reaction to collagen plugs.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^1135xHQE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination (Figs. 1). It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination. After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia. Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.
The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on multiple factors. Patients with a reducible hernia, improvement in symptoms, no evidence of complications, and an otherwise normal physical examination should be referred for outpatient surgical follow-up to discuss elective hernia repair. Patients with concern for abdominal wall hernia complications, including strangulation, intestinal obstruction, hernia incarceration, unrelieved severe pain, overlying skin changes, or evidence of systemic illness, should be seen by an acute care surgeon. Ideally, surgical evaluation should precede imaging in patients with nonreducible hernias and worrisome findings on physical examination.
Patients with an incarcerated hernia and concern for strangulation or presence of peritonitis require prompt surgical intervention, as increased time from onset of symptoms to operative intervention is associated with an increased need for bowel resection. Signs of bowel incarceration causing obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation), in addition to severe pain at the hernia site, are suggestive of strangulation. Systemic signs of strangulation may include hypotension and tachycardia, with elevations in serum lactate (> 2.0 mmol/L) and white blood cell often (although not definitively) found on initial laboratory evaluation. Physical examination may also show erythema or bruising/discoloration of the skin overlying the hernia. When these findings are present, or the patient is otherwise deemed at risk for strangulation within the hernia, an emergent exploration should be undertaken, with assessment of the viability of involved bowel, reduction of the hernia, and definitive hernia repair if practical. In many cases, imaging is not required and may lead to unnecessary delay. Similar to other EGS procedures, patients requiring acute urgent operation for hernia complications are at increased risk of complication compared with their elective counterparts.
In circumstances of diagnostic uncertainty or a difficult-to-interpret examination (as can be found in obesity), imaging should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for high-risk imaging features associated with strangulation. While ultrasound can be used to help with the initial diagnosis, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography scan is preferred. Even when the diagnosis of hernia is confidently made on physical examination, computed tomography imaging can provide useful clinical information on the fascial defect size and hernia contents to evaluate for signs of intestinal obstruction or ischemia. In the absence of a high index of suspicion for strangulation, attempts should be made to reduce an incarcerated abdominal wall hernia unless it is known that the patient has had a chronically nonreducible incarcerated hernia. Acute hernia incarceration that is not reducible should prompt urgent operative intervention to reduce the hernia, evaluate for the viability of the incarcerated bowel, and repair the hernia defect.
Acutely incarcerated hernias that are reducible but have high-risk features (Table 1) on imaging or physical examination should favor urgent repair (defined as nonemergent but performed during the index admission). These features are related to the patient's presentation and imaging findings. Clinical high-risk features include persistent abdominal pain after reduction or persistent nausea/vomiting. Radiographic findings associated with a higher risk for hernia complications should be considered when determining the need for urgent surgery in patients without clear signs of strangulation. Beyond the typical signs of bowel ischemia (e.g. pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or free air), the presence of fluid within the hernia sac, a transition point of the bowel at the neck of the hernia, bowel thickening within the hernia, and inflammatory stranding in the tissue along the hernia are considered high-risk features.
While repair of a hernia on initial presentation may be ideal, patient factors or local capacity may not permit this to be reasonably performed in all settings. Patient-specific factors should be considered, including age, frailty, American Society of Anesthesia score, and preadmission anticoagulant use, as each of these variables is associated with an increased risk of complications. – Some patients with hernias that exhibit a higher risk of recurrence may be discharged but with a defined plan to repair it in the short term to minimize patients' loss of follow-up. Variables associated with a higher risk of recurrence include clinical factors and radiographic features of the hernia (Table 2). Acute onset and escalation of symptoms should be considered potential reasons to hasten repair. The need for conscious sedation to achieve a successful visceral reduction marks patients as higher risk, and they should undergo expedited repair (when performed within 4 weeks, reincarceration rates of ~2% have been reported). High-risk anatomical features include certain types of hernias with femoral and Spigelian hernias exhibiting a higher incarceration rate and need for emergent repair; therefore, these should be addressed promptly. Women with groin hernia have a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery compared with men, especially if a femoral hernia is present. The size of the fascial defect is an unreliable predictor of the need for urgent repair, but primary hernia defects between 3 and 4 cm are at higher overall risk of incarceration compared with smaller or larger defects (with a rate of 10%; odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.91–5.74; p < 0.0001). Specific measurements comparing the width of a fascial defect and the height of the hernia sack can also be used to estimate an increased risk with a "mushrooming hernia", one with a narrow neck as compared with height creating an acute angle with the abdominal wall being associated with a higher risk of requiring emergent surgery (odds ratio, 6.12; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–20.00). Similarly, a study by James et al.identified the ratio of hernia size to fascial defect (neck) as a potential aid in surgical decision-making, finding that a hernia-to-neck ratio > 2.5 predicted the need for emergent repair. Patients presenting to the ED with acute abdominal wall hernia symptoms who do not have an indication for urgent surgery are at high risk of being lost to follow-up. A prior multicenter study of patients with an ED visit for hernia-related symptoms showed that over 50% did not follow up in the outpatient clinic, with 20% returning to the ED with additional hernia-related complaints. Considering socioeconomic factors and health care disparities to determine the need for operative intervention at the index admission will address low clinic follow-up rates and prevent future ED resource utilization. When immediate repair is not required, an effort should be made to ensure follow-up and initiate planning for definitive repair before the patient is discharged from the ED or the inpatient setting. The ability to follow-up in the outpatient clinic and access to elective, outpatient surgery should also be considered.
Nonurgent repair or repair after patient optimization prior to surgery can be pursued for symptomatic hernias without high-risk features. These patients can likely be safely discharged from the ED with elective outpatient follow-up. If modifiable patient risk factors are identified at the time of hernia diagnosis (such as smoking, need for weight loss, or control of diabetes), these should be addressed before surgery. If the hernia is deemed complex, its eventual repair should be scheduled when patient optimization has been achieved and performed by a surgeon experienced in complex abdominal wall reconstruction techniques. Prediction of the need for component separation can be a subjective determination or made in various ways using data from cross-sectional imaging comparing aspects of the hernia to the remaining abdominal wall. Watchful waiting and outpatient follow-up may be considered for asymptomatic ventral, inguinal, and umbilical hernias found incidentally on imaging. While these have a reasonably high rate of requiring an eventual repair, it is likely safe to monitor these hernias after the patient has received counseling on monitoring the hernia for symptoms in the future.

### Use of REBOA to stabilize in-hospital iatrogenic intra-abdominal hemorrhage [^116PMh53]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

What we did and why

After review of his prior CT angiography, it was thought that the patient was bleeding intra-abdominally secondary to a ruptured iatrogenic dissection of the celiac artery. The OR was mobilized and the general surgery team retrieved a REBOA from the emergency department. The left groin was selected for access to avoid right groin pseudoaneurysm, and the interventional radiology attending physician placed an ultrasound-guided 18-gauge left femoral artery arterial catheter, which was upsized to a 7 Fr sheath. The senior general surgery resident then inserted a REBOA (Prytime Medical, Boerne, TX) through the 7 Fr sheath to 45 cm, after flushing the catheter and testing the balloon. A chest X-ray confirmed position of the catheter within zone 1, and the balloon was inflated slowly to 8 mL with normal saline. The patient's blood pressure subsequently improved to 180/90 mm Hg and the norepinephrine was stopped (table 1).

Table 1
Time course of critical events

The patient was emergently moved to the OR for laparotomy, during which the middle colic artery was found to be bleeding, potentially due to a misplaced wire after multiple attempts to cannulate the celiac artery. The bleeding was controlled, a negative pressure wound was placed, and he was taken to the ICU. He returned to the OR 2 days later and was closed. He was ultimately discharged to a skilled nursing facility.

REBOA technology is increasingly being used in patients with traumatic injuries and its use is being actively studied. The best described indication is for traumatic injury with non-compressible torso hemorrhage. Its indications for use are broadening, including hemorrhage arising above the diaphragm and use in prehospital settings.

The area of potential REBOA balloon deployment is divided into three zones. Zone 1 extends from the left subclavian artery to the celiac artery and is indicated when mesenteric bleeding was suspected, as above. Zone 2 includes the visceral vessels from the celiac artery to the most caudal renal artery. Zone 3 extends from the renal artery to the aortic bifurcation and is used in cases of pelvic or junctional/lower extremity hemorrhage.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^111iZ6hP]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Haematomas and active bleeding

Haemorrhage represents the commonest form of VASC after transarterial diagnostic and interventional procedures. The degree of severity is quantified by the haemoglobin level drop, and blood transfusions are required in 1% to 6% of patients. Minor bleeding is generally apparent as persistent ecchymosis radiating from the puncture site. Major haemorrhage manifests with a combination of haemodynamic instability, dropping haemoglobin, abdominal pain, neurologic symptoms and swelling of the ipsilateral thigh. Arterial puncture above the inguinal ligament may lead to the uncommon retroperitoneal haemorrhage, which is associated with higher need for transfusions, longer hospital stay and non-negligible mortality (6.6%).

In our experience, multidetector CT angiography is beneficial in patients with suspected groin VASC, particularly when there is concern for deep-seated haemorrhage. The CT protocol should include a preliminary unenhanced acquisition extending at least from the iliac crests to the mid-thigh, which allows assessing presence, site, and entity of extravascular blood. The expected early CT appearance following uncomplicated transarterial access is represented by fat stranding and fluid abutting the ventral aspect of the punctured CFA, and mild high-attenuation fascial blood (Fig. 1).

Complications of femoral arterial access

Incidence and risk factors

In the cardiologic literature, clinically significant VASC have been reported to occur after 0.8–1.8% of diagnostic coronary angiography (CA) and up to 9% of coronary interventions (CI). Summarised in Table 1, the commonest VASC of CFA access include bleeding, pseudoaneurysm (PA), arterio-venous fistula (AVF), CFA occlusion and dissection. Other occasional complications include local lymphatic leakage and femoral neuropathy secondary to large haematomas or PA.

Table 1
Vascular complications of femoral arterial access (in descending order of frequency)

In recent years, the increasing use of ultrasound guidance has resulted in significantly decreased (roughly 50%) overall complications and bleeding rates, particularly in elderly and obese patients.

General predisposing factors related to VASC development include operator experience, technical and patient-related conditions. Meticulous technique is crucial to minimising risks during transarterial interventions, including correct choice of access site, proper closure, and appropriate management of antithrombotic medications. Repeated puncture attempts and arterial access distal or proximal to the CFA bifurcation are associated with higher risk. The key technical issue is represented by use of large catheters (> 6 French).

Patient-related risk factors include female gender, high body mass index, advanced age, low platelet count, hypertension and severity of peripheral atherosclerotic disease. Due to smaller vessels and higher comorbidities, women have a risk of complications double that of men. Left-sided CFA cannulation carries a four times higher risk, probably related to severe atheromatous disease and previous failed right-sided puncture.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^111VmaKa]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

Guidelines

On the basis of the results of the Consensus Conference we propose the following guidelines in the GrPS clinical and imaging evaluation:
Step 1: Patient history completed by the HAGOS questionnaire. Both patient anamnesis and the compilation of HAGOS questionnaire must be made before clinical assessment. The anamnesis must be based on a thorough interview with the patient and a careful examination of his previous medical documentation.
Step 2: Clinical assessment mainly based on clinical tests proposed in the document 2 of the Consensus Conference (Clinical evaluation document consensus).
Step 3: Imaging evaluation. In GrPS due to functional overload and in LSGrPS it is strongly recommended to adopt the whole imaging routine examinations presented in the third document of the Consensus Conference (Imaging document consensus). In GrPS of traumatic origin the clinician/s may adopt a reduced imaging routine (in the flow chart, the possibility of choice among the various imaging tests is indicated with the dashed line).
Step 4: Formulation of the diagnosis based on the information collected in step 1, 2 and 3. If possible the diagnosis should be based on one, or more than one, of the 63 diseases listed in the document 1 of the Consensus Conference (Diagnostic classification document consensus).
Step 5: If the formulation of the diagnosis is impossible the patient may be advised for further diagnostic tests.
Step 6: Depending on the additional information obtained from step 5 (together with the information taken from the previous steps) the clinician(s) can make a diagnosis and advise the patient regarding the correct therapeutic procedure.

The above guidelines are shown in the flow chart represented in figure 2.

Figure 2

In the case in which it is possible to have a diagnosis the patient may be advised for a conservative or surgical treatment. In the case in which a diagnosis is not reached the patient may be advised for further diagnostic investigations (ie, blood tests, urine test, CT, scintigraphy etc) in order to obtain diagnosis and decide the treatment pathway.

### Femoral pseudoaneurysms after percutaneous access [^1177jL7t]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The femoral artery has been the primary percutaneous-based arterial access site for coronary artery catheterizations for more than three decades. Noncardiac percutaneous-based procedures have also been performed primarily with femoral access and have increased in number exponentially by vascular specialists in past decades. Groin complications are infrequent in incidence after femoral arterial access for cardiac and peripheral diagnostic and interventional cases, with groin hematomas and pseudoaneurysms being the most common. Until ultrasound-based treatment modalities became the mainstay of treatment, vascular surgeons were the primary specialty managing pseudoaneurysms, but now other specialties also manage these cases. This review outlines the clinical implications and current issues relevant to understanding the ideal treatment strategy for this common complication.

Objective

Groin pain in elite athletes is a common yet challenging diagnostic and management dilemma for the sports clinician, accounting for a significant proportion of athletic injuries. It is often debilitating and, if severe enough, may compromise an athlete's career. Traditionally, groin pain has been poorly understood by radiologists.

Conclusion

A major reason groin pain has been misunderstood is the complexity of the anatomy of this region, which this article discusses in detail in an effort to inform the reader.

Future directions

The weak point of this Consensus Conference was the paucity and lack of high-quality studies present in the literature. This represented a problem concerning scientific support to substantiate and validate the experts' various opinions. For this reason the conclusions of this Consensus Conference do not represent evidence, but rather guidelines.

The relatively small number of female participants in the present literature could theoretically be a limitation for the applicability of the data described above to a female population. Further studies focused on female population are needed.

Finally, we would like to point out the need for future multidisciplinary Consensus Conferences that could help to further clarify this difficult field of study.

### Multidetector CT of iatrogenic and self-inflicted vascular lesions and infections at the groin [^1164SxbL]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Expected CT appearance following uncomplicated percutaneous access to the right common femoral artery (CFA) in two different patients. In an 82-year-old diabetic female patient, 48 h after coronary angiography (CA) and coronary artery stenting, focused precontrast (A) and arterial-phase (B) CT images showed mild fat stranding and fluid (thin arrows) along the probable puncture tract, abutting the ventral aspect of the calcified but patent CFA (arrowheads). The day after CA, in a 90-year-old female patient, CT-angiography (C, D) showed similar changes (thin arrows) surrounding the CFA (arrowhead) and high-attenuation fascial blood (arrows), which did not require treatment

From the injured CFA, post-catheterisation haemorrhage may either collect locally at the groin (Fig. 2), or extend downwards in the adductor or quadriceps thigh muscles (Fig. 3) or upwards in the pelvis (Fig. 4). The imaging diagnosis of haematoma relies on the identification of its characteristic precontrast hyperattenuation: hyperacute blood measures 40–60 Hounsfield Units (HU) due to its high protein content, which becomes even denser (60.80 HU) from clotting within a few hours and thus appears hyperdense compared to normal muscles. The involved muscles may be more or less enlarged compared to the contralateral ones. Subsequently, progressive haemoglobin lysis leads to a characteristic mixed-density appearance including geographic areas of lower attenuation and fluid-fluid levels (the so-called "haematocrit sign") corresponding to different blood components stratified because of dependent settling of denser cellular elements.

### Hemorrhagic complications after prasugrel (effient) therapy for vascular neurointerventional procedures [^115ZRT7S]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patient demographics, procedure type, and pre- and post-procedural antiplatelet regimens were recorded. Charts were analyzed for all procedural neurointerventional complications. Hemorrhagic complications were defined according to the previously published Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction criteria. Specifically, major bleeding was defined as intracerebral hemorrhage or clinically overt bleeding (including imaging) associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 5 g/dl; minor bleeding was defined as any clinically overt bleeding (including imaging) associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of 3–5 g/dl. Groin hematomas without hemodynamic alterations not requiring a blood transfusion and mild, self-limiting episodes of epistaxis were not included as hemorrhagic complications.

Statistical analyses were performed using a Student's two tailed t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate for continuous variables and a Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.

### Outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy for patients with stroke presenting with low Alberta stroke program early computed tomography score in the early and extended window [^114x8hpZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Data Collection and Clinical Outcome

Collected data included baseline demographic characteristics, location of occlusion, baseline core infarct as determined by the ASPECTS, time from symptom onset to groin puncture, MT technique, procedure time, thrombectomy passes, devices used, rescue therapy used, complications, and final modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia score. Patients with an ASPECTS of 2 to 5 were divided into early window and extended window groups. Baseline imaging, recanalization rates, and postprocedural imaging were reviewed by local investigators at each participating site. Successful recanalization was defined as a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia score of 2B or more. The 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was used as the primary outcome measure and was recorded during a follow-up visit or telephone encounter at a mean (SD) of 90 (14) days after stroke by a stroke neurologist or registered nurse. Favorable outcome was defined as an mRS score of 0 to 2 at 90 days. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as postprocedural hemorrhage with an associated decrease of 4 points or more in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score.

Statistical Analysis

We used descriptive statistics to report patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, using median (IQR) values for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. The characteristics of the 2 groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann-Whitney) test and the χ² test as appropriate. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the factors associated with 90-day outcomes for all patients undergoing MT who presented with ICA or M1 occlusion, and interaction terms between an ASPECTS of 2 to 5 and receipt of MT in the extended window were used. Variables included in the regression model include age, location of occlusion, admission NIHSS score, intravenous thrombolysis, successful recanalization, an ASPECTS of 2 to 5, and treatment in the extended window. Finally, to assess whether the association between an ASPECTS of 2 to 5 and a favorable outcome is modified by the center in which the thrombectomy was performed, we used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. All P values were from 2-sided tests, and results were deemed statistically significant at P < .05.

### Minimum reporting standards for clinical research on groin pain in athletes [^113saio1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

While X-ray is frequently used in clinical practice to 'exclude bony abnormalities', most authors who have examined the role of X-ray have found bony abnormalities to be frequent. The clinical significance of many of these findings is unknown. As is the case for MRI and ultrasound studies, describing the way findings are defined and recorded, along with the reliability of the assessment, needs to be undertaken to investigate the clinical meaning of the abnormalities commonly found on X-ray.

In summary, there are few resources available to help guide minimal reporting standards with regard to imaging. The Copenhagen Standardized MRI protocolprovides a detailed description of the protocols used, gives a clearly defined assessment of abnormalities, and has fair-to-moderate reliability for the majority of findings. At the present time, we are not aware of detailed descriptions of reliable techniques for any imaging modality to assess for abnormalities of the adductors, iliopsoas or inguinal region (with the exception of hernias). Future studies should aim to develop these techniques, so that the clinical relevance of the abnormalities commonly found on imaging can be examined. Key considerations for the reporting on radiology are outlined in figure 5.

### Necrotising pancreatitis presenting as a painful mass in the groin and sepsis [^113mXkGm]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is typically associated with classical clinical and radiological features. The sensitivity of CT to diagnose acute pancreatitis depends on the severity of the attack and ranges from 77% to 92% with a specificity approaching 100%. Despite the fact this is a common disease, there are myriad clinical presentations of acute pancreatitis. We report herein an especially rare presentation where severe acute necrotising pancreatitis presented with a tender inguinoscrotal swelling with a normal pancreas on CT imaging.

### Emergency computed tomography for acute pelvic trauma: where is the bleeder? [^112srNen]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Contrast medium extravasation at computed tomography (CT) is an accurate indicator of active haemorrhage in pelvic trauma. When this is present, potentially lifesaving surgical or endovascular treatment should be considered. Identification of the site or territory of haemorrhage is helpful for the interventional radiologist as it allows for focused angiographic evaluation and expedites haemostatic angio-embolisation. Even with thin-section arterial phase CT, tracing the bleeding vessel is not always possible and is often time consuming. We introduce a technique for predicting the bleeding vessel based on knowledge of the cross-sectional anatomical territory of the vessel as an alternative to tracing the vessel's course. Several case examples with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) correlation will be provided.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^111732to]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Symptoms of pericarditis typically persist up to a week after ablation (Table 5). If symptoms persist for > 1 week or are associated with lightheadedness or shortness of breath, further evaluation is warranted. Groin pain that persists past 7 days or is getting worse should prompt a physical exam and vascular ultrasound to exclude femoral access complications. A persistent nagging dry cough might also be observed for up to 6 weeks after ablation. This complication is more common with CB than with RF ablation and is likely related to direct bronchial or lung injury. This type of cough is generally treated with antitussives and will typically subside over 4–6 weeks.

Some patients, particularly those with a history of migraines, might experience migraine headaches in the first few weeks after ablation. These headaches might be related to the residual ASD present after transseptal puncture and will typically improve over several weeks. Hemoptysis is rare but might result from pneumonia or pulmonary infarction due to an occluded PV, typically occurring 3–6 months after ablation. Dysphagia in the first days after ablation is most likely related to irritation from transesophageal echocardiography or intubation. If dysphagia persists, then imaging (chest CT or MRI) should be performed to exclude an AEF (see late complications). The differential diagnosis of dyspnea occurring early after ablation should include volume overload, pneumonia, or PN injury as outlined above. A chest roentgenogram should be obtained. If symptoms persist with a normal chest roentgenogram, we should also consider PV stenosis (see late symptoms, below). Vagal denervation of the esophagus or stomach can occur after ablation due to ablation lesions placed in the vicinity of the esophagus, particularly if extensive ablation is performed along the LA posterior wall. Symptoms can include nausea and early satiety. Patients should be advised to eat small, frequent meals. Symptoms will typically improve over 4–6 weeks. If symptoms are profound or persist, a gastric emptying study can be diagnostic. Pain at the site of sheath insertion can result from an pseudoaneurysm, an AV fistula, or a hematoma. Evaluation usually starts with a vascular ultrasound. Bloodwork and a CT scan might be appropriate.

### Imaging of groin masses: inguinal anatomy and pathologic conditions revisited [^113ohymS]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

The groin region is subdivided into two distinct anatomic areas: the inguinal canal and the femoral triangle. A series of cross-sectional imaging cases illustrate that a good understanding of the local anatomic characteristics of the groin allows confident characterization of groin pathologic conditions. Such conditions can be classified into five major groups: congenital abnormalities, noncongenital hernias, vascular conditions, infectious or inflammatory processes, and neoplasms. Congenital entities include hernias, cysts, undescended testis, and retractile testes. Ultrasound (US) is useful in depicting these conditions. In the second group, noncongenital hernias, US allows visualization of bowel loops in peristalsis within the hernia. Herniography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are also helpful in diagnosis. Among vascular conditions, false aneurysms may be detected from the turbulent flow through the tract at Doppler US. The characteristic venous flow of varicoceles is best diagnosed with US during the Valsalva maneuver. Infectious or inflammatory conditions include, among others, hematomas, which appear hyperattenuating at CT and have variable appearances, depending on the age of the blood products, at MR imaging. The origins of neoplasms may be assessed at CT and MR imaging, although appearances of solid tumors are relatively nonspecific.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging phases — timing and purpose are outlined as follows: the unenhanced (or nonenhanced) phase occurs when imaging is performed without intravenous (IV) contrast; the arterial phase imaging occurs approximately 20–40 seconds after the start of IV contrast injection and allows better differentiation of the arteries and veins; the portal venous phase occurs approximately 70 seconds after the start of IV contrast injection with brighter and more homogeneous organ enhancement and is the typical phase used for general evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis; the delayed phase typically occurs 3–10 minutes after the start of IV contrast injection, is used primarily to detect urinary extravasation, and is also useful in detecting active bleeding.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® newly diagnosed palpable scrotal abnormality [^114Yknyv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Palpable scrotal abnormalities are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from indolent benign conditions to aggressive tumors, and infectious and vascular processes. In these patients the diagnostic workup typically begins with a complete clinical, history, and physical examinations, including analysis of risk factors. If imaging is required, ultrasound examination is the diagnostic modality of choice. In few select patients with very large scrotal masses, MRI may be appropriate. However, the use of gadolinium-based contrast should be evaluated critically depending on specific patient factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Groin complications in endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: a 10-year single center experience [^111ErmEq]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Our cohort of patients is similar to those described in other international stroke trials, with 12.7% on anticoagulation on admission and 5.9% of total patients having an INR > 1.7. Our puncture site complication rate was slightly less than that reported by Applegate and colleagueswho summarized complications of Angioseal deployment in 3898 patients. This retrospective study demonstrated a minor complication (hematoma, arteriovenous fistula, or pseudo-aneurysm) rate of 0.8% and major complication (vascular death, vascular repair, vessel occlusion, or bleeding with > 3 g hemoglobin drop) rate in 0.6% of patients.

In our study, the number of groin complications was too low to meaningfully infer possible relationships between groin complications and anticoagulation, thrombolysis, antiplatelet therapy and type of closure device use. Being that all groin punctures and closure device deployments were performed by neurointerventional attending physicians, it is conceivable that practitioner experience may have played a role. Weaknesses of the study include a single-center retrospective design and its reliance on accurate medical record keeping and coding that could have resulted in a reduced retrospective detection rate. This was in part mitigated this by carefully reviewing all clinical, radiological and blood bank records associated with the patients' admission for stroke treatment. Lastly, this analysis excluded non-clinically significant hematomas and does not represent the rate of minor groin hematoma complications.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^116Y8gMh]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Pelvic fracture hemorrhage — AE (angioembolization) plays an important role in controlling life-threatening hemorrhage from pelvic fracture, and all facilities need a protocol for the management of patients with pelvic fractures that includes a PI process because time to AE impacts outcome; consider AE as initial treatment for patients with a pelvic injury stabilized by a sheet or binder who are still hemodynamically unstable and have no indication for laparotomy or other source of hemorrhage, and AE may be performed in combination with pelvic reduction with local resource availability considered; if the patient's pelvis is adequately stabilized with a sheet or binder, hardware fixation is not immediately necessary; in addition, consider AE in all patients with pelvic fracture and contrast extravasation on CT scan, regardless of hemodynamics, repeat AE for patients who have previously undergone AE of the pelvis and have ongoing hemorrhage, and also consider AE for patients with pelvic fracture who have undergone pre-peritoneal packing and have ongoing hemorrhage; when possible, perform selective angiography of the bleeding vessel, but in cases of severe injury or diffuse pelvic bleeding this may not be possible, in which case embolization of the entire internal iliac system can be performed; arterial bleeding is intermittent and may not be apparent at arteriography, and when no arterial extravasation is seen the decision for prophylactic AE is made on several factors; patients not embolized who show ongoing hemorrhage may require repeat angiographic imaging and AE, and elderly patients with a negative angiogram should be treated more aggressively with AE than younger individuals due to lower cardiovascular reserve.
