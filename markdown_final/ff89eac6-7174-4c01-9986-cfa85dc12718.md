## Question

Promethazine dose for insomina

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about whether promethazine should be used for insomnia, what dose might be appropriate if it is used off-label, and how to reconcile this with guideline-based care and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether promethazine has any FDA-approved indication for insomnia. Then, I should verify what major insomnia guidelines say about first-generation antihistamines and whether promethazine is specifically addressed. Next, I will examine the FDA labeling for sedative dosing ranges and duration to infer a pragmatic, safety-conscious bedtime dose if used off-label. After that, I need to weigh efficacy, safety, and tolerability, especially in older adults and those with respiratory risk. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, time-limited recommendation and outline preferred, evidence-based alternatives with dosing and monitoring guidance.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status. Promethazine is not FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia; its labeled uses include sedation, antiemesis, motion sickness, and adjunctive therapy in anesthesia, but not chronic insomnia, so any use for sleep would be off-label and should be justified by patient-specific circumstances and shared decision-making [^116kHg8h] [^112niwNR] [^111TcXfa].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines say about first-generation antihistamines for insomnia. The AASM 2017 guideline recommends against diphenhydramine for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, and although promethazine is not explicitly named, it shares the same mechanistic class and anticholinergic burden, so the recommendation generalizes to nonselective antihistamines. The VA/DoD 2025 guideline explicitly advises avoiding diphenhydramine for chronic insomnia disorder, and the European insomnia guideline recommends not using antihistamines for insomnia, reinforcing a class-wide caution rather than a single-agent exception [^115hNB3D] [^1169qznJ] [^112LXd24] [^112jHcfV] [^1154fbCW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check whether any high-quality evidence supports promethazine for insomnia. I need to ensure I'm not missing randomized trials, but the AASM and VA/DoD evidence reviews do not identify robust RCTs supporting antihistamines for chronic insomnia, and the VA/DoD notes that evidence for first-generation antihistamines is unsupported by rigorous data, which aligns with the broader literature noting minimal supportive data and meaningful safety concerns for antihistamines as hypnotics [^112Fxg5n] [^114VC2eW].

> Next, I should review what the FDA labeling actually provides for sedative dosing, since that is the closest labeled analogue to bedtime use. Multiple FDA sources indicate that adults usually require 25 to 50 mg for nighttime sedation, with onset within about 20 minutes and duration of 4 to 6 hours, though effects may persist up to 12 hours in some patients. This pharmacokinetic profile suggests that 25 mg at bedtime is a reasonable starting point if, despite guideline cautions, a clinician elects a short-term, off-label trial for insomnia, with careful attention to next-day residual effects [^112niwNR] [^1165RDM6] [^116b4wU5] [^1112ZrW2].

> I should double-check geriatric and safety caveats before proposing any dose. The FDA warns that sedating drugs may cause confusion and oversedation in older adults, so dose selection should start at the low end and be titrated cautiously; promethazine also carries risks of extrapyramidal symptoms, paradoxical reactions, and rare but serious respiratory depression, and it is contraindicated in children under 2 years due to fatal respiratory depression risk, underscoring class-wide vulnerability in those with compromised respiration or high anticholinergic sensitivity [^111wxHNg] [^114ZvgZS] [^1147aqRP].

> Let me consider comparative safety signals from related agents to calibrate risk. Diphenhydramine 50 mg showed minimal clinically significant benefit for insomnia and produced next-day psychomotor impairment in driving simulations, with tolerance to sedative effects developing within 3 to 4 days; given promethazine's greater anticholinergic and antidopaminergic activity, similar or greater impairments are plausible, reinforcing a conservative stance and a strict time limit if used at all [^112LWDHQ] [^1169qznJ].

> I will now examine preferred, evidence-based pharmacotherapies so I can offer concrete alternatives. For sleep onset, short-acting options like zaleplon 10 mg, ramelteon 8 mg, or carefully dosed zolpidem are guideline-supported. For sleep maintenance, low-dose doxepin 3–6 mg or suvorexant 10–20 mg have supportive data, with eszopiclone 2–3 mg effective across onset and maintenance. Dosing should be individualized, with lower starting doses in older adults and close monitoring for next-day impairment and adverse effects [^113YDsT9] [^1141nm63] [^111dLQ3K] [^113dXzuS] [^116KPbUi] [^115CMGD8].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on promethazine for another indication and finds it helps with sleep; should I insist on switching? I should confirm that shared decision-making includes counseling on off-label status, limited efficacy data, anticholinergic burden, and fall risk, and if a cautious trial is pursued, it should be short-term, ideally no more than a few days to a week, with reassessment of benefit and harms, and a plan to transition to guideline-supported therapy or behavioral strategies such as CBT-I for durable benefit [^112LWDHQ] [^113a8TLf].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise and safety-focused. If promethazine is used off-label for insomnia despite guideline cautions, a pragmatic starting dose is 25 mg orally at bedtime, with a maximum of 50 mg if needed and tolerated, used short-term only, with explicit avoidance in patients with respiratory compromise, older adults at high fall risk, or those on other CNS depressants. Monitor for next-day sedation, confusion, anticholinergic effects, and paradoxical reactions, and discontinue promptly if adverse effects emerge or if there is no clear benefit within a few nights [^112niwNR] [^111wxHNg] [^1147aqRP].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. Promethazine lacks FDA approval for insomnia, major guidelines advise against first-generation antihistamines for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy and meaningful safety concerns, and if a clinician elects a short, off-label trial, 25 mg at bedtime is a reasonable starting point with strict time limits and vigilant monitoring, while prioritizing evidence-based hypnotics and behavioral treatments for sustained management [^116kHg8h] [^115hNB3D] [^112LXd24] [^112jHcfV] [^112niwNR].

Promethazine is not recommended for insomnia because of **limited efficacy** and **significant safety concerns** [^112Fxg5n] [^112jHcfV]. If used off-label, the typical adult dose is **25–50 mg PO at bedtime** [^112niwNR]; start at 25 mg in older adults or those at risk of sedation or falls [^112niwNR] [^111wxHNg]. Avoid use in patients with **respiratory disorders**, **glaucoma**, or **urinary retention**, and limit use to short-term only due to risks of tolerance, cognitive impairment, and next-day sedation [^112LWDHQ].

---

## Recommended dosage for insomnia (off-label use)

- **Standard adult dose**: 25–50 mg orally at bedtime [^112niwNR].
- **Geriatric or sensitive patients**: Start at 12.5–25 mg to minimize sedation and fall risk [^113RgWGS].
- **Maximum dose**: 50 mg per night; avoid exceeding this due to increased adverse effects.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use in insomnia

Evidence supporting promethazine for insomnia is **limited and low quality**; no robust RCTs demonstrate meaningful benefit, and guidelines do not recommend it for this purpose [^112Fxg5n] [^112jHcfV].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

Promethazine has a **significant adverse effect profile**, particularly with repeated or high-dose use:

- **Central nervous system**: Drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, paradoxical excitation [^114ZvgZS].
- **Respiratory**: Respiratory depression, especially in children, patients with respiratory disorders, or when combined with CNS depressants [^1147aqRP].
- **Cardiovascular**: Hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia [^116CYu4j].
- **Anticholinergic effects**: Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation [^notfound].
- **Geriatric considerations**: Increased risk of confusion, falls, and cognitive impairment [^notfound].

## Comparison with other insomnia medications

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Promethazine | Limited evidence | - Significant anticholinergic <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Respiratory depression | Not recommended |
| Diphenhydramine | Limited efficacy | - Anticholinergic <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Tolerance | Not recommended [^112LWDHQ] |
| Doxepin (3–6 mg) | Effective for maintenance | - Minimal anticholinergic <br/> - Low abuse potential | Recommended [^113dXzuS] |
| Zolpidem | Effective for onset/maintenance | - Sedation <br/> - Dependence <br/> - Complex sleep behaviors | Recommended with caution [^111dLQ3K] |
| Eszopiclone | Effective for onset/maintenance | - Sedation <br/> - Dependence <br/> - Headache | Recommended with caution [^115CMGD8] |

---

## Special populations and precautions

- **Pediatric patients**: Contraindicated in children under 2 years due to risk of fatal respiratory depression [^1147aqRP].
- **Pregnant women**: Use only if clearly needed; weigh risks and benefits.
- **Elderly patients**: Start low and go slow; monitor closely for sedation, confusion, and falls [^111wxHNg].
- **Patients with respiratory disorders**: Avoid due to risk of respiratory depression [^1147aqRP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **AASM**: Does not recommend promethazine for insomnia due to limited evidence and safety concerns [^notfound].
- **VA/DoD**: Recommends against first-generation antihistamines, including promethazine, for chronic insomnia [^112LXd24].
- **BAP**: Recommends against nonselective antihistamines for insomnia [^112jHcfV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Promethazine is **not recommended for insomnia** because of limited efficacy and significant safety concerns. If used off-label, limit the dose to 25–50 mg PO at bedtime, start low in older adults, and use short-term only. Prefer guideline-supported options such as doxepin, zolpidem, or eszopiclone, and avoid promethazine in patients with respiratory disorders, glaucoma, or urinary retention.

### Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: meta-analysis of data submitted to the food and drug administration [^1124QcLa]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (Z drugs) and associated placebo responses in adults and to evaluate potential moderators of effectiveness in a dataset used to approve these drugs.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Source

US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Study Selection

Randomised double blind parallel placebo controlled trials of currently approved Z drugs (eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem).

Data Extraction

Change score from baseline to post-test for drug and placebo groups; drug efficacy analysed as the difference of both change scores. Weighted raw and standardised mean differences with their confidence intervals under random effects assumptions for polysomnographic and subjective sleep latency, as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included waking after sleep onset, number of awakenings, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep quality. Weighted least square regression analysis was used to explain heterogeneity of drug effects.

Data Synthesis

13 studies containing 65 separate drug-placebo comparisons by type of outcome, type of drug, and dose were included. Studies included 4378 participants from different countries and varying drug doses, lengths of treatment, and study years. Z drugs showed significant, albeit small, improvements (reductions) in our primary outcomes: polysomnographic sleep latency (weighted standardised mean difference, 95% confidence interval -0.57 to -0.16) and subjective sleep latency (-0.33, -0.62 to -0.04) compared with placebo. Analyses of weighted mean raw differences showed that Z drugs decreased polysomnographic sleep latency by 22 minutes (-33 to -11 minutes) compared with placebo. Although no significant effects were found in secondary outcomes, there were insufficient studies reporting these outcomes to allow firm conclusions. Moderator analyses indicated that sleep latency was more likely to be reduced in studies published earlier, with larger drug doses, with longer duration of treatment, with a greater proportion of younger and/or female patients, and with zolpidem.

Conclusion

Compared with placebo, Z drugs produce slight improvements in subjective and polysomnographic sleep latency, especially with larger doses and regardless of type of drug. Although the drug effect and the placebo response were rather small and of questionable clinical importance, the two together produced to a reasonably large clinical response.

Other agents for primary insomnia — limited or excluded evidence: For oxazepam, a crossover study of oxazepam 25 mg versus placebo in 28 patients with "insomnia" found subjective interval ratings showed a significant reduction in sleep latency (SL) and significant improvement in quality of sleep (QOS). A quetiapine placebo-controlled study included only 13 subjects; numerical increases in subjective total sleep time (TST) and decreases in subjective SL were not statistically significant. A gabapentin open-label investigation with 18 subjects and no placebo control was excluded. For paroxetine, one variable-dosage trial in 15 patients without placebo was excluded, and another randomized study in 27 older adults evaluated paroxetine 10 mg/20 mg versus placebo with doses pooled for analysis.

### Sedative drug prescription patterns in Danish adults from 2002 through 2021. A register-based cohort study [^112Q1E25]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pharmacological treatment strategies for insomnia seem to vary, and there is lack of knowledge about how sedative drugs are used in a real-world setting. We investigated changes in sedative drug prescription patterns in Danish adults who initiated treatment between 2002 and 2016.

Methods

All adults with a first-time purchase of a sedative drug registered in the Danish National Prescription Register from 2002 through 2016 were followed for five years between 2002 and 2021 for subsequent prescriptions of sedative drugs, death, or emigration. Sedative drugs were classified into anxiolytic benzodiazepines (N05BA), hypnotic benzodiazepines (N05CD), Z-drugs (N05CF), melatonin (N05CH01), promethazine (R06AD), and low-dose quetiapine (N05AH04). Analyses were stratified on time: 2002–2006, 2007–2011, and 2012–2016.

Results

A total of 842,880 individuals purchased their first sedative drug between 2002 and 2016. Most of them (40.0%) initiated treatment between 2002 and 2006, whereas 29.2% initiated treatment in 2012–2016. In 2002–2006, anxiolytic benzodiazepines (46.4%), Z-drugs (42.8%), and hypnotic benzodiazepines (5.4%) were the most common first treatment. This pattern changed over time with a gradual increase in the use of melatonin, promethazine, and low-dose quetiapine, which in 2011–2016 accounted for 27% of all first treatments. During the five years from first prescription, around 27% shifted to a different sedative drug. This percentage increased slightly over time, but over time the first shift to another drug class was most often to a Z-drug or anxiolytic benzodiazepine. Few individuals (5.8%) had more than one shift and the third choice seemed randomly distributed across all other drug classes.

Conclusion

Sedative drug prescriptions are distributed on different drug classes, with Z-drugs and anxiolytic benzodiazepines as the most frequent first treatment, and second choice in case of shift.

### The treatment of chronic insomnia: drug indications, chronic use and abuse liability. summary of a 2001 new clinical drug evaluation unit meeting symposium [^114VC2eW]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

This paper summarizes a group of presentations and panel discussions on chronic insomnia at the 2001 NCDEU meeting. The presentations and discussions focused on the twin issues of efficacy and concerns of abuse liability with long-term hypnotic therapy. The panel concluded that insomnia may be an epidemiological marker for a variety of difficulties including accidents, increased health care utilization and subsequent development of major depression. Whether or not treatment of insomnia will prevent these long-term problems has not yet been determined. Since the mid-1980s there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia. Some participants expressed concern at the lack of data for this practice, particularly the absence of dose-response and tolerance information, and noted that the small amount of efficacy data available is not encouraging. Similarly, there are minimal data to support the use of antihistamines as sleep aids; moreover, their side effect profile and interactions with other drugs may be under appreciated. The limited data available on nightly long-term usage of the newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, primarily of six-months' duration, suggest an absence of tolerance, but more data for both nightly and non-nightly administration are needed. Insomniacs tend to show therapy-seeking, rather than drug-seeking behavior, and patients without histories of drug abuse are unlikely to self-escalate dosage of currently available hypnotics. There is fairly good agreement on the characteristics of an ideal hypnotic. All currently available agents, while effective and safe, do not achieve this ideal. The next few years are likely to see the appearance of a variety of agents with new and promising mechanisms of action.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116h4D8y]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — adverse events and patient preference considerations explains that beyond the quality of evidence for or against use of a given drug for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, the task force also considered the relative benefit:harm ratio and the likelihood that an informed patient would use a specific agent, and that assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events often rely on spontaneous reporting by research participants with frequencies so low that reported studies are underpowered to find a difference from placebo. It adds that this implies the effect size for a TEAE would be very small and that it is unlikely the clinical significance of TEAEs has been underestimated, but some TEAEs are very infrequent yet very serious when they occur (for example, sleep-related behaviors with BzRA), clinical trials are likely to underestimate such risks due to the limited number of patients and limited duration of treatment, and as a result assessment of potential harms is largely derived from clinical experience and theoretical considerations rather than well-documented evidence; additionally, the task force judged likelihood of patient use and in most cases these judgments were in agreement with recommendations, while in certain cases (e.g., melatonin) informed patients may be likely to use a specific drug even when data do not clearly support a recommendation for use.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^11614ihX]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Guideline recommendation scope and strength — these analyses yield recommendations for use of a limited number of drugs for a limited number of specific indications such as sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance, and in all cases the recommendations are "weak", based on relatively limited and/or low quality evidence; many agents shown to be "statistically significantly superior" to placebo may nonetheless be "not recommended", reflecting differences between FDA criteria and the GRADE approach, which establishes evidence quality ratings and clinical significance thresholds not used in individual studies or FDA approval, and each prescriber bears responsibility for treatment determinations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^117DMi1h]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotics for chronic insomnia disorder — quetiapine risks and monitoring: Evidence on using low-dose quetiapine is limited to a few studies and case series with short duration, small sample sizes, and vague and incomplete details, making efficacy inconclusive. Doses typically used for insomnia are lower than the FDA-recommended dosage of 150–800 mg/day, and all antipsychotics, including low-dose quetiapine, are known for causing harms; quetiapine has a black box warning indicating a 1.6 to 1.7 fold increase in mortality in elderly populations with dementia-related psychosis. All antipsychotics carry a strong recommendation in the 2023 Beers Criteria to avoid their use in the elderly except in schizophrenia or bipolar disorders due to an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident and a greater rate of cognitive decline and mortality in persons with dementia; anticholinergic effects, including sedating and hypotensive effects, occur with all antipsychotics in varying frequency and severity. It is advised that routine monitoring of metabolic parameters be conducted with all antipsychotics due to the risk of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain, and active-duty service member use of an antipsychotic may affect deploy ability.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia? [^115tVjP6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. Reasons for preferential prescription of these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may include a desire to treat concurrent sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication, and/or an attempt to avoid hypnotic drugs due to their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed to treat insomnia. In addition, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles themselves. Here we review the pertinent research studies published in recent years on antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate in the treatment of sleep issues in specific well-defined populations.

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Inform patients that the use of Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Instruct patients not to share Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution with others and to take steps to protect Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution from theft or misuse.

Important Dosing and Administration Instructions

Instruct patients how to measure and take the correct dose of Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution. Advise patients to measure Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution with an accurate milliliter measuring device. Patients should be informed that a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage. Advise patients to ask their pharmacist to recommend an appropriate measuring device and for instructions for measuring the correct dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Advise patients not to increase the dose or dosing frequency of Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution because serious adverse events such as respiratory depression may occur with overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^112LWDHQ]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia — first-generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine) efficacy and safety: An industry-sponsored, multicenter trial compared diphenhydramine (50 mg) with a valerian-hops preparation for 28 nights in 184 adults (average age 44.3 years), and pooled trials reported a mean difference of 2.47 minutes (95% CI -8.17–3.23 minutes) for subjective sleep latency and a 17.86 minutes increase (95% CI -3.79–39.51) in subjective total sleep time (sTST) with diphenhydramine versus placebo; only one trial assessed sleep efficiency, where subjective mean sleep efficiency increased 4.6% (1.44% to 7.88% higher) from baseline to week two in the diphenhydramine group relative to placebo. Safety data using first-generation antihistamines long-term for chronic insomnia disorder was not available, and the 2023 Beers Criteria carries a strong recommendation to avoid using these agents in older adults; tolerance to sedative effects has been noted after three to four days of continuous use. In performance studies, no differences between the morning-after psychomotor impairment and morning-after memory impairment was seen with diphenhydramine compared to baseline in one trial, but in a driving simulator diphenhydramine (50 mg) for one week impaired driving, including lane keeping, in drivers aged 25 to 44 years to a greater extent than alcohol (approximately 0.1% blood alcohol concentration), and self-reported drowsiness was not a good predictor of impairment.

Quazepam — randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults with insomnia included seven studies; the methodologies were not comparable to the standard of data reporting required by GRADE and, therefore, no specific recommendation was made. Quazepam and its metabolites have long half-lives, raising concerns regarding accumulation and daytime impairment, and data regarding daytime sleepiness from these studies suggests a higher percentage of patients with somnolence in the active treatment group versus placebo, particularly at the 30 mg dosage.

The average effective dose of promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP for the active therapy of nausea and vomiting in children or adults is 25 mg. 12.5 to 25 mg doses may be repeated, as necessary, at 4 to 6 hour intervals.

For nausea and vomiting in children, the usual dose is 0.5 mg per pound of body weight, and the dose should be adjusted to the age and weight of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated.

For prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, as during surgery and the postoperative period, the average dose is 25 mg repeated at 4 to 6 hour intervals, as necessary.

Sedation

This product relieves apprehension and induces a quiet sleep from which the patient can be easily aroused. Administration of 12.5 to 25 mg promethazine hydrochloride orally at bedtime will provide sedation in children. Adults usually require 25 to 50 mg for nighttime, presurgical, or obstetrical sedation.

Pre- and Postoperative Use

Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP in 12.5 to 25 mg doses for children and 50 mg doses for adults the night before surgery relieves apprehension and produces a quiet sleep.

For preoperative medication, children require doses of 0.5 mg per pound of body weight in combination with an appropriately reduced dose of narcotic or barbiturate and the appropriate dose of an atropine-like drug. Usual adult dosage is 50 mg promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP with an appropriately reduced dose of narcotic or barbiturate and the required amount of a belladonna alkaloid.

Postoperative sedation and adjunctive use with analgesics may be obtained by the administration of 12.5 to 25 mg in children and 25 to 50 mg doses in adults.

Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are contraindicated for children under 2 years of age.

Approach and interpretation of recommendations — direction, strength, public comment, and definitions indicate that the task force assigned a direction (for or against) and strength (STRONG or WEAK) for each recommendation statement. Public input was solicited for a two-week period on the AASM website, and based on comments the task force decided to include data from clinicaltrials.gov, which allowed development of a recommendation for the use of suvorexant; due to a conflict of interest, a task force member did not participate in that recommendation. The guideline states it should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other reasonable methods, defines a STRONG recommendation as one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, always be following when pharmacological treatment is indicated, and states that a WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in appropriateness and requires that the clinician use his/her clinical knowledge and experience and refer to the individual patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of promethazine formulations did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of promethazine HCl suppositories and observed closely.

Zolpidem for the treatment of chronic insomnia — recommendation and evidence: We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK] Remarks: This recommendation is based on trials of 10 mg of zolpidem. Twelve RCTs evaluated zolpidem 10 mg for the treatment of chronic primary insomnia, and the overall quality of evidence was downgraded to very low due to significant heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of publication bias. The single paper reporting on extended-release zolpidem 6.25 mg found moderate reduction in PSG-determined WASO (based on only the first 6 h of sleep) and minimal improvement in LPS and SE at end-treatment, and data from the one study on zolpidem extended-release 12.5 mg found moderate reduction in PSG LPS with WASO also moderate while SE was not significantly different from placebo, with overall quality of evidence LOW due to imprecision and potential publication bias. Meta-analysis in studies employing zolpidem 10 mg reported small, but potentially significant increases in amnesia, dizziness and somnolence. Overall, the benefits of zolpidem 10 mg and extended-release zolpidem 12.5 mg were judged to be greater than the minimal potential harm, whereas benefits and harms were judged to be approximately equal for extended-release zolpidem 6.25 mg. For dosing safety, the FDA has subsequently lowered the recommended starting dosage of immediate-release zolpidem products from 10 mg to 5 mg, and has recommended a reduction of starting dosage for extended-release formulations of zolpidem from 12.5 mg to 6.25 mg.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (prometh with codeine) [^1159CpRL]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Codeine: Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, exert their primary effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The analgesic effects of codeine are due to its central action; however, the precise sites of action have not been determined, and the mechanisms involved appear to be quite complex. Codeine resembles morphine both structurally and pharmacologically, but its actions at the doses of codeine used therapeutically are milder, with less sedation, respiratory depression and gastrointestinal, urinary, and pupillary effects. Codeine produces an increase in biliary tract pressure, but less than morphine or meperidine. Codeine is less constipating than morphine.

Codeine has good antitussive activity, although less than that of morphine at equal doses. It is used in preference to morphine, because side effects are infrequent at the usual antitussive dose of codeine.

Codeine in oral therapeutic dosage does not usually exert major effects on the cardiovascular system.

Narcotic analgesics may cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ); however, they also depress the vomiting center, so that subsequent doses are unlikely to produce vomiting. Nausea is minimal after usual oral doses of codeine.

Narcotic analgesics cause histamine release, which appears to be responsible for wheals or urticaria sometimes seen at the site of injection on parenteral administration. Histamine release may also produce dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, with resultant flushing of the face and neck, pruritus, and sweating.

### Safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia [^116ZHYbR]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE (January 1990-November 2011) using the terms quetiapine, insomnia, sleep, low-dose, subtherapeutic, safety, and weight gain.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Two prospective trials were identified that evaluated the effect of quetiapine in primary insomnia. In addition, 2 retrospective cohort studies were identified that evaluated the safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia. Several case reports on adverse effects with low doses of the drug were also included.

Data Synthesis

Quetiapine is commonly used off-label for treatment of insomnia. When used for sleep, doses typically seen are less than the Food and Drug Administration-recommended dosage of 150–800 mg/day; those evaluated in the studies reviewed here were 25–200 mg/day). At recommended doses, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine are associated with metabolic adverse events (diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia). Adverse effects in the prospective trials were patient-reported and were minor, including drowsiness and dry mouth; however, the trials were limited by their small sample size and short duration. The retrospective cohort studies found that quetiapine was associated with significant increases in weight compared to baseline. Serious adverse events identified from case reports included fatal hepatotoxicity, restless legs syndrome, akathisia, and weight gain.

Conclusions

There are potential safety concerns when using low-dose quetiapine for treatment of insomnia. These concerns should be evaluated in further prospective studies. Based on limited data and potential safety concerns, use of low-dose quetiapine for insomnia is not recommended.

Respiratory Depression

Pediatrics

Promethazine hydrochloride injection should not be used in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age because of the potential for fatal respiratory depression. Post-marketing cases of respiratory depression, including fatalities, have been reported with use of promethazine in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. A wide range of weight-based doses of promethazine hydrochloride injection have resulted in respiratory depression in these patients.

Caution should be exercised when administering promethazine hydrochloride injection to pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. It is recommended that the lowest effective dose of promethazine hydrochloride injection be used in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Avoid concomitant administration of other drugs with respiratory depressant effects because of an association with respiratory depression, and sometimes death, in pediatric patients.

Other

Because of the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression, use of promethazine hydrochloride injection in patients with compromised respiratory function or patients at risk for respiratory failure (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea) should be avoided.

### Promethazine: a review of therapeutic uses and toxicity [^11381S3E]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Promethazine was first approved in 1951 and has since been used as a treatment option for a variety of indications. A histamine H 1 receptor competitive antagonist with antihistaminic, sedative, anti-kinetotic, antiemetic, and antimuscarinic effects, promethazine is utilized for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits.

Objective

This review of promethazine explores its pharmacology and history of toxicities, and discusses current recommendations from patient safety organizations, which implicate its role in therapy.

Discussion

Injectable promethazine utilization should take into consideration patient-specific factors, institutional policies, medication shortages of alternative agents, and the efficacy and toxicities of injectable promethazine itself. For decades, injectable promethazine has been associated with rare but serious limb-threatening adverse effects after extravasation or inadvertent intra-arterial injection. Patient safety organizations have called for hospitals to remove injectable promethazine from formularies, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acted in December of 2023 to change the product labeling, adding dilution and administration recommendations for intravenous administration and stating a preference for intramuscular administration.

Conclusion

Promethazine offers a suitable alternative antiemetic for use in the ED due to its distinct mechanism of action. Injectable promethazine, however, must be used with caution to minimize risk of serious patient harm in the event of intra-arterial or perivascular extravasation when given parenterally.

This recommendation is based on trials of 50 mg doses, and two RCTs evaluated diphenhydramine 50 mg with overall evidence weakly against effectiveness; the mean reduction in patient-reported sleep latency versus placebo and the small increase in total sleep time both fell below clinical significance, and none of the other objective or patient-reported outcomes reached clinical significance. No meta-analysis was possible for side effects, the task force judged benefits and harms to be approximately equal, and it determined that the majority of well-informed patients would not use diphenhydramine over no treatment.

### Insomnia: pharmacologic therapy [^116KiadC]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Insomnia accounts for more than 5.5 million visits to family physicians each year. Although behavioral interventions are the mainstay of treatment, pharmacologic therapy may be necessary for some patients. Understanding the risks and benefits of insomnia medications is critical. Controlled-release melatonin and doxepin are recommended as first-line agents in older adults; the so-called z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon) should be reserved for use if the first-line agents are ineffective. For the general population with difficulty falling asleep, controlled-release melatonin and the z-drugs can be considered. For those who have difficulty staying asleep, low-dose doxepin and the z-drugs should be considered. Benzodiazepines are not recommended because of their high abuse potential and the availability of better alternatives. Although the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant appears to be relatively effective, it is no more effective than the z-drugs and much more expensive. Sedating antihistamines, antiepileptics, and atypical antipsychotics are not recommended unless they are used primarily to treat another condition. Persons with sleep apnea or chronic lung disease with nocturnal hypoxia should be evaluated by a sleep specialist before sedating medications are prescribed.

Doxepin for the treatment of chronic insomnia — In adults with sleep maintenance insomnia, We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK] This recommendation is based on trials of 3 mg and 6 mg doses of doxepin. Four studies addressed the efficacy of doxepin 3 mg and four studies investigated the 6 mg dosage, with overall evidence graded as weakly in favor of improving sleep maintenance. Meta-analysis shows that polysomnography (PSG) and patient-reported sleep latency (SL) at 3 mg and PSG SL at 6 mg fell below the clinical significance threshold, while both PSG and subjective total sleep time (TST) at 3 mg and PSG TST at 6 mg were above significance thresholds, although subjective TST at 6 mg fell short. PSG data for reduction of wake after sleep onset (WASO) exceeded the clinical significance threshold at both dosages, although limited objective data for WASO at the 6 mg dosage fell below threshold based on two studies; the SMD in sleep quality for doxepin 3 mg suggests moderate improvement and for 6 mg suggests mild improvement. The objective sleep efficiency (SE) for both dosages exceeded the clinical significance level, while objective NOA fell short.

Sleep-promoting medications — evidence limitations and research needs — are characterized by overall quality of evidence that is relatively low in the vast majority of cases, with insufficient evidence for numerous drugs and highly variable, idiosyncratic data reporting that precludes comparing data from one study to another or conducting meta-analyses; virtually all studies of prescription hypnotic agents are industry-funded, and potential publication bias, particularly lack of publication of negative results, and the role of industry in study design and data analysis may compromise evidence quality and uniformity; with these limitations, the task force recommends for future investigations: clear definitions of inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequately powering studies to detect significant differences for key sleep variables, and development and utilization of uniform data collection instruments to improve cross-study analysis and comparisons.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — evidence grading and meta-analysis constraints states that quality of evidence grades for randomized clinical trials begin at HIGH and are downgraded progressively for heterogeneity, imprecision, and/or potential publication bias; since the vast majority of studies in this field are industry sponsored, the quality of evidence for nearly all of these studies is, therefore, reduced from HIGH to MODERATE, and when heterogeneity and imprecision are accounted for, the quality of evidence for many treatments considered is LOW or VERY LOW. Meta-analysis requires specific data (numerical data for a given outcome, presented as mean and standard deviation), many studies do not report data in the required format, resulting in exclusion of substantial amounts of data from the formal meta-analyses, and while these studies are discussed and considered in formulation of recommendations, the inability to include such data in meta-analysis represents a distinct limitation.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine guideline — suvorexant for chronic insomnia: Recommendation 1 states "We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK]" Remarks specify that "This recommendation is based on trials of 10, 15/20, and 20 mg doses of suvorexant". Evidence includes two randomized controlled trials: in a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study of adults 18–64 years, "Sixty-two subjects received 10 mg suvorexant and 61 received 20 mg", with inclusion criteria "LPS > 20 min and WASO > 60 min". In two randomized placebo-controlled parallel trials of 3 months, "Adults 18- to 64-years-old and adults > 65 with primary insomnia were included", with "Two-hundred fifty four and 239 patients" randomized to 15/20 mg; "The dosages of interest for this analysis were 20 mg for younger adults and 15 mg for older adults" and "Data for the two dosages were pooled for analysis". Objective outcomes noted that "Objective reports of wake after sleep onset (PSG) showed clinically significant reduction at both 10 mg and 20 mg dosages", while "Objective reports (PSG) at the 10 mg and 15/20 mg dosages showed minimal improvements in sleep latency that failed to meet clinical significance", but "objective reports (PSG) at 20 mg dose did show clinically significant reduction in sleep latency", with "PSG sleep efficiency (SE) results" near or above clinical significance, "PSG number of awakenings (NOA) was not statistically significantly reduced or increased", and "sleep quality ratings showed minimal change". Safety findings were that "Overall frequency of adverse events was not significantly increased versus placebo" and "There was no evidence of daytime residual or withdrawal symptoms", leading that "the task force judged the overall benefits to outweigh the potential harms" and "the task force determined that the majority of patients would use suvorexant over no treatment".

History of hypnotic usage — pharmacological agents have been used for insomnia throughout much of recorded history, with the first benzodiazepine (BZD) chlordiazepoxide introduced to the United States market in 1963, followed by diazepam. Flurazepam, the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved hypnotic BZD, became available in 1970 and rapidly supplanted barbiturates and similar compounds for treatment of insomnia. Zolpidem, the first United States nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist (non-BZD, BzRA), became available in 1992 and remains the most widely prescribed hypnotic medication, accounting for 87.5% of all BzRA prescriptions in a recent survey. Since 2005, ramelteon, low-dose doxepin, and suvorexant have entered the United States market.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112JJKpB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should, under most circumstances, follow. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty in the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients, but should not be construed as an indication of ineffectiveness. GRADE recommendation strengths do not refer to the magnitude of treatment effects in a particular patient, but rather, to the strength of evidence in published data. Downgrading the quality of evidence for these treatments is predictable in GRADE, due to the funding source for most pharmacological clinical trials and the attendant risk of publication bias; the relatively small number of eligible trials for each individual agent; and the observed heterogeneity in the data. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. We suggest that clinicians use suvorexant as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use eszopiclone as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zaleplon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use triazolam as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use temazepam as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use ramelteon as a treatment for sleep onset insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians use doxepin as a treatment for sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use trazodone as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tiagabine as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use melatonin as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use tryptophan as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK). We suggest that clinicians not use valerian as a treatment for sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. (WEAK).
