## Question

A nurse is assessing for compartment syndrome in a client who has a short leg cast. Which of the following findings should the nurse identify as a manifestation of this condition?
Bounding pedal pulse
- Capillary refill less than 2 seconds
Pain that increases with passive movement
Areas of warmth on the cast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which assessment finding best indicates compartment syndrome in a patient with a short leg cast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of acute compartment syndrome and how a tight cast contributes to it. Then, I should verify the classic clinical signs and which are most reliable early features. Next, I will examine each option against those criteria and explicitly check why distractors are misleading. Finally, I will synthesize the answer and note any caveats about late findings and pressure measurement thresholds to ensure clinical completeness [^115q2evU] [^113hYpof] [^1172KNDR].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: acute compartment syndrome is a rise in intracompartmental pressure within a closed myofascial space that reduces capillary perfusion, causing ischemia and nerve compression; a circumferential cast can act as an external constrictive shell that further elevates compartment pressure, especially with swelling, so I need to keep that mechanism front-of-mind as I interpret signs [^113HoMYq] [^114St5SR].

> Next, I should review the most reliable early clinical features; wait, let me verify the hierarchy before I rank options. Pain out of proportion to injury and pain with passive stretch of the involved muscles are consistently cited as the most sensitive early findings, whereas paresthesias, pallor, pulselessness, and paralysis are later and less reliable; I should double-check that emphasis on passive stretch pain because it is often the key discriminator early on [^113HoMYq] [^116FAhif] [^115q2evU].

> Now, Option A claims a bounding pedal pulse; hold on, I should verify whether pulses help early. Pulses are typically preserved in early compartment syndrome because arterial inflow pressure exceeds compartment pressure; pulselessness is a very late and uncommon sign, so a bounding pulse actually argues against early compartment syndrome rather than for it, making this a distractor [^112oBdSe] [^115q2evU].

> Option B states capillary refill less than 2 seconds; hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "less than 2 seconds" might be normal, but I should double-check the correct cutoff. Normal capillary refill in adults is generally less than 3 seconds, and a value under 2 seconds indicates brisk perfusion, not compromise; moreover, capillary refill is an unreliable marker for compartment syndrome and is often normal early, so this finding does not support the diagnosis and may even mislead toward reassuring perfusion when compartment pressure is high [^111LHdHk] [^1172KNDR].

> Option C proposes pain that increases with passive movement; let me consider whether this aligns with the early pathophysiology. Pain with passive stretch of the muscles within the involved compartment is a hallmark early sign because stretch aggravates ischemic muscle and compresses nerves; this is exactly the kind of pain that is out of proportion and worsens with passive motion, making it the most reliable bedside indicator among the choices provided [^113HoMYq] [^116FAhif] [^115q2evU].

> Option D mentions areas of warmth on the cast; I need to check whether warmth tracks with compartment syndrome. Warmth on the cast surface reflects superficial skin temperature and is nonspecific; compartment syndrome is more often associated with tenseness or firmness of the compartment rather than focal warmth, so warmth does not reliably indicate rising intracompartmental pressure and should not be prioritized over pain with passive stretch [^115q2evU] [^1172KNDR].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the answer clearly: the correct choice is pain that increases with passive movement, as it is the most consistent early clinical manifestation of compartment syndrome in this context; the other options either reflect normal perfusion or nonspecific findings that do not support the diagnosis early on [^113HoMYq] [^116FAhif] [^115q2evU].

> But wait, what if the exam is equivocal or the patient is unreliable; I need to ensure I note escalation steps. If clinical suspicion remains high, emergent cast bivalving or complete removal and compartment pressure measurement are indicated, with a delta pressure less than 30 mmHg (diastolic minus compartment pressure) supporting the need for fasciotomy; I should also remember that paresthesias and weakness are late and that relying on pulses or capillary refill can dangerously delay care [^115q2evU] [^1172KNDR] [^113hYpof] [^114St5SR].

---

The nurse should identify **pain with passive movement** as the most reliable early sign of compartment syndrome in a client with a short leg cast [^115q2evU]. This pain is typically severe, out of proportion to the injury, and worsens with passive stretch of the affected muscles [^116FAhif]. Bounding pedal pulses and capillary refill less than 2 seconds are not reliable indicators because **perfusion may remain normal early** [^113hD356]. Areas of warmth on the cast are nonspecific and not diagnostic [^1172KNDR].

---

## Pathophysiology of compartment syndrome

Compartment syndrome results from **increased pressure** within a closed muscle compartment, reducing perfusion and causing ischemia, nerve compression, and tissue damage [^113HoMYq]. Common causes include **fractures, crush injuries, and tight casts or dressings** [^notfound]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to **prevent permanent damage** [^1172KNDR].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome

The classic presentation of compartment syndrome includes the "five Ps": pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness [^111tXUVj]. However, **early signs are subtle** and may not include all five. The most reliable early indicator is severe pain that is disproportionate to the injury and worsens with passive movement [^115q2evU].

---

## Analysis of the provided options

### Option 1: Bounding pedal pulse

Bounding pedal pulses are **not a reliable indicator** of compartment syndrome [^112oBdSe]. Early compartment syndrome often maintains normal peripheral pulses because arterial inflow is not yet compromised [^115q2evU]. Therefore, bounding pulses do not indicate compartment syndrome and may falsely reassure the clinician [^112oBdSe].

---

### Option 2: Capillary refill less than 2 seconds

Capillary refill time (CRT) is a measure of peripheral perfusion. A CRT of less than 2 seconds is generally considered normal and indicates adequate perfusion [^notfound]. In compartment syndrome, CRT may remain normal in the early stages because arterial inflow is not significantly affected [^113hD356]. Thus, a normal CRT **does not exclude compartment syndrome** and is not a reliable indicator [^1172KNDR].

---

### Option 3: Pain that increases with passive movement

Pain that increases with passive movement is a hallmark sign of **compartment syndrome** [^113HoMYq]. This pain is typically severe, out of proportion to the injury, and exacerbated by **passive stretch** of the affected muscles [^116FAhif]. This finding is highly sensitive and specific in the early diagnosis of compartment syndrome and should prompt **immediate intervention** [^113hYpof].

---

### Option 4: Areas of warmth on the cast

Areas of warmth on the cast are nonspecific and may indicate localized inflammation or infection, but they are **not diagnostic** of compartment syndrome [^1172KNDR]. Compartment syndrome is primarily characterized by severe pain, tenseness of the compartment, and neurovascular compromise, rather than localized warmth [^113HoMYq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Clinical guidelines consistently emphasize **pain with passive movement** as a key diagnostic feature of compartment syndrome [^116FAhif]. The British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) highlight **pain out of proportion to injury** and pain with passive stretch as reliable early indicators [^116FAhif] [^115q2evU]. These findings should prompt immediate evaluation and management, including cast removal and consideration of **compartment pressure measurement** [^114St5SR].

---

## Nursing implications and interventions

When compartment syndrome is suspected, the nurse should:

- Immediately notify the healthcare provider [^1172KNDR].
- Remove or bivalve the cast to relieve pressure [^114St5SR].
- Elevate the limb to heart level to reduce swelling [^notfound].
- Monitor neurovascular status closely, including pain, paresthesia, and motor function [^112oBdSe].
- Prepare for emergency fasciotomy if indicated [^113HoMYq].

---

## Conclusion

The most reliable early sign of compartment syndrome in a client with a short leg cast is **pain that increases with passive movement** [^112XhNpx]. This finding should prompt immediate intervention to prevent permanent tissue damage [^113HoMYq]. Bounding pedal pulses, normal capillary refill, and localized warmth are not reliable indicators of compartment syndrome and should not delay diagnosis or treatment [^113hD356].

### Passive movements for the treatment and prevention of contractures [^114dxBzQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Contractures, a common complication following immobility, lead to restricted joint range of motion. Passive movements (PMs) are widely used for the treatment and prevention of contractures; however, it is not clear whether they are effective.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to determine the effects of PMs on persons with contractures or at risk of developing contractures. Specifically, the aim was to determine whether PMs increase joint mobility.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), ISI Web of Science (SCI-EXPANDED; SSCI; CPCI-S; CPCI-SSH), PEDro and PsycINFO (Ovid SP). The search was run on 21 November 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of PMs administered for the treatment or prevention of contractures were included. Studies were included if they compared the effectiveness of PMs versus no intervention, sham intervention or placebo in people with or at risk of contracture. Studies that involved other co-interventions were included, provided the co-interventions were administered in the same way to all groups. Interventions administered through mechanical devices and interventions that involved sustained stretch were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent review authors screened studies for inclusion. Two review authors then extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were joint mobility and occurrence of adverse events such as joint subluxations or dislocations, heterotopic ossification, autonomic dysreflexia and fractures or muscle tears. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, pain, spasticity, activity limitations and participation restrictions. We used standard methodological procedures as advocated by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

Two identified studies randomly assigned a total of 122 participants with neurological conditions comparing PMs versus no PMs. Data from 121 participants were available for analysis. Both studies had a low risk of bias. One within-participant study involving 20 participants (40 limbs) measured ankle joint mobility and reported a mean between-group difference of four degrees (95% confidence interval (CI), two to six degrees) favouring the experimental group. Both studies measured spasticity with the Modified Ashworth Scale, but the results were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity. Neither study reported a clinically or statistically relevant reduction in spasticity with PMs. In one study, the mean difference on a tallied 48-point Modified Ashworth Scale for the upper limbs was one of 48 points (95% CI minus two to four points), and in the other study, the median difference on a six-point Modified Ashworth Scale for the ankle plantar flexor muscles was zero points (95% CI minus one to zero points). In both studies, a negative between-group difference indicated a reduction in spasticity in the experimental group compared with the control group. One study with a total of 102 participants investigated the short-term effects on pain. The mean difference on a zero to 24-point pain scale was -0.4 points in favour of the control group (95% CI -1.4 to 0.6 points). The GRADE level of evidence about the effects of PMs on joint mobility, spasticity and pain is very low. Neither study examined quality of life, activity limitations or participation restrictions or reported any adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not clear whether PMs are effective for the treatment and prevention of contractures.

### Continuous passive motion following total knee arthroplasty in people with arthritis [^112SsShR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Arthritis of the knee is a common problem causing pain and disability. If severe, knee arthritis can be surgically managed with a total knee arthroplasty. Rehabilitation following knee arthroplasty often includes continuous passive motion (CPM). CPM is applied by a machine that passively and repeatedly moves the knee through a specified range of motion (ROM). It is believed that CPM increases recovery of knee ROM and has other therapeutic benefits. However, it is not clear whether CPM is effective.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of CPM and standard postoperative care versus similar postoperative care, with or without additional knee exercises, in people with knee arthroplasty. This review is an update of a 2003 and 2010 version of the same review.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 24 January 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to 24 January 2013), CINAHL (January 1982 to 24 January 2013), AMED (January 1985 to 24 January 2013) and PEDro (to 24 January 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which the experimental group received CPM, and both the experimental and control groups received similar postoperative care and therapy following total knee arthroplasty in people with arthritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes of interest were active knee flexion ROM, pain, quality of life, function, participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness, incidence of manipulation under anaesthesia and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were passive knee flexion ROM, active knee extension ROM, passive knee extension ROM, length of hospital stay, swelling and quadriceps strength. We estimated effects for continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences (SMD), and effects for dichotomous data as risk ratios; all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If appropriate, we performed meta-analyses using random-effects models.

Main Results

We identified 684 papers from the electronic searches after removal of duplicates and retrieved the full reports of 62 potentially eligible trials. Twenty-four randomised controlled trials of 1445 participants met the inclusion criteria; four of these trials were new to this update. There was moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important short-term effects on active knee flexion ROM: mean knee flexion was 78 degrees in the control group, CPM increased active knee flexion ROM by 2 degrees (95% CI 0 to 5) or absolute improvement of 2% (95% CI 0% to 4%). The medium- and long-term effects are similar although the quality of evidence is lower. There was low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important short-term effects on pain: mean pain was 3 points in the control group, CPM reduced pain by 0.4 points on a 10-point scale (95% CI -0.8 to 0.1) or absolute reduction of -4% (95% CI -8% to 1%). There was moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important medium-term effects on function: mean function in the control group was 56 points, CPM decreased function by 1.6 points (95% CI -6.1 to 2.0) on a 100-point scale or absolute reduction of -2% (95% CI -5% to 2%). The SMD was -0.1 standard deviations (SD) (95% CI -0.3 to 0.1). There was moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important medium-term effects on quality of life: mean quality of life was 40 points in the control group, CPM improved quality of life by 1 point on a 100-point scale (95% CI -3 to 4) or absolute improvement of 1% (95% CI -3% to 4%). There was very low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM reduces the risk of manipulation under anaesthesia; risk of manipulation in the control group was 7.2%, risk of manipulation in the experimental group was 1.6%, CPM decreased the risk of manipulation by 25 fewer manipulations per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 64) or absolute risk reduction of -4% (95% CI -8% to 0%). The risk ratio was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.9). There was low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM reduces the risk of adverse events; risk of adverse events in the control group was 16.3%, risk of adverse events in the experimental group was 17.9%, CPM decreased the risk of adverse event by 150 fewer adverse events per 1000 (95% CI 103 to 216) or absolute risk reduction of -1% (95% CI -5% to 3%). The risk ratio was 0.9 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.3). The estimates for risk of manipulation and adverse events are very imprecise and the estimate for the risk of adverse events does not distinguish between a clinically important increase and decrease in risk. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of CPM on participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

CPM does not have clinically important effects on active knee flexion ROM, pain, function or quality of life to justify its routine use. It may reduce the risk of manipulation under anaesthesia and risk of developing adverse events although the quality of evidence supporting these findings are very low and low, respectively. The effects of CPM on other outcomes are unclear.

### Mechanism of action of spinal mobilizations: a systematic review [^112Atopa]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To review the evidence regarding the mechanism of action of mobilizations.

Summary Of Background Data

Spinal mobilizations-low velocity passive oscillatory movements-reduce spinal pain in some patient subgroups. Identifying patients likely to respond remains a challenge since mobilizations' mechanism(s) of action are unclear.

Methods

Medline, Web of Science, Cinahl, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies. Reference lists of included studies were hand searched. Studies were included if the intervention was passive spinal mobilizations, participants were symptomatic, and outcomes evaluated possible mechanisms of action. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two assessors using a modified Cochrane Back Review Group tool.

Results

Twenty-four studies were included in the review. Four were classified high risk, 14 moderate risk, and four low risk of bias. Commonest methodological limitations were lack of participant blinding, adequate randomization and allocation concealment, and sample size calculation. Evidence suggests that spinal mobilizations cause neurophysiological effects resulting in hypoalgesia (local and/or distal to mobilization site), sympathoexcitation, and improved muscle function. Mobilizations have no effect on temperature pain threshold. Three of four studies reported reduction in spinal stiffness, heterogeneous in location and timing. There is limited evidence (one study in each case) to suggest that mobilizations produce increased nociceptive flexion reflex threshold, improved posture, decreased concentration of substance P in saliva, and improved sway index measured in cervical extension. Evidence does not support an effect on segmental vertebral movement. Two studies investigated correlations between hypoalgesia and mechanism: one found a correlation with sympathoexcitatory changes, whereas the other found no correlation with change in stiffness.

Conclusion

These findings suggest involvement of an endogenous pain inhibition system mediated by the central nervous system, although this is yet to be investigated directly. There is limited evidence regarding other possible mechanisms.

### Continuous passive motion following total knee arthroplasty in people with arthritis [^115PskBd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Total knee arthroplasty is a common intervention for patients with arthritis. Post-surgical rehabilitation often includes continuous passive motion. However, it is not clear whether continuous passive motion is effective.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of continuous passive motion following total knee arthroplasty in people with arthritis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2009), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2009), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2009), AMED (January 1985 to January 2009) and PEDro (to January 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which the experimental group received continuous passive motion, and both the experimental and control groups received similar postoperative care and therapy following total knee arthoplasty in people with arthritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion. Data were then extracted and the quality of trials assessed. The primary outcomes were active knee flexion range of motion, passive knee flexion range of motion, active knee extension range of motion, passive knee extension range of motion, length of hospital stay, function and incidence of manipulation under anaesthesia. The secondary outcomes were pain, swelling and quadriceps strength. Effects were estimated as weighted mean differences or standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models for continuous variables.

Main Results

Twenty randomised controlled trials of 1335 participants met the inclusion criteria. There is high-quality evidence that continuous passive motion increases passive knee flexion range of motion (mean difference 2 degrees, 95% CI 0 to 5) and active knee flexion range of motion (mean difference 3 degrees, 95% CI 0 to 6). These effects are too small to be clinically worthwhile. There is low-quality evidence that continuous passive motion has no effect on length of hospital stay (mean difference -0.3 days; 95% CI -0.9 to 0.2) but reduces the need for manipulation under anaesthesia (relative risk 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.70).

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of continuous passive motion on knee range of motion are too small to justify its use. There is weak evidence that continuous passive motion reduces the subsequent need for manipulation under anaesthesia.

### Fear of movement, passive coping, manual handling, and severe or radiating pain increase the likelihood of sick leave due to low back pain [^112FTFFr]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Sick leave due to low back pain (LBP-SL) is costly and compromises workforce productivity. The fear-avoidance model asserts that maladaptive pain-related cognitions lead to avoidance and disuse, which can perpetuate ongoing pain. Staying home from work is an avoidant behavior, and hence pain-related psychological features may help explain LBP-SL. We examined the relative contribution of pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, and pain coping (active and passive) in LBP-SL in addition to pain characteristics and other psychosocial, occupational, general health, and demographic factors. Two-way interactions between age and gender and candidate exposures were also considered. Our sample comprised 2164 working nurses and midwives with low back pain in the preceding year. Binary logistic regression was performed on cross-sectional data by manual backward stepwise elimination of nonsignificant terms to generate a parsimonious multivariable model. From an extensive array of exposures assessed, fear of movement (women, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.08; men, OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.29), passive coping (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.04–1.11), pain severity (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.50–1.72), pain radiation (women, OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.10–1.92; men, OR = 4.13, 95% CI 2.15–7.95), and manual handling frequency (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05) increased the likelihood of LBP-SL in the preceding 12 months. Administrators and managers were less likely to report LBP-SL (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.27–0.71), and age had a protective effect in individuals in a married or de facto relationship (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.98). In summary, fear of movement, passive coping, frequent manual handling, and severe or radiating pain increase the likelihood of LBP-SL. Gender-specific responses to pain radiation and fear of movement are evident.

### Passive movement therapy in patients with moderate to severe paratonia; study protocol of a randomised clinical trial (ISRCTN43069940) [^1117VoJQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Before designing a new trial with sufficient power we therefore initiated a Delphi procedure with known experts in the field to achieve a new consensus definition of paratonia. After four Delphi-rounds, the experts agreed on 7 criteria for operational defining paratonia (see below). Consequently these criteria have been assessed on validity and reliability in a 3-phase cross-sectional study in which this definition was tailored even further and in which we developed an assessment instrument (the Paratonia Assessment Instrument, PAI) for an instant diagnosis of paratonia, thus providing researchers an operational tool for future trials on paratonia.

"Paratonia is a form of hypertonia with an involuntary variable resistance during passive movement. The nature of paratonia may change with progression of the dementing illness (e.g. active assistance (Mitgehen) is more common early in the course of degenerative dementias, whilst active resistance is more common later in the course of the disease). The degree of resistance varies depending on the speed of movement (e.g. a low resistance to slow movement and a high resistance to fast movement). Paratonia increases with progression of dementia. Furthermore, the resistance to passive movement is in any direction and there is no clasp-knife phenomenon". The resistance must be felt in either two directions in one limb or in two different limbs.

We designed a randomized clinical trial in order to answer three research questions; first, is passive movement therapy an effective intervention on the severity of paratonia in comparison with usual care without passive movement therapy?

Second, is passive movement therapy an effective intervention for improvement of daily care? And finally, does PMT reduce pain during daily care in patients with moderate to severe paratonia.

### The effect of intra-operative passive movement therapy on non-surgical site pain after breast reconstructive surgery: a preliminary study [^115ASkmY]. Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Pain distant to an operative site is under-reported but sometimes more severe than pain from the surgical site. Intra-operative passive movement could possibly reduce this pain. This preliminary study was designed to assess the practicalities of conducting a randomised controlled trial of this therapy in anaesthetised patients. The study design was pragmatic. Forty-two patients undergoing breast reconstruction were randomly assigned to receive either intra-operative passive movement or standard care. Twenty-four hours after surgery, median (IQR [range]) morphine consumption was 33 (11–42 [0–176]) mg in the passive movement group compared with 74 (15–118 [0–238]) mg with standard care (p = 0.126), while participants reported median (IQR [range]) visual analogue scores in areas distant from the surgical site of 0 (0–4 [0–34]) mm in the passive movement group compared with 10 (2–30 [0–57]) mm in those receiving standard care (p = 0.002). A full trial of intra-operative passive movement therapy to reduce postoperative is feasible and warranted.

### Low back pain [^1168iqAV]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain prognostic factors and preventive priorities — clinicians should also consider screening for and addressing factors that increase the probability of developing recurrent or chronic low back pain; prognostic factors for recurrent pain include (1) history of previous episodes, (2) excessive spine mobility, and (3) excessive mobility in other joints, and prognostic factors for chronic pain include (1) presence of symptoms below the knee, (2) psychological distress or depression, (3) fear of pain, movement, and reinjury or low expectations of recovery, (4) pain of high intensity, and (5) a passive coping style. The clinical course of low back pain can be described as acute, subacute, recurrent, or chronic, and given the high prevalence of recurrent and chronic low back pain and the associated costs, clinicians should place high priority on interventions that prevent (1) recurrences and (2) the transition to chronic low back pain.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^112r53sH]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Evidence update for multimodal physical therapy in nonarthritic hip joint pain reports an SR of 14 randomized controlled trials in individuals with FAI, labral tears, or mixed hip-related joint pain populations (no OA). The authors concluded that prescribed physiotherapy consisting of hip strengthening, hip joint manual therapy techniques, functional activity-specific retraining and education showed a small to medium effect size compared with a combination of passive modalities, stretching and advice (very low to low quality of evidence; interpretation of evidence: very uncertain, but may slightly improve outcomes), and prescribed physiotherapy was inferior to hip arthroscopy (small effect size; moderate quality of evidence; interpretation of evidence: hip arthroscopy probably increases outcome slightly), with the overall quality of evidence for both domains ranging from very low to moderate.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^111CPhA6]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Poor motor behavior can be influenced by fear-avoidance beliefs, a decrease in self-efficacy expectations, catastrophic cognition, and an increase in depressive symptoms. Furthermore, pain-related movement disorders are a means of learning maladaptation that increases the attention to and memory of pain, favoring the perpetuation of the painful experience (Figure 2). Behavioral changes associated with the experience of the perception of maintained pain can cause various movement dysfunctions, mainly when a passive coping strategy is used. The result of this situation is an increase in disability levels (Figure 2).

To perform adequate clinical reasoning and undertake a good diagnostic approach using this model, it is necessary to evaluate the four dimensions and try to discern how they interact with one another, and especially to evaluate what factors are relevant (Figure 1). We recommend performing an assessment that objectifies sensorimotor variables through physical tests and an evaluation of cognitive and emotional factors using self-reports to quantify them. In Figure 1, we suggest the variables that should be evaluated to work with the biobehavioral model of pain perception and motor behavior.

The therapeutic approach we suggest attempts to provide a comprehensive framework for the treatment of patients with chronic painful TMD. The main variable to achieve optimum functional recovery is disability: we propose that if we improve the motor behavior, we will decrease the disability and in turn the painful perception. Therefore, we consider the possibility of a bidirectional relationship through which the treatment that reduces the painful perception can also favor the recovery of motor behavior while decreasing the disability. In order to achieve this change, it is necessary to eliminate erroneous beliefs and negative cognitions that could alter the treatment results. It will also be necessary to use motivational strategies that promote good adherence and compliance with the various types of treatments. It is important to mention that the treatment proposed herein has as a central therapeutic axis the movement to reduce pain and improve function. In relation to this, Luomajoki et al found that treatment with therapeutic exercise to improve motor performance also resulted in an improvement in pain and disability in patients with low-back pain. In our model, we also integrate therapeutic strategies, such as therapeutic exercise, that can specifically reduce pain and would make treatment more effective.

Current scientific evidence shows the ability of therapeutic exercise to modulate pain in experimental conditions.–In addition, we have strong scientific clinically relevant evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise in reducing disability and pain intensity in other chronic musculoskeletal conditions.–

### Does movement change when low back pain changes? A systematic review [^115gGQ9k]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between changes in volitional spinal movement (including muscle activity) and changes in pain or activity limitation at the individual level in people with nonspecific low back pain.

Design

Etiology systematic review.

Literature Search

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED were searched from inception to January 2020.

Study Selection Criteria

The study included peer-reviewed articles that reported the relationship between changes in volitional spinal movement and changes in pain or activity limitation at the individual level in people with nonspecific low back pain.

Data Synthesis

The data were descriptively synthesized to identify a relationship between change in movement and improved pain or activity limitation.

Results

We included 27 studies involving 2739 participants. There was low-quality evidence of a relationship between change in movement and change in pain or activity limitation at the individual level 31% of the time (20 of the 65 times investigated within the 27 studies). Increases in spinal range of motion, velocity, and flexion relaxation of the back extensors were consistently related to improved pain or activity limitation (93%, 18.5/20 relationships observed).

Conclusion

A relationship between changes in movement and changes in pain or activity limitation was infrequently observed at the individual level; however, a paucity of high-quality evidence precludes a definitive understanding of this relationship.

### Relation between changes in posteroanterior stiffness and active range of movement of the cervical spine following manual therapy treatment [^115wuP6R]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Repeated measures study of active and passive movements in patients with neck pain.

Objectives

To determine if, following manual therapy: (1) changes occur in active range of movement (AROM) and stiffness of posteroanterior (PA) movements, (2) such changes are dependent on the location treated, and (3) there is a relation between changes in PA stiffness and AROM.

Summary Of Background Data

PA movements are frequently used to assess patients with neck pain but little is known about how these movements are related to patient symptoms.

Methods

One location deemed symptomatic and hypomobile and 1 asymptomatic location were selected in 20 patients with neck pain for more than 2 weeks. PA stiffness at each location and AROM were measured before and after each of 4 manual therapy interventions: PA movements to each location, a general treatment, and a control intervention.

Results

The general intervention had a greater increase in each axis of AROM than the other interventions (F = 2.814 to 7.929, DF = 3) but there were no differences in PA stiffness across interventions (F = 0.945, DF = 3). Differences in PA stiffness was divided into regions by applied force. After treatment to the symptomatic location, regions of stiffness at forces above 8 N demonstrated significant correlations with total AROM (R = -0.466 to -0.628).

Conclusion

After manual therapy, increased AROM is related to decreased PA stiffness in patients with neck pain, but only for the treated location and only when that location had been identified previously as symptomatic and hypomobile.

### Research on the developmental trajectory of movement-evoked pain and its potential predictors in patients after knee arthroplasty [^115j63hJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to a global epidemiological survey, the number of knee arthroplasties in China reached 1 million in 2019, and this trend is increasing annually. In the Netherlands, the number of knee arthroplasties is projected to rise by 297% by 2030 compared to 2005 figures. In the US, the number of knee arthroplasties is expected to increase by 673% from 2005, reaching approximately 3.48 million. This rising demand places significant pressure on global health resources.

With advancements in modern medicine, there has been an increasing emphasis on patients' quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Pain, recognized as the fifth vital sign alongside temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure, is a crucial factor in this context. Notably, 44% of knee arthroplasty patients experience pain, with 15% suffering from severe pain postoperatively. While early functional exercise is essential for recovery and reducing postoperative complications, it can also lead to movement-evoked pain. This not only hinders the rehabilitation process but can also induce fear and potentially result in chronic pain and emotional disorders.

Movement-evoked pain is triggered by both active and passive movement of the affected tissues. Passive limb movement after knee arthroplasty, initiated early in the postoperative period, has been shown to have better results in the recovery of mobility and function of knee joints. Pain occurring within 72 hours after surgery is the most significant predictor of chronic postoperative pain, making effective pain management during this period critical for knee arthroplasty patients.

Differences in postoperative pain experiences have been noted in cases of bone metastases and uterine diseases at various time points. These may suggest that similar features may be present after knee arthroplasty. Current research in pain management mainly starts with physiological blockade, using drugs and anesthetic tissues to reduce the release of inflammatory factors and inhibit central sensitisation to alleviate pain. However, the effects of pain are multidimensional, and patients' pain management needs tend to be diverse. A prerequisite for good pain management is the provision of targeted care based on the pain management needs of different patients. movement-evoked pain is an individual-oriented model and assumes differences in the developmental trajectories of individuals within a group. Individuals with the same developmental trajectory are grouped together. Individuals based on shared developmental trajectories are frequently employed to examine the longitudinal progression of postoperative pain. 13

Therefore, this study aims to dynamically track and investigate the status of movement-evoked pain within 72 hours post-knee arthroplasty, identify its longitudinal trajectory, and analyze predictive factors across different trajectory categories. These findings may help identify key populations and inform management strategies to mitigate movement-evoked pain after knee arthroplasty.

### Low back pain [^112Y8hot]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — acute low back pain with movement coordination impairments (spinal instabilities) presents with "Acute exacerbation of recurring low back pain that is commonly associated with referred lower extremity pain" and "Symptoms often include numerous episodes of low back and/or low back-related lower extremity pain in recent years". Impairments include "Low back and/or low back-related lower extremity pain at rest or produced with initial to mid-range spinal movements", pain "reproduced with provocation of the involved lumbar segment(s)", and "Movement coordination impairments of the lumbopelvic region with low back flexion and extension movements". Primary strategies include "Neuromuscular re-education to promote dynamic (muscular) stability to maintain the involved lumbosacral structures in less symptomatic, mid-range positions", to "Consider the use of temporary external devices to provide passive restraint to maintain the involved lumbosacral structures in less symptomatic, mid-range positions", and "Self-care/home management training pertaining to (1) postures and motions that maintain the involved spinal structures in neutral, symptom-alleviating positions, and (2) recommendations to pursue or maintain an active lifestyle".

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^1173WioJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Emotional factors related to fear of pain play an important role in the degree of protective behaviors triggered by pain. Recent research has shown that high levels of fear of pain are associated with being less physically active, limited range of motion, physical disability, and strategies for adopting alternative movements. It should be noted that behaviors associated with psychological distress, interruption of activity, and avoidance of activity are essential components in pain-related disability.

Motor behavior related to painful experiences can vary according to the case. Some patients with chronic pain use passive motor strategies to avoid pain; however, other patients use active self-regulation strategies to cope with pain. Simmonds et al reported that movement dysfunction was not only a consequence of anticipating and minimizing pain. The motor component involved is an even more complicated problem that involves social, environmental, and psychological factors (cognitions and emotions) that can influence motor activity as a complex multidimensional construct. Several motor programs have been proposed for the various forms of pain behavior. These can be organized at various levels of the CNS, and can be influenced by social and psychological factors.

Current evidence holds that in addition to fear of pain, other psychosocial factors might contribute to generating pain-related functional alterations.–In this regard, Sullivan suggested that certain psychological factors, such as pain catastrophizing, fear, and depression can influence pain by reducing the threshold of activation of motor programs related to pain perception.

In summary, the biobehavioral model of pain perception and motor behavior presents a specific framework to help us understand the mechanisms involved in chronic painful TMD. Basically, we propose that sustained pain perception produces neuroplastic changes in the CNS that have implications for motor behavior that are directly and indirectly influenced by cognitive and emotional factors. In this model, the motor behavior is an essential element, given its alteration would increase levels of disability, leading to poorer quality of life, and would increase the perception of pain intensity.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^111p8Mu1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Topics included — intervention: manual therapy encompasses skilled hand movements and skilled passive movements of joints and soft tissue (thrust and nonthrust) within the scope of physical therapy practice; manual therapy techniques may include traction (an intervention that uses manually or mechanically applied forces with the intention of stretching and distracting the spine), massage (connective tissue massage and therapeutic massage), mobilization/manipulation (soft tissue and spinal and peripheral joints), and dry needling (an intervention that uses a thin filiform needle to penetrate the skin and stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points and muscular and connective tissues for the management of neuromusculoskeletal pain and movement impairments, used to treat dysfunctions in skeletal muscle, fascia, and connective tissue, and to diminish persistent peripheral nociceptive input and reduce or restore impairments of body structure and function, leading to improved activity and participation).

### Shoulder pain and mobility deficits: adhesive capsulitis [^112GSYga]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Shoulder pain and mobility deficits/adhesive capsulitis — rule in if: Patient's age is between 40 and 65 years; Patient reports a gradual onset and progressive worsening of pain and stiffness; Pain and stiffness limit sleeping, grooming, dressing, and reaching activities; Glenohumeral passive range of motion (ROM) is limited in multiple directions, with external rotation the most limited, more particularly in adduction; Glenohumeral external or internal rotation ROM decreases as the humerus is abducted from 45° toward 90°; Passive motions into the end ranges of glenohumeral motions reproduce the patient's reported shoulder pain; and Joint glides/accessory motions are restricted in all directions. Rule out if: Passive ROM is normal; Radiographic evidence of glenohumeral arthritis is present; Passive glenohumeral external or internal rotation ROM increases as the humerus is abducted from 45° toward 90° and the reported shoulder pain is reproduced with palpatory provocation of the subscapularis myofascia; Upper-limb nerve tension testing reproduces the reported symptoms and shoulder pain can be increased or decreased with altering nerve tension positions; or Shoulder pain is reproduced with palpatory provocation of the relevant peripheral nerve entrapment site.

### The effects of active and passive stretching on muscle length [^1174tq4a]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Active stretch is necessary for regulating muscle fiber length (ie, the number of series sarcomeres). Elevated cytoplasmic calcium is the proposed component of contractile activity required to activate signaling pathways for sarcomere number regulation. Passive stretch reduces muscle tissue stiffness, most likely by signaling connective tissue remodeling via fibroblasts. Passive stretch may induce sarcomere addition if the muscle fibers are lengthened sufficiently to raise cytoplasmic calcium through stretch-activated calcium channels. The magnitude of stretch in vivo is limited by the physiologic range of movement and stretch pain tolerance. The greatest effect of stretching muscle fibers is expected when the lengthening exceeds the optimum fiber length (Lo).

### Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults: an overview of cochrane reviews [^115Q9Q3K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Exercise and physical activity interventions implemented in the included reviews

Interventions assessed included: any specified style of land‐based exercise or physical activity such as one designed to improve strength, range of movement, aerobic capacity, or a combination of these (Boldt 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hurkmans 2009; Koopman 2015; Regnaux 2015; van der Heijden 2015); a single style of land‐based exercise only (tai chi only: Han 2004, walking only: Lauret 2014, walking or jogging only: Brown 2010; Lane 2014, balance training only: Silva 2010, motor control exercise only: Saragiotto 2016, Pilates method only: Yamato 2015); any pool‐based or aquatic therapy (Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Cramp 2013), or "any exercise therapy" (Hayden 2005).

Aquatic exercise

Any exercise performed in water. This can include swimming, though many studies will be referring to exercises performed vertically in the water (not horizontally), either using the water to support the body through the exercise, or as resistance against the body.

Range of motion and flexibility exercise

Can be performed in water or on land. The intention is to increase the range of motion around a joint through progressive stretching and mobilising of the muscles around and crossing the joint. For the purposes of this overview, we only included active movement where the movement was brought about by the participant, and not passively moved by an external force such as a therapist.

Aerobic exercise

Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise usually performed continuously to raise the heart rate and breathing rate for a prolonged period. Examples include walking, jogging, running, cycling, and swimming. Often presented as a percentage of the participant's heart rate max (HRmax) ‐ the highest heart rate reached when performing at their absolute maximum. Similarly it may be presented as a percentage of VO 2 max or VO 2 peak (a proportion of the maximum amount of oxygen the muscle can take up per minute), or as an absolute value (mL/kg/minute).

### Exercise therapy is effective for improvement in range of motion, function, and pain in patients with frozen shoulder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Ak9se]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective(S)

To determine (1) the effect of exercise therapy alone or in combination with other interventions compared with solely exercises and programs with or without exercises and (2) what kind of exercise therapy or combination with other interventions is most effective.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

Study Selection

Studies were screened in a 2-phase approach by 2 independent reviewers (M.M. and L.M.). Reference lists of included studies and interesting systematic reviews were hand searched.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers (M.M. and L.M.) extracted information about origin, characteristics of study participants, eligibility criteria, characteristics of interventions, outcome measures and main results in a pre-defined template.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-three studies were included in the qualitative and 19 in the meta-analysis. Preliminary evidence was found for supervised exercises to be more beneficial than home exercises for ROM and function. Multimodal programs comprising exercises may result in little to no difference in ROM compared to solely exercises. Programs comprising muscle energy techniques show little to no difference in ROM when compared with programs with other exercises. Adding stretches to a multimodal program with exercises may increase ROM. There is uncertain evidence that there is a difference between those programs regarding function and pain. Preliminary evidence was found for several treatment programs including exercises to be beneficial for improvement in both passive and active ROM, function, pain, and muscle strength. No studies used patient satisfaction as an outcome measure.

Conclusions

ROM, function, and pain improve with both solely exercises and programs with exercises, but for ROM and pain there was little to no difference between programs and for function the evidence was uncertain. Adding exercises improve active ROM compared with a program without exercises, whereas adding physical modalities has no beneficial effect. Muscle energy techniques are a beneficial type of exercise therapy for improving function compared with other types of exercise. Unfortunately, no conclusion can be drawn about the results in the long-term and most effective dose of exercise therapy.

### Pain-related brain activity evoked by active and dynamic arm movement: delayed-onset muscle soreness as a promising model for studying movement-related pain in humans [^111W2sV4]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many people suffer from musculoskeletal pain such as low-back pain and osteoarthritis, and the personal and social costs of pain conditions have become a serious concern in our society. Movement-related pain including musculoskeletal pain impairs activities of daily living and quality of life and is, therefore, an important therapeutic target for health care. Musculoskeletal pain is caused by overuse as well as muscle injury and tissue inflammation. For example, low back pain from overuse is a common work-related diagnosis. It is estimated that one-third of adults have pain from overuse. Considering the clinical and social importance of treating movement-related pain, a better understanding of its underlying brain processing is needed to develop effective and efficient therapeutic strategies.

Several recent studies reported the influence of pain on the motor system. For example, nociceptive stimuli to a muscle elicit the redistribution of motoneuron discharges in the surrounding muscles. Furthermore, pain suppresses the electromyographic response of an affected muscle to stimulation of the peripheral nerve or the motor cortex. Based on these findings, Hodeges et al. proposed a model of how the central nervous system sustains our motor functions when we have musculoskeletal pain. To maintain motor performance, plastic changes for adapting to pain occur at various level of the central nervous system, especially the brain. In their model, the pain-related plastic changes of the central motor system are a specific feature of movement with pain. To date, however, no study has directly demonstrated brain plasticity related to movement with pain.

### Rehabilitation medicine approaches to pain management [^115GmFK7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Rehabilitation medicine offers strategies that reduce musculoskeletal pain, targeted approaches to alleviate movement-related pain, and interventions to optimize patients' function despite the persistence of pain. These approaches fall into four categories: modulating nociception, stabilizing and unloading painful structures, influencing pain perception, and alleviating soft tissue musculotendinous pain. Incorporating these interventions into individualized, comprehensive pain management programs offers the potential to empower patients and limit pain associated with mobility and required daily activities. Rehabilitative approach may be particularly helpful for patients with refractory movement-associated pain and functional vulnerability, and for those who do not wish for, or cannot, tolerate pharmacoanalgesia.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^111dqc89]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

2. Range of motion

Active movements [knee flexion (135°), knee extension (0°), internal and external rotation (10°), isometric quadriceps contraction]

Passive movements [patellar tilt, lateral tracking of patella or increased Q angle]

3. Palpation

Surface anatomy is best appreciated with the knee flexed to 90 degrees. The point of maximal tenderness should be correlated with the underlying bone or soft tissue anatomy. Palpate and note tenderness over the patellofemoral joint, bones, menisci and along the course and attachments of ligaments and tendons. Patients with patellofemoral pain typically have tenderness over the medical and/or lateral patellar facets, superior and inferior poles of the patella or patellar tendon. Pain over the physes or joint line is not part of patellofemoral pain.

Effusion [may be visible or palpable. In situations where there is minimal fluid, compression of the suprapatellar pouch may decrease the joint volume and aid detecting an effusion].

### Comparing targeted thrust manipulation with general thrust manipulation in patients with low back pain. A general approach is as effective as a specific one. A randomised controlled trial [^116J7m7N]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

This trial took two similar groups of subjects with low back pain and compared the effect of a manipulative TT technique aimed toward a clinician-defined target versus a similar magnitude thrust technique that was not targeted toward a specific level of the lumbar spine. There were no differences in disability or pain reductions between the groups. Pain was measured as self-reported pain levels or in pressure-pain perception in the lumbar muscles. There was an increase in the stretch-reflex sEMG response in the lumbar multifidus muscles of the TT group, across the three visits.

Our data suggest that targeting a manipulative thrust technique to a clinician-defined, specific level of the lumbar spine does not improve self-reported pain or disability levels. This extends previous reports that compared methods of joint mobilisation and manipulation. All these data (our study and related studies) suggest, it may be necessary for manual therapy scientists to re-evaluate the paradigms traditionally used to explain the therapeutic mechanisms of applied passive movement to the spine. We report that specifically targeted manipulation amplified the local stretch-reflex response, though it did not reduce pain (compared with the control group), over the course of three visits. One could speculate that as subjects attended for repeated visits, they anticipated that they were to going to receive a thrust to a specific locality resulting in a 'protective' muscular excitability to stretch, via an increase in alpha motor neuro pool activity, a phenomenon that has been observed with lumbar manipulation previously.

### Effect of interferential current stimulation in management of hemiplegic shoulder pain [^115gLu2u]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the immediate effects of interferential current stimulation (IFC) on shoulder pain and pain-free passive range of motion (PROM) of the shoulder in people with hemiplegic shoulder pain (HSP).

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Institutional physical therapy clinic, neurologic rehabilitation center.

Participants

A population-based sample of people with HSP (N = 30) was recruited.

Intervention

Participants were divided into 2 groups — an IFC group and a placebo group — by using a match-paired method (age, sex, and Brunnstrom motor recovery stage). In the IFC group, participants received IFC for 20 minutes with an amplitude-modulated frequency at 100 Hz in vector mode. The current intensity was increased until the participants felt a strong tingling sensation.

Main Outcome Measures

Pain intensity and pain-free PROM of the shoulder until the onset of pain were measured at baseline and immediately after treatment.

Results

Participants reported a greater reduction in pain during the most painful movement after treatment with IFC than with placebo (P < .05). The IFC group showed a greater improvement in posttreatment pain-free PROM than the placebo group in shoulder flexion (P < .01), abduction (P < .01), internal rotation (P < .01), and external rotation (P < .01).

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that IFC is effective for the relief of pain during movement and also increases the pain-free PROM of the shoulder in people with HSP.

### Reducing back exertion and improving confidence of individuals with low back pain with a back exosuit: a feasibility study for use in BACPAC [^1137ijPe]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To prevent these compensatory behaviors, ergonomic aids and orthotic devices have been explored to help bridge function during periods of low-back-related disability. Back belts, for instance, aim to stiffen the spine and increase abdominal pressure, thereby increasing spinal stability. However, they have shown minimal biomechanical efficacy, restricting RoMand disrupting inter-segmental coordination. Despite limited biomechanical efficacy, back belts transiently improve pain, fear of movement, and catastrophizing in people returning to work following LBP, highlighting the psychological implications of perceived support.

Emerging robotic technologies, such as back exoskeletons or exosuits (herein referred to as back exos), have been discussed as a potential aid in rehabilitation by assisting natural biomechanics while offloading back exertion with external assistance. Back exos can be classified as active, powered by electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuators, or passive, unpowered devices that use a spring-like structure to store and release energy collected by human motion. A number of studies in healthy participants have demonstrated that both passive and active back exos can reduce peak muscle activity through these applied external moments, which alludes to the potential of these technologies to benefit individuals with LBP. On the other hand, a few studies with passive exoskeletons have shown that healthy subjects receive these benefits with the burden of increased abdominal coactivation, movement restriction, and discomfortduring lifting and static bending, which could decrease the likelihood of using back exos with individuals with LBP.

### Drug-free interventions to reduce pain or opioid consumption after total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JUmUE]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is increased interest in nonpharmacological treatments to reduce pain after total knee arthroplasty. Yet, little consensus supports the effectiveness of these interventions.

Objective

To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence of nonpharmacological interventions for postoperative pain management after total knee arthroplasty.

Data Sources

Database searches of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science (ISI database), Physiotherapy Evidence (PEDRO) database, and ClinicalTrials.gov for the period between January 1946 and April 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing nonpharmacological interventions with other interventions in combination with standard care were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted the data from selected articles using a standardized form and assessed the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used for the analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Postoperative pain and consumption of opioids and analgesics.

Results

Of 5509 studies, 39 randomized clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis (2391 patients). The most commonly performed interventions included continuous passive motion, preoperative exercise, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, and acupuncture. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that electrotherapy reduced the use of opioids (mean difference, -3.50; 95% CI, -5.90 to -1.10 morphine equivalents in milligrams per kilogram per 48 hours; p = 0.004; I2 = 17%) and that acupuncture delayed opioid use (mean difference, 46.17; 95% CI, 20.84 to 71.50 minutes to the first patient-controlled analgesia; P < .001; I2 = 19%). There was low-certainty evidence that acupuncture improved pain (mean difference, -1.14; 95% CI, -1.90 to -0.38 on a visual analog scale at 2 days; p = 0.003; I2 = 0%). Very low-certainty evidence showed that cryotherapy was associated with a reduction in opioid consumption (mean difference, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.01 morphine equivalents in milligrams per kilogram per 48 hours; p = 0.03; I2 = 86%) and in pain improvement (mean difference, -0.51; 95% CI, -1.00 to -0.02 on the visual analog scale; P < .05; I2 = 62%). Low-certainty or very low-certainty evidence showed that continuous passive motion and preoperative exercise had no pain improvement and reduction in opioid consumption: for continuous passive motion, the mean differences were -0.05 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.25) on the visual analog scale (P = 0.74; I2 = 52%) and 6.58 (95% CI, -6.33 to 19.49) opioid consumption at 1 and 2 weeks (P = 0.32, I2 = 87%), and for preoperative exercise, the mean difference was -0.14 (95% CI, -1.11 to 0.84) on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index Scale (P = 0.78, I2 = 65%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, electrotherapy and acupuncture after total knee arthroplasty were associated with reduced and delayed opioid consumption.

### Theoretical schemas to guide back pain consortium (BACPAC) chronic low back pain clinical research [^113cj2d9]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sensorimotor Control

The spinal column is biomechanically stabilized by three subsystems: 1) a passive subsystem that includes bone, cartilage, ligaments, and intervertebral discs; 2) an active subsystem that includes the paraspinal muscles; and 3) the neural control subsystem. These subsystems are often conceptualized separately, but they are functionally interdependent. Motor control and function include muscle recruitment, strength, and endurance. An important feedback component of neuromotor control is proprioception, which refers to afferent information arising from internal peripheral areas that contribute to postural control, joint stability, and several conscious sensations. Movement and control disorders presumably lead to a proprioceptive deficit because of stress on local muscle spindles and joint receptors in the painful area resulting from stress to a joint caused by an individual's maladaptive movement. Subsequently, abnormal joint and tissue loading during daily activities and postures can affect local proprioceptors and maintain this vicious cycle. Changes in muscle activity have been linked to spinal pain (muscle-tension or pain-spasm-pain model) or restriction of spinal motion (pain adaptation).

Five studies reported data related to sensorimotor control, including anticipatory postural adjustments (one RPF with substantial SOE confidence), compensatory postural adjustments (one RPF with substantial SOE confidence), proprioception (two RPFs with little SOE confidence), lumbar repositioning error (one RPF with little SOE confidence), and trunk strength and mobility (one RPF with little SOE confidence), in relation to cLBP classification (yes/no) and pain severity or disability as assessed by questionnaire. The study authors hypothesized that movement control disorders cause spine tissue overloading with increased risk for nociceptive activation.

Load

Muscle and gravity loads cause the lumbar spine to be one of the most highly stressed structures in the body. Loading induces a combination of compression, bending, torsion, and shear that vary from level to level. Spinal loads induce stresses within the various sub-tissues, which can be anabolic (stimulate remodeling via cell-mediated processes) or catabolic (induce damage and inflammation). Obesity can contribute to increased biomechanical loading of spinal joints.

None of the cited studies reported on load.

### The applications and prescriptions of motion style acupuncture treatment for musculoskeletal pain: a scoping review of clinical controlled trials [^11754y4f]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Musculoskeletal pain, defined as "persistent or recurrent pain that arises as part of a disease process directly affecting bone(s), joint(s), muscle(s), or related soft tissue(s)", is the most common cause of disability with significant economical and societal implications globally. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was approximately 30% (range of 13.5–47%) from 23 population studies conducted in 15 different countries. Considering the different aetiologies and underlying physiopathological mechanisms, musculoskeletal pain is categorized into nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and nociplastic pain. Clinically, there are different manifestations of pain, such as burning sensations, stabbing pains, electric shock-like sensations, and sharp pains. Musculoskeletal pain can effect sleepand mood. Moreover, it can significantly limit one's mobility and participation in regular physical activities, thereby increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases. In the management of musculoskeletal pain, pharmacotherapy is common used. However, the effectiveness of the currently available pharmacotherapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain conditions is unsatisfactory. In addition, the potential for adverse effects needs to be taken into account. Accordingly, the implementation of preventative strategies and physical tools are recommended in recent guidelines to minimize the use of pharmacotherapy. Non-pharmacological therapy includes manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, acupunctureand so on. As for acupuncture, many clinical trials have validated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain. After the development of acupuncture, a novel acupuncture treatment which is named motion style acupuncture treatment has emerged. MSAT, the combination of acupuncture therapy and exercise therapy, requests the patient to exercise actively or passively, while needles are left in the body. The analgesic effects of acupuncture are mediated through the modulation of neuronal activity in the central nervous system (CNS). Specifically, the release of endogenous opioids, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and norepinephrine in the CNS, which are induced by peripheral stimuli, is thought to play a crucial role in the regulation of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. MSAT reinforces the stimulus quantity of acupuncture by moving the needled muscles. Through extensive activation of the brain, it provides a greater analgesic effect with neuronal modulation in the CNS than conventional acupuncture therapy. Due to this mechanism, MSAT is suitable for a wide range of musculoskeletal disorders, with the effect of relieving pain, improving the range of motion of joints and aiding in the recovery of functions. Furthermore, in the clinical application, MSAT is widely used to reduce musculoskeletal pain. However, MSAT used in the management of musculoskeletal pain is different.

### Research on the developmental trajectory of movement-evoked pain and its potential predictors in patients after knee arthroplasty [^115SJCJ1]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The patients with short disease duration are more likely to have movement-evoked pain after knee arthroplasty. The results are similar to the findings of Weiwei Kong. The reason for this may be related to the fact that the longer the patient's disease duration, the longer he suffers from pain, which increases the threshold of pain. As a result, patients with shorter disease duration were more likely to enter the severe pain-continuously stable group compared to patients with longer disease duration.

For patients with short disease duration, we can take measures to reduce postoperative movement-evoked pain, such as fast-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can be given in advance to minimize pain caused by functional exercises after knee arthroplasty and to promote patient comfort.

Predictors of Severe Pain in Knee Arthroplasty: Operation Time, Social Support, and Pain Catastrophization

Our study shows that operation time, social support, and pain catastrophization are significant predictors of movement-evoked pain after knee arthroplasty. Patients with longer operation time, lower social support, and higher pain catastrophization levels are more likely to experience severe movement-evoked pain.

Longer operation time are associated with increased movement-evoked pain, aligning with findings from Yiyang Li et al. The reason may be that a tourniquet is used in knee arthroplasty in order to reduce intraoperative bleeding, obtain a clearer surgical field of vision, and the purpose of better fit the prosthesis. The prolonged use of a tourniquet during surgery to minimize bleeding can lead to increased swelling and pain at the surgical site. In addition, the operation time tends to be directly proportional to the complexity of the surgical procedure; with the longer operation time, the more complex the operation is likely to be. Therefore, Longer operation time has a passive influence on postoperative knee mobility and the level of postoperative movement-evoked pain. This underscores the importance of striving to minimize operation times where possible to reduce postoperative pain and enhance recovery.

### Musculoskeletal pain and exercise-challenging existing paradigms and introducing new [^1144pbXE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Summary — Pain Science 2018 in a nutshell.

Traditional pain models that describe tissue pathology as a source of nocioceptive input directly linked with pain expression are insufficient for assessing and treating musculoskeletal pain. Other models reconceptualise pain and put forward concepts that are based on the premise that pain does not always provide a measure of the state of tissue pathology. Instead, pain is modulated by many factors, and the relationship between pain and tissue becomes less predictable the longer pain persists. Altered central processing of pain has been shown to be present in many pain conditions, with the immune system playing a role in the development and maintenance of pain sensitisation. Furthermore, unhelpful thoughts of patients and clinicians towards pain, including belief that pain will not get better and that movement will cause further tissue damage and worsening of the pain, are also important issues to remain mindful of.

### Shoulder pain and mobility deficits: adhesive capsulitis [^115wAuCW]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis — tissue irritability–based evaluation and care state that diagnosis of tissue irritability is important for guiding the clinical decisions regarding treatment frequency, intensity, duration, and type, with the goal of matching the optimal dosage of treatment to the status of the tissue being treated; irritability is a term used by rehabilitation practitioners to reflect the tissue's ability to handle physical stress, and is presumably related to physical status and the extent of inflammatory activity that is present, with three levels of irritability operationally defined; the primary clinical finding that determines the level of tissue irritability is the relation between pain and active and passive movements, with other clinical findings including pain level, frequency of pain, and level of disability reported by the patient; because irritability level often reflects the tissue's ability to accept physical stress, clinicians should match the most appropriate intervention strategies to the level of irritability, such that patients with a high level of tissue irritability are not ready for significant physical stress and treatment should emphasize activity modification and appropriate modalities, medication, and manual therapy to relieve pain and inflammation with only low levels of glenohumeral exercises while encouraging motion at adjacent regions, patients with a moderate level of irritability should be able to tolerate controlled physical stress in the form of progressive manual therapy, mild stretching, and strengthening activities and perform basic functional activities, and patients with low irritability should be able to tolerate progressive resistance exercise and higher-demand physical activities.

### Effect of active limb movements on symptoms in patients with low back pain [^116fGFQi]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A descriptive, correlational study of patients with mechanical low back pain (LBP).

Objectives

To assess the effect of active limb movements on symptoms in patients with LBP and to examine the relationship between symptoms with limb movements and select patient characteristics.

Background

Limb movements result in forces applied to the spine and, thus, may be important in the examination and treatment of patients with LBP.

Methods and Measures

A total of 188 people with LBP, 84 men and 104 women, participated in a standardized examination. Six of the items required patients to move their limbs and note LBP symptoms as increased, remained the same, or decreased. The prevalence of various symptom responses with each limb movement test was calculated. Relationships between patient characteristics and reports of increased symptoms were examined with Cochran's linear trend statistic and the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients. Differences in characteristics of patients with and without increased symptoms were examined with chi2 test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Student's t test for independent groups.

Results

An increase in symptoms was reported by 149 patients with at least 1 of the limb movement tests, and 3 of the patients reported a decrease in symptoms. Across the patient sample, the mean number of limb movement tests for which symptoms were reported as increased was 2.30 ± 1.64. Patients with an increase in symptoms reported higher average pain intensity the week prior to the examination (median = 2; range: 1–5) and higher functional disability (mean = 0.25; SD = 0.15) than those without a change in symptoms (pain intensity: median = 1; range: 0–2 and functional disability: mean = 0.16; SD = 0.12). The correlation between the number of increased symptoms and the person's average pain intensity was r = 0.23; the correlation with the functional disability score was r = 0.36. Patients with a history of LBP tended to report an increase in symptoms with more of the limb movement tests (mean = 3.5; SD = 1.40) than those without a previous history of LBP (mean = 2.0; SD = 1.11).

Conclusions

Active limb movements performed during the examination primarily resulted in increased LBP symptoms. The presence and number of increased symptoms with the active limb movements was related to the patient's report of average pain intensity and functional disability. Tests of symptoms with active limb movements may provide insight into factors contributing to a LBP problem, as well as information to guide the treatment of patients with LBP.

Acute compartment syndrome — key diagnostic features include pain with passive stretch and paraesthesias, and in patients with an unreliable or unobtainable clinical exam measurement of intracompartmental pressures may be beneficial; a gradient of < 30 mmHg between the diastolic blood pressure and intracompartmental pressure is predictive of patients who would benefit from a fasciotomy. When a compartment syndrome is suspected, early fasciotomies should be performed using long, generous skin and fascial incisions to release all the compartments of the involved limb, and those incisions should be left open at the conclusion of the procedure.

### Shoulder pain and mobility deficits: adhesive capsulitis [^11724tFx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis — Evaluation/Intervention Component 3 (diagnosis of tissue irritability level) defines three strata. High irritability is characterized by reports high levels of pain (≥ 7/10), consistent night or resting pain, high levels of reported disability on standardized self-report outcome tools, pain occurring before end ranges of active or passive movements, and active range of motion (ROM) significantly less than passive ROM due to pain. Moderate irritability is characterized by reports moderate levels of pain (4–6/10), intermittent night or resting pain, moderate levels of reported disability on standardized self-report outcome tools, pain at end ranges of active or passive movements, and active ROM similar to passive ROM. Low irritability is characterized by reports minimal levels of pain (≤ 3/10), no night or resting pain, minimal levels of reported disability on standardized self-report outcome tools, pain with overpressures into end ranges of passive movements, and active ROM same as passive ROM.

Lateral ankle ligament sprains — manual therapy recommendations: Clinicians should use manual therapy procedures within pain-free movement to reduce swelling, improve pain-free ankle and foot mobility, and normalize gait parameters in individuals with an acute LAS (2013 Recommendation B). For updated guidance, clinicians should use manual therapy procedures, such as lymphatic drainage, active and passive soft tissue and joint mobilization, and anterior-to-posterior talar mobilization procedures within pain-free movement, alongside therapeutic exercise to reduce swelling, improve pain-free ankle and foot mobility, and normalize gait parameters in individuals with a LAS (2021 Recommendation A). The clinician should favor slow-velocity techniques that do not provoke symptoms in the acute phase.

### Continued disability and pain after lumbar disc surgery: the role of cognitive-behavioral factors [^114EBLnm]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Cognitive-behavioral factors are considered important in the development of chronic disability and pain in patients with low back pain. In a prospective cohort study of 277 patients undergoing surgery for lumbosacral radicular syndrome, the predictive value of preoperatively measured cognitive-behavioral factors (fear of movement/(re)injury, passive pain coping, and negative outcome expectancies) for disability and pain intensity at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery was investigated, taking into account the effect of possible confounding variables. Higher levels of cognitive-behavioral factors were found to be associated with a worse outcome at both 6 weeks and 6 months. These associations remained significant after controlling for possible confounding variables (preoperative disability and pain intensity, age, gender, educational level, duration of complaints, neurological deficits, and intake of analgesics) and pain intensity 3 days postoperatively. In multiple regression analyses, the cognitive-behavioral factors independently predicted different outcomes. Fear of movement/(re)injury predicted more disability and more severe pain at 6 weeks and more severe pain at 6 months; passive pain-coping strategies predicted more disability at 6 months; and negative outcome expectancies predicted more disability and more severe pain at both 6 weeks and 6 months. The findings support the potential utility of preoperative screening measures that include cognitive-behavioral factors for predicting surgical outcome, as well as studies to examine the potential benefits of cognitive-behavioral treatment to improve surgical outcome.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for spinal cord protection [^114TMAwF]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Spinal cord protection — methods of extrication with possible cervical spine injury — Analysis of neck motion during extrication from an automobile using an infrared 6-camera motion-capture system revealed that strategies permitting individuals to exit the vehicle under their own volition with cervical collar in place resulted in less motion of the cervical spine than extrication by experienced paramedics, and investigators concluded that self-extraction with verbal instructions and no assistive devices was the most stable extraction method, with use of backboards resulting in more motion that increased with victim body weight. Patients requiring extrication should be encouraged to reduce movement of the neck, especially painful movement, and allowed to exit the situation under their own volition if alert and reliable. If injuries or other circumstances such as unconsciousness prevent controlled self-extrication, patients' cervical spines should be packaged to reduce passive motion and the airway adequately managed without a goal of absolute immobilization. There is no requisite role for commercially made or improvised rigid cervical collars in an out-of-hospital environment (Evidence grade: 1C).

### The role of ERK signaling and the P2X receptor on mechanical pain evoked by movement of inflamed knee joint [^116eBzpJ]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Pain during inflammatory joint diseases is enhanced by the generation of hypersensitivity in nociceptive neurons in the peripheral nervous system. To explore the signaling mechanisms of mechanical hypersensitivity during joint inflammation, experimental arthritis was induced by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the synovial cavity of rat knee joints. As a pain index, the struggle threshold of the knee extension angle was measured. In rats with arthritis, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), induced by passive joint movement, increased significantly in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating the knee joint compared to the naïve rats that received the same movement. The intrathecal injection of a MEK inhibitor, U0126, reduced the phosphorylation of ERK in DRG neurons and alleviated the struggle behavior elicited by the passive movement of the joint. In addition, the injection of U0126 into the joint also reduced the struggle behavior. These findings indicate that the ERK signaling is activated in both cell bodies in DRG neurons and peripheral nerve fibers and may be involved in the mechanical sensitivity of the inflamed joint. Furthermore, the phosphorylated ERK-positive neurons co-expressed the P2X3 receptor, and the injection of TNP-ATP, which antagonizes P2X receptors, into the inflamed joint reduced the phosphorylated ERK and the struggle behavior. Thus, it is suggested that the activation of the P2X3 receptor is involved in the phosphorylation of ERK in DRG neurons and the mechanical hypersensitivity of the inflamed knee joint.

### No differences in clinical outcomes between fixed-and mobile-bearing computer-assisted total knee arthroplasties and no correlations between navigation data and clinical scores [^114Mfb8U]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Oxford Scores of both groups across the time were not significantly different. Ignoring the implant type, there was a significant effect for the repeated measure factor (p < 0.001). The OXF improved significantly for all patients between baseline and 1 year (p < 0.001) and remained stable between 1 year and the last follow-up.

Range of movement of both groups was not different from each other across the time (Table 3). Once again, ignoring whether the patients got a FB or a MB implant, there was an overall significant difference in ROM across the measurement times (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons shown that a 3.8% overall mean ROM increase between baseline and 1 year was statistically significant (p = 0.01). ROM remained stable between 1 and 4 years (n.s.).

The median of the sub-item KSS-Pain was the same in both groups across the follow-up times: zero (severe pain) at baseline and 50 (no pain) at 1 and 4 years. There was a significant difference between the mean KSS-Pain ranks (x 2 = 156.9, p < 0.001). The patients perceived a significant pain relieve from pre-operatively to 1 year (Z = 8.6; p < 0.001). The pain relieve remained at 4 years (Z = 0.3; n.s.) (Fig. 2 a).

### Rest pain and movement-evoked pain as unique constructs in hip and knee replacements [^1173Apa7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our findings highlight the different and complex pain pathways in THR and TKR patients and how there is still considerable scope to improve long‐term pain outcomes. Further insight into the mechanisms underlying pain‐on‐movement and pain‐at‐rest in hip and knee OA could be valuable in improving treatment for patients.

### Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults: an overview of cochrane reviews [^114YBaEh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Description of the interventions

Physical activity has been defined by the WHO as "any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure, including activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits" (WHO 2015). WHO also states that "exercise. is a sub‐category of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and aims to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness" (WHO 2015).

Physical activity for health can take many different forms: it can be structured exercise, such as in classes, gym‐based, or a DVD or programme performed at home; or unstructured and involve adding just a few small activities each day (activities of daily living). Physical activity and exercise can also vary in intensity, duration, and type: aerobic (such as walking) or more focused on increasing flexibility, strength, or balance. Physical activity and exercise can also be taught (or led) by another individual such as an exercise professional, or initiated and maintained through the person's own initiative and motivation.

Both physical activity and exercise can be performed on land or in the water, and can range from whole‐body to localised (body site‐specific) training. Most forms of exercise can also be modified to be performed where there is restricted movement (e.g. in a chair, a bed, or another assistive device).

How the intervention might work

Physical activity and exercise can be adapted for an individual, and is something people can do to help themselves. It is likely to be associated with minimal adverse effects, such as interactions with medication and potential for abuse in adults with chronic pain, when compared to pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. It is therefore an attractive option to help manage an individual's pain if the systematic reviews show benefit. However, current evidence suggests that simply giving an individual advice to exercise is insufficient to bring about significant change (SIGN 2013), and a badly prescribed intervention that does not consider the individual's conditions and present state of health and fitness, such as one that does not incorporate pacing or gradual progression, may bring about adverse events such as pain 'flare‐ups', or lead to cardiac or respiratory events (American College of Sports Medicine 2007). This suggests that supervised or structured interventions may be more fruitful, though this is currently unconfirmed.

### Lumbar stabilisation exercises versus back endurance-resistance exercise training in athletes with chronic low back pain: protocol of a randomised controlled trial [^114Dvkxs]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

In the concept of lumbar stability proposed by Panjabi, fatigue of the trunk muscles increases the risks of neuromuscular deficits, causing uncoordinated movements (ie, poor motor coordination), increasing the instability of the spine and thus contributing to overload and injury in passive structures such as ligaments and joints. The final effect of this cascade of events is pain.

In individuals with CLBP, lumbar muscle fatigue, abdominal and paravertebral weakness, poor motor coordination, imbalance and proprioception can be considered as probable sources of pain. However, in athletes, these mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Guidelines and systematic reviews in rehabilitation recommend active interventions such as LMSE and back endurance-resistance exercises (BERE) for the general population with CLBP based on strong evidence.LMSE and BERE interventions for the treatment of CLBP are well established in the general population, but not in athletes. Athletes in training and competitions perform high physical exertion when compared to the activities of daily living, they have a better physical condition than the general population and yet suffer from low back pain.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^1152AkXM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Movement pattern training — approach and implementation uses personalized, task-specific training to educate a patient in how to optimize their lower extremity movement patterns during activities that are reported by the patient as symptom provoking. The physical therapist performs a series of assessments, observing the patient's movement during standard tests and those activities the patient reported as symptom provoking. The goal of the assessment is to identify the patient's lower extremity movement pattern that is consistently associated with an increase in pain; for example, a common movement pattern noted is excessive hip adduction motion during tasks such as stair negotiation and squatting. When the patient reports increased pain with a movement test or activity, follow-up tests are performed by asking the patient to perform the same movement test or activity with a modified movement pattern; if the patient reports decreased pain with the modified movement compared to the previously performed test, the identified movement pattern is further implicated as a contributor to the pain problem. Specific practice of those activities with modified movement patterns is then prescribed, and patients are encouraged to use these modified movement patterns while performing their daily activities.

### Predictability of simple clinical tests to identify shoulder pain after stroke [^117CAfgp]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify simple diagnostic musculoskeletal tests that can be performed early after stroke to predict patients' likelihood of reporting early signs of hemiplegic shoulder pain.

Design

Case control.

Setting

Multicenter acute care hospitals.

Participants

A total of 152 adults after a first episode of stroke, of whom 135 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty patients were assigned to the experimental group because they reported moderate intensity of hemiplegic shoulder pain at rest. The remaining 105 patients made up the control group.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Therapists measured the performance of combined upper-limb movement including the hand-behind-neck (HBN) maneuver, passive pain-free ranges of shoulder motion, 3 musculoskeletal tests, and the strength of deltoid muscles during each patient's hospital stay. The numeric rating scale (NRS) identified those who reported moderate or greater intensities of hemiplegic shoulder pain during rest and during assessment.

Results

In our study, 22.2% (95% confidence interval, 15.5–30.2) of the patients reported hemiplegic shoulder pain, on average 1 week after the onset of stroke. Positive Neer test (NRS score ≥ 5) during the HBN maneuver and a difference of more than 10 degrees of passive range of external rotation between shoulders had a 98% probability of predicting the presence of hemiplegic shoulder pain (receiver operating characteristic, .994; sensitivity, 96.7%; specificity, 99.0%; positive predictive value, 96.7%; negative predictive value, 99.0%; P < .001).

Conclusions

Three diagnostic clinical tests that can be performed during a bedside evaluation increase the likelihood of determining those who complain of hemiplegic shoulder pain after an acute episode of stroke.

### Women, but not men, report increasingly more pain during repeated (un) predictable painful electrocutaneous stimulation: evidence for mediation by fear of pain [^112r5fs8]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

An abundance of animal research suggests that fear inhibits pain whereas anxiety increases it. Human studies on this topic are more scarce, and the existing evidence seems rather inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the divergent effects of both negative emotional states-that is, pain-related fear and anxiety on pain sensitivity and unpleasantness. Possible sex-related differences were also under investigation, as well as the potential mediational role of fear of movement-related pain on the differences in pain intensity and unpleasantness between both sexes. We employed a voluntary joystick movement paradigm using movements as conditioned stimuli (CSs) and a painful electrocutaneous stimulus as the unconditioned stimulus. Healthy participants received predictable shocks in one condition and unpredictable shocks in another condition. The former procedure is known to induce fear of movement-related pain to the CS+ movement (movement consistently followed by pain), whereas the latter procedure induces (contextual) pain-related anxiety. Results showed that fear of movement-related pain indeed resulted in decreased pain intensity/unpleasantness ratings, while pain-related anxiety led to increased pain intensity/unpleasantness reports. Further, the anticipated sex difference was modulated by time. That is, women gradually reported more pain/unpleasantness, whereas men do not show such a sensitization effect. Moreover, this sex-specific sensitization is partially mediated by (conditioned) fear of movement-related pain. Women also report increasingly more fear of pain over conditioning blocks, while men do not. These results might be interesting in the light of the overrepresentation of women in a number of clinical pain conditions as well as anxiety disorders.

### It hurts to move! intervention effects and assessment methods for movement-evoked pain in patients with musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1115Jajx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the effects of musculoskeletal rehabilitation interventions on movementevoked pain and to explore the assessment methods/protocols used to evaluate movement-evoked pain in adults with musculoskeletal pain.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis.

Literature Search

Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched.

Study Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials investigating musculoskeletal rehabilitation interventions for movement-evoked pain in adults with musculoskeletal pain were included.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analysis was conducted for outcomes with homogeneous data from at least 2 trials. The mean change in movementevoked pain was the primary outcome measure. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework.

Results

Thirty-eight trials were included, and 60 different interventions were assessed. There was moderate-certainty evidence of a beneficial effect of exercise therapy compared to no treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.83, -0.47; P < .001) on movement-evoked pain in adults with musculoskeletal pain. There was low-certainty evidence of a beneficial effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation compared to no treatment (SMD, -0.46; 95% CI: -0.71, -0.21; p = 0.0004). There was no benefit of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation when compared to sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (SMD, -0.28; 95% CI: -0.60, 0.05; p = 0.09; moderate-certainty evidence).

Conclusion

There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise therapy is effective for reducing movement-evoked pain in patients with musculoskeletal pain compared to no treatment. Consider exercise therapy as the first-choice treatment for movement-evoked pain in clinical practice. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(6):345–374. Epub: 05 Feb 2022. doi:10.2519/jospt.2022.10527.

### Pain-related brain activity evoked by active and dynamic arm movement: delayed-onset muscle soreness as a promising model for studying movement-related pain in humans [^115xvZZf]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In previous studies that investigated the relationship between pain and movement, either the nociceptive stimulus was not directly related to the movement, or pain was evoked by isometric contraction. Although pain directly evoked by active and dynamic movement closely resembles the clinical condition of chronic pain, studies for pain with active and dynamic movement are scarce. Indeed, a suitable experimental model for pain evoked by active and dynamic movement has not been established in humans. Such an experimental model would have to satisfy the following requirements: subjects feel pain only when they make a body movement, and they have no pain at rest. Stimulation techniques such as injection of hypertonic saline into the muscle do not meet the requirements. Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is an unpleasant sensation after strenuous exercise to which the muscles are unaccustomed. In DOMS, there is no spontaneous pain at rest, and muscle pain is only evoked by movement of the affected muscles. DOMS, therefore, meets the requirements for an experimental model of movement-evoked pain. Using DOMS, Zimmermann et al. reported brain activation related to DOMS-related pain. In their study, however, muscle pain was evoked by mechanical muscle stimulation or isometric contraction. They did not investigate brain activation related to pain evoked by active and dynamic movement.

The purposes of this study are (1) to examine whether DOMS is a suitable model for the study of movement-evoked pain and (2) to identify brain regions specifically involved in pain evoked by active and dynamic movement. We, therefore, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activations between a DOMS condition in which subjects felt pain in DOMS-affected muscles and a painless condition in which there was no movement-evoked pain at all.

### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reduces movement-evoked pain and fatigue: a randomized, controlled trial [^114TfEL5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex condition characterized by widespread pain and fatigue. Pharmacologic interventions are only modestly effective for treating FM, with most individuals experiencing activity‐limiting pain despite use of multiple drugs 1, 2. It has become increasingly recognized that nonpharmacologic interventions should be considered as first‐line treatments for chronic pain 3, 4, 5 and as safe, low‐cost treatments that can be added to pharmacologic approaches. While there is strong evidence that exercise is an effective treatment for FM 6, 7, individuals report that movement‐evoked pain limits activity participation 8, 9. Use of nonpharmacologic approaches that reduce movement‐evoked pain would theoretically increase activity participation, resulting in a perceived global improvement.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a nonpharmacologic intervention that delivers electrical current through the skin for pain control. Animal studies show that TENS activates endogenous inhibitory mechanisms to reduce central excitability 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In contrast, individuals with FM exhibit reduced endogenous inhibition and enhanced central excitability 15, 16. Thus, based on the mechanism of action of TENS, it may be useful in individuals with FM.

Although TENS is effective for several pain conditions, recent systematic reviews have shown mixed results 17, 18, 19, 20. Johnson and colleagues have noted limitations of the TENS trials currently described in the literature, such as inadequate sample size, limited outcome data, and moderate risk of bias 17, 21. We have further suggested that variables not considered in TENS clinical trials also lead to equivocal results 22. Stimulation intensity must be strong, but comfortable or greater for TENS effectiveness 14, 23, 24. TENS works best for movement‐evoked pain 24, 25 and provides the greatest effects while the unit is on 22, 26, yet prior studies have routinely measured resting pain or assess pain after treatment, when physiologic effects of TENS are no longer optimal 25, 27, 28, 29, 30. Furthermore, few studies have examined effects on other domains such as fatigue, quality of life, or function.

### Shoulder pain and mobility deficits: adhesive capsulitis [^111C1AaC]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis — Evaluation/Intervention Component 4 (intervention strategies for shoulder pain and mobility deficits) aligns interventions to irritability level. For high irritability, modalities include heat for pain modulation and electrical stimulation for pain modulation; self-care/home management training emphasizes patient education on positions of comfort and activity modifications to limit tissue inflammation and pain; manual therapy uses low-intensity joint mobilization procedures in the pain-free accessory ranges and glenohumeral positions; mobility exercises include pain-free passive ROM exercises and pain-free active assisted ROM exercises. For moderate irritability, modalities are heat for pain modulation as needed and electrical stimulation for pain modulation as needed; self-care/home management training focuses on patient education on progressing activities to gain motion and function without producing tissue inflammation and pain; manual therapy uses moderate-intensity joint mobilization procedures, progressing amplitude and duration of procedures into tissue resistance without producing posttreatment tissue inflammation and associated pain; stretching exercises are gentle to moderate, progressing the intensity and duration of the stretches into tissue resistance without producing posttreatment tissue inflammation and associated pain; neuromuscular re-education includes procedures to integrate gains in mobility into normal scapulohumeral movement while performing reaching activities. For low irritability, self-care/home management training provides patient education on progression to performing high-demand functional and/or recreational activities; manual therapy uses end-range joint mobilization procedures, high amplitude and long duration of procedures into tissue resistance; stretching exercises progress the duration of the stretches into tissue resistance without producing posttreatment tissue inflammation and associated pain; neuromuscular re-education uses procedures to integrate gains in mobility into normal scapulohumeral movement during performance of the activities performed by the patient during his/her functional and/or recreational activities.

### Acute compartment syndrome after isolated soleus tear in an elderly recreational athlete [^113vzmSa]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 62-year-old man was beginning to run a short distance race when he felt a pop in his calf while coming off the starting block. He felt a short intense pain and did not finish the race. He went home to ice and rest his leg, but his pain and swelling continued to increase. He presented to the emergency department but left due to long wait. He returned 2–3 hours later when the pain became "unbearable". His physical exam revealed firm swelling of the posterior leg, with taut skin and significant pain with palpation. His foot was held in resting plantarflexion and he demonstrated pain with passive movement of the ankle but no significant increase in pain with flexion or extension of the toes. He had no neurological deficits and distal pulses were intact. He had no history of injury to that leg previously, no history of coagulopathy, and was not taking any anticoagulants.

### The effect of diaphragm training on lumbar stabilizer muscles: a new concept for improving segmental stability in the case of low back pain [^115VEFKh]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Three subsystems are responsible for maintaining stability, namely passive, neural, and active subsystems. The passive subsystem consists of the spine and parts of the spinal joints; the neural subsystem receives information from the structures of the passive and active subsystems, and it stabilizes the lumbar spine by controlling the function of the active subsystem, namely the muscles. The neural and active subsystems are primarily responsible for spinal stability in the neutral zone. The members of the active subsystem can be divided into two groups: global and local stabilizer muscles. The global stabilizer muscles play an important role in performing the movements of the trunk and the hips, while the unique function of the local stabilizer muscles is the stabilization of the segments in relation to each other. Generally local stabilizers include all the deep layer muscles such as lumbar multifidus, transversus abdominis, pelvic floor muscles, and diaphragm. The stabilizing function of these deep muscles can be realized in a variety of ways. Lumbar multifidus has an important role in the segmental control mainly during lifting and rotational movements. Transversus abdominis muscle attaches to the thoracolumbar fascia; therefore, it is capable of increasing the stiffness of the lumbar spine indirectly. The pelvic floor muscles and diaphragm are in synergism with transversus abdominis, and they are responsible for maintaining and increasing intra-abdominal pressure during several postural tasks. Hodges and Gandeviapresumed in a previous study that a possible explanation for the mechanism of the stabilizing function of the diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles is the following: the activation of transversus abdominis prior to the initiation of an upper limb movement results in the displacement of the abdominal contents; hence, the consequential contraction of the diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles is necessary to restrain the shift of these abdominal structures. In their research, they assessed the activation of the diaphragm and transversus abdominis muscle during repetitive arm flexions in standing position. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that the activation of diaphragm occurs prior to an arm movement and happens simultaneously with the activation of transversus abdominis. The exact role of diaphragm in trunk stabilization has been under investigation for > 50 years, but the accurate mechanism still remains poorly understood. There have been several types of research which investigated the functioning of trunk stabilizer muscles during upper limb movement in standing position.–However, there have been few research considering the sitting position.

### Predictors of persistent neuropathic pain – A systematic review [^117Hs9Ph]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Characterization of the prognostic variables for persistent neuropathic pain (PNP) remains incomplete despite multiple articles addressing this topic. To provide more insight into the recovery and prognosis of neuropathic pain, high-quality data are required that provide information about the predictors that contribute to the development of PNP.

Objective

To determine the methodological quality of studies about predictors for PNP and to summarize findings of predictors found in high-quality studies.

Study Design

A systematic review.

Setting

VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Methods

Studies were identified by searching the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Methodological quality of each article was independently assessed by 2 reviewers.

Results

Forty-six relevant studies were identified, classified into 4 different neuropathic pain (NP)-syndromes: postherpetic neuralgia (n = 35), radicular pain and sciatica (n = 3), postsurgical pain (n = 6), and other types of NP (n = 2). Seven studies were of high quality. The 3 high-quality studies found for PHN reported male gender, older age, smoking, trauma at the site of lesion, missed antiviral prescriptions, higher acute pain severity, higher rash severity, more neuropathic characteristics, shorter rash duration, and a lower health status as predictors for PNP. For persistence of radicular pain one high-quality study reported negative outcome expectancies, pain-related fear of movement, and passive pain coping as predictors for PNP. Psychological distress, acute pain, breast cancer surgery, higher body mass index, area of secondary hyperalgesia, neuropathic characteristics, hypoesthesia, and hyperesthesia were found to be predictive for postsurgical pain in 3 high-quality studies.

Limitations

Some publications may have been missed during literature search. The low-quality of the studies could be the result of an incomplete description of their methods.

Conclusions

High-quality studies mainly assessed factors related to disease functions and structures. Due to shortcomings in methodological quality and limited areas of predictor selection, there is a need for high-quality studies focusing on predictor measurement, statistical analysis and the use of a standardized set of predictors.

### Pharmacological and neurosurgical management of cerebral palsy and dystonia: clinical practice guideline update [^112S5nYL]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Dystonia is defined as 'a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements are typically patterned, twisting, and may be tremulous. Dystonia is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation'. When muscle contractions are sustained, individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and dystonia present with stiff postures and hypertonia. In dystonia, the hypertonia (sometimes referred to as dystonic hypertonia) is characterized by resistance to passive stretch of a muscle across a joint, which is present at low speeds, fluctuates with repeated stretches, and where tactile stimulus (e.g. light touching) or purposeful movement of another body part triggers increased tone or increased involuntary postures. When muscle contractions are intermittent, dystonia typically presents with slow repetitive involuntary movements.

Dystonia is frequently present in individuals with CP. CP refers to 'a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations, that are attributed to non‐progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain'. Dystonia exists among individuals with the dystonic subtype of dyskinetic CP, defined by the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe network as being dominated by abnormal postures and hypertonia. Dystonia is also frequently present in individuals with predominantly spastic CP, up to 75% of whom have mixed hypertonia patterns. Dystonia can affect function (including speech), participation, ease of caregiving, well‐being, and is associated with pain and musculoskeletal deformity.

### Shoulder pain and mobility deficits: adhesive capsulitis [^112AbHht]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Medium credibility.

Adhesive capsulitis — stretching exercises: Stretching exercises appear to influence pain and improve ROM, but not necessarily more than other interventions. Results are inconsistent across multiple studies, demonstrating that stretching results in minimal or no difference in outcomes (at 3–6 months) in patients treated with a therapist-directed HEP or other interventions. There is only 1 study for which the authors fully described the exercises performed, with the other studies simply describing the program as active and/or passive exercises. No evidence exists to guide the optimal frequency, number of repetitions, or duration of stretching exercises. Stretching beyond painful limits may result in poorer outcomes, therefore, stretching intensity that matches the given level of tissue irritability is indicated. Kivimäki et al performed a randomized controlled clinical trial (n = 125) comparing a HEP to a combination of manipulation under anesthesia and a HEP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute extremity compartment syndrome [^113HoMYq]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute compartment syndrome:

- **Definition**: ACS is a serious condition characterized by increased pressure within a closed anatomical space, such as a limb compartment.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ACS involves two primary mechanisms. First, the elevated pressure within the compartment can reduce tissue perfusion, leading to ischemia and potential tissue necrosis. Second, the increased pressure can compress nerves, blood vessels, and muscles within the compartment, leading to dysfunction and potential damage.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ACS ranges from 1 to 7.3 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, ACS presents with a constellation of symptoms. These include pain that is out of proportion to the injury, pain on passive stretching of the muscles within the involved compartment, paresthesia, paralysis, and pallor. Complications include nerve damage, muscle dysfunction, and the development of secondary conditions like rhabdomyolysis and AKI.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is largely dependent on the timing of diagnosis and intervention. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical decompression, are known to be the best determinants of good outcomes. Delayed recognition and treatment can lead to serious complications, including permanent muscle and nerve damage, limb loss, and even death.

### Patellofemoral pain [^112yesad]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for patellofemoral pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to classification, APTA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using the proposed impairment/function-based PFPS classification system to guide management:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Overuse/overload without other impairment|- Patients presenting with a history suggesting an increase in magnitude and/or frequency of patellofemoral joint loading at a rate surpassing the ability of patellofemoral joint tissues to recovery|
|Muscle performance deficits|- Patients presenting with lower extremity muscle performance deficits in the hip and quadriceps <br/> - Patients may respond favorably to hip and knee resistance exercises|
|Movement coordination deficits|- Patients presenting with excessive or poorly controlled knee valgus during a dynamic task, but not necessarily due to weakness of the lower extremity musculature <br/> - Patients may respond favorably to gait retraining and movement re-education interventions leading to improvements in lower extremity kinematics and pain, suggesting the importance of assessing dynamic knee valgus during movement|
|Mobility impairments|- Patients presenting with higher than normal foot mobility and/or flexibility deficits of ≥ 1 of the following structures|

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^114zWm4h]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5.1 Piriformis syndrome

Piriformis syndrome, sometimes termed deep gluteal syndrome, refers to buttock and/or leg pain caused by impingement of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle where the muscle crosses the sciatic notch, coinciding with where the sciatic nerve exits the pelvis. This diagnosis is somewhat controversial and its prevalence is debated. In one prospective study, more than 6% of patients presenting with "sciatica" and low back or buttock pain had piriformis syndrome. In studies examining patients with piriformis syndrome, 35%–100% of patients with this condition had radiation of symptoms to the leg, mimicking radiculopathy. Importantly, the supine straight leg raise test, frequently used in radiculopathy, is often positive in persons with piriformis syndrome.

Patients with piriformis syndrome report buttock and/or radicular pain that is often worse with sitting and with increased tension on the piriformis muscle. Reproduction of buttock and/or leg symptoms using physical exam maneuvers that increase tension on the piriformis muscle, such as passive hip internal rotation and adduction with the hip flexed (the FAIR test) and resisted hip abduction with the hip flexed, support the diagnosis. For instance, the active piriformis test, in which patients lie on the contralateral side and tension the piriformis muscle by abducting and externally rotating their hip while the examiner resists these movements has a sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.80. In the passive (seated) piriformis test, tension on the piriformis muscle is generated by having the patient sit with the hip flexed to 90 degrees with the knee in extension, and having the examiner move the hip in adduction and internal rotation while palpating the sciatic notch; this test has a sensitivity of 0.53 and a specificity of 0.90 for piriformis syndrome. The combination of these two tests improves the sensitivity to 0.91 and specificity to 0.80. Tenderness to palpation and/or reproduction of symptoms on palpation of the sciatic notch (Figure 2) is also suggestive of piriformis syndrome.

### Effects of acupuncture and placebo TENS in addition to exercise in treatment of rotator cuff tendinitis [^113mrHjy]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effect of acupuncture with placebo transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) when added to the exercise treatment of rotator cuff tendinitis with respect to pain, shoulder movements and function.

Design

Prospective alternate allocation controlled trial.

Setting

Outpatient department.

Patients

Thirty-three patients (12 women and 21 men) were included in the study. All had clinically diagnosed rotator cuff tendinitis.

Intervention

Both groups underwent a standardized training programme. Each patient received in addition either 10 treatments with acupuncture or placebo TENS, 1–2 times per week.

Main Outcome Measures

The parameters investigated were intensity of pain (measured with visual analogue scale), active, passive as well as functional movements in the shoulder (hand in neck (HIN) and pour out of a pot (POP)). Patients were tested before treatment, after treatment and at a six-month follow-up. Medicine intake, ability to lie on the affected side and sleep disturbances were evaluated. A subjective assessment was made after the treatment and at follow-up.

Results

Sixteen patients had acupuncture, 17 placebo TENS. Eight patients endured pain at rest in the placebo TENS group, and 10 in the acupuncture group. After treatment both groups improved, the improvement persisted at the six-month follow-up. Both groups increased range of movement. Except for the functional test HIN in the acupuncture group, there were no differences between the groups regarding other parameters investigated directly after treatment or at six-month follow-up.

Conclusion

There is no difference between the effect of additional acupuncture treatment and placebo TENS in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinitis.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^116xV7m7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — movement pattern training comparative outcomes are as follows: Compared to the standard group, those who participated in movement pattern training displayed greater reductions in hip adduction (mean difference, −7.2°; 95% CI: −12.9°, −1.4°) and pelvic drop (mean difference, 3.0°; 95% CI: 0.4°, 5.6°) during a single-leg squat. In a subset analysis (n = 27) from a pilot randomized controlled trial, after 12 weeks of treatment the standard group had a significant increase of 4% in gluteus medius muscle volume compared to 1% in the movement pattern training group (P = 0.04), while both groups increased hip abductor strength (14% movement pattern training, 15% standard) and showed decreased fat proportion in gluteus minimus and gluteus maximus (P < .02).

N. Lesteva 1, D. Vasilyev 2, E. Kondratyeva 2, S. Kondratyev 2, A. Kondratyev 2

1 Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Almazov National Medical Research Centre, Sankt-Petersburg, Russian Federation; 2 Almazov National Medical Research Centre, Sankt-Petersburg, Russian Federation

Critical Care 2021, 25 (Suppl 1): P114

Introduction: Spasticity in disorders of consciousness (DOC) is mainly severe, and causes increasing of nociception, impairs physical therapy and care as well as rehabilitation prognosis in general [1]. It is especially likely to happen in patients who suffer spasticity in the upper limbs. Managing spasticity could positively impact neurological status. A regional blockade of the upper limb causes anesthesia and muscular relaxation in relevant zones. That potentially can be beneficial during spasticity treatment, especially physical therapy, which can cause pain and increasing of muscular hypertonicity itself.

Methods: Four patients with chronic DOC after local ethics committee approval received treatment of spasticity added by continuous brachial plexus block combined with the upper limb periodical immobilization via plaster splint in as far as possible extended position. All the patients had been assessed initially, then during treatment and at the discharge with Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Nociception Coma Scale-Revised (NCS-R), as well as passive range of movements in elbow joints were measured.

Results: There was among all the patients increased passive range of movements in elbow joints (10–40o), decreased intensity of spasticity (2 MAS comparing with 3–4 before treatment), nobody had pain level above 1 NCSR during physical therapy (initially they had 3–4). One patient's neurological status improved after treatment (assessed using CRS-R). There were no complications.

Conclusions: Method can be beneficial while treating spasticity in DOC. Further studies are needed.

### Postoperative lumbar paraspinal compartment syndrome [^111rqvCt]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Lumbar paraspinal compartment syndrome is a rare cause of rhabdomyolysis and of chronic low back pain. A universal feature is high creatine kinase (CK) (generally > 5000 IU/L) and rhabdomyolysis. Characteristic symptomatology includes local paraspinal muscle pain exacerbated by passive movements, that is, lateral truncal tilting, forward flexion and straight leg raising, and alleviated with the extension of the back; and tenderness and firm texture/board-like rigidity of the affected paraspinal musculature on palpation. Timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical treatment will usually result in favourable outcomes.

### Optimization of opioid therapy for preventing incident pain associated with bone metastases [^111Dx8R6]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain is a transitory flare of pain superimposed on an otherwise stable pain pattern in patients treated with opioids. One form of breakthrough pain is incident pain, which is due to movement and is commonly associated with bone metastases. The development of this pain is rapid and no medication, administered "as needed", has such a rapid onset that it parallels this temporal pattern of pain. This study used a construct based on the prevention of this event, and implemented a new experimental paradigm. Specifically, the study determined whether increasing the opioid doses above those sufficient to control pain at rest would reduce the occurrence of these pains. Twenty-five consecutive patients with movement-related episodic pain associated with bone metastases, and no evident fractures, were selected for the study. They received a rapid intravenous titration of the opioid dose to obtain pain relief at rest. Then, opioid doses were increased to challenge the therapeutic window. The dose ceiling was determined by the development of limiting adverse effects, rather than optimal pain control at rest. Opioid dose increases were then stopped, or doses were even reduced, according to patients' satisfaction or development of adverse effects with moderate-severe intensity. Basal pain intensity and pain induced by movement were measured using a numerical scale from 0–10. Opioid-related symptoms were assessed using a scale from 0 to 3 (absent, slight, moderate, severe), and global daily doses of oral morphine and other symptomatic drugs were also recorded at daily intervals, and at time of discharge, when the best balance was presumed to be reached. Basal pain control was achieved after rapid intravenous titration. The day after, pain induced by movement significantly improved using mean doses of oral morphine equivalents of 102 mg. In the following days, the subsequent increase in opioid doses prescribed despite optimal basal pain control allowed an acceptable level of incident pain intensity until patients' discharge. A minority of patients developed adverse effects with an intensity of 2–3 on the scale, requiring symptomatic treatment or decreases in opioid doses. Data from this study suggest that the intensity of incident pain may be reduced by increasing the opioid dose above that effective for controlling pain at rest. This approach is based on experimental bone models showing a hypersensitivity to some innocuous stimuli, such as movement, requiring pre-emptive higher doses of basal opioid medication to reduce the increased pain input.

### Evaluation and management of acute compartment syndrome in the emergency department [^1172KNDR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a time-sensitive surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a closed compartment. ACS can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if it is not rapidly identified and treated.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based review of the diagnosis and management of ACS, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

ACS is the result of decreased perfusion within a compartment and is associated with a number of risk factors, but it occurs most commonly after fractures or trauma to the involved area. It can present with a variety of findings, including pain out of proportion to the injury, paresthesias, pain with passive stretch, tenseness or firmness of the compartment, focal motor or sensory deficits, or decreased pulse or capillary refill time. Pain is typically the earliest finding in patients with ACS. Unfortunately, history and physical examination are typically unreliable and cannot rule out the diagnosis. Measurement of intracompartmental pressures using a pressure monitor is the most reliable test, though noninvasive means of diagnosis are under study. Treatment involves surgical consultation for emergent fasciotomy, as well as resuscitation and management of complications, such as rhabdomyolysis.

Conclusion

ACS is a dangerous medical condition requiring rapid diagnosis and management that can result in significant complications if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Emergency clinician awareness and knowledge of this condition is vital to appropriate management.

### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reduces movement-evoked pain and fatigue: a randomized, controlled trial [^113ffY8S]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by pain and fatigue, particularly during physical activity. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) activates endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms. This study was undertaken to investigate if using TENS during activity would improve movement-evoked pain and other patient-reported outcomes in women with FM.

Methods

Participants were randomly assigned to receive active TENS (n = 103), placebo TENS (n = 99), or no TENS (n = 99) and instructed to use it at home during activity 2 hours each day for 4 weeks. TENS was applied to the lumbar and cervicothoracic regions using a modulated frequency (2–125 Hz) at the highest tolerable intensity. Participants rated movement-evoked pain (primary outcome measure) and fatigue on an 11-point scale before and during application of TENS. The primary outcome measure and secondary patient-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline (time of randomization) and at 4 weeks.

Results

After 4 weeks, a greater reduction in movement-evoked pain was reported in the active TENS group versus the placebo TENS group (group mean difference -1.0 [95% confidence interval -1.8, -0.2]; P = 0.008) and versus the no TENS group (group mean difference -1.8 [95% confidence interval -2.6, -1.0]; P < 0.0001). A reduction in movement-evoked fatigue was also reported in the active TENS group versus the placebo TENS group (group mean difference -1.4 [95% confidence interval -2.4, -0.4]; P = 0.001) and versus the no TENS group (group mean difference -1.9 [95% confidence interval -2.9, -0.9]; P = < 0.0001). A greater percentage of the patients in the active TENS group reported improvement on the global impression of change compared to the placebo TENS group (70% versus 31%; P < 0.0001) and the no TENS group (9%; P < 0.0001). There were no TENS-related serious adverse events, and < 5% of participants experienced minor adverse events from TENS.

Conclusion

Among women who had FM and were on a stable medication regimen, 4 weeks of active TENS use compared to placebo TENS or no TENS resulted in a significant improvement in movement-evoked pain and other clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to examine effectiveness in a real-world setting to establish the clinical importance of these findings.

### Movement imagery increases pain in people with neuropathic pain following complete thoracic spinal cord injury [^115Faj4x]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in deafferentation and the onset of neuropathic pain in a substantial proportion of people. Based on evidence suggesting motor cortex activation results in attenuation of neuropathic pain, we sought to determine whether neuropathic SCI pain could be modified by imagined movements of the foot. Fifteen subjects with a complete thoracic SCI (7 with below-level neuropathic pain and 8 without pain) were instructed in the use of movement imagery. Movement imagery was practiced three times daily for 7days. On the eighth day, subjects performed the movement imagery in the laboratory and recorded pain ratings during the period of imagined movement. Six out of 7 subjects with neuropathic pain reported an increase in pain during imagined movements from 2.9 ± 0.7 during baseline to 5.0 ± 1.0 during movement imagery (p < 0.01). In SCI subjects without neuropathic pain, movement imagery evoked an increase in non-painful sensation intensity from a baseline of 1.9 ± 0.7 to 4.8 ± 1.3 during the movement imagery (p < 0.01). Two subjects without a history of pain or non-painful phantom sensations had onset of dysesthesia while performing imagined movements. This study reports exacerbation of pain in response to imagined movements and it contrasts with reports of pain reduction in people with peripheral neuropathic pain. The potential mechanisms underlying this sensory enhancement with movement imagery are discussed.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^115q2evU]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic trauma compartment syndrome — clinical diagnosis and the role of pressure measurement are summarized as follows: Compartment syndrome should be presumed until proven otherwise, and it can occur after relatively minor injuries to an extremity, even in the absence of fracture; patients who take anticoagulants, who have long periods of leg elevation, and those who have been "found down" after a prolonged period are at increased risk. In a patient that is awake with a normal sensorium, the diagnosis of compartment syndrome is best made by physical examination, classically marked by a constellation of clinical findings referred to as the "P's" of compartment syndrome, with paraesthesias, pain out of proportion to injury, and pain with passive stretch as reliable early findings; pain is typically the earliest and most pronounced, and worsening pain or pain refractory to medication warrants further examination, whereas in some patients paraesthesias may be the first detectable finding. Paralysis, pallor, and pulselessness are typically very late findings and may never be present, and the perceived "tightness" or "fullness" of the compartment has low diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Overall, clinical findings have low sensitivity and positive predictive value, but when more than two clinical findings are present the sensitivity and positive predictive value improve; despite exam insensitivity, a negative physical exam without a tense compartment is very helpful to rule out compartment syndrome. In the appropriate clinical context, the diagnosis of compartment syndrome should be made by physical exam, but in suspected cases with an unreliable or unobtainable exam, measuring intracompartmental pressures can be helpful; historically, absolute pressures from 30 to 45 mm Hg were considered diagnostic, although tissue perfusion is determined by the arteriovenous pressure gradient and depends on arterial blood pressure.

### Avoiding, diagnosing and treating well leg compartment syndrome after pelvic surgery [^115h2bSW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

All surgeons who undertake pelvic procedures on patients maintained in the Lloyd‐Davies/lithotomy positions should be aware of well leg compartment syndrome (WLCS).
The risk of WLCS must be noted specifically in the preoperative team brief and WHO time out. Strategies agreed to minimize the risk to each patient must be recorded before commencement of surgery.
Unless mandated by other patient safety considerations, the patient's legs should be kept at a level below the heart for the maximum duration possible during a procedure.
Where elevation of the legs is required to facilitate surgery, the maximum unbroken period of elevation should not exceed 4 h. The patient's legs should be kept at a lower level than the heart for a minimum of 15 min after each 4‐h interval. The duration of elevation and the time allowed for recovery should be monitored and documented in the patient's operation note/anaesthetic chart.
Intraoperative hypotension should be corrected where possible and intraoperative fluid therapy optimized to avoid both excessive fluid administration, or inadequate tissue perfusion.
Any patient who has undergone pelvic surgery in the lithotomy position, whether or not combined with Trendelenberg tilt, who complains of postoperative leg pain should be suspected of having WLCS.
The initial diagnosis of WLCS is entirely clinical, so assessment of the patient with suspected WLCS must be methodical, focused and thorough, and documented clearly and contemporaneously.
Assessment must include: Accurate history – pain, paraesthesia, numbness, weakness, paralysis. Pain – onset, site, nature. Presence of paraesthesia or numbness. Inspection: swelling – unilateral/bilateral, oedema. Palpation: tension in compartments, palpable difference between sides; tenderness in each compartment. Passive stretch exacerbation of pain: dorsiflexion of toes, plantar flexion of toes, dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of ankle. Assessment of sensation, pulses and capillary refill.
If WLCS is suspected, immediate referral should be made to the orthopaedic or vascular surgery team, according to local protocols.
If clinical assessment confirms a definite or likely diagnosis of WLCS, this is a limb/life‐threatening surgical emergency requiring immediate decompression by open four‐compartment fasciotomy. Treatment should be under way within 1 h of diagnosis.
There should be a low threshold for reassessment in patients whose symptoms persist or deteriorate.
If initial assessment is equivocal, for example in a sedated/unconscious patient, in whom adequate clinical assessment cannot be undertaken, and there is a high index of suspicion, measurement of compartment pressures may be used to confirm or exclude compartment syndrome.
If compartment pressure measurement is undertaken, and the difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is less than 30 mmHg in any compartment, an immediate (within 1 h), bilateral four‐compartment fasciotomy should be undertaken.
Reassessment of the compartments in theatre should be carried out between 48 and 72 h after decompression.
After fasciotomy, early discussion with, and involvement of, plastic and reconstructive surgeons is recommended for patients with significant tissue loss.

Interventions – acute and postacute lateral ankle sprains: manual therapy — Clinicians should use manual therapy procedures, such as lymphatic drainage, active and passive soft tissue and joint mobilization, and anterior-to-posterior talar mobilization procedures with pain-free movement, alongside therapeutic exercise to reduce swelling, improve pain-free ankle and foot mobility, and normalize gait parameters in individuals with a LAS.

### Acute exertional compartment syndrome of bilateral upper extremities after a push-up contest [^111t4viX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The patient described in this case report details another example of a rare but highly morbid condition. Regarding his cocaine use, although he denied intoxication during his push-ups, he might not have been truthful. Recent use might have caused a sense of euphoria and decreased perception of pain, increasing the amount of push-ups that he could typically achieve. This overexertion might have predisposed him to develop AECS.

Nevertheless, the clinical diagnosis was made due to the patient's concerning symptoms consistent with compartment syndrome, most notably progressively worsening pain despite a typically adequate pain regimen and pain with passive stretch of his triceps muscle. The diagnosis was then confirmed by the billowing force of the muscles from their compartments as the fascia was incised. The patient then began experiencing an improvement in pain and gradual return in sensation and motor strength after the fasciotomies. With appropriate awareness and clinical suspicion, an early and accurate diagnosis can be made, allowing for prompt treatment to prevent further potentially devastating injury.

Discussion

Compartment syndrome occurs when an increase in pressure within an enclosed myofascial compartment causes a decrease in tissue perfusion within that compartment. Between 4 and 8 hours, muscle ischemia becomes irreversible, leading to osmotic derangements and further edema. Myocyte necrosis results in rhabdomyolysis, releasing toxic intracellular material into the blood, causing renal toxicity and failure. Classic symptoms include pain, pallor, paresthesias, pulselessness, and paralysis. Among them, pain out of proportion to the injury and exaggeration with passive stretch are the most reliable indicators. Diagnosis can be confirmed by intracompartmental pressure (ICP) measurements with a threshold of 30 mm Hg within diastolic blood pressure or an absolute value of 30 mm Hg as diagnostic. The resting ICP of the paravertebral muscles is about 3.11 mm Hg (0 to 11) in the prone position and 7.95 mm Hg (2 to 20) while seated.

Acute PCS has a more indolent presentation. A constellation of 10 signs and symptoms has been developed for increased reliability. It is characterized by (1) an inciting event causing severe localized back pain worsened by flexion and relieved by extension, (2) no previous back pain, (3) board-like muscular rigidity, (4) hypoactive bowel sounds with diffuse abdominal tenderness, (5) localized sensory loss with possible muscular atrophy, (6) CPK level > 2,000 to 40,000 μg/L, (7) elevated serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) level, (8) myoglobinuria, (9) ICP of 70 to 80 mm Hg, and (10) homogenous intracompartmental signal increase on T2-weighted MRI.

Paravertebral compartment syndrome has been an infrequently described phenomenon. Although exertional PCS has been described < 10 times in the literature, deadlifts have become a recognized inciting activity. Although an acute event, PCS must be in the differential diagnosis for severe, worsening back pain and muscle rigidity after weightlifting. The above signs, symptoms, and laboratory and imaging tests aid in the diagnosis, and in our opinion, once ICP confirms the diagnosis, fasciotomy is indicated. This patient fulfilled all diagnostic criteria mentioned previously, a prompt fasciotomy was performed, and he returned to baseline laboratory values and athletic activity.

### Isolated compartment syndrome of the pronator quadratus compartment: a case report [^113xiE3H]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of compartment syndrome that involves the pronator quadratus space but does not affect any of the other forearm compartments. Symptoms consisted of pain out of proportion to examination findings, splinting of the forearm in a 30 degrees pronated position, and severe pain with passive supination. Diagnosis was confirmed with pressure measurements of all forearm compartments at the time of surgery. Symptoms resolved promptly with isolated release of the pronator quadratus compartment with concomitant reduction in compartment pressure in that one compartment.

### Avoiding, diagnosing and treating well leg compartment syndrome after pelvic surgery [^113hD356]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms are typically bilateral, but are frequently asymmetrical, and may even be unilateral. Approximately half of patients complain of pain appearing almost immediately on waking from anaesthesia and over 99 per cent do so within 24 h of return to theatre recovery 6. Notably, the pain is severe and unremitting, and patients may complain that the leg pain greatly exceeds that of the abdominal surgery.

Pain that is severe, unremitting and exacerbated by passive dorsiflexion of the toes and ankles is a cardinal symptom, together with the presence of tension and/or tenderness in the leg compartments. Active dorsiflexion of the ankle, or even of the toes, may be impossible owing to pain and also to impairment of peroneal nerve function.

In patients with unilateral symptoms, there may be a palpable difference between sides. Limb neurology and perfusion, including capillary refill and distal pulses, should be documented but they do not contribute to early diagnosis of the condition 45, 46. It should be emphasized that evidence of vascular insufficiency or numbness is not required for diagnosis; indeed, these are features of a diagnosis made too late, and consequently of irreversible injury.

The British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma (BOAST) 45 state that 'in high‐risk patients, regional anaesthesia should be avoided as it can mask the symptoms of compartment syndrome. In addition patient‐controlled analgesia with intravenous opiates can also mask the symptoms'. However, this is most relevant to the diagnosis of traumatic compartment syndrome (where the analgesia is aimed at treating pain in the injured limb in which the compartment syndrome might be diagnosed). It is not relevant to epidural analgesia (where the aim is to provide effective control of abdominal wound pain, usually without affecting sensation in the legs). Epidural anaesthesia should not be a barrier to the effective diagnosis of WLCS 44, 47.

If initial clinical assessment is equivocal, a repeat clinical assessment in 30 min is mandatory, as WLCS is usually a rapidly progressive condition.

Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis

Although DVT is a possible explanation for postoperative leg pain when associated with a swollen, tense lower limb, WLCS and DVT may co‐exist; therefore, an attempt to diagnose DVT should not delay consideration and treatment of WLCS. The High Court in England found in 2013 that it was not reasonable to delay diagnosis and treatment of WLCS in order to exclude DVT and pulmonary embolism first, in a patient who had recently undergone abdominoperineal excision for rectal cancer 48.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of acute compartment syndrome in pediatric patients [^114St5SR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome is an emergent condition caused by increased pressure within a closed compartment. The most common etiology is fractures, but there a number of atraumatic causes cited in the literature. Acute compartment syndrome occurs most frequently in the anterior compartment of the lower leg, followed by the volar forearm. Patients may present with severe pain, pain with passive stretch, swelling, paresthesias, numbness, weakness, decreased pulses, and delayed capillary refill. No finding in isolation can exclude the diagnosis. Direct measurement of the intracompartmental pressure is the most important diagnostic test. Treatment involves removal of compressive dressings and surgical consultation for emergent fasciotomy.

There was also a benefit in using instructions to decrease the use of a cervical collar, improve posture, and perform mobilizing exercises, when compared to only receiving rest and analgesics, to increase range of motion (ROM) and decrease pain over the intermediate term, and advice to act as usual, when compared to use of a soft collar, for reducing pain over the intermediate and long term.

### Trends in corticosteroid injections for treatment of lateral epicondylitis: an analysis of 80, 169 patients [^115or1sq]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis (LE), commonly known as "tennis elbow", affects 1% to 3% of the population annually and is associated with risk factors such as smoking, obesity, increased age, repetitive movements, and movements with high physical load. Overuse of the extensor muscles results in degenerative tendinopathy, most commonly that of the extensor carpi radialis brevis. This can result in tenderness of the lateral epicondyle and proximal wrist extensor muscle mass, painful resisted extension of the wrist with a flexed elbow, or painful passive flexion of the wrist with an extended elbow — impairments which can markedly hinder work-related and daily living activities. Poorer prognoses are associated with severe pain at presentation, concomitant neck pain, greater daily physical demands, and higher levels of baseline pain because such risk factors are associated with a longer duration of symptoms and greater pain scores 1 year from disease onset. Treatment of LE entails nonsurgical treatment such as activity modification, bracing treatment, NSAIDs, corticosteroid (CS) injections, and physical therapy (PT); surgery is rarely needed because most patients have symptom resolution within 1 year.

There remains a lack of consensus regarding the preferred method of nonsurgical treatment of this condition. Among the most common of these nonsurgical practices is CS injections. Early studies demonstrated the effectiveness of CS in reducing LE pain 6 weeks after injection. However, more recent studies report an increased rate of relapse of LE pain and functional impairment, as indicated by measures of grip strength and pain rating, in patients who received CS injections compared with those who did not, with no notable benefit compared with controls at 3 months after treatment. Additional findings suggest that although CS can relieve acute LE symptoms, they are contraindicated for long-term cases, as evidenced by decreased rates of symptom improvement or resolution among patients receiving CS compared with those receiving other nonsurgical treatments. Additional concerns around increased rates of postoperative infection, need for revision surgeries, and the suggestion that CS injections may be less cost-effective than other nonsurgical treatments have been documented.

Exercise

Pharmacological management often relies on the prescription of analgesics, antidepressants, and/or antiepileptics, but these therapies are not always effective and frequently cause undesirable effects. Nonpharmacological therapies have been advocated as a first-line treatment for patients suffering from FM, including exercise, which is the only strong therapy-based recommendation. Tailored exercise programs are needed for FM patients, but thus far, finding the most appropriate type of exercise that is both tolerable and sustainable for these patients has been challenging. The effects of pain and fatigue on motor function are often under-recognised. Patients with FM demonstrate dysfunctional pain inhibition, whereby they do not show endogenous hypoalgesia following exerciseand may experience discrepancy between their perceived capability and actual ability to engage in exercise. Pain can trigger inhibitory mechanisms in affected and surrounding muscles, contributing to decreased motor output.FM patients exhibit reduced blood flow and degenerative changes in the muscles, presumably due to local hypoxia, creating higher levels of free radicals that induce apoptosis, reduce ATP and increase lactate concentrations in muscle cells, leading to muscle weakness and pain. Another hypothesis suggests that hypervascularisation of tender points increases oxygen availability in muscle fibres, leading to a prevalent use of aerobic metabolism with low lactate production.

More than 80% of people with FM experience poor sleep quality with severe fatigue impacting depression, pain perception, physical functioningand exercise adherence. Reduced attentional and cognitive capacity resulting primarily from fatigue, may interfere with sensorimotor processing and contribute to reduced postural control displayed by patients with FM. This, along with co-occurring joint hypermobility, requires that exercise be performed with neutral joint positioningto avoid potential repetitive use injury. Exercise has low to moderate effects on fatigue for FM patients; however, at this juncture, the literature is scarce and there are no precise recommendations regarding frequency, intensity or type.

Establishing fundamental movement skills and confidence should be the first step in facilitating engagement in activities of daily living and physical activity. Mind-body disciplines may fulfil the need for both exercise and coping skills components of FM treatment, and have been shown to improve balance. The addition of VR and therapeutic exergames offer patients opportunities to engage in meaningful, intensive, and enjoyable tasks related to their real-life interests and daily activities.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute compartment syndrome, more specifically with respect to clinical examination, ALCS-WG 2010 guidelines recommend to obtain clinical assessment to elicit the following signs suggestive of ALCS and establish the diagnosis in alert patients with limb injuries:

- palpable tenseness or swelling of the compartment

- pain out of proportion to the injury

- pain on passive stretch of muscles within the compartment

- paresthesia of skin supplied by nerves traversing the compartment

- paresis of muscles supplied by nerves traversing the compartment

- pallor of skin overlying the compartment

- pulses present.

Strength/resistance exercise

Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise performed against a progressive resistance with the intention of improving muscle strength, muscle endurance, muscle power, or a combination of these. Resistance can come from fixed or free weights, elastic bands, body weight (against gravity), and water resistance. It may also involve static or isometric strength (holding a position or weight without moving against it). Often presented as a percentage of the participant's one repetition maximum (1‐RM) ‐ the maximum weight they can lift/move if they only have to do it once.

Motor control exercise

Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise to bring about activation of the deep trunk muscles, targeting the restoration of control and co‐ordination of these 'core muscles' (Saragiotto 2016).

Balance (proprioceptive) training

Can be performed in water or on land (water may be used initially for support). Exercise emphasises the maintenance of balance during visual and perturbation challenges with eyes open or closed, range of motion, and maintaining stability over reduced areas of support and unstable surface (Silva 2010), that is improving balance in increasingly unstable situations.

Tai chi

An ancient Chinese discipline developed from martial arts, involving a continuous series of very controlled (and usually slow) movements designed to improve physical and mental wellbeing.

Yoga

Arising out of Hindu philosophy. Exercise includes breath control, simple meditation, and the adoption of specific bodily postures. It is widely practised for health, relaxation, and control (physically and mentally). Incorporates stretching and flexibility training with isometric strength training (holding certain poses, with no movement against a resistance).

Pilates

Developed by Joseph Pilates in the 20th Century, it is a system of exercises (often using special apparatus) designed to improve physical strength, flexibility, and posture, and enhance mental awareness.

Duration and dose (frequency/intensity) of the exercise and physical activity interventions

A detailed breakdown of each review can be seen in Table 5.

### Capillary refill [^111LHdHk]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Capillary refill time is defined as the time taken for color to return to an external capillary bed after pressure is applied to cause blanching. It can be measured by holding a hand higher than heart-level and pressing the soft pad of a finger or fingernail until it turns white, then taking note of the time needed for the color to return once pressure is released. In humans, CRT of more than three seconds indicates decreased peripheral perfusion and may indicate cardiovascular or respiratory dysfunction. The most reliable and applicable site for CRT testing is the finger pulp, and the cut-off value for the normal CRT should be 3 seconds, not 2 seconds. Assessment In adults CRT can be measured by applying pressure to the pad of a finger or toe for 5–10 seconds. It became popularized in the 1980s when Champion et al. proposed a CRT of less than 2 seconds be deemed normal and included CRT in the Trauma Score.

The value of 2 seconds for a normal CRT that was proposed by Dr Champion had been arbitrarily chosen by his nurse, and no evidence supporting that value has subsequently been found. CRT has been shown to be influenced by ambient temperature, age, sex, and the anatomical testing and lighting conditions. The most reliable and applicable site for CRT testing is the finger pulp, and the cut-off value for the normal CRT should be 3 seconds, not 2 seconds. To assess shock, central CRT, which is done by assessing capillary refill time at the sternum, rather than finger CRT, is more useful. In infants In newborn infants, capillary refill time can be measured by pressing on the sternum for five seconds with a finger or thumb, and noting the time needed for the color to return once the pressure is released. The upper normal limit for capillary refill in newborns is 3 seconds.

A prolonged capillary refill time may be a sign of shock and can also indicate dehydration and may be a sign of dengue hemorrhagic fever and decreased peripheral perfusion. Prolonged capillary refill time may also suggest peripheral artery disease. It is generally accepted that the test is affected by many different external factors and therefore should not be relied upon as a universal diagnostic measure. In animals Capillary refill time is also used in veterinary medicine. An animal should have a capillary refill time of less than 1 to 1 3/4 of a second. Because animals have fur, the gums are typically used to test capillary refill time. Use Capillary refill time is a quick and cheap way to indicate decreased peripheral perfusion and may indicate cardiovascular or respiratory dysfunction. It has also been used to assess or diagnose diseases of the peripheral circulatory system such as Raynaud's syndrome and hand–arm vibration syndrome.

There is disagreement as to whether the test is useful, however, and it is poorly standardised. Poor finger or toe capillary refill time is a contraindication for the use of compressive techniques to treat peripheral oedema. Capillary refill time is traditionally used as a clinical indicator of tissue vascularity either after limb injury or after revascularization and the most reliable and applicable site for CRT testing is the finger pulp, and the cut-off value for the normal CRT should be 3 seconds, not 2 seconds. In veterinary medicine, poor gum CRT may be an contraindication for use of anaesthesia, as the likelihood of anaesthesia being fatal is higher if there is an underlying heart or lung problem. Gum CRT also used to monitor health during anaesthesia. See also

### Compartment syndrome… [^111tXUVj]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Symptoms of acute compartment syndrome include severe pain, decreased blood flow, decreased movement, numbness, and a pale limb. It is most often due to physical trauma, like a bone fracture or a crush injury. It can also occur after blood flow returns following a period of poor circulation. Diagnosis is clinical, based on symptoms, not a specific test. However, it may be supported by measuring the pressure inside the compartment. It is classically described by pain out of proportion to the injury, or pain with passive stretching of the muscles. Normal compartment pressure should be 12–18 mmHg; higher is abnormal and needs treatment. Treatment is urgent surgery to open the compartment. If not treated within six hours, it can cause permanent muscle or nerve damage. Chronic compartment syndrome, or chronic exertional compartment syndrome, causes pain with exercise. The pain fades after activity stops. Other symptoms may include numbness.

Symptoms usually resolve with rest. Running and biking commonly trigger CCS. This condition generally does not cause permanent damage. Similar conditions include stress fractures and tendinitis. Treatment may include physical therapy or, if that fails, surgery. Signs and symptoms Compartment syndrome usually presents within a few hours of an inciting event, but it may present anytime up to 48 hours after. The earliest symptom is a tense, "wood-like" feeling in the affected limb. There may also be decreased pulses, paralysis, and pallor, along with paresthesia. Usually, NSAIDs cannot relieve the pain. High compartment pressure may limit the range of motion. In acute compartment syndrome, the pain will not be relieved with rest. In chronic exertional compartment syndrome, the pain will dissipate with rest. There are five signs and symptoms of acute compartment syndrome. They are known as the "5 Ps": pain, pallor, decreased pulse, paresthesia, and paralysis.

Pain and paresthesia are the early symptoms of compartment syndrome. Common symptoms are:

- **Pain**: A person may feel pain greater than the exam findings. This pain may not be relieved by strong painkillers, including opioids like morphine. It may be due to nerve damage from ischemia. A person may experience pain disproportionate to the findings of the physical examination. The pain is aggravated by passively stretching the muscle group within the compartment. However, such pain may disappear in the late stages of compartment syndrome.
- Paresthesia: A person may complain of "pins and needles, " numbness, and a tingling sensation. This may progress to loss of sensation if no intervention is made. Uncommon symptoms are:

- **Paralysis**: Paralysis of the limb is a rare, late finding. It may indicate both a nerve or muscular lesion.
- **Pallor**: Pallor describes the loss of color to the affected limb.

Other skin changes can include swelling, stiffness, or cold temperature.
- **Pulselessness**: A lack of pulse rarely occurs in patients, as pressures that cause compartment syndrome are often lower than arterial pressures. Absent pulses occur only with arterial injury or late-stage compartment syndrome, when pressures are very high. Chronic exertional compartment syndrome may cause pain, tightness, cramps, weakness, and numbness. This pain can last for months or even years, but rest may relieve it. There may also be mild weakness in the affected area. Exercise causes these symptoms. They start with muscle tightness, then a painful burning if exercise continues. A few minutes after exercise stops, the compartment pressure will drop, relieving the pain. Symptoms occur after a certain level of exercise. This threshold can range anywhere from 30 seconds of running to 2–3 miles of running. CECS most often occurs in the lower leg. The anterior compartment is most affected.

### Anterior compartment syndrome [^115ahct2]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

A compartment syndrome is an increased pressure within a muscular compartment that compromises the circulation to the muscles. Symptoms and signs Diffuse tightness and tenderness over the entire belly of the tibialis anterior muscle that does not respond to elevation or pain medication can be early warning signs and suggestive of Anterior Compartment Syndrome. Other common symptoms include excessive swelling that causes the skin to become hot, stretched and glossy. Pain, paresthesias, and tenderness in both the ischemic muscles and the region supplied by the deep common fibular nerve are exhibited by patients with this condition. Sensitivity to passive stretch and active contraction are common, and tend to increase the symptoms. Pathology A compartment space is anatomically determined by an unyielding fascial enclosure of the muscles.

The anterior compartment syndrome of the lower leg, can affect any and all four muscles of that compartment: tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneus tertius. This term is often mistakenly used to describe various related/proximal conditions, including Anterior Shin Splints. It is important to distinguish between the two, as shin splints rarely causes serious health problems, while Anterior Compartment Syndrome can lead to irreversible damage. The true compartment syndrome arises due to increased pressure within the unyielding anterior compartment of the leg. The pressure obstructs venous outflow, which causes further swelling and increased pressure. The resultant ischemia leads to necrosis of the muscles and nerves.

The process can begin with swelling of the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and/or the peroneus tertius muscles in response to strong eccentric contractions sufficient to produce postexercise soreness. Diagnosis If these symptoms are observed/experienced it is important to contact a physician specializing in sports medicine, a doctor of podiatric medicine, or other qualified health care professional immediately so as to get the appropriate advice/treatment before serious damage occurs. The 5 Ps of Anterior Compartment Syndrome:

1. Pain
2. Pallor 3. Paresthesia
4. Pulselessness 5. Paralysis. Treatment The only option to treat acute compartment syndrome is surgery. The procedure, called a fasciotomy, involves a surgeon cutting open the skin and the fascia to relieve the pressure. Options to treat chronic compartment syndrome include physiotherapy, shoe inserts, and anti-inflammatory medications.

### Hypovolemic shock… [^111YMZiT]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

In treating hypovolemic shock, it is important to determine the cause of the underlying hypovolemia, which may be the result of bleeding or other fluid loss. To minimize damage to tissues from insufficient blood flow, treatment involves quickly replacing lost blood or fluids, with consideration of both rate and the type of fluids used. Tachycardia, a fast heart rate, is typically the first abnormal vital sign. When resulting from blood loss, trauma is the most common root cause, but severe blood loss can also happen in various body systems without clear traumatic injury. The body in hypovolemic shock prioritizes getting oxygen to the brain and heart, which reduces blood flow to nonvital organs and the limbs, causing them to grow cold, look mottled, and exhibit delayed capillary refill. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of hypovolemic shock can be related to volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances, or acid–base disorders that accompany the condition.

Patients with volume depletion may complain of thirst, muscle cramps, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Severe hypovolemic shock can result in insufficient blood flow to the heart and to the mesentery in the abdomen, which can cause or chest pain or abdominal pain. Agitation, lethargy, or confusion may characterize brain mal-perfusion. Dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, low jugular venous distention, tachycardia, and hypotension can be seen along with decreased urinary output. Patients in shock can appear cold, clammy, and cyanotic. Early signs and symptoms include tachycardia given rise to by catecholamine release; skin pallor due to vasoconstriction triggered by catecholamine release; hypotension followed by hypovolaemia and perhaps arising after myocardial insufficiency; and confusion, aggression, drowsiness and coma caused by cerebral hypoxia or acidosis.

Tachypnoea owing to hypoxia and acidosis, general weakness caused by hypoxia and acidosis, thirst induced by hypovolaemia, and oliguria caused by reduced perfusion may also arise. Abnormal growing central venous pressure indicates either hypotension or hypovolemia. Tachycardia accompanied by declined urine outflow implies either tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade or cardiac failure which is thought secondary to cardiac contusion or ischaemic heart disease. Echocardiography in such case may be helpful to distinguish cardiac failure from other diseases. Cardiac failure manifests a weak contractibility myocardium; treatment with an inotropic drug such as dobutamine may be appropriate. Skin Fluid loss also can occur from the skin. In a hot and dry climate, skin fluid losses can be as high as 1 to 2 liters/hour. Patients with a skin barrier interrupted by burns or other skin lesions also can experience large fluid losses that lead to hypovolemic shock.

Third-spacing Sequestration of fluid into a third space also can lead to volume loss and hypovolemic shock. Third-spacing of fluid can occur in intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, obstruction of a major venous system, vascular endothelium or any other pathological condition that results in a massive inflammatory response. The body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. Typically, there is a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure with narrowing of the pulse pressure. As diastolic ventricular filling continues to decline and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure drops. A key factor in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic shock is the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Coagulopathy develops as a combination of several processes.
