## Question

Will bactrim treat enterococcus faecalis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Bactrim, that is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, will treat Enterococcus faecalis infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of TMP-SMX and the clinical behavior of E. faecalis. Then, I should verify what the FDA and authoritative guidelines say about TMP-SMX activity against Enterococcus. Next, I will check resistance mechanisms that could explain any in vitro and in vivo discordance. After that, I should confirm what the approved labeling includes or excludes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and alternatives for therapy, anchoring this on the FDA monograph and the 2023 ESC endocarditis guidelines to ensure clinical accuracy [^112xDiHY] [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR] [^111U5Rsb].

> Let me first confirm the basics. Bactrim combines sulfamethoxazole, which inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, with trimethoprim, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, producing sequential blockade of folate synthesis and thereby impairing nucleic acid and protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria, whereas Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive organism that causes UTIs, bacteremia, endocarditis, and device-associated infections and is notable for intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms that limit treatment options [^111U5Rsb] [^115u6CNy].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA's specific stance on Enterococcus. The FDA trimethoprim monograph explicitly states that although Enterococcus species including E. faecalis may appear susceptible in vitro to trimethoprim, they are not clinically effective and should not be reported as susceptible, which is a clear warning that in vitro results are misleading for clinical decision-making here [^112xDiHY].

> I should confirm the mechanistic rationale for this in vitro–in vivo disconnect. The FDA document details several resistance mechanisms relevant to Enterococcus, including cell wall impermeability, overproduction of chromosomal DHFR, production of resistant chromosomal DHFR variants, and plasmid-mediated trimethoprim-resistant DHFR enzymes, all of which can yield deceptively low MICs in the lab without translating into clinical cures [^112xDiHY].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant therapy for serious E. faecalis infections to see whether TMP-SMX ever appears. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the 2023 ESC endocarditis guidelines, which recommend ampicillin or amoxicillin plus ceftriaxone for six weeks or plus gentamicin for two weeks for susceptible E. faecalis and, for VRE or resistant strains, high-dose daptomycin often combined with a beta-lactam or fosfomycin, and TMP-SMX is absent from these regimens entirely [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR].

> I need to ensure the product labeling does not list Enterococcus as a target organism. The approved TMP-SMX and trimethoprim labels list urinary pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, but Enterococcus faecalis is conspicuously absent, reinforcing that it is not an indicated target for this drug combination [^111U5Rsb] [^112ufByz] [^116Fq6DA] [^113f8eW1].

> Let me consider the clinical evidence base in the materials at hand. I should double-check whether any trials support TMP-SMX for E. faecalis infections, but what I see are randomized data for MRSA invasive disease and for drained skin abscesses that establish roles against Staphylococcus, not Enterococcus, and there are no supportive data here for E. faecalis infections of any type, which aligns with the FDA and guideline stance [^112Wx9eX] [^116cvZxm] [^117E864F].

> I will now examine pharmacodynamic plausibility. Compared with many antibiotics, the PK/PD index that best predicts TMP-SMX efficacy is not firmly established, and targets have largely been extrapolated from limited data rather than validated across pathogens and syndromes; that uncertainty, coupled with biofilm-rich, high-inoculum settings such as endocarditis or device infections, raises further concerns about achieving reliable in vivo killing of enterococci even when MICs look favorable in vitro [^114C6Hbr] [^113uVBLs].

> Next, I should review other infection domains where Enterococcus coverage is debated. Hmm, wait a minute, I listed intra-abdominal infection guidance twice in the source trace, which is redundant, but either way when enterococcal coverage is chosen for high-risk intra-abdominal infections, recommended agents are ampicillin or vancomycin for susceptible strains and linezolid, tigecycline, or daptomycin for VRE, again with no role for TMP-SMX mentioned, which supports the broader conclusion across syndromes [^115zPStC].

> But wait, what if a lab reports E. faecalis as TMP-SMX susceptible in a UTI, could that be an exception. Hold on, I should verify the FDA language again, because it cautions that Enterococcus spp. should not be reported as susceptible to trimethoprim precisely due to lack of clinical effectiveness, so even a low MIC on a report should not sway therapy toward TMP-SMX for E. faecalis [^112xDiHY].

> Synthesis and clinical answer time. Based on FDA guidance that in vitro activity does not predict clinical efficacy for Enterococcus, the absence of Enterococcus from approved indications, the lack of supportive clinical trial evidence, mechanistic resistance explanations, and modern guideline recommendations that never include TMP-SMX for E. faecalis, Bactrim should not be used to treat Enterococcus faecalis infections, and alternative, guideline-directed agents should be selected instead [^112xDiHY] [^111U5Rsb] [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR].

> Practical recommendation, with a quick self-check for alignment to references. For susceptible E. faecalis, use ampicillin or amoxicillin-based regimens, often combined with ceftriaxone or a short gentamicin course in endocarditis, and for resistant phenotypes including VRE, consider high-dose daptomycin often combined with a beta-lactam or fosfomycin per ESC guidance, with linezolid as a recognized anti-enterococcal option in other literature; do not rely on TMP-SMX even if an in vitro report suggests susceptibility because that is clinically misleading for Enterococcus [^111La9pf] [^117JMtzR] [^111Jpnv9] [^112xDiHY].

No, Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is **not effective** against Enterococcus faecalis because E. faecalis is intrinsically resistant to trimethoprim and sulfonamides, and clinical failure is expected even if in vitro testing suggests susceptibility. Bactrim is **not recommended** for enterococcal infections; use ampicillin or amoxicillin for susceptible strains [^111Jpnv9], and vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid for resistant strains.

---

## Intrinsic resistance of enterococcus faecalis to bactrim

- **Intrinsic resistance**: E. faecalis is intrinsically resistant to trimethoprim and sulfonamides [^112xDiHY], the components of Bactrim [^111U5Rsb].

- **Mechanisms of resistance**: Resistance mechanisms include reduced cell wall permeability, overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) [^112xDiHY], and plasmid-mediated trimethoprim-resistant DHFR enzymes.

- **Clinical implications**: Despite occasional in vitro susceptibility, clinical failure is expected [^112xDiHY], and Bactrim should not be used for E. faecalis infections.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend Bactrim** for enterococcal infections due to intrinsic resistance [^112xDiHY] and lack of clinical efficacy. **Preferred antibiotics** include ampicillin or amoxicillin as first-line for susceptible E. faecalis [^111Jpnv9], with vancomycin [^111La9pf], daptomycin, or linezolid [^117JMtzR] used for resistant strains.

---

## Clinical scenarios and outcomes

- **Urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: Bactrim is ineffective for E. faecalis UTIs due to intrinsic resistance [^112xDiHY].

- **Endocarditis**: Bactrim is not recommended for enterococcal endocarditis; combination therapy with ampicillin and ceftriaxone [^111La9pf] or gentamicin is preferred [^113B6CAu].

- **Other infections**: Bactrim is ineffective for other E. faecalis infections, including bacteremia and intra-abdominal infections [^114RCMHD].

---

## Alternative antibiotics for enterococcus faecalis infections

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Ampicillin or amoxicillin | First-line for susceptible strains [^111Jpnv9] | Highly effective |
| Vancomycin | Ampicillin-resistant strains [^111Jpnv9] | Effective alternative |
| Daptomycin | Resistant strains; including VRE | High-dose recommended [^117JMtzR] |
| Linezolid | Resistant strains; including VRE [^117JMtzR] | Effective alternative |
| Gentamicin (adjunctive) | Combination therapy for endocarditis | Used with ampicillin or vancomycin [^111La9pf] |

---

## Clinical risks and considerations

- **Treatment failure**: Using Bactrim for E. faecalis risks clinical failure [^112xDiHY] and complications.

- **Resistance development**: Inappropriate use can promote resistance and limit future options [^111U5Rsb].

- **Adverse effects**: Bactrim can cause hematologic toxicity [^1143uW9h], hypersensitivity, and renal impairment, especially in vulnerable patients [^1136cCih].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Bactrim is **not effective** against E. faecalis due to intrinsic resistance [^112xDiHY] and should not be used for these infections. Use **ampicillin or amoxicillin** [^111Jpnv9] for susceptible strains, and vancomycin [^111La9pf], daptomycin, or linezolid [^117JMtzR] for resistant strains.

## References

### Trimethoprim [^112xDiHY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. This binding is considerably stronger for the bacterial enzyme than for the corresponding mammalian enzyme. Thus, trimethoprim selectively interferes with the bacterial biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins.

- **Resistance**: Resistance to trimethoprim may be conferred by various mechanisms, including cell wall impermeability, overproduction of the chromosomal dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme, production of a resistant chromosomal DHFR enzyme, or production of a plasmid-mediated trimethoprim-resistant DHFR enzyme. Acinetobacter baumannii/Acinetobacter calcoaceticus complex, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are intrinsically resistant to trimethoprim. Non-Enterobacteriaceae fecal organisms, Bacteroides spp., and Lactobacillus spp. are not susceptible to trimethoprim at the concentrations obtained with the recommended dosage. Although Enterococcus spp. (E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum/E. casseliflavus) may appear active in vitro to trimethoprim, they are not effective clinically and should not be reported as susceptible. Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were found consistently resistant to trimethoprim.

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Trimethoprim has been shown to be active against most strains of certain microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections, as described in the indications and usage section.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^117JMtzR]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy for resistant enterococci, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend administering daptomycin combined with β-lactams (ampicillin, ertapenem, or ceftaroline) or fosfomycin. The recommended doses for adult patients with infective endocarditis caused by VRE species are as follows:

- **Daptomycin**: 10–12 mg/kg/day IV in 1 dose.
- **Ampicillin**: 300 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 equally divided doses.
- **Fosfomycin**: 12 g/day IV in 4 doses.
- **Ceftaroline**: 1,800 mg/day IV in 3 doses.
- **Ertapenem**: 2 g/day IV or IM in 1 dose.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^111Jpnv9]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Low credibility.

If enterococci, especially Enterococcus faecalis, are sensitive to ampicillin or amoxicillin, these should be the initial agents of choice with up to a week of intravenous therapy followed by oral amoxicillin.

For ampicillin-resistant enterococci, vancomycin and daptomycin are the first choices. Resistance to vancomycin, known as vancomycin-resistant enterococci, is increasing. Apart from daptomycin or oral linezolid, often no other alternative options are available. Pristinamycin may be considered for the treatment of E. faecalis, although evidence supporting this is limited for enterococcal implant-related infections.

Intravenous fosfomycin has extensive tissue penetration in inflamed tissue and bone. In an experimental model of foreign-body infection, the combination of fosfomycin and gentamicin showed good biofilm activity against E. faecalis. Further studies are needed before intravenous fosfomycin can be recommended as a standard therapy in enterococcal fracture-related infection, although it may be considered in selected cases. No safety data exist on long-term oral administration of fosfomycin. This route of administration is therefore not recommended for bone and joint infections.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^111La9pf]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of infective endocarditis, especially in relation to antibiotic therapy, the 2023 ESC guidelines recommend specific regimens. For enterococci that are susceptible, the guidelines advise administering a combination of ampicillin or amoxicillin with ceftriaxone for six weeks or with gentamicin for two weeks. This is applicable to adult patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) caused by non-high-level aminoglycoside-resistant Enterococcus species.

- **Amoxicillin**: 200 mg/kg/day intravenously divided into 4–6 doses.
- **Ampicillin**: 12 g/day intravenously divided into 4–6 doses.
- **Ceftriaxone**: 4 g/day intravenously in 2 doses.
- **Gentamicin**: 3 mg/kg/day intravenously or intramuscularly in 1 dose.

### Empiric use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in the treatment of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, in a geographical area with a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens [^114UnsWW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to TMP-SMX-resistant (TMP-SMX-R) pathogens. Healthy nonpregnant premenopausal women with symptomatic lower UTIs were assessed for the presence of pyuria and bacteriuria. If either was present, a urine sample was cultured and TMP-SMX was prescribed. Clinical and microbiologic cure was assessed at days 5–9 and 28–42 after cessation of therapy.

For 71% of patients, cultures grew TMP-SMX-susceptible (TMP-SMX-S) microorganisms, and for 29%, cultures grew TMP-SMX-R organisms. Escherichia coli remained the predominant bacteria in both groups of cultures. At visit 2, microbiological cure had been achieved in 86% of the patients in the TMP-SMX-S group and 42% of those in the TMP-SMX-R group. Similar differences were found at visit 3 by clinical evaluation.

Treatment with TMP-SMX of uncomplicated UTI caused by TMP-SMX-R microorganisms results in microbiologic and clinical failure. In high-resistance areas, TMP-SMX should not be the empiric drug of choice for uncomplicated UTI.

### A comprehensive review of abdominal infections [^115zPStC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Use of antibiotic therapy for Enterococcus in intra-abdominal infections (IAI) is controversial. Enterococcus is often isolated from IAI and is associated with an increased risk of treatment failure and higher mortality. However, outcomes in these patients have shown to be independent of antibiotic coverage for Enterococcus.

The general consensus is that enterococcal coverage is not required for community-acquired infections. However, ampicillin or vancomycin should be added for the following high-risk patient groups: patients in septic shock who have received prolonged treatment with cephalosporins or other antibiotics that select for Enterococcus, immunocompromised patients, patients with prosthetic heart valves or other intravascular prosthetic devices, and patients with health care-associated intra-abdominal infections.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections occur in patients who are immunocompromised, previously colonized with VRE, or treated with vancomycin. In these circumstances, VRE should be suspected and treated with alternatives such as linezolid, tigecycline, or daptomycin. In the absence of these risk factors, specific coverage for VRE is not recommended.

Candida is similar to Enterococcus, in that isolation of Candida from intra-abdominal cultures is associated with increased mortality, but antifungal treatment has not been shown to alter this risk. Therefore, fungal coverage is unnecessary unless the patient is immunocompromised or has a severe IAI with Candida grown from intra-abdominal cultures.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114C6Hbr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Compared with other antibiotics, the pharmacodynamics of cotrimoxazole are poorly understood. It is unclear which pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index (fT > MIC, C max > MIC, or AUC/MIC) best correlates with the efficacy of cotrimoxazole. Target concentrations for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are predominantly based on theoretical assumptions and in vitro measurements rather than an association with clinical outcomes. For the treatment of PCP, target concentrations for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been suggested and used in both research and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in clinical practice. Specifically, sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations above 5 mg/L are recommended. These targets are originally based on two small studies.

The first study included 26 children with PCP and found that 3–5 mg/L for trimethoprim and 100–150 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole resulted in clinical effectiveness. The other study included eight adults with PCP and reported that trimethoprim concentrations below 5.5 mg/L were linked to treatment failure. The concentrations associated with toxicity have been studied more extensively: concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity both in healthy individuals and in patients with PCP. Concentration-dependent adverse events that have been described include hematological toxicity, hyperkalemia, renal failure, and central nervous system adverse effects.

Studies assessing the optimal initial dosing regimen to reach the target concentrations are critical, and further research is needed to establish more definitive guidelines.

### Comparing the cost-effectiveness of linezolid to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: a healthcare system perspective [^114HnjkD]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Few industry-independent studies have been conducted to compare the relative costs and benefits of drugs to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. We performed a stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two treatment strategies — linezolid versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin — for the treatment of MRSA infection.

- **Methods**: We used cost and effectiveness data from a previously conducted clinical trial, complementing it with data from published literature to compare the two regimens from a healthcare system perspective. Effectiveness was expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Several sensitivity analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulation to measure the effect of potential parameter changes on the base-case model results, including potential differences related to type of infection and drug toxicity.

- **Results**: Treatment of MRSA infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin and linezolid was found to cost on average €146 and €2536, and lead to a gain of 0.916 and 0.881 QALYs, respectively. Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was found to be more cost-effective than linezolid in the base case and remained dominant over linezolid in most alternative scenarios, including different types of MRSA infection and potential disadvantages in terms of toxicity. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of €0, €50,000, and €200,000 per QALY gained, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus rifampicin was dominant in 100%, 96%, and 85% of model iterations.

### Trimethoprim [^112ufByz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of trimethoprim tablets, USP, as well as other antibacterial drugs, trimethoprim tablets, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Trimethoprim is indicated for the treatment of initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus.

Cultures and susceptibility tests should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria to trimethoprim. Therapy may be initiated prior to obtaining the results of these tests.

### Functional genomics of antibiotic susceptibility in Enterococcus faecalis from infective endocarditis [^116eKpNC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen that causes infective endocarditis. Despite in vitro synergy of the recommended combination of ampicillin and ceftriaxone (AC), E. faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) mortality remains high. We characterized 119 isolates from EFIE patients in our health system from 2018 to 2023, both genomically and phenotypically.

- **Genetic lineages**:
	- Three genetic lineages (ST6, ST40, and ST179) accounted for 41% of all infections. ST6 isolates were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and AC in dual-antibiotic checkerboard assays but also exhibited decreased survival in dual-antibiotic killing assays using humanized AC exposures.

- **Genetic disruptions**:
	- ST6 isolates encoded a known genetic disruption affecting pbp4 and a mutation in a putative hydrolase called phnP. Functional studies confirmed that both alterations contributed to altered AC susceptibility.

- **Therapeutic strategies**:
	- Finally, we found that ampicillin plus daptomycin showed robust growth inhibition and killing against EFIE isolates with decreased AC susceptibility. These findings enhance our understanding of EFIE and may guide better therapeutic strategies.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^112Wx9eX]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

We used a central computer-generated random number list to randomise patients to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin. Allocation was concealed in sealed, opaque, numbered envelopes that were opened consecutively after informed consent was obtained. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started intravenously at a dose of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily and could be switched to oral treatment using the same dose at the discretion of the treating physician. Dosing was based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that a lower dose resulted in inhibition, but not killing, of S. aureus and on the dose used in a previous trial. The vancomycin starting dose was 1 g twice daily. In both arms, treatment was adjusted to renal function; in the vancomycin arm, it was directed by serum concentrations to obtain drug trough concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/dL. The complete study protocol is available on request. Treatment had to be administered for a minimum of seven days, following which the duration depended on the indication. Concomitant antibiotics, other than the combination of vancomycin and co-trimoxazole, could be administered. After randomisation, no blinding was performed, but outcomes were adjudicated blinded to allocation.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^116oAAwA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. The drug disrupts the production of essential nucleic acids needed for bacterial proliferation and replication by synergistically inhibiting two consecutive enzymatic steps involved in bacterial folinic acid synthesis. It has excellent tissue penetration and is therefore used for the treatment of various infections, ranging from those caused by more resistant pathogens (ESBL+ E. coli, MRSA) to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

Trimethoprim is primarily eliminated through nonionic renal diffusion, with 40–75% of the drug recovered unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. Sulfamethoxazole is extensively metabolized into inactive metabolites which are renally excreted. Approximately 16% of sulfamethoxazole is eliminated unchanged and 46% as N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, the predominant metabolite. Although N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole lacks relevant antibacterial activity, this metabolite has been associated with concentration-dependent toxicity due to accumulation in patients with renal impairment. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is therefore recommended in patients with impaired renal function receiving high-dose cotrimoxazole.

### SPL drug information for trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^11371ZoJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV for the treatment of shigellosis in adults is as follows:

- **Maintenance**: 8–10/40–50 mg/kg IV daily, divided into 2–4 doses, for 5 days.
- **Maximum**: 960/4,800 mg per day.

### Bactrim [^1143uW9h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Folate deficiency**: Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g. the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states), and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

- **Hemolysis**: In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur; this reaction is frequently dose-related.

- **Hypoglycemia**: Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with BACTRIM are seen rarely, usually occurring following a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or those receiving high doses of BACTRIM are particularly at risk.

- **Impaired phenylalanine metabolism**: The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

- **Porphyria and hypothyroidism**: Like other drugs containing sulfonamides, BACTRIM may precipitate porphyria or exacerbate hypothyroidism.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^111TcNMw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The two studies (both type 1) specifically designed to answer the question of this review showed no change in pneumococcal resistance to penicillin. However, one of these studies reported resistance to clindamycin among HIV-exposed infants.

- **MRSA infection studies**: Of type 2 studies, 4 investigated MRSA infection, 2 investigated colonization with MRSA, and 1 reported on colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Three of the 4 MRSA infection studies, all considered good quality, reported a reduction in infection with MRSA. One study, not considered good quality, reported an increase in MRSA infection.

- **Colonization studies**: The type 2 colonization studies reported no change in two MRSA studies, whereas there was a reported increase in colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

- **Heterogeneity and meta-analysis**: Significant heterogeneity was observed among type 2 MRSA cross-sectional and case-control studies; thus, no meta-analyses are presented. However, for cohort studies, the meta-analysis showed a protective effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis on MRSA (relative risk, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.7); the test for heterogeneity among cohort studies was not significant (P = 0.92).

- **Analysis results**: In an analysis of results according to whether the study outcome was colonization or infection, no trends were seen in the data, possibly because of small numbers in each category. Additionally, no trends were noted in analyses of whether the study population comprised adults or children.

### Revisiting the evidence base that informs the use of adjunctive therapy for Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113B6CAu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend adjunctive gentamicin for the treatment of Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis (EFIE) despite a risk of toxicity. We sought to revisit the evidence for adjunctive therapy in EFIE and to synthesize the comparative safety and effectiveness of aminoglycosides versus ceftriaxone by systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: For historical context, we reviewed seminal case series and in vitro studies on the evolution from penicillin monotherapy to modern-day regimens for EFIE. Next, we searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to 16 January 2024 for studies of EFIE that compared adjunctive aminoglycosides versus ceftriaxone or adjunctive versus monotherapy. Where possible, clinical outcomes were compared between regimens using random effects meta-analysis. Otherwise, data were narratively summarized.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis was limited to 10 observational studies at high risk of bias (911 patients). Relative to adjunctive ceftriaxone, gentamicin had similar all-cause mortality (risk difference [RD], -0.8%; 95% confidence interval, -5.0 to 3.5), relapse (RD, -0.1%; 95% CI, -2.4 to 2.3), and treatment failure (RD, 1.1%; 95% CI, -1.6 to 3.7) but higher discontinuation due to toxicity (RD, 26.3%; 95% CI, 19.8 to 32.7). The 3 studies that compared adjunctive therapy to monotherapy included only 30 monotherapy patients, and heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Adjunctive ceftriaxone appeared to be equally effective and less toxic than gentamicin for the treatment of EFIE. The existing evidence does not clearly establish the superiority of one regimen over the other.

### New insights into the antimicrobial effect of mast cells against Enterococcus faecalis [^115huRJv]. Infection and Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis has emerged as an important cause of life-threatening multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in hospital settings. The pathogenesis of enterococcal infections has remained a relatively neglected field despite their obvious clinical relevance. The objective of this study was to characterize the interactions between mast cells (MCs) — an innate immune cell population abundant in the intestinal lamina propria — and E. faecalis.

This study was conducted with primary bone marrow-derived murine MCs. The results demonstrated that MCs exerted an antimicrobial effect against E. faecalis. This effect was mediated both by degranulation, with the concomitant discharge of antimicrobial effectors contained in the granules, and by the release of extracellular traps, in which E. faecalis was snared and killed. In particular, the cathelicidin LL-37 released by the MCs had a potent antimicrobial effect against E. faecalis.

We also investigated the specific receptors involved in the recognition of E. faecalis by MCs. We found that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critically involved in the MC recognition of E. faecalis. MCs deficient in the expression of MyD88, an adaptor molecule required for signaling by most TLRs, were significantly impaired in their capacity to degranulate, reduce E. faecalis growth, and release tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) after encountering this pathogen. Furthermore, TLR2 was identified as the most prominent TLR involved in the recognition of E. faecalis by MCs.

### First characterization of a cluster of VanA-type glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Colombia [^116iijMx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Resistance of enterococci to multiple antibiotics is common, making treatment problematic. Studies suggest that enterococci are inhibited in vitro by 1,000 µg/mL and streptomycin (> 2,000 µg/mL), which further limits therapeutic alternatives. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used as an alternative for treating GRE infections, but it was inactive against the isolates examined here.

As found by others, chloramphenicol was one of the two agents that retained in vitro activity against GRE in this investigation. In a retrospective study of 14 patients with clinical responses, 57% showed improvement after treatment with chloramphenicol. The microbiologic response was 73% in 11 patients evaluated in the same study. Although no lasting adverse effects related to the use of the drug occurred, treatment with chloramphenicol was discontinued for two patients because of chloramphenicol-induced bone marrow suppression. In another study of 51 patients with bloodstream infection due to vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, 61% and 79% showed a clinical and microbiologic response to chloramphenicol, respectively, but no corresponding decrease in deaths occurred. In our study, patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) (eight cases) were initially treated successfully.

### Stewardship approach for optimizing antimicrobial therapy through use of a rapid microarray assay on blood cultures positive for Enterococcus species [^114mYCTH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Enterococci are a major cause of bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients, with limited antimicrobial treatment options due to various resistance mechanisms. Molecular technologies have significantly reduced the time required for identifying enterococcal isolates compared to conventional methods. This study evaluated the impact of rapid organism identification and resistance detection using the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture microarray assay on clinical and economic outcomes for patients with enterococcal bacteremia.

A single-center preintervention/postintervention quasi-experimental study was conducted. It compared inpatients with enterococcal bacteremia from 1 February 2012 to 9 September 2012 (preintervention period) and from 10 September 2012 to 28 February 2013 (postintervention period). An infectious disease and/or critical care pharmacist was consulted with the microarray assay results to recommend effective antibiotics. The clinical and economic outcomes for 74 patients were assessed.

The mean time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was 23.4 hours longer in the preintervention group than in the postintervention group (P = 0.0054). A nonsignificant decrease in the mean time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was observed for patients infected with vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus isolates (P = 0.1145). For patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia, the mean time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy was 31.1 hours longer in the preintervention group than in the postintervention group (P < 0.0001). In the postintervention group, the hospital length of stay was significantly reduced.

### Enterococcus faecalis promotes innate immune suppression and polymicrobial catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^111r6Ko3]. Infection and Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis, a member of the human gastrointestinal microbiota, is an opportunistic pathogen associated with hospital-acquired wound, bloodstream, and urinary tract infections. E. faecalis can subvert or evade immune-mediated clearance, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we examined E. faecalis-mediated subversion of macrophage activation.

- **Prevention of NF-κB signaling**: We observed that E. faecalis actively prevents NF-κB signaling in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages in the presence of Toll-like receptor agonists and during polymicrobial infection with Escherichia coli.

- **Suppressed macrophage transcriptional response**: E. faecalis and E. coli coinfection in a mouse model of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) resulted in a suppressed macrophage transcriptional response in the bladder compared to that with E. coli infection alone.

- **Augmented E. coli CAUTI**: Finally, we demonstrated that coinoculation of E. faecalis with a commensal strain of E. coli into catheterized bladders significantly augmented E. coli CAUTI.

Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that E. faecalis suppression of NF-κB-driven responses in macrophages promotes polymicrobial CAUTI pathogenesis, especially during coinfection with less virulent or commensal E. coli strains.

### Pathogenesis and immunity in enterococcal infections [^11613VYN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium have emerged as multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Multi-resistant strains have acquired virulence genes, resulting in hospital-adapted clones. This review summarizes several proteins, carbohydrates, or glycoconjugates identified as putative virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of enterococcal infections. These may be used as targets for alternative therapies. Several studies describing the host immune response against enterococci are also summarized.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116bLCRt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

After placing weight on good-quality studies and additional weight on studies that were specifically designed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance, the findings of this review offer suggestive evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in HIV protects against the development of bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. More carefully designed studies should be conducted to answer this question. It is important to ensure that future studies evaluate the importance of the duration of exposure to TMP-SMX on antimicrobial resistance.

Ideally, microbial resistance surveys should be included with TMP-SMX implementation in developing countries to alert providers to any changes in drug resistance patterns. Of most importance, the fear of antibiotic resistance should not stop health care providers from giving TMP-SMX to individuals who need it.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^113aZRxG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

The strength of our study is its multicentric and exhaustive nature: including most hospitals, along with all referral centers, in a large area. Additionally, it employs a pragmatic approach to evaluate treatment efficacy by considering the antibiotic regimen actually received by the patient. The limitations of this study are primarily due to its retrospective design, which leads to missing data, a significant proportion of patients lost to follow-up, and the inability to fully control confounding factors in treatment effects despite multivariate analysis. The low number of relapses and patients treated with amoxicillin alone results in a lack of power in the analysis of treatment efficacy. The definition of acute kidney failure did not allow for a reliable assessment of this complication. Finally, we did not evaluate the role of serum concentrations of antibiotics, which might be important to better understand the mechanisms of relapse.

### Bactrim [^111U5Rsb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Microbiology - **Mechanism of action**: Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim block two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many bacteria.

- **Resistance**: In vitro studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination than with either sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Bactrim has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the indications and usage section.
	- **Aerobic gram-positive bacteria**: Streptococcus pneumoniae
	- **Aerobic gram-negative bacteria**:
		- Escherichia coli (including susceptible enterotoxigenic strains implicated in traveler's diarrhea)
		- Klebsiella species
		- Enterobacter species
		- Haemophilus influenzae
		- Morganella morganii
		- Proteus mirabilis
		- Proteus vulgaris
		- Shigella flexneri
		- Shigella sonnei
	- **Other microorganisms**: Pneumocystis jirovecii

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Randomised controlled trial [^113ffv6a]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome was clinical treatment failure at seven days. This was a composite outcome consisting of death, persistence of fever (defined as a temperature below 38°C for two consecutive days without a subsequent increase above 38°C), persistence of hypotension (systolic pressure below 90 mm Hg or the need for vasopressor support), non-improving Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (a decrease of at least 30% for baseline SOFA ≥ 3, or a stable/decreased SOFA score for baseline SOFA < 3), or persistent bacteraemia on day 7. Blood cultures were repeated on day 2 for all patients with bacteraemia and conducted daily thereafter for patients with persistent fever, persistent bacteraemia, or other signs of infection. We defined a primary safety outcome as all-cause mortality at 30 days.

Secondary outcomes included:

- **Failure or modification of treatment**: Encompassed treatment failure as previously defined or antibiotic treatment modification.
- **Bacteriological failure**: Defined as the growth of MRSA on day 7 cultures.
- **Persistence of bacteraemia**: Noted at 48 hours.
- **Length of hospital admission**.
- **Duration of fever**: Calculated as the total days with at least one measurement of temperature 38°C or above until day 30.
- **Development of resistance**: Defined as the acquisition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin-resistant S. aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococci.

Adverse events included:

- **Renal failure**: Defined using RIFLE criteria.
- **Rash**.
- **Leucopoenia**.
- **Diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea**.
- **Other adverse events**.

### Genome-wide identification of ampicillin resistance determinants in Enterococcus faecium [^116jZYSq]. PLoS Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Enterococci rank third overall as causative agents of healthcare-associated infections. Up to the late 1980s, Enterococcus faecalis was responsible for practically all enterococcal infections. However, starting from the 1990s, nosocomial infections with E. faecium became more frequent. Currently, E. faecium causes approximately 40% of all enterococcal infections acquired during hospital stays. Clinical isolates of E. faecium have rapidly accumulated antibiotic resistance genes, including those for clinically important antibiotics such as ampicillin and vancomycin, which leads to treatment failure and increased mortality rates.

In the United States, nosocomial infections caused by ampicillin-resistant E. faecium (ARE) were first detected in the 1980s, with resistance rates steadily increasing to 80% of E. faecium isolates in the 1990s. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) also emerged in the late 1980s and increased rapidly during the 1990s. Currently, VRE is widespread among clinical E. faecium strains in North America but is less common in hospital-acquired infections in Europe. Ampicillin resistance has spread much further and is currently being reported in over 80% of clinical E. faecium isolates worldwide.

In addition to ARE and VRE, the emergence of E. faecium strains resistant to new classes of antibiotics is challenging the few remaining therapeutic options. Thus, the development of new anti-enterococcal agents may become critical for the successful treatment of these infections.

### Sulfatrim [^113f8eW1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

- **Urinary tract infections**: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

- **Acute otitis media**: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when, in the judgment of the physician, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offer some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. At the time of writing, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media.

### Primary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is linked to antibiotic resistance in the Veterans Health Administration [^1154Jg3o]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a major cause of mortality. Although SBP primary prophylaxis (SBPPr) with fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is often used, resistance could reduce its benefit.

- **Aim**: Analyze peritoneal fluid resistance patterns in patients with a first SBP episode with or without SBPPr using the Veterans Health Administration corporate data warehouse and evaluate national antibiograms. Data were extracted using validated International Classification of Disease-9/10 codes, culture, resistance data, and outcomes of 7,553 patients who developed their first inpatient SBP between 2009 and 2019, comparing those with and without SBPPr.

- **Findings**: Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX was calculated using 2021 Veterans Health Administration antibiogram data from all states. The most common isolates were E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus species. Veterans taking ciprofloxacin SBPPr had higher fluoroquinolone resistance (34% vs. 14% no SBPPr, p < 0.0001); those taking TMP-SMX had higher TMP-SMX resistance (40% vs. 14%, p < 0.0001). SBPPr patients showed higher culture positivity, greater length of stay, a higher probability of a second SBP, and higher liver transplant rates compared to no SBPPr.

- **Conclusion**: Multivariable models showed SBPPr to be the only variable associated with gram-negative resistance, and SBPPr was associated with a trend toward longer length of stay. E. coli ciprofloxacin sensitivity rates were 50%-87% and 43%-92% for TMP-SMX.

We reviewed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotic susceptibility testing data among Staphylococcus aureus using three national inpatient databases. In all three databases, we observed an increase in the percentage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that were not susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Providers should select antibiotic regimens based on local resistance patterns and should report changes to the public health department.

### Risk factors for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole-resistant Escherichia coli in ED patients with urinary tract infections [^114CVrxj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended as one of the first-line empiric therapies for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, institutions that observe resistance rates exceeding 20% for Escherichia coli (E. coli) should utilize alternative empiric antibiotic therapy per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. Identifying risk factors associated with TMP-SMX resistance in E. coli may help guide empiric antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs).

- **Methods**: This multicenter, retrospective study included adult patients who were discharged from 12 emergency departments (EDs) with a urine culture positive for E. coli between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between potential risk factors and TMP-SMX resistance. The overall institutional antimicrobial resistance rates for E. coli were compared to the rates seen in the study population of ED urinary isolates.

- **Results**: Among 427 patients included from a randomized sample of 500 with a urine culture positive for E. coli, 107 (25.1%) were resistant to TMP-SMX. Three predictors of TMP-SMX resistance were identified: reUTI (OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.27–3.99]), genitourinary abnormalities (OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.17–4.49]), and TMP-SMX use within 90 days (OR 8.77 [95% CI 3.19–28.12]). When the antibiotic susceptibilities for this ED cohort were compared to the institutional antibiogram, the TMP-SMX resistance rate was found to be higher in the ED population (25.1% vs. 20%).

- **Conclusions**: TMP-SMX should likely be avoided for this population due to the identified risk factors indicating an increased resistance rate.

### Multicenter evaluation of the novel ETEST fosfomycin for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Enterobacterales, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus species [^116dbYGx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical study encompassed several evaluations:

- **ETEST FO performance with CLSI/FDA breakpoints and FDA requirements**: Comparative analysis included 152 and 201 cases at three study sites. We evaluated the performance using CLSI/FDA breakpoints and FDA acceptance criteria. The performance demonstrated an essential agreement (EA) of 98.0% (149/152) and a categorical agreement (CA) of 93.4% (142/152). There were no very major errors (VME) or major errors (ME), and 6.6% (10/152) minor errors. Among the clinical isolates, 18 were categorized as intermediate and two isolates as resistant. These results met all FDA performance criteria.

	- Clinical performance of CLSI/FDA breakpoints demonstrated that for n = 152, the EA was 149/152 (98.0%), CA was 142/152 (93.4%), VME 0/2 resistant isolates (0%), ME 0/132 susceptible isolates (0%), and minor errors (mE) 10/152 (6.6%).

- **ETEST FO performance results**: Results demonstrated 91.0% EA (183/201) and 99.0% CA (199/201), with 0% VME (0/14), 0% ME (0/183), and 1% (2/201) minor errors. According to CLSI/FDA breakpoints, four strains were categorized as intermediate and 14 as resistant.

	- Clinical performance of CLSI/FDA breakpoints: n = 201.

- **ETEST FO performance with EUCAST breakpoints and ISO requirements for Enterobacterales**: The analysis was based on a comparison of results to the ISO performance criteria. A total of 201 clinical specimens were analyzed using EUCAST breakpoints for intravenous and oral use. For intravenous use, an EA and CA of 91.0% (183/201) and 97.0% (195/201) were achieved. Three MEs (1.7%, 3/177) and three VMEs (12.5%, 3/24) were observed among isolates. For these VMEs, the ETEST FO showed a MIC of 32 μg/mL, whereas the actual dilution (AD) showed a MIC of 64 μg/mL. The VMEs were 1 dilution apart.

### Response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci [^116W7iTB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Enterococci are common inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract. Although more than 40 enterococcus species exist, nosocomial infections are primarily caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococcal infections are the third most common cause of nosocomial infections in intensive care units (ICUs), and multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections have been associated with higher hospitalization costs and a higher number of related deaths.

Linezolid, one of the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobial drugs, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of 23S rRNA. In April 2000, linezolid was approved in the United States and has been heavily marketed to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections. Although more expensive than vancomycin, linezolid does not require testing for adequate serum drug concentrations or dosing adjustment for renal or hepatic insufficiency, and it has been regarded by some healthcare providers as more effective than vancomycin in treating nosocomial pneumonia and MRSA skin and soft tissue infections.

Most reports of linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) have been individual cases or small case series or have specifically described linezolid-resistant and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (LRVRE). We describe a large hospital outbreak of LRE infections.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Randomised controlled trial [^116cvZxm]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not achieve non-inferiority compared with vancomycin among patients with invasive MRSA infections. In the subgroup of patients with bacteraemia, the difference in treatment failure and all-cause mortality might be clinically important. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for the treatment of severe MRSA infections. We propose a further randomised controlled trial to examine the feasibility of step-down from vancomycin to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, allowing early discharge of patients with MRSA responding to treatment.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114DjdCU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A total of 501 studies were identified, of which 17 remained eligible for inclusion. Figure 1 shows the elimination process for the reviewed studies.

- **Figure 1**: Process for identification of eligible publications.

- **Description of studies**: Six cohort studies, four case-control studies, six cross-sectional studies, and one before-after study met the eligibility criteria. Six studies were conducted in the United States, four in South Africa, two in Italy, and one in each of the following countries: Kenya, Zambia, Singapore, Spain, and France.

- **Summary of studies that met the inclusion criteria**: Only two studies were designed to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance. The remainder examined the question as subanalyses of studies which had been designed to answer a different question.

There were two comparison groups for bacterial resistance to antibiotics other than TMP-SMX: studies in which all participants were infected and/or colonized and in which rates of bacterial resistance were compared between those taking or not taking TMP-SMX. Most type 1 studies reported on pneumococcal resistance to penicillin. Type 2 studies compared those who had a resistant infection/colonization with those who were not infected/colonized. Most type 2 studies reported on infection and/or colonization with MRSA.

- **Description of the quality of studies**: Studies that did not control for confounders of interest, such as the stage of HIV disease, prior hospitalization, and previous antibiotic use, were considered to be of poorer quality. Only eight of the 17 studies addressed these factors.

### Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^115nBctr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Sulfonamides have a glorious history. In 1935, they were the first class of true antimicrobial agents with life-saving potency. Today, 66 years later, increased bacterial resistance to sulfonamides and to trimethoprim (TMP), a synthetic antimicrobial agent that is 30 years younger than sulfonamides, has limited their use to only a few indications. In the treatment and prophylaxis of patients with urinary tract infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) or TMP alone is still considered the first-line drug of choice, although increased bacterial resistance to these agents has been linked with treatment failure.

TMP-SMZ has a possible role as a second- or third-line treatment for patients who have respiratory tract infections. In the developing world, where this inexpensive drug is widely used as first-line treatment, bacterial resistance has caused problems, especially with regard to the treatment of patients with severe respiratory tract infections. Use of TMP-SMZ as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection has rapidly increased the multidrug resistance of bacterial pathogens found in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.

Today, detailed and reliable knowledge on the resistance of bacterial pathogens to both TMP-SMZ and TMP is an essential requirement for the safe and effective use of these drugs in all clinical settings.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^112BFkK7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been shown to reduce HIV-related mortality among adults and children when used as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Since 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS have recommended TMP-SMX prophylaxis for immunosuppressed adults and children born to HIV-infected women.

The successful roll-out of antiretroviral drugs has reduced the importance of TMP-SMX prophylaxis in developed countries. However, in resource-limited settings where antiretroviral therapy coverage is still incomplete and where confirmation of HIV infection in children under 18 months of age is limited, TMP-SMX prophylaxis remains vital for improving HIV management outcomes.

Despite widespread recommendations and the availability of convincing evidence of the effectiveness of TMP-SMX, the implementation of its use has been poor. The WHO estimated that, in 2006, only 1% of the 4 million children eligible for TMP-SMX received it. In Zimbabwe in 2007, only 10.5% of children eligible for TMP-SMX received it.

In Africa, barriers to implementation include shortages of trained staff, stock-outs of TMP-SMX, and failure of healthcare systems to identify individuals eligible for TMP-SMX prophylaxis. In addition, there is anxiety that it may not be cost-effective. However, new evidence of the intervention's cost-effectiveness may alleviate these concerns.

Furthermore, there has been a concern that this intervention will not work in areas where resistance to TMP-SMX is thought to be high. Fortunately, there is now convincing evidence available.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: Mechanisms and clinical observations [^114X9MPA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enterococci are not generally regarded as highly virulent bacterial pathogens; however, resistance to many antimicrobial drugs complicates the treatment of enterococcal infections. Acquired resistance to high concentrations of glycopeptide antibiotics, specifically vancomycin, has exacerbated this problem. This article seeks to concisely review the mechanisms of that resistance and its effects on the clinical management of enterococcal infections, as well as clinical microbiology and infection control.

### Impact of Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis treatment on risk of relapse [^1133wAFB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of the A-G combination with other regimens**: The cumulative incidence of relapse 1 year after endocarditis diagnosis was 46.2% (95% CI: 17.8%–85.8%) for patients treated with A, 13.4% (7.2%–24.2%) for patients treated with A-G, and 14.7% (8.6%–24.5%) with A-C therapy. The lowest incidence was 4.3% (1.1%–16.0%) for patients sequentially treated with A-G/A-C.

- **Figure 2**: Cumulative incidence of relapse and survival probability according to the treatment received.
	- **A**: Cumulative incidence of relapse according to the treatment received in a Fine and Gray model (death considered as a competitive risk).
	- **B**: Survival probability according to the treatment received in a Cox model. Comparison of different treatments with A-G combination considered as reference. Abbreviations: aHR, adjusted hazard ratio; aSHR, adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval.

When comparing the risk of relapse according to the treatment received, with A-G as a reference, no significant difference was observed in univariate and multivariate analysis. In a sensitivity analysis considering only patients who received complete treatment, treatment with A showed a significantly higher risk of relapse than A-G in multivariate analysis (aSHR 5.41, 95% CI: 1.19–24.6, P = .03).

Patients treated with A-C had a significantly higher risk of death compared to A-G in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: Epidemiology, infection prevention, and control [^115u6CNy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is a pathogen of growing concern due to the increasing development of antibiotic resistance, the lengthening of hospitalizations, and excess mortality. The utility of some infection control practices is debatable as newer developments in infection prevention strategies continue to emerge. This article summarizes the significance of VRE and its transmission, while also highlighting key changes in infection control practices within the past five years.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114oUcbz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to type 1 studies, type 2 studies provided stronger evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects from infection with drug-resistant bacteria. Four studies, all considered of good quality, reported reduced infection and/or colonization with MRSA. Additionally, one study, also regarded as good quality, reported no change in MRSA colonization. However, two lower-quality studies in this group reported increased MRSA prevalence. The meta-analysis of MRSA cohort studies demonstrated a 70% protective effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis against MRSA infection (relative risk, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.7).

It is plausible that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against infection with drug-resistant bacteria. TMP-SMX may directly protect against colonization and/or infection with drug-susceptible bacterial pathogens. Indirect protection may result as the individual has less exposure to conditions identified as risk factors for infection and/or colonization with drug-resistant bacteria. For instance, patients may no longer require frequent hospitalization or be less likely to be exposed to intravenous catheters, conditions known to increase antibiotic resistance. Consequently, patients may be less likely to receive other antibiotics for treating infections, and such exposure to antibiotics has been shown to increase antibiotic resistance.

The finding by Gill et al. that pneumococcal resistance to one of five antibiotics increased while resistance levels for the other four drugs remained unchanged suggests that it is possible for TMP-SMX prophylaxis to influence bacterial resistance patterns.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^1117KD1j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A systematic review was designed to explore whether cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV increases bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. There is suggestive evidence that cotrimoxazole protects against antibiotic resistance.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116gcvqq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has long been recommended for immunosuppressed HIV-infected adults and children born to HIV-infected women. Despite this, many resource-limited countries have not implemented this recommendation, partly because of fear of widespread antimicrobial resistance not only to TMP-SMX, but also to other antibiotics. We aimed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV-infected and/or exposed individuals increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics other than TMP-SMX.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted in Medline, Global Health, Embase, Web of Science, ELDIS, and ID21.

- **Results**: A total of 501 studies were identified, and 17 met the inclusion criteria. Only 8 studies were of high quality, of which only 2 had been specifically designed to answer this question. Studies were classified as (1) studies in which all participants were infected and/or colonized and in which rates of bacterial resistance were compared between those taking or not taking TMP-SMX and (2) studies comparing those who had a resistant infection with those who were not infected. Type 1 studies showed weak evidence that TMP-SMX protects against resistance. Type 2 studies provided more convincing evidence that TMP-SMX protects against infection.

There was some evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against resistance to other antibiotics. However, more carefully designed studies are needed to answer the question conclusively.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^111evnh8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Seventeen of 501 studies identified met the eligibility criteria of this review. Of the eight studies that were considered to have fair protection from bias and confounding, only two studies were specifically designed to evaluate the effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis on antibiotic resistance. In the remaining studies, the effect of TMP-SMX was examined in subanalyses, which often had low precision.

The studies were classified according to types of comparison groups:

- **Type 1 studies**: Analysis included patients who were all infected/colonized, and comparisons of antibiotic resistance levels were made between those receiving TMP-SMX and those who were not. No patterns were observed in these studies. Among the three studies considered to be of good quality in this group, one reported no change in pneumococcal resistance after TMP-SMX use, one reported an increase in resistance, and one had mixed findings: an increase in pneumococcal resistance to clindamycin but no change in resistance to four other drugs.

- **Type 2 studies**: Straightforward comparisons were made between patients who developed drug-resistant infections/colonizations and those who did not have infections/colonizations.

For the type 1 studies, it may be appropriate to place additional weight on the two cohort studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of TMP-SMX prophylaxis on antibiotic resistance. The rationale for this is twofold. First, cohort studies are considered the most robust designs for observational studies because they are least likely to have bias and confounding. Second, because the studies were designed to…

### Antimicrobial resistance in uncomplicated urinary tract infections in 3 California EDs [^113BJ4DK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Increased trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) resistance has led to changes in empiric treatment of female urinary tract infections (UTI) in the emergency department (ED), particularly increased use of fluoroquinolones (Acad Emerg Med. 2009;16(6):500–507). Whether prescribing changes have affected susceptibility in uropathogens is unclear. Using narrow-spectrum agents and therapy tailored to local susceptibilities remain important goals.

- **Objective**: The primary goal of this study is to characterize the susceptibility patterns of uropathogens among ambulatory female ED patients with UTI. Its secondary goal is to identify demographic or clinical factors predictive of resistance to narrow-spectrum agents.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study of women with suspected UTI referred to a trial of computer kiosk-aided treatment of UTI in 3 Northern California EDs. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from the kiosk and chart, and features associated with resistance were identified by bivariate and multivariable regression analysis.

- **Results**: Two hundred eighty-three participants, aged 15 to 84 years, were diagnosed with UTI and cultured. One hundred thirty-five (48%) of cultures were positive, with full susceptibilities reported (81% Escherichia coli). Only 2 isolates (1.5%) were fluoroquinolone resistant. Resistance to TMP/SMX was 18%, to nitrofurantoin 5%, and to cefazolin 4%. Seventy-four percent were sensitive to all 3 narrow-spectrum agents. Resistance to narrow-spectrum agents did not vary significantly by diagnosis, age, recent UTI, or any clinical factors.

### A review of combination antimicrobial therapy for Enterococcus faecalis bloodstream infections and infective endocarditis [^117UXbiE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Enterococci, one of the most common causes of hospital-associated infections, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Enterococcus faecalis, the more common and virulent species, causes serious high-inoculum infections, namely infective endocarditis, that are associated with cardiac surgery and mortality rates that have remained unchanged for the last 30 years. The best cures for these infections are observed with combination antibiotic therapy; however, optimal treatment has not been fully elucidated. It is the purpose of this review to highlight treatment options and their limitations, and provide direction for future investigative efforts to aid in the treatment of these severe infections.

While ampicillin plus ceftriaxone has emerged as a preferred treatment option, mortality rates continue to be high. From a safety standpoint, ceftriaxone, unlike other cephalosporins, promotes colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci due to high biliary concentrations. More research is needed to improve patient outcomes from this high-mortality disease.

### Bactrim [^116Fq6DA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Bactrim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

- **Urinary tract infections**: For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

- **Acute otitis media**: For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when, in the judgment of the physician, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offer some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. At the time of writing, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of Bactrim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Bactrim is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

### Emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [^111VAZbJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Vancomycin and ampicillin resistance in clinical *Enterococcus faecium* strains has developed in the past decade. Failure to adhere to strict infection control to prevent the spread of these pathogens has been well established. New data implicate the use of specific classes of antimicrobial agents in the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins and drugs with potent activity against anaerobic bacteria may promote infection and colonization with VRE and may exert different effects on the initial establishment and persistence of high-density colonization. Control of VRE will require a better understanding of the mechanisms by which different classes of drugs promote gastrointestinal colonization.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^114thHFN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence regarding whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis causes an increase in bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. From a public health perspective, an increase in resistance would reduce the usefulness of first-line antibiotics and result in fewer options for treating common bacterial infections in developing countries. From an individual perspective, patients receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis may be at increased risk of treatment failure when they acquire a bacterial infection, although this has not been demonstrated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of TMP-SMX.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^114TwFBw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The effect of third-generation cephalosporins on the risk for VRE is likely due to their activity against nonenterococcal aerobic enteric flora, leading to a decrease in resistance colonization and allowing colonization with VRE. Similarly, suppression of gastrointestinal anaerobic flora is the presumed mechanism for the association between metronidazole and VRE. This activity and suppression do not explain the lack of effect of other agents with similar or even broader spectra of activity, such as clindamycin, β-lactamase–inhibitor combinations, and imipenem. Other researchers have suggested that the combination of the enteric concentration of the antimicrobial agent and its spectrum of activity against competing microflora determines its likelihood to be a risk factor (Rice LB, unpub. data).

In our study, the positive association between the duration of quinolone treatment and VRE had borderline statistical significance and a small increased risk per day of treatment. This observation, which requires further validation, may have important clinical implications for patients treated for long durations.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^113uVBLs]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

- **Study highlights**: Cotrimoxazole is an antibiotic combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, effective against both Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative pathogens. Sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations > 5 mg/L have been associated with clinical effectiveness for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, its metabolite N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity. All three components are cleared to some extent by renal clearance.

- **What question did this study address?** Which dosing regimens of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be used to reach the target concentrations for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and which dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal insufficiency or with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)?

- **What does this study add to our knowledge?** TID 1,920 mg and b.i.d. 2,400 mg lead to sufficient exposure for infections with P. jirovecii in patients without renal insufficiency. To reach equivalent exposure, a dose reduction of 33.3% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m² and of 16.7% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m². N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates in patients with a reduced eGFR. CRRT increased the clearance of sulfamethoxazole, but not trimethoprim or N-acetyl sulfamethoxazole, compared with the median clearance in the population.

- **How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science?** The dosing regimens suggested in the study provide guidance on achieving effective and safe concentrations of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes for individuals requiring this treatment.

### SPL drug information for trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^1136cCih]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Blood dyscrasias**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.

- **Crystalluria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.

- **Decreased blood glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.

- **Hemolysis**: Use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocyt.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo for uncomplicated skin abscess [^117E864F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscesses have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for patients with a drained abscess is unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was the clinical cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.

- **Results**: The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P < 0.001). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^113o2SD7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis of studies relating to colonization and/or infection with MRSA shows the potential effect of differing study designs on resistance outcomes. The two cohort studies, considered the most robust, clearly showed reduced MRSA colonization and/or infection, both individually and when combined, whereas the cross-sectional and case-control studies showed no effect.

This literature review had several limitations. Because TMP-SMX prophylaxis has long been proven to save lives of HIV-infected patients, only observational studies, which have more potential for bias and confounding, were available for review. Most studies did not control for factors known to independently increase antibiotic resistance. For example, only three studies adjusted for HIV disease progression or previous hospitalization. Previous hospitalization has been reported as an important risk factor for colonization or infection with MRSA.

Most studies did not provide data on the duration of exposure to TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Of the studies that did, the duration of exposure is shorter than expected in clinical practice in resource-limited settings. Because of the shortage of antiretroviral therapy in such settings, HIV-infected adults are likely to be receiving TMP-SMX prophylaxis for much longer periods than was evaluated in these studies. However, the finding from Gill et al. may be more generalizable to HIV-exposed infants because TMP-SMX was given according to guidelines used in many resource-limited settings.

Most studies only evaluated resistance to one antibiotic. This makes it difficult to fully understand the breadth of resistance induction across different antibiotic classes.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole: Dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^112XBvAd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Low credibility.

We did not estimate the optimal dosing regimens for infections other than PCP. In the literature, target concentrations have been suggested for infections caused by other pathogens; however, these target concentrations are based predominantly on in vitro studies and are not clinically validated. For PCP, the evidence for the target range is also limited to small studies; therefore, larger studies are needed to establish the optimal concentrations for effectiveness.

To further optimize the dosing regimens of cotrimoxazole, additional research is needed to investigate its PK/PD, PK/toxicity, post-antibiotic effect, and tissue penetration. In a murine thigh model, AUC/MIC was found to best predict the effectiveness for MRSA infections. However, T > MIC, C max > MIC, and species-dependent associations have also been suggested. Based on the specific association for a certain pathogen, alternative dosing regimens could be explored.

For instance, beta-lactam antibiotics are often administered via continuous infusion because T > MIC best predicts their effectiveness. If T > MIC is also a predictor of cotrimoxazole's effectiveness, shortening the dose interval or using continuous infusion might be beneficial. If C max best predicts the effectiveness and there is sufficient post-antibiotic effect, high doses with a prolonged dosing interval might be more effective. Furthermore, because of the high tissue penetration of both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, the target site concentrations might be higher compared with plasma concentrations, and require alternative dosing regimens based on this consideration.

### Management of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections [^114RCMHD]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterococci are organisms with a remarkable ability to adapt to the environment and acquire antibiotic resistance determinants. The evolution of antimicrobial resistance in these organisms poses enormous challenges for clinicians when faced with patients affected by severe infections. The increased prevalence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium worldwide has resulted in a major decrease in therapeutic options because the majority of E. faecium isolates are now resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin and exhibit high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. These are three of the traditionally most useful anti-enterococcal antibiotics. Newer antibiotics such as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline have good in vitro activity against enterococcal isolates, although their clinical use may be limited in certain scenarios due to reduced rates of success, possible underdosing for enterococci, and low serum levels, respectively, as well as the emergence of resistance. The experimental agent oritavancin may offer some hope for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, but clinical data are still lacking. Thus, optimal therapies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections continue to be based on empirical observations and extrapolations from in vitro and animal data. Clinical studies evaluating new strategies, including combination therapies, to treat severe vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections are urgently needed.
