## Question

For a patient with TBI coming into ED after intubation what is more important stat labs, stat CT or starting my tube and Foley catheter and administering mannitol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which priority is most important for a patient with traumatic brain injury who arrives in the emergency department already intubated: obtaining stat labs, obtaining a stat head CT, or inserting a urinary catheter and administering mannitol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate threats to life and brain in severe TBI. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about imaging and osmotic therapy timing. Next, I will examine the role and timing of labs and urinary catheterization. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-critical sequence and state the single most important action with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. An intubated TBI patient typically has severe injury and is at high risk for secondary brain insults from hypoxia, hypotension, and rising intracranial pressure; rapid identification of mass lesions and herniation risk is time-critical to outcomes, and delays in CT can worsen prognosis in this population [^3fac3a1f] [^da8a3a99].

> I need to check the hierarchy of priorities. Airway is secured, so the next immediate threats are breathing and circulation, followed rapidly by identification of surgically remediable intracranial pathology; this aligns with ATLS-style sequencing adapted for severe TBI, where early CT is prioritized to detect hematomas or contusions requiring urgent neurosurgical intervention, while simultaneously stabilizing hemodynamics and avoiding hypotension and hypoxia [^3fac3a1f] [^da8a3a99].

> Now, let me verify the role of stat head CT. Noncontrast head CT is the standard initial imaging for moderate-to-severe TBI and for any intubated patient with suspected intracranial injury; it should be obtained urgently because it directly changes management by revealing hemorrhage, mass effect, or herniation that may require immediate surgery or escalation of medical therapy, and guidelines endorse early CT in this exact scenario [^da8a3a99] [^2907af29].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mannitol. I initially thought mannitol might be a top priority, but wait, let me verify the indications and timing. Mannitol is indicated for control of raised ICP or signs of transtentorial herniation, and it should be restricted before ICP monitoring to patients with herniation or progressive neurologic deterioration not due to extracranial causes; moreover, mannitol can precipitate hypotension, which is harmful in TBI, so it should not be given indiscriminately without a target and hemodynamic stability [^5c9d2771] [^b5f8103b] [^ec300e4d].

> Next, I should review the role of stat labs. Essential labs such as CBC, electrolytes including sodium, renal function, coagulation profile, and glucose should be obtained early, but they rarely change the immediate need for CT in severe TBI; they support subsequent decisions like osmotherapy, transfusion, and anticoagulant reversal, yet they can be drawn while CT is being obtained and processed in parallel rather than delaying imaging [^da8a3a99].

> I will now examine the urinary catheter question. A Foley catheter supports accurate output monitoring and facilitates osmotic therapy, but it is not time-critical in the first few minutes; it can be placed after CT is ordered or while CT is being performed, so it should not delay imaging or emergent neurosurgical decisions [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the sequence. The most important immediate action is to obtain a stat noncontrast head CT without delay, because it identifies life-threatening mass lesions and guides urgent neurosurgical management; concurrently, secure hemodynamics, avoid hypotension, and draw stat labs, and only consider mannitol if there are signs of herniation or progressive neurologic decline while ensuring blood pressure is adequate, while placing a urinary catheter when feasible but not at the expense of delaying CT or neurosurgical consultation [^da8a3a99] [^5c9d2771] [^b5f8103b].

> But wait, what if the patient is profoundly hypotensive from hemorrhage? I should double-check that circulation is prioritized in exsanguinating trauma, and yes, in polytrauma with exsanguination, circulation-first strategies can be appropriate; however, in an isolated severe TBI without ongoing hemorrhage, the brain-directed priority remains early CT to detect operable lesions while maintaining MAP and CPP, so the answer still holds for this specific question context [^81eba531] [^b7c2ee85].

> Final answer: Stat head CT is the most important immediate priority for an intubated TBI patient arriving in the ED, because it rapidly identifies surgically treatable intracranial pathology and dictates urgent management; stat labs should be obtained in parallel, mannitol should be reserved for herniation or progressive decline with stable blood pressure, and a urinary catheter can follow without delaying care [^da8a3a99] [^5c9d2771] [^b5f8103b].

---

In the ED, **stat CT head** is the most critical next step for an intubated TBI patient because it rapidly identifies life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect requiring immediate neurosurgical intervention [^da8a3a99]. Stat labs (CBC, CMP, coagulation profile, ABG) are important but **should not delay CT**; they can be drawn while CT is being obtained. Urinary catheterization is not urgent and can be done after CT. Mannitol is only indicated if there are signs of herniation or progressive neurologic decline, and should be given only after confirming hemodynamic stability and discussing with neurosurgery [^5c9d2771] [^b5f8103b]. Prioritize CT first, then labs, then catheter, and reserve mannitol for specific indications.

---

## Clinical priorities in the ED for intubated TBI patients

### Immediate priorities (within minutes)

- **Airway and breathing**: Already secured by intubation; confirm tube position and maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation [^3fac3a1f].
- **Circulation**: Ensure hemodynamic stability; avoid hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) to prevent secondary brain injury [^b5f8103b].
- **Neurologic assessment**: Document GCS, pupillary size/reactivity, and motor response; repeat frequently [^3644545d].

---

### Secondary priorities (within the first hour)

- **Stat head CT**: Non-contrast CT is the gold standard to rapidly identify intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or herniation requiring urgent intervention [^da8a3a99].
- **Stat labs**: CBC, CMP, coagulation profile, ABG, and glucose are essential to guide management but should not delay CT [^notfound].
- **Urinary catheterization**: Important for fluid management and monitoring but not urgent; can be done after CT [^notfound].
- **Mannitol administration**: Only if there are signs of herniation or progressive neurologic decline, and only after confirming hemodynamic stability and consulting neurosurgery [^5c9d2771] [^b5f8103b].

---

## Rationale for prioritizing stat CT head

- **Rapid diagnosis**: CT quickly identifies surgical emergencies (e.g. epidural/subdural hematoma, contusions, mass effect) that require immediate neurosurgical intervention [^da8a3a99].
- **Guideline support**: Multiple guidelines recommend non-contrast head CT as the initial imaging modality for moderate-to-severe TBI or altered mental status [^da8a3a99] [^2907af29].
- **Outcome impact**: Early CT and intervention reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Role of stat labs

Stat labs are essential for identifying coagulopathy, electrolyte disturbances, and metabolic derangements that affect management, but they **should not delay CT**. Key labs include:

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|
| CBC | Hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets |
| CMP | Sodium, potassium, renal function |
| Coagulation profile | PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen |
| ABG | Oxygenation, ventilation, acid-base status |
| Glucose | Hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia management |

---

## Indications and timing for urinary catheterization

Urinary catheterization is important for accurate fluid balance and monitoring but is **not time-critical**. It can be performed after CT and initial stabilization. Indications include the need for strict fluid monitoring, administration of osmotic diuretics, or prolonged sedation.

---

## Mannitol administration: indications and precautions

Mannitol is effective for reducing ICP but carries risks, including hypotension and electrolyte disturbances. It should be used selectively:

- **Indications**: Signs of transtentorial herniation or progressive neurologic decline not attributable to extracranial causes [^5c9d2771].
- **Precautions**: Ensure hemodynamic stability (SBP ≥ 90 mmHg) before administration [^b5f8103b].
- **Dosing**: 0.25–1 g/kg IV bolus, repeated as needed based on clinical response and neurosurgical guidance [^b5f8103b].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Priority** | **Intervention** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Stat head CT | Rapid identification of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect requiring urgent intervention [^da8a3a99] |
| 2 | Stat labs | Guide coagulation, electrolyte, and metabolic management [^notfound] |
| 3 | Urinary catheterization | Facilitate fluid management and monitoring [^notfound] |
| 4 | Mannitol administration | Only if signs of herniation or progressive neurologic decline, and hemodynamically stable [^5c9d2771] [^b5f8103b] |

---

In the ED, **stat CT head is the most critical next step** for an intubated TBI patient, followed by stat labs, urinary catheterization, and selective mannitol use. This sequence balances rapid diagnosis and intervention with safe, evidence-based care.

### Prioritizing circulation over airway to improve survival in trauma patients with exsanguinating injuries: a World Society of Emergency Surgery-panamerican trauma consensus statement [^81eba531]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The concept of prioritizing circulation over airway in trauma resuscitation marks a significant paradigm shift in how we manage patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage. Historically, the ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) sequence has been the cornerstone of trauma care. However, emerging evidence suggests that intubating first may worsen outcomes in patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage by exacerbating hypotension and compromising cardiac function.

Successful implementation of this paradigm shift requires a multidisciplinary approach. Surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, emergency medicine physicians, advanced care professionals (APPs), and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel must collaborate to ensure that circulation is prioritized from the scene and during the initial in-hospital management of trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage.

Hemorrhage remains the leading cause of preventable death in both civilian and military trauma settings. Over the years, resuscitation science has advanced significantly with the introduction of damage-control resuscitation, focusing on early and balanced blood product administration, minimizing crystalloid use, addressing trauma-induced coagulopathy, and prioritizing rapid hemorrhage control. Historically, these interventions were only available once patients arrived at the trauma center, but we now understand that time is of the essence for hemorrhaging patients. Deaths from exsanguinating hemorrhage often occur within the first few hours following injury, with a significant portion happening even before patients reach the hospital. This highlights the critical need to bring advanced hemorrhage control and resuscitation strategies into the prehospital environment, and sharing resuscitation strategies with first responders can improve outcomes for patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage.

For patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is crucial to avoid hypoxia, as this strongly correlates with survival, and for these patients early intubation might be indicated. However, the traditional guideline to intubate trauma patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 9 or below should be reevaluated, particularly in cases of penetrating injuries where TBI is less likely. In these patients with penetrating trauma and exsanguinating hemorrhage, a low GCS is often a result of inadequate brain perfusion rather than a neurological injury. For this group of patients, initiating early blood transfusion with whole blood is more beneficial than immediate intubation. While airway management should still take priority in cases of airway obstruction or severe hypoxia, focusing on restoring circulation in patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage, can lead to better outcomes.

### Hypertonic saline vs mannitol for pediatric traumatic brain injury… [^02b5a79a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the management of elevated ICP in severe TBI, the Brain Trauma Foundation recommends the use of 3% hypertonic saline as the first-line hyperosmolar therapy. 4, 5 In the largest comparative effectiveness study to date among children with severe TBI and elevated ICP. a bolus dose of 3% HTS outperformed mannitol in observed ICP reductions at ICP greater than 20, 25, and 30 mm Hg. 6 An earlier randomized clinical trial of 30 children given equimolar doses of 3% HTS vs 20% mannitol showed that both were equally effective in the management of elevated ICP. 7 A systematic review involving 11 studies showed that although both HTS and mannitol lower ICP and improve outcomes in pediatric severe TBI, there were insufficient high-quality data to conclude which of the 2 agents was superior.
8. In this multinational pediatric TBI study, we report the type and dosage of hyperosmolar agents used to treat children with moderate to severe TBI in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.

No differences were observed in in-hospital mortality and functional outcomes between children receiving HTS and those receiving mannitol. Although we observed a marginal increase in the association between use of mannitol and poor 3-month GOS-E-Peds scores in the multiple linear regression and IPTW-adjusted models, this finding was not statistically significant. The BTF recommends ICP monitoring for children with severe TBI and the use of hyperosmolar agents for control of elevated ICP. 5 Use of 3% HTS for elevated ICP is one of the few interventions with a level 2 recommendation. 5 Prior pediatric. We observed that patients who received HTS had marginally favorable GOS-E-Peds scores at 3 months, but this finding was not statistically significant.

The Approaches and Decisions for Acute Pediatric TBI Trial investigators reported that HTS was associated with greater ICP reduction for ICP of more than 25 mm Hg after adjustment for confounders, but not at other ICP thresholds, among children with severe TBI. 6 In our observational study on moderate to severe TBI, we found a steady reduction in daily 6 am ICP values in the group that received HTS, which was not present in the other groups.

Hyperosmolar therapy and overall outcomes in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury show limited evidence: there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for the use of hyperosmolar therapy to improve overall outcomes; in a retrospective cohort of 236 infants and children, use of HTS or mannitol for high ICP in the operating room was associated with favorable outcome versus no hyperosmolar therapy, but when the comparison included the emergency department, operating room, and ICU, a significant effect was not observed; adult TBI guidelines suggest that HTS may be more effective than mannitol with regard to ICP burden and ICP greater than 25 mm Hg, with no differences in mortality or long-term outcome.

### Secondary gains: advances in neurotrauma management [^0ff01f3c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Neurotrauma is a leading cause of death and is associated with many secondary injuries. A balance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) is required to ensure adequate cerebral blood flow and cerebral perfusion pressure. Evaluation and management in the emergency department entails initial stabilization and resuscitation while assessing neurologic status. ICP management follows a tiered approach. Intubation requires consideration of preoxygenation, head of bed elevation, first pass success, and adequate analgesia and sedation. Early consultation with neurosurgery is needed for definitive therapy. Focused evaluation and management play a significant role in optimizing patient outcomes.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^7c849d32]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) repeat head CT — criteria and timing — Patients who sustained a minimal TBI (defined as initial GCS 13–15 and the presence of any intracranial injury on initial head CT imaging) and have either an improving or persistently normal mental status do not require a repeat head CT. In contrast, patients with a persistently altered mental status should undergo repeat CT in 6–12 hours. Any worsening of a patient's neurologic exam is an indication for urgent CT scanning, as soon as possible. For patients with more severe TBI (defined as an admitting GCS of 12 or less), insufficient data exist to identify patients who do not require a repeat CT, and a second CT is almost always warranted because progression of injury is often not predictable or may be occult. The timing of the repeat CT is dependent upon the patient's neurologic status and findings on the first head CT scan, but the recommended timing is within the first 6–12 hours, if not sooner. These data and recommendations are not age restricted.

### Circulation first-the time has come to question the sequencing of care in the ABCs of trauma; an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma multicenter trial [^8cf2beaf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

For patients in extremis including those suffering cardiac arrest, airway, then breathing, followed by circulation have been the priorities established in resuscitative algorithms including the Advanced Trauma Life Support ATLS course. However, more recent data in non-trauma patients have found that prioritizing perfusion over airway has been associated with better outcomes in patients with a primary cardiac event. There are a number of potential explanations including the phenomenon of agonal breaths or gasping that happens in patients in extremis which has been shown to increase cardiac output and perfusion.

The idea of prioritizing circulation over airway in the trauma cohort has not been previously investigated. In part, this is difficult to study in a prospective fashion as it is well established that even brief periods of hypoxemia portend a poor prognosis in brain-injured patients or those with a secondary brain injury from cardiac arrest or profound hypotension. Most importantly, it is difficult in the first moments of emergency department evaluation to determine if a patient in extremis, especially a bluntly injured patient, has both significant bleeding and traumatic brain injury. However, the risk of intubation in hypovolemic patients is worsening hypotension which also has deleterious effects especially in the brain-injured patient.

Trauma care has followed the airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) approach developed by the Advanced Trauma Life Support course. This methodology focuses on treating the airway first, on many occasions resulting in intubation before addressing breathing and circulation issues during the primary survey. This is also referred to as the "first resuscitation cycle" which is basically the initial phase of medical intervention and care provided to a patient who is in a critical or life-threatening condition. This cycle encompasses the immediate actions taken to stabilize the patient's vital functions and address any emergent medical issues to prevent further deterioration and potentially save their life.

In essence, the ABC approach underscores the sequential importance of addressing the airway, breathing, and circulation in the initial evaluation of trauma patients. Although the methodology traditionally places a strong emphasis on securing the airway first, it is important to note that medical practices and protocols continue to evolve based on ongoing research and advancements in trauma care. As a result, variations and adaptations of the ABC approach might emerge over time to better cater to the specific needs of patients and improve overall outcomes in trauma management.

In busy urban trauma centers, these steps are usually performed simultaneously with a large multispecialty team. In rural and resource-limited environments, these steps are often performed sequentially by a single physician. Although promulgated widely, and at this point the standard of care for patients with traumatic injury, the ABC approach has been supported primarily by expert consensus rather than scientific evidence.

### A systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing hypertonic sodium solutions and mannitol for traumatic brain injury: implications for emergency department management [^f63ab64d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To comparatively evaluate hypertonic sodium (HTS) and mannitol in patients following acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the outcomes of all-cause mortality, neurological disability, intracranial pressure (ICP) change from baseline, ICP treatment failure, and serious adverse events.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) were searched (inception to November 2015) using hypertonic saline solutions, sodium chloride, mannitol, osmotic diuretic, traumatic brain injury, brain injuries, and head injury. Searches were limited to humans. Clinical practice guidelines and bibliographies were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized trials comparing HTS and mannitol in adults (≥ 16 years) with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8) and elevated ICP were included. ICP elevation, ICP reduction, and treatment failure were defined using study definitions.

Data Synthesis

Of 326 articles screened, 7 trials enrolling a total of 191 patients met inclusion criteria. Studies were underpowered to detect a significant difference in mortality or neurological outcomes. Due to significant heterogeneity and differences in reporting ICP change from baseline, this outcome was not meta-analyzed. No difference between HTS and mannitol was observed for mean ICP reduction; however, risk of ICP treatment failure favored HTS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.18–0.81). Serious adverse events were not reported.

Conclusions

Based on limited data, clinically important differences in mortality, neurological outcomes, and ICP reduction were not observed between HTS or mannitol in the management of severe TBI. HTS appears to lead to fewer ICP treatment failures.

### Evaluation of the impact of implementing the emergency medical services traumatic brain injury guidelines in Arizona: the excellence in prehospital injury care (EPIC) study methodology [^66e7abc5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) exacts a great toll on society. Fortunately, there is growing evidence that the management of TBI in the early minutes after injury may significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. In response, evidence-based prehospital and in-hospital TBI treatment guidelines have been established by authoritative bodies. However, no large studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of implementing these guidelines in the prehospital setting. This article describes the background, design, implementation, emergency medical services (EMS) treatment protocols, and statistical analysis of a prospective, controlled (before/after), statewide study designed to evaluate the effect of implementing the EMS TBI guidelines-the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care (EPIC) study (NIH/NINDS R01NS071049, "EPIC"; and 3R01NS071049-S1, "EPIC4Kids"). The specific aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that statewide implementation of the international adult and pediatric EMS TBI guidelines will significantly reduce mortality and improve nonmortality outcomes in patients with moderate or severe TBI. Furthermore, it will specifically evaluate the effect of guideline implementation on outcomes in the subgroup of patients who are intubated in the field. Over the course of the entire study (~9 years), it is estimated that approximately 25,000 patients will be enrolled.

### Comparison of intracranial pressure measurements before and after hypertonic saline or mannitol treatment in children with severe traumatic brain injury [^49617fd2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The ADAPT trial was conceived based on the recognition of 3 factors: (1) evidence-based treatment recommendations in the current guidelines reflected a low level of evidence, (2) failure of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in pediatric sTBI (and parallel failures of RCTs in adults) suggested the need for an alternative approach, and (3) practice variability represented a key contributor to treatment failure in RCTs yet a potential opportunity to compare strategies that are in clinical practice. The ADAPT cohort mimics patients observed in RCTs, such as male preponderance, age, and GCS score. However, ADAPT is unique in its inclusion of abusive head trauma and penetrating TBI (24% of the overall cohort). Thus, ADAPT more fully reflects patients receiving guidelines-based ICP-directed care than RCTs.

### Prioritizing circulation over airway in trauma patients with exsanguinating injuries: what you need to know [^b7c2ee85]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hemorrhage remains a leading cause of preventable trauma-related mortality, with early resuscitation and hemorrhage control serving as crucial interventions. Emerging evidence suggests that prioritizing circulation before airway (Circulation, Airway, and Breathing [CAB]) during initial resuscitation in patients with exsanguinating injuries can improve survival by avoiding the deleterious effects of postintubation hypotension. This article reviews current evidence supporting the CAB approach and outlines best practices across prehospital, emergency department, and operative settings. Delaying advanced airway management while focusing on immediate hemorrhage control and blood product resuscitation has been associated with decreased 24-hour and 30-day mortality. This review synthesizes findings from recent multicenter trials and literature supporting the CAB paradigm, with practical recommendations for implementation in trauma care systems.

### Prehospital endotracheal intubation in patients with severe traumatic brain injury: guidelines versus reality [^472e315e]. Resuscitation (2009). Low credibility.

The international Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines recommend prehospital endotracheal intubation in all patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8. Close adherence to these guidelines is associated with improved outcome, but not all severely injured TBI patients receive adequate prehospital airway support. Here we hypothesized that guideline adherence varies when skills are involved that rely on training and expertise, such as endotracheal intubation. We retrospectively studied the medical records of CT-confirmed TBI patients with a GCS ≤ 8 who were referred to a level 1 trauma centre in Amsterdam (n = 127). Records were analyzed for demographic parameters, prehospital treatment modalities, involvement of an emergency medical service (EMS) and respiratory and metabolic parameters upon arrival at the hospital. Patients were mostly male, aged 45 ± 21 years with a median injury severity score (ISS) of 26. Of all patients for whom guidelines recommend endotracheal intubation, only 56% were intubated. In 21 out of 106 severe cases an EMS was not called for, suggesting low guideline adherence. Especially those TBI patients treated by paramedics tended to develop higher levels of stress markers like glucose and lactate. We observed a low degree of adherence to intubation guidelines in a Dutch urban area. Main reasons for low adherence were the unavailability of specialized care, scoop and run strategies and absence of a specialist physician in cases where intubation was recommended. The discrepancy between guidelines and reality warrants changing practice to improve guideline compliance and optimize outcome in TBI patients.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^74f7f2c8]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric severe traumatic brain injury — hyperosmolar therapy evidence and implications: The ADAPT trial is described as the first to compare a bolus of 3% hypertonic saline with mannitol in this population and reported a modest decrease in intracranial pressure (ICP) and increase in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with hypertonic saline and increased CPP with mannitol; a Cochrane review also noted improved outcomes of ICP reduction with hypertonic saline, while long-term outcomes are lacking except that mortality was not shown to be improved with hypertonic saline compared with mannitol. Safety considerations include that the hyperosmolar state induced by hypertonic saline can be associated with a higher risk of kidney injury, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and, after repeated doses, hyperchloremic acidosis, and mannitol was associated with acute tubular necrosis in one included study. Hypertonic saline may thus be more appropriate in patients with decreased renal perfusion, but additional controlled trials comparing hypertonic saline with mannitol are needed to determine efficacy for lowering ICP, short- and long-term neurologic and survival outcomes, and adverse effects or limitations. The most recent (2019) Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines were used to inform the Red Cross guidelines related to the use of hypertonic saline in pediatric severe TBI and for avoiding complications related to hypernatremia.

### Action collaborative on traumatic brain injury care: adapted clinical practice guideline [^c2194480]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2025). Medium credibility.

Outpatient follow-up care for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is inconsistent. The Action Collaborative on TBI Care, convened under the auspices of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, aimed to standardize management with a clinical practice guideline. The guideline is intended for community-dwelling adults with TBI who are able to care for themselves at hospital discharge or who did not require acute hospital care. Guideline topics were selected and prioritized with input from individuals with lived experience and clinicians. Existing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (k = 18) were identified from systematic literature reviews. Recommendations for each priority topic were extracted from existing guidelines and synthesized using the ADAPTE process. Strength of evidence ratings were assigned based on the American Academy of Family Physician's adaptation of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) through consensus voting. A draft guideline underwent external review by 20 health professional and brain injury organizations. The Action Collaborative on TBI Care guideline provides recommendations for 11 priority topics: (1) confirm the diagnosis; (2) determine whether emergency department evaluation is required; (3) request neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment when indicated; (4) screen for social determinants of health; (5) provide guidance on return to usual activities; (6) educate the patient and family; (7) assess for risk of persistent symptoms; (8) prioritize which symptoms to target first; (9) initiate treatment for posttraumatic headache; (10) screen and initiate treatment for mental health disorders; and (11) decide if and when to refer to specialty care.

### Guidelines for prehospital management of traumatic brain injury 3rd edition: executive summary [^4564560a]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

It is generally believed that care provided early after TBI — largely aimed at resuscitating the patient and optimizing their vital signs — is more consequential for the ultimate outcome of a patient than care provided after admission to the hospital. The third edition of the BTF's Prehospital Guidelines for the Management of TBIaims to identify and disseminate best practices in prehospital care, updating the recommendations provided by the second edition 15 years ago. The updated recommendations guide patient assessment, treatment, and transport decision-making. It is hoped that implementation of these guidelines will further improve on the marked outcome benefits seen with the second edition. Moreover, we hope that these guidelines will draw attention to gaps in knowledge and inspire new research. Although many clinicians provide important contributions, neurosurgeons are the only physicians who can provide comprehensive care to TBI victims. It is thus important that neurosurgeons are familiar with recommendations for best practices across the continuum of care.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^766a39d4]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

Acute treatment of cerebral edema and herniation syndromes is often necessary in the pre-hospital setting. However, well-designed clinical trials did not suggest any benefit from the use of HTS in the pre-hospital setting on long-term outcomes in patients with TBI.
4 We suggest against the use of mannitol in the pre-hospital setting to improve neurological outcomes for patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was very low and did not suggest any potential benefit in the pre-hospital setting on long-term outcomes in patients with TBI.

The panel evaluated several studies to inform recommendations on the use of HTS and/or mannitol to improve ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes (Table 1, Questions 3 and 4). These two agents have been compared in at least eight randomized, controlled trials of patients with elevated ICP from a variety of causes, including TBI. A number of uncontrolled, retrospective, and non-comparative studies have also evaluated either HTS or mannitol in patients with TBI. These studies all support the notion that both hyperosmolar therapies effectively reduce ICP (Table 3). The available data are limited by patient heterogeneity, low sample size, and inconsistent methods among studies. For example, several studies utilized a crossover study design where patients served as their own control, sequentially receiving HTS and then mannitol or vice versa, whereas others randomized patients to receive one agent or the other. In addition, several of the early studies evaluating HTS used a combination product which included HES. The overall quality of evidence was low (Evidentiary Table 2 of Electronic Supplementary Material).

Trauma — head injury key considerations define severity by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and alert–voice–pain–unresponsive (AVPU) and require capnography with advanced airways. Mild injury is GCS 14–15/AVPU = (A), moderate is GCS 9–13/AVPU = (V), and severe is GCS 3–8/AVPU = (P) or (U). If endotracheal intubation or invasive airways are used, continuous waveform capnography is required to document proper tube placement and assure proper ventilation rate and minute volume, and hyperventilation can worsen secondary brain injury via vasoconstriction.

DISCUSSION

What Is New?

The third edition of the BTF's Guidelines for Prehospital Management of Traumatic Brain Injury updates the recommendations provided in 2008. This edition includes additional evidence published over a subsequent 17-year period. Without question, the most important difference in this update is that 75% of the recommendations are now strong — in the second edition, all of the recommendations were graded as weak.

There are additional noteworthy changes in these updated guidelines. The blood pressure targets have been increased across the age spectrum. This parallels the change in the BTF's 4th edition adult severe TBI guidelines. Immediate application of supplemental oxygen is now recommended for all patients with suspicion of moderate or severe TBI irrespective of their baseline oxygen saturation. Capnography is now more strongly and frequently recommended to guide care, especially the avoidance of hyperventilation in the absence of herniation. Recommendations related to temperature management now appear for the first time. The 3rd edition guidelines place a greater emphasis on the motor component of the GCS and no longer refer to a global 2-point change as a threshold for intervention similar to the SIBICC algorithms. These guidelines put greater emphasis on documentation and communication and provide more explicit, helpful recommendations related to airway management options and patient monitoring. The new edition includes a management algorithm (Figure 3); one had accompanied the firstbut not the second editionof these guidelines.

### Guidelines for prehospital management of traumatic brain injury 3rd edition: executive summary [^ef6b2cb1]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The Brain Trauma Foundation's (BTF's) Guidelines for the Management of Severe Head Injury, published in 1996, were the first clinical practice guidelines to be published by a surgical specialty. Implementation of these guidelines has been repeatedly associated with a 50% reduction in mortalityas well as reduced cost of care. The BTF next created prehospital guidelines, reflecting the understanding that care and processes of care at the scene of injury, during transport, and early after arrival to the hospital markedly influences the ultimate outcome of brain-injured patients. Indeed, much of the benefit inherent to the BTF guidelines is attributed to improved resuscitation and the avoidance of secondary insults such as hypotension and hypoxia. The first BTF Prehospital Guidelines were published in 2002and the second edition followed in 2008.

The efficacy of the BTF's Prehospital Guidelines 2nd edition was recently examined in the large prospective Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care (EPIC) study. This study included more than 130 emergency medical services and systems in Arizona and examined outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) before and after state-wide implementation of the BTF Prehospital Guidelines. It included 21 852 patients accrued over an 8-year period. This study found that implementation of the Prehospital Guidelines was associated with a 1.7x greater odds of surviving to hospital admission as well as 2x greater odds of survival until discharge. In intubated patients, prehospital guideline compliance was associated with a 3x greater chance of survival to discharge. Remarkably, however, variability in contemporary American prehospital TBI care remains problematic. Here we provide an executive summary of the new 3rd edition Prehospital Guidelinessuitable for neurosurgeons in hopes it will promote dissemination of best practices and further improve the outcome of TBI victims.

### Does intracranial pressure management hurt more than it helps in traumatic brain injury? [^61478c3f]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

ICP management does hurt more than it helps (abridged summary)

Dr Charles A Adams, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery, Rhode Island Hospital

Despite ICP measurement being presented as a central tenant of multiple evidence-based TBI guidelines, the evidence largely consists of retrospective studies and a single RCT performed in a settling not generalizable to the USA. Furthermore, although the Munro-Kellie doctrine appears mechanistically straightforward, the interplay between injury and intervention is far more complex.

When considering harm, it is important to note that ICP monitoring per se does not lead to adverse events, but rather it is the care that is driven from such monitoring that is the consequence. These management efforts are motivated by a desire to maintain CPP, which can result in the use of aggressive interventions such as mannitol or hypertonic saline. Some interventions are known to be harmful to certain groups, such as the elderly, which have limited cardiovascular and/or renal reserve. Decompressive craniectomy is another example of an aggressive intervention, performed in response to raised ICP, which can lead to the improved survival of patients with little to no chance of a functional life.

In considering this issue further, practice patterns often provide clues as to practicing clinicians' views on the value of an intervention. Despite clear guidelines on the use of ICP monitoring, less than half of patients with an indication for ICP monitoring, actually receive one. This may reflect the intuition of the neurosurgeons that ICP monitors add little to the care of TBI.

The use of ICP monitoring has a poor evidence base, and it is clear that it can drive some interventions that are associated with harmful morbidity. This issue requires more thorough evaluation before it should be considered a standard of care.

In pediatric populations, a randomized trial of 200 intensive care unit patients with elevated ICP found that 3% sodium chloride decreased coma compared to mannitol without a mortality benefit and mannitol was associated with acute tubular necrosis, while another trial comparing bolus doses of 3% hypertonic saline versus mannitol included 518 children with severe TBI, showing a statistically significant decrease in ICP and increase in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with hypertonic saline bolus administration and mannitol observed to increase CPP, with hypertonic saline associated with a greater reduction in ICP using unadjusted data but after adjusting for confounders the associations of both agents with ICP and CPP were not different; during periods of increased ICP, greater improvements were observed with 3% hypertonic saline than mannitol and this difference persisted for an ICP greater than 25 mmHg.

### EMS treatment guidelines in major traumatic brain injury with positive pressure ventilation… [^82de15ff]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between guideline implementation and outcomes in patients with major TBI who received positive pressure ventilation in the field via bag-valve-mask, supraglottic airway, or endotracheal intubation. Patients were assigned to airway management subgroups based on the technique used. Patients with attempts at both SGA and ETI were classified as ETI, whether the intubation was successful or not. Race and ethnicity were determined by responding EMS personnel. As would be expected from the emphasis on reducing hyperventilation, among intubated patients, the rate of hypocapnia decreased significantly after implementation has been controversial for decades. 5, 8, 21, 23–25, 32, 51–53 However, in studies finding an association of prehospital intubation with negative outcomes, 23, 24, 32, 53, 54 it is unclear whether the primary issue was the procedure itself or the high proportion of patients receiving inadvertent hyperventilation after ETI. 9, 31, 51, 55–57. A dramatic example of this was the San Diego Rapid Sequence Intubation Trial, which was ended early due to harm in the ETI arm. 23 The conclusion was that prehospital ETI caused the poor outcomes. However, one of the most telling aspects of this study came with the subsequent analysis by Davis et al56 of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide measurements. Sixth, it is important to note that these findings do not answer the questions surrounding when patients with TBI ought to be intubated in the field.

While there was a significant reduction in the proportion of prehospital intubations, more than 70% of patients with PPV during the postimplementation phase still underwent ETI. While there was significant improvement in outcomes among intubated patients after implementation of guideline-based care, this does not answer the question of whether they should have been intubated in the first place.

### Sedation for rapid sequence induction and intubation of neurologically injured patients [^372fcacc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

There are subtle physiologic and pharmacologic principles that should be understood for patients with neurologic injuries. These principles are especially true for managing patients with traumatic brain injuries. Prevention of hypotension and hypoxemia are major goals in the management of these patients. This article discusses the physiology, pitfalls, and pharmacology necessary to skillfully care for this subset of patients with trauma. The principles endorsed in this article are applicable both for patients with traumatic brain injury and those with spinal cord injuries.

### WSES consensus conference guidelines: monitoring and management of severe adult traumatic brain injury patients with polytrauma in the first 24 hours [^d9cd9624]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The acute phase management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and polytrauma represents a major challenge. Guidelines for the care of these complex patients are lacking, and worldwide variability in clinical practice has been documented in recent studies. Consequently, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) decided to organize an international consensus conference regarding the monitoring and management of severe adult TBI polytrauma patients during the first 24hours after injury. A modified Delphi approach was adopted, with an agreement cut-off of 70%. Forty experts in this field (emergency surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensivists) participated in the online consensus process. Sixteen recommendations were generated, with the aim of promoting rational care in this difficult setting.

### Pediatric advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^0e57fd3a]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Red Cross Guidelines — pediatric major traumatic brain injury (TBI) with acute intracranial hypertension: Mannitol or hypertonic saline may be given to patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have a monitored elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), signs of transtentorial herniation prior to ICP monitoring, or progressive neurological deterioration not due to extracranial causes. Arterial hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) should be avoided in patients with intracranial hypertension. For pediatric patients with major TBI and acute intracranial hypertension, hypertonic saline is preferred over mannitol to lower the ICP to less than 20 mmHg. A bolus of hypertonic saline (3%) is recommended at a dose between 2 and 5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight (2 mL/kg to 5 mL/kg) over 10 to 20 minutes. A continuous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is suggested at a rate between 0.1 mL/kg and 1.0 mL/kg per hour, and the minimum dose needed to maintain ICP less than 20 mmHg is suggested. For refractory ICP, a bolus of 23.4% hypertonic saline is suggested; the suggested dose is 0.5 mL/kg with a maximum of 30 ml. A serum sodium level of greater than 170 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) for a sustained period (greater than 72 hours) should be avoided to preclude complications of thrombocytopenia and anemia, and sustained serum sodium greater than 160 mEq/L should be avoided to preclude the complication of deep venous thrombosis. When hypertonic saline cannot be used, mannitol may be considered to lower the ICP, with a bolus of 0.25 g/kg to 1 g/kg over 10 minutes suggested.

### Hypertonic saline infusion for treating intracranial hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury [^bfe10d56]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

And what of mannitol; will it be abandoned if the results of the COBI trial confirm the current findings? That may not happen so readily, with the primary reason being the ease of peripheral intravenous administration versus the need for central venous catheters that are required for administering hypertonic saline. It may be that mannitol remains the hyperosmolar agent of choice for early resuscitation, while HTS may be adopted for maintenance therapy, even though data for that also favors HTS.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^84dd88c5]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

While the overall quality of the evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across the published studies to suggest symptom-based bolus dosing of HTS as an effective means of reducing ICP and cerebral edema in patients with SAH. In addition, HTS bolus administration may also raise serum sodium, improve brain pH, and increase brain tissue oxygenation. At present, there are insufficient data to support the use of HTS to improve neurological outcome, regardless of the administration strategy. We did not identify any substantial evidence to support targeting a specific serum sodium concentration in order to reduce ICP or improve neurological outcome in patients with SAH, demonstrating the need for future research regarding the impact of specific sodium targets on ICP and neurological outcomes.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury

In patients with TBI, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions improve cerebral edema compared to mannitol?
In patients with TBI, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions for cerebral edema improve neurological outcomes compared to mannitol?

Recommendations

We suggest using hypertonic sodium solutions over mannitol for the initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest that neither HTS nor mannitol be used with the expectation for improving neurological outcomes in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that while the quality of evidence was low, the consistency of the literature suggested HTS was at least as safe and effective as mannitol. In addition, the panel agreed that the putative advantages of HTS over mannitol for fluid resuscitation and cerebral perfusion justified the suggestion to use HTS over mannitol. Although treatment effect of these agents on elevated ICP or cerebral edema may be expected based on the literature, neither agent has been demonstrated to improve neurological outcomes.
2 We suggest that the use of mannitol is an effective alternative in patients with TBI unable to receive hypertonic sodium solutions (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

Although HTS was recommended over mannitol, the quality of evidence was low and the literature consistently suggests that mannitol is also a safe and effective option for the initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with TBI, particularly those with concomitant severe hypernatremia or volume overload.
3 We recommend against the use of hypertonic sodium solutions in the pre-hospital setting to specifically improve neurological outcomes for patients with TBI (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Comparative effectiveness of mannitol versus hypertonic saline in patients with traumatic brain injury: a CENTER-TBI study [^cbee1690]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is one of the most important modifiable and immediate threats to critically ill patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Two hyperosmolar agents (HOAs), mannitol and hypertonic saline (HTS), are routinely used in clinical practice to treat increased ICP. We aimed to assess whether a preference for mannitol, HTS, or their combined use translated into differences in outcome. The Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) Study is a prospective multi-center cohort study. For this study, patients with TBI, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), treated with mannitol and/or HTS, and aged ≥ 16 years were included. Patients and centers were differentiated based on treatment preference with mannitol and/or HTS based on structured, data-driven criteria such as first administered HOA in the ICU. We assessed influence of center and patient characteristics in the choice of agent using adjusted multi-variate models. Further, we assessed the influence of HOA preference on outcome using adjusted ordinal and logistic regression models, and instrumental variable analyses. In total, 2056 patients were assessed. Of these, 502 (24%) patients received mannitol and/or HTS in the ICU. The first received HOA was HTS for 287 (57%) patients, mannitol for 149 (30%) patients, or both mannitol and HTS on the same day for 66 (13%) patients. Two unreactive pupils were more common in patients receiving both (13, 21%), compared with patients receiving HTS (40, 14%) or mannitol (22, 16%). Center, rather than patient characteristics, was independently associated with the preferred choice of HOA (p -value < 0.05). ICU mortality and 6-month outcome were similar between patients preferably treated with mannitol compared with HTS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.0, confidence interval [CI] = 0.4–2.2; OR = 0.9, CI = 0.5–1.6, respectively). Patients who received both also had a similar ICU mortality and 6-month outcome compared with patients receiving HTS (OR = 1.8, CI = 0.7–5.0; OR = 0.6, CI = 0.3–1.7, respectively). We found between-center variability regarding HOA preference. Moreover, we found that center is a more important driver of the choice of HOA than patient characteristics. However, our study indicates that this variability is an acceptable practice given absence of differences in outcomes associated with a specific HOA.

### Infra-red thermometry: the reliability of tympanic and temporal artery readings for predicting brain temperature after severe traumatic brain injury [^20be3aad]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The study was approved by the local research ethics committee (reference number 06/Q1406/115). Approval to undertake the study was obtained from the patient's spouse, relative or partner before measurements were made.

Patients

All patients aged 16 years or above, who were admitted to our 16 bed, level 3, university teaching hospital ICU within 24 hours of severe TBI were eligible for recruitment to the study.

Patients were admitted either as direct referrals from the emergency department (ED) or as tertiary referrals from EDs of other hospitals within the greater Manchester region. All the patients were sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated; all had an intra or extra-axial lesion on computed tomography (CT), with or without systemic trauma and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of eight or less on admission to the ICU. The patients were treated in accordance with local neurointensive care guidelines to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure at 60 mmHg or higher and intracranial pressure (ICP) below 20 mmHg. To manage raised ICP, patients were positioned at a 30° angle head up and received sedation, analgesia, neuromuscular blockade and osmotherapy with mannitol (0.5 g/kg) as required.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^0dc0f850]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The various treatments for ICP or cerebral edema reviewed in this guideline are used in patients with critical intracranial pathologies worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials. The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments. The concepts of hyperosmotic therapy have been entrenched in the critical care management of patients with neurological injuries for years, yet there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal practical use of mannitol or hypertonic saline. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema. The goals of research activities in this area should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures. Basic criteria of research efforts should include a definition of how cerebral edema is being measured, the specific purpose of any intervention (e.g. resuscitation, management of ICP, effect on physiological parameters), and what outcome measures will be assessed. In addition, research efforts should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on designated outcomes. Finally, while the goal of all interventions in the management of neurological injuries is to improve survival and minimize disability, it must be acknowledged that a single intervention to address a specific physiological variable may have limited impact on the multiple factors that contribute to both short- and long-term outcomes.

Severe traumatic brain injury — treatments not recommended for intracranial hypertension are listed by the SIBICC working group and include mannitol by non-bolus, continuous intravenous infusion; scheduled infusion of hyperosmolar therapy (e.g., every 4 to 6 hours); lumbar CSF drainage; furosemide; routine use of steroids; routine therapeutic hypothermia to temperatures below 35°C due to systemic complications; High dose propofol to attempt burst suppression; routinely decreasing PaCO2 below 30 mm Hg/4.0 kPa; and routinely raising CPP above 90 mm Hg. The group's decision-making included evidence against treatments (e.g., steroids, CPP > 70 mm Hg) and lack of sufficient supporting evidence, and inclusion on this list does not proscribe consideration in some individual cases.

Older adults with traumatic brain injury — tracheostomy considerations: Older adult patients are less likely to undergo a tracheostomy and, when performed, it is often later in the hospital course than for younger patients, even though tracheostomies in older patients are reported to be associated with lower in-hospital mortality. Both tracheostomy placement and oral intubation are independent risk factors for dysphagia in older adults. Given differing goals of care, the decision to perform a tracheostomy in an older adult with severe TBI must be weighed against the patient's goals of care.
