questions to ask a patient for a routine sports physical

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what questions to ask a patient for a routine sports preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE), preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals and scope of the PPE. Then, I should verify the optimal setting and timing. Next, I will structure the history domains, followed by the physical examination priorities. After that, I need to consider special populations and contextual modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize clearance categories, documentation requirements, and counseling points, while double-checking evidence limitations and controversies such as ECG screening and concussion management.

> Let me first confirm the core purpose and scope of the PPE so I don't miss anything foundational. The PPE aims to maximize safe participation, detect conditions predisposing to injury or illness, and serve as an entry point into the healthcare system, with the understanding that while the PPE may detect important conditions, evidence is limited that it prevents morbidity or mortality in athletes, so I should be careful not to overstate its impact [^115Frdea] [^112jfUtu] [^111EbA2Q].

> I need to ensure the setting and timing are appropriate because that affects confidentiality and follow-through. The evaluation should occur in a private medical home setting with adequate time for a structured history and exam, ideally 6 weeks before preseason to allow for evaluation and treatment of identified issues, and I should avoid mass screenings in locker rooms or gyms due to privacy and quality concerns [^111EbA2Q] [^115Frdea].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the history domains; I should verify that I'm aligning with PPE5 and AMSSM guidance. The history should be comprehensive and include personal medical history, cardiovascular symptoms and family history, concussion and neurologic history, respiratory and infectious disease history, musculoskeletal injuries, mental health and substance use, and female-specific issues such as menstrual history and relative energy deficiency in sport, while also screening for depression, anxiety, and ADHD as recommended [^115Frdea] [^111EbA2Q].

> Wait, let me verify the cardiovascular screening elements because this is where sensitivity is often limited. I should ask about exertional chest pain, syncope or near-syncope, excessive fatigue or dyspnea, palpitations, and a family history of premature sudden cardiac death or cardiomyopathy, recognizing that history and physical alone have low sensitivity for detecting high-risk cardiac conditions and that positive responses are common, which can lead to false positives or missed cases if not triaged thoughtfully [^113NsWsB] [^117S85Yp] [^115jbNR7].

> I will now examine the concussion and neurologic history, and I should double-check that I'm capturing premorbid modifiers that affect risk and recovery. I need to document prior concussions or TBI, mechanism, symptoms, duration, medical care, baseline neurocognitive testing if available, and premorbid conditions such as learning disorders, ADHD, mood disorders, migraine, and motion sickness, since these influence diagnosis, management, and return-to-play decisions [^1175hT3K] [^1126PYNj] [^115LMcrD].

> Next, I should review respiratory and infectious disease history, and I need to check the evidence on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction screening. Screening questionnaires and routine exams miss a substantial proportion of adolescent athletes with EIB, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider formal testing when symptoms or risk factors are present, while also asking about COVID-19 history and return-to-sport after infection per current guidance [^112zFdSS] [^115Frdea].

> Let me consider musculoskeletal history carefully, and I should confirm that I'm asking about prior injuries, surgeries, and current symptoms in a way that guides the focused exam. A relevant history plus a focused lower-extremity examination is strongly recommended when assessing for ACL injury, and I should also screen for overuse patterns, training load, and equipment or biomechanical contributors that increase injury risk [^112J1CEv] [^111DwH59] [^116kpeYQ].

> I need to ensure mental health and substance use screening are not overlooked, as these affect both safety and performance. I should screen for depression, anxiety, ADHD, sleep disturbances, and use of performance-enhancing substances, and I should be prepared to use validated tools and refer when indicated, integrating mental health care into the athlete's plan [^115Frdea].

> For female athletes, I should confirm that I'm asking about menstrual history, eating behaviors, and body image, and I must screen for relative energy deficiency in sport because of its broad health consequences; I should also ask about contraceptive use and pregnancy when relevant to participation and safety [^115Frdea].

> Now, I will structure the physical examination, and I need to ensure it remains focused yet comprehensive where it matters. The exam should prioritize cardiovascular auscultation in supine and standing positions to detect murmurs, pulses, and signs of Marfan syndrome, a focused neurologic screen including coordination and balance, and a targeted musculoskeletal exam emphasizing joints and regions pertinent to the athlete's sport, with additional systems as indicated by history [^115Frdea] [^112jfUtu].

> But wait, what if the athlete is transgender or has a disability; I should verify that I'm using inclusive and appropriate approaches. I need to ask about gender-affirming hormones and anatomy-specific considerations, and for athletes with physical or intellectual disabilities, I should adapt the history and exam while maintaining the same safety priorities and medical eligibility standards [^115Frdea].

> Hold on, I should verify how sport, level, and season modify risk and clearance decisions. High-collision or high-exertion sports, elite or high-level competition, and preseason timing may lower thresholds for further evaluation, whereas recreational or low-intensity contexts may allow more permissive clearance with education and follow-up, always anchored in shared decision-making and local resources [^112jfUtu] [^111EbA2Q].

> I will now examine clearance categories, and I need to ensure documentation is precise. Clearance can be full, conditional with follow-up or further testing, or withheld pending evaluation, and I must document the rationale, the plan for follow-up, and the specific restrictions or accommodations, ideally using a standardized PPE form and ensuring the athlete and guardians understand next steps [^111EbA2Q] [^115Frdea].

> Next, I should review counseling and health promotion, and I need to check that I'm integrating physical activity as a vital sign. I should assess physical activity using a simple two-question vital sign or validated tool, counsel on injury prevention including neuromuscular training for lower-extremity injuries, and provide anticipatory guidance on heat illness, hydration, and gradual return after illness or injury, aligning with broader public health and lifestyle medicine principles [^1148Dcae] [^115eE3zW] [^114sxouC] [^114TgPnt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine ECG screening is universally recommended, but I should double-check the current stance. The AHA supports history and physical as the primary screen and does not endorse routine ECG for all athletes, whereas the ESC suggests considering ECG in young competitive athletes where resources and expertise exist; AMSSM emphasizes individualized, risk-based strategies given false positives, infrastructure needs, and limited outcomes data, so I should tailor ECG use to local capacity and athlete risk rather than apply a one-size-fits-all approach [^114ai2W4] [^117TfqZH] [^111gazZS] [^113JwoiJ].

> I should confirm concussion management principles so I don't overprescribe rest. Diagnosis remains clinical, baseline testing can assist but is not required, and after a brief period of rest, athletes should progress through graded activity while staying below symptom-exacerbation thresholds, with multidisciplinary care for prolonged symptoms and careful attention to modifiers such as sleep, mood, and cervical or vestibular contributors [^111xeAyY] [^111EXZku] [^115LMcrD].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency. Start with a private, structured history using a standardized form, proceed to a focused exam prioritizing cardiovascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal systems, apply sport- and level-specific risk stratification, assign a clear clearance category with documentation, and close with counseling and a follow-up plan, recognizing the PPE's strengths and limitations and engaging in shared decision-making throughout [^111EbA2Q] [^115Frdea] [^112jfUtu].

For a routine sports physical, ask about **exertional symptoms** (chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, palpitations) [^112jfUtu], **cardiac history** (heart murmur, congenital heart disease, hypertension, family history of sudden cardiac death) [^114ai2W4], and **concussion history** (prior concussions, symptoms, baseline testing) [^1175hT3K]. Also screen for **asthma/EIB** (wheezing, cough, exercise-induced symptoms) [^112zFdSS], musculoskeletal injuries, and mental health (anxiety, depression, eating disorders) [^115Frdea]. Confirm medications, allergies, and menstrual history in females [^115Frdea]; document immunizations and COVID-19 status [^notfound]; and ask about training load, nutrition, hydration, and sleep [^116kpeYQ]. Use a standardized form [^111EbA2Q] and tailor questions to sport, age, and sex to guide safe participation and clearance [^112jfUtu].

---

## Cardiovascular history

- **Exertional symptoms**: Chest pain, dyspnea, syncope/near-syncope, palpitations, fatigue [^112jfUtu].

## Respiratory history

Ask about **asthma/EIB** — including wheezing, cough, exercise-induced symptoms, prior diagnosis, and inhaler use [^notfound] — and about **respiratory infections** such as recent infections, COVID-19, and long COVID symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Neurologic history

Ask about **concussion history** — including prior concussions, symptoms, baseline testing, and return-to-play history [^1175hT3K] — and about **seizures** — including history, medications, and triggers [^notfound].

---

## Musculoskeletal history

Ask about **prior injuries** — including fractures, sprains, dislocations, surgeries, and physical therapy — and about **current pain** — including location, severity, and functional limitations [^115Frdea].

---

## Mental health history

Screen for **anxiety and depression** — including symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment — and for **eating disorders** — including restrictive eating, body image concerns, and menstrual irregularities [^115Frdea].

---

## Female-specific history

The process of evidence-based practice (EBP) guides clinicians in the integration of individual clinical expertise, patient values and expectations, and the best available evidence. Becoming proficient with this process takes time and consistent practice, but should ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. The EBP process entails 5 steps: (1) formulating an appropriate question, (2) performing an efficient literature search, (3) critically appraising the best available evidence, (4) applying the best evidence to clinical practice, and (5) assessing outcomes of care. This first commentary in a 2-part series will review principles relating to steps 1, 2, and 3 of this 5-step model. The purpose of this commentary is to provide a perspective to assist clinicians in formulating foreground questions, searching for the best available evidence, and determining validity of results in studies of interventions for orthopaedic and sports physical therapy.

### The preparticipation sports evaluation [^112jfUtu]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The preparticipation physical evaluation is a commonly requested medical visit for amateur and professional athletes of all ages. The overarching goal is to maximize the health of athletes and their safe participation in sports. Although studies have not found that the preparticipation physical evaluation prevents morbidity and mortality associated with sports, it may detect conditions that predispose the athlete to injury or illness and can provide strategies to prevent injuries. Clearance depends on the outcome of the evaluation and the type of sport (and sometimes position or event) in which the athlete participates. All persons undergoing a preparticipation physical evaluation should be questioned about exertional symptoms, presence of a heart murmur, symptoms of Marfan syndrome, and family history of premature serious cardiac conditions or sudden death. The physical examination should focus on the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. U.S. medical and athletic organizations discourage screening electrocardiography and blood and urine testing in asymptomatic patients. Further evaluation should be considered for persons with heart or lung disease, bleeding disorders, musculoskeletal problems, history of concussion, or other neurologic disorders.

### AMSSM position statement on cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes: current evidence, knowledge gaps, recommendations, and future directions [^113JwoiJ]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Knowledge gaps in preparticipation screening — evidence limitations include that "despite its use and existence for more than 2 decades, the immediate and long-term outcomes of the customary PPE are largely unknown", and "no study to date has tested the ability of modern recommendations for CV screening by history and physical examination alone to detect CV conditions that pose potential risk of SCA/D in athletes". "Current estimates of the sensitivity of the history and physical examination are extrapolated from studies that also use other screening modalities such as ECG", so findings "may be confounded", and "the extent to which a screening evaluation using only history and physical examination can identify athletes with conditions associated with elevated risk of SCA/D is yet to be clearly established". Process gaps include that "the physician response to positive history responses remains relatively uninvestigated and nonuniform", "electronic PPE formats may provide a platform to better understand the current PPE process and improve question sets", and "whether a PPE performs more effectively than an annual health examination with the patient's primary care physician is also unknown".

### Remote assessment in sport and exercise medicine (SEM): a narrative review and teleSEM solutions for and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic [^116wfQnf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Generic and condition-specific quick guides for remote consultations

The COVID-19 challenges are unprecedented, and SEM physicians must be agile and flexible to adapt their traditional clinical assessments. It is reasonable to assume that most patients who present for a telemedicine consultation will at some point require a face-to-face clinical consultation. However, depending on the situation or the condition, this face-to-face meeting does not necessarily have to be the initial consultation. Triage in SEM can in most cases be through teleSEM, based on history alone. In case of uncertainty (and where appropriate), initial special investigations may be arranged, followed by a face-to-face consultation for examination and review of the results. It may even be possible to provide initial advice and a rehabilitation plan, followed later by a face-to-face follow-up consultation. While this is a reversal of the usual steps in clinical assessment, it may be the only reasonable way to provide a service in a 'lockdown' or similar situation. Patients will generally understand and appreciate this. Many conditions (such as tendinopathies) are more suitable to this type of consultation, where the physical assessment or imaging add very little additional value to the clinical history.

Similarly, teleSEM is ideal to discuss results following the initial face-to-face clinical consultation in cases where the follow-up would not involve further or a repeated patient examination (eg, where there are no contradictory imaging findings).

Team physicians and physicians who work with a specific cohort of athletes can offer teleSEM for routine athlete health monitoring (in those without any new injury or illness), and other situations where the consultation is mostly a history and results review.

A potential new area of SEM eHealth service is a teleSEM consultation for general health advice, not specific to a particular patient or pathology. In such a consultation, an athlete will engage with an SEM physician and ask one-on-one questions about health issues, without requiring a specific clinical examination.

The teleSEM consultation can be facilitated by condition-specific guidelines based on the generic teleSEM template (figure 1). TeleSEM is particularly suited for preventative exercise medicine, including exercise advice for health.

### Physical activity counselling in sports medicine: a call to action [^112HKTSS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

A call to action

We propose three principle actions aimed at engaging the sports and exercise medicine community in PA promotion: (1) providing physicians with the methods and support necessary to assess and prescribe exercise to their patients; (2) developing educational programmes aimed at increasing and improving the competencies sports medicine physicians have related to PA promotion and (3) encouraging medical students, residents and practising physicians to serve as physically active role models to their families, patients and communities.

Physicians

Action 1: give physicians the methods and support they need to counsel patients

Use of a PA or exercise vital sign

Vital signs have historically been utilised as key indicators of health status and include pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate and body weight (body mass index). As the causes of illness have changed in the past century, new measures of health status have been proposed to address more contemporary causes of death and disability. In the past two decades, smoking status has been demonstrated to be an important vital sign that led to increased physician smoking cessation counselling.

In light of a worldwide explosion of NCDs, and dangerously low PA levels in the United States and worldwide, it is clear that a practice prompt that can increase physician awareness of a patient's sedentary lifestyle or insufficient activity levels, and encourage counselling around increasing levels of PA is truly needed. A PA (or exercise) vital sign is an easy way to meet this need and is recommended as a key healthcare strategy in the US National Physical Activity Plan.

From a practical perspective, asking about PA is a minimal time investment with a high yield. Staff can be trained to ask and document responses to questions about patient PA. Respiratory rate, which is almost never accurate, and temperature, which needs to be measured when the patient complains of infectious symptoms, are commonly measured vital signs that could easily be eliminated to provide the 30–60 s necessary to collect and record a PA vital sign that is sure to have a higher impact on patient health.

Audit measures

Healthcare professionals should take the opportunity, whenever possible, to identify inactive patients and levels of physical activity should be routinely checked. This could be by simply asking the patient about their activity levels or via a formal validated screening tool such as the Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) (endorsed by the American College of Sports Medicine Exercise is Medicine®). The PAVS consist of two questions: "On average, how many days per week do you engage in moderate to strenuous exercise like a brisk walk?" "On average, how many minutes do you engage in exercise at this level?"

The PAVS is highly associated with decreased levels of BMI and odds of obesity and has been tested for face and discriminant validity.
2 Alternatively, physical activity status may be assessed by the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) – a NICE recommended survey to help identify those inactive and need of support. All patients who receive a score of less than 'active' should be provided with appropriate advice to increase their physical activity levels or offered a Brief Intervention in Physical Activity in line with the NICE Guidance (2006).
3 Healthcare professionals should help patients identify their circumstances, preferences and barriers to being physically active. The NICE 'Physical activity: brief advice for adults in primary care' (PH44) has recommendations on how to deliver and follow up up on brief physical activity advice:

### Patient acceptable symptomatic state and substantial clinical benefit matter most to patients and must Be reported correctly [^115RehY3]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite a push for a focus on clinical rather than "statistical" significance and an emphasis on reporting of outcome thresholds such as the patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB), the PASS and SCB are rarely reported and, when reported, are often reported incorrectly. Yet, patients require satisfaction (PASS) as a result of our treatments, and patients desire to improve substantially (SCB). Determining whether patients are satisfied and/or substantially improved is simple. just ask them. The questions are known as anchor questions. Obviously, different patients have different PASS and SCB thresholds, and reliance on previously published literature for values of these thresholds can result in error-thus, the anchor questions. And, each patient must be assessed individually. Outcome thresholds are not group-level metrics, and they must be reported as the percentage of individuals who achieve the clinically significant outcome. Certain patients, such as athletes, have high baseline function and may demand maximum outcome improvement. In contrast, the minimal clinically important difference is a less-than-ideal measure; patients do not desire "minimal" improvement. Journals must do a better job of publishing patient-reported outcome measures that matter most to patients: satisfaction and substantial benefit.

### Abnormal pre-participation cardiac screening in athletes: can an athlete train while waiting for a "Diagnosis"? [^114RspNj]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The question will continue to persist — can your athlete exercise, while undergoing further evaluation following an abnormal initial pre-participation screening? In brief, assess the risk at the time of initial review, collaborate with experts, perform timely onward evaluations, and empower athletes in their journey to success. Furthermore, the process of SDM must be viewed as a continuum and incorporated at each step, from the initial encounter in the screening arena, where naturally a degree of uncertainty exists, through to the onward comprehensive evaluation and surveillance.

### Sport and exercise as contributors to the health of nations [^115eE3zW]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Self-reported rates of participation in sport vary by country. In the UK, about 40% of men and women aged 16 years or older participate in at least one sport every week. Although few data exist to assess trends for participation in sport, there is little evidence of change in the past decade among adults. Large cohort studies suggest that such participation in sport is associated with a 20–40% reduction in all-cause mortality compared with non-participation. Randomised trials and crossover clinical studies suggest that playing sport is associated with specific health benefits. Some sports have relatively high injury risk although neuromuscular training programmes can prevent various lower extremity injuries. Clinicians can influence a large number of patients through brief interventions that promote physical activity, and encouragement toward participation in sport for some physically inactive patients qualifies as evidence-based therapy. Exercise might also be considered as a fifth vital sign and should be recorded in patients' electronic medical records and routine histories.

### Living Concussion Guidelines: guideline for concussion&prolonged symptoms for adults 18 years of age or older: 2022 August update [^112SaQBK]. ConcussionsOntario (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for concussion, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, LCG 2022 guidelines recommend to elicit a thorough history (using a standardized concussion symptom inventory tool, including cognition screening), perform a physical examination, and assess concurrent potential contributing factors, such as comorbid medical conditions and mental health conditions, to guide initial medical management in patients with concussion.

### Improving the reliability of measurements in orthopaedics and sports medicine [^112jhYML]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Generally, there is no clear answer to the ideal break duration between individual trials (e.g. measurement sessions, occasions) regarding inter-rater, intra-rater, and test–retest reliability studies. Again, the gap depends not only on the number of performed trials but also on their characteristic. For example, as previously mentioned, radiographs can be assessed multiple times, but participants will not necessarily tolerate many examinations. In this case, one should consider a break between tests that is long enough to obtain the initial and ideal conditions for the examination (e.g. lack of patient fatigue) but short enough so that the patient's condition does not change between the measurements. In the literature, there are a wide range of possible break lengths, from tests performed on the same day to trials with a one-day break to a maximum of up to a one-week interval between tests. It is also worth highlighting exceptional types of intra-rater and test–retest reliability studies that additionally address within-day (intra-day) and between-day (inter-day) reliability.

It is also essential to perform all trials under the same conditions, such as in the same laboratory and at the same time of day. Participants are always asked to maintain their regular training regimens during the experimental period and refrain from participating in vigorous physical activity between trials. The occurrence of various circumstances between individual tests that may affect the results of subsequent measurements, such as injuries or even common colds, should lead to the exclusion of a given target from the tested sample.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^117Ujdau]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Appendix II — PICO Questions and Inclusion Criteria Used to Define Literature Search lists PICO questions for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, including whether physical exam is an accurate diagnostic modality for ACL tear, whether aspiration for symptomatic effusions results in better patient outcomes, whether surgical reconstruction for primary ACL tear improves outcomes, and in combined ACL and meniscal tears whether ACL reconstruction with preservation/repair of the meniscal tear improves outcomes. The questions also address, in patients receiving primary ACL reconstruction, whether adding ALL/LET improves outcomes and, for isolated primary ACL tear, whether treatment with repair or reconstruction improves outcomes; additional topics include functional knee bracing after isolated primary ACL reconstruction, prophylactic knee bracing to prevent ACL injury, training programs to reduce primary ACL injuries in high-risk sports, and factors and criteria to consider for return to play decision making after ACL injury or reconstruction.

### The pre-sports cardiovascular evaluation: should it depend on the level of competition, the sport, or the state? [^116DKwfi]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in an athlete is a rare but tragic event, and significant controversy exists regarding the most effective method to define those at highest risk. Recommendations of the American Heart Association require that a history and physical examination be used for preparticipation screening with an abnormal cardiac finding expected to prompt further evaluation. Given the lack of data documenting that electrocardiogram (ECG) screening in all competitive athletes is either feasible or appropriate, these same guidelines state that such screening is optional but not mandatory. The extremely low incidence of SCD events, in conjunction with the low sensitivity and specificity of ECG as a screening tool in athletes, contributes to this recommendation. Although these guidelines target all competitive athletes, however, there may be subgroups of athletes, based on age, level of competition, individual sport, or state of residence, for which mandatory ECG screening may be both appropriate and sensible. Given the lack of resolution of the ongoing ECG debate, it is perhaps reasonable to consider screening specific high-risk subgroups of athletes rather than continuing to dispute whether to screen all competitive athletes or none at all. Recent data suggest that such a program may be feasible and may provide a rationale basis for subsequent expansion of cardiovascular screening programs.

### American College of Sports Medicine expert consensus statement to update recommendations for screening, staffing, and emergency policies to prevent cardiovascular events at health fitness facilities [^111iMkBM]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2020). High credibility.

Preparticipation medical clearance — screening guidance states that the routine referral of asymptomatic middle-aged and older individuals for medical clearance before starting an exercise program appears unwarranted and presents needless barriers to exercise adoption, whereas physically inactive individuals with known cardiovascular, metabolic or renal disease, or signs/symptoms suggestive of these diseases should seek medical attention before starting an exercise program, regardless of the intensity.

### AMSSM position statement on cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes: current evidence, knowledge gaps, recommendations, and future directions [^113NsWsB]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) questionnaires — symptom and family history tools used for cardiovascular (CV) screening — have high positive response rates and notable limitations; reported positive responses occur in high school athletes at 15%-31% and in college athletes at 27%-37%, questionnaires require an honest patient and may fail to elicit symptoms not volunteered, CV symptoms can be misinterpreted as normal exertional responses, and symptoms may develop after a single-time-point PPE; the process should include athlete and family education on CV signs and symptoms that may develop after the examination and warrant reevaluation, and several studies indicate that the PPE is not implemented adequately or uniformly.

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: time for a risk-based approach? [^112xG5rB]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Determining what constitutes the most effective PPCS strategy for young athletes has created an intense debate regarding the need and feasibility of electrocardiogram (ECG)‐based screening programs. Critics of a widespread ECG‐based screening program highlight concerns related to the lack of robust evidence for its efficacy to reduce athlete fatalities, reliability of outcomes (false‐positives), and overall cost. Proponents of ECG screening recognize the relative failure of the history and physical examination to meet the primary objective of PPCS, specifically to detect athletes with at‐risk cardiac conditions, and the wealth of evidence demonstrating the high false‐positive response rate and very low positive predictive value of symptom and family history questionnaires. 2

The paradigm of ECG screening has been debated in a binary "all or nothing" form, whereby programs are mandated to include ECG for all young athletes, or none at all. These polarized options contradict the fundamental approach to preventative medicine, which ordinarily requires assessment of individualized patient risk and the available medical resources. This article will address the current landscape of PPCS and review the epidemiological data of SCA/SCD in young athletes, which may support a novel risk‐based approach to PPCS.

The annual physical examination remains a popular format with both patients and providers, despite the lack of evidence that either a comprehensive examination or laboratory screening tests are indicated for healthy adults. Patient desire for extensive testing and comprehensive examination combined with provider belief that the physical examination is both of proven value and can detect subclinical illness have led to the continued pervasive practice of annual physical examinations in our country. The authors review the current forces behind the ongoing popularity of the annual physical examination and the current recommendations for preventive services in healthy adults, and provide thoughts on what the busy practicing clinician can focus on in the realm of proven preventive health.

### Recommendations for cardiac screening and emergency action planning in youth football: a FIFA consensus statement [^115HMvp8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence review

The panel was divided into four working groups, each with an assigned content area related to the creation of cardiac screening recommendations. The groups were instructed to perform a comprehensive review of the scientific literature including original research publications and cardiology/sports medicine society guidelines relevant to their specific assigned content. Medical search engines including PubMed, OVID Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were suggested, and the use of multiple search engines was encouraged. This type of knowledge synthesis represents a pragmatic alternative to a comprehensive systematic review and accelerates the process to produce a definitive evidence base in a resource-efficient manner. Standardised assessment of study quality and risk of bias was not performed.

Each working group was provided with specific questions created by the steering committee:

Group 1 (General Principles of Youth Cardiac Screening): (a) What is the appropriate age to initiate cardiac screening in youth football players?; (b) What are the role and optimal time intervals of serial (ie, repeat) cardiac screening following the initial cardiac screening?; (c) What are the medico-legal issues (ie, consent/assent, parental/stakeholder engagement, etc) that are uniquely important to youth cardiac screening?

Group 2 (Core Components of Routine Youth Cardiac Screening): (a) What is the role of personal/family medical history and physical examination during youth cardiac screening?; (b) What is the role of 12-lead electrocardiography during youth cardiac screening?

Group 3 (Additional Diagnostic Testing During Youth Cardiac Screening): (a) What is the role of transthoracic echocardiography during youth cardiac screening?; (b) What is the role of additional testing including exercise stress testing, ambulatory rhythm monitoring, and cardiac MRI during youth cardiac screening?

Group 4 (Emergency Action Planning): (a) What recommendations should be provided about the resources needed to conduct a youth cardiac screening programme?; (b) What recommendations should be provided about the evaluation of abnormalities detected during youth cardiac screening?; (c) What are the basic elements of an effective emergency action plan (CPR proficiency, AED accessibility, emergency medical response coordination, etc) that should be in place irrespective of youth cardiac screening?

Each working group met virtually, a minimum of two times, to prepare a summary document including youth cardiac screening recommendations and a detailed bibliography prior to the consensus process in-person meeting.

### Performance of the American Heart Association (AHA) 14-point evaluation versus electrocardiography for the cardiovascular screening of high school athletes: a prospective study [^114ai2W4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of death in young athletes during sports. 1, 2 Preparticipation cardiovascular screening aimed at the detection of disorders associated with SCD is universally supported by major medical societies; however, the best method for cardiovascular screening of young athletes remains controversial. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 At the center of the debate is the addition of a resting ECG to the traditional history and physical examination (H&P). Since 1996, the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended a comprehensive personal and family H&P as the primary screening protocol and has opposed routine use of ECG during the preparticipation assessment. 8, 9, 10 In contrast, a 2005 consensus guideline by the European Society of Cardiology recommended the systematic use of ECG in the cardiovascular screening of athletes. 11

Cardiovascular screening by H&P or by ECG presents unique challenges and limitations. Several studies have documented the low sensitivity and high positive response rate of preparticipation history questionnaires. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Likewise, concerns for inaccurate ECG interpretation, high false‐positive rates, and unnecessary testing or restriction from sports have been raised regarding ECG screening. 10, 17, 18 In an attempt to improve the sensitivity of the H&P, the AHA in 2014 expanded its 12‐point evaluation by including 2 additional history questions. 10 To date, no study has evaluated the performance of the AHA 14‐point evaluation for the cardiovascular screening of athletes. The purpose of this study was to examine the performance of the AHA 14‐point evaluation compared with an ECG for the cardiovascular screening of high school student athletes.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: principles for the responsible use of regenerative medicine in sports medicine [^11245Ayy]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regenerative medicine in sports medicine — informed consent should provide understandable information and address patient questions, and valid informed consent has 3 components: patients must be informed, consent must be obtained voluntarily, and consent must be given by a competent person (or surrogate). The informed consent process should include information agreed on by professional standards or reasonable people, be conveyed in verbal and written manner with forms at a low-grade school reading level, and be discussed honestly and in a balanced manner focusing on clinically indicated and scientifically justified options. Care option discussions should include the procedure(s), risks, and potential benefits; risks such as infection, rejection, procedural complications, contamination, and other identifiable and unanticipated risks should be addressed, and benefits should be described accurately and not overemphasized. Patients should be informed that regenerative medicine interventions are not currently considered standard of care, the FDA approval status and, if part of a research protocol, the internal review board status should be discussed, out-of-pocket costs should be clearly communicated, relevant conflicts of interest should be disclosed, and the patient should be informed that they have the right to withdraw their consent from the procedure for any reason and at any time.

### Why screening tests to predict injury do not work-and probably never will…: a critical review [^115MXQWT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This paper addresses if and how a periodic health examination to screen for risk factors for injury can be used to mitigate injury risk. The key question asked is whether it is possible to use screening tests to identify who is at risk for a sports injury-in order to address the deficit through a targeted intervention programme. The paper demonstrates that to validate a screening test to predict and prevent sports injuries, at least 3 steps are needed. First, a strong relationship needs to be demonstrated in prospective studies between a marker from a screening test and injury risk (step 1). Second, the test properties need to be examined in relevant populations, using appropriate statistical tools (step 2). Unfortunately, there is currently no example of a screening test for sports injuries with adequate test properties. Given the nature of potential screening tests (where test performance is usually measured on a continuous scale from low to high), substantial overlap is to be expected between players with high and low risk of injury. Therefore, although there are a number of tests demonstrating a statistically significant association with injury risk, and therefore help the understanding of causative factors, such tests are unlikely to be able to predict injury with sufficient accuracy. The final step needed is to document that an intervention programme targeting athletes identified as being at high risk through a screening programme is more beneficial than the same intervention programme given to all athletes (step 3). To date, there is no intervention study providing support for screening for injury risk.

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: time for a risk-based approach? [^112zpdJB]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pre-participation cardiovascular screening (PPCS) is recommended by several scientific and sporting organizations on the premise that early detection of cardiac disease provides a platform for individualized risk assessment and management; which has been proven to lower mortality rates for certain conditions associated with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). What constitutes the most effective strategy for PPCS of young athletes remains a topic of considerable debate. The addition of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to the medical history and physical examination undoubtedly enhances early detection of disease, which meets the primary objective of PPCS. The benefit of enhanced sensitivity must be carefully balanced against the risk of potential harm through increased false-positive findings, costly downstream investigations, and unnecessary restriction/disqualification from competitive sports. To mitigate this risk, it is essential that ECG-based PPCS programs are implemented by institutions with a strong infrastructure and by physicians appropriately trained in modern ECG standards with adequate cardiology resources to guide downstream investigations. While PPCS is compulsory for most competitive athletes, the current debate surrounding ECG-based programs exists in a binary form; whereby ECG screening is mandated for all competitive athletes or none at all. This polarized approach fails to consider individualized patient risk and the available sports cardiology resources. The limitations of a uniform approach are highlighted by evolving data, which suggest that athletes display a differential risk profile for SCA/SCD, which is influenced by age, sex, ethnicity, sporting discipline, and standard of play. Evaluation of the etiology of SCA/SCD within high-risk populations reveals a disproportionately higher prevalence of ECG-detectable conditions. Selective ECG screening using a risk-based approach may, therefore, offer a more cost-effective and feasible approach to PPCS in the setting of limited sports cardiology resources, although this approach is not without important ethical considerations.

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: time for a risk-based approach? [^117CYZET]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pre‐participation cardiovascular screening (PPCS) is recommended by several scientific and sporting organizations on the premise that early detection of cardiac disease provides a platform for individualized risk assessment and management; which has been proven to lower mortality rates for certain conditions associated with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). What constitutes the most effective strategy for PPCS of young athletes remains a topic of considerable debate. The addition of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to the medical history and physical examination undoubtedly enhances early detection of disease, which meets the primary objective of PPCS. The benefit of enhanced sensitivity must be carefully balanced against the risk of potential harm through increased false‐positive findings, costly downstream investigations, and unnecessary restriction/disqualification from competitive sports. To mitigate this risk, it is essential that ECG‐based PPCS programs are implemented by institutions with a strong infrastructure and by physicians appropriately trained in modern ECG standards with adequate cardiology resources to guide downstream investigations. While PPCS is compulsory for most competitive athletes, the current debate surrounding ECG‐based programs exists in a binary form; whereby ECG screening is mandated for all competitive athletes or none at all.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury assessment — The high quality studies reviewed demonstrated the high significance of a sound history and physical toward assessing ACL injury. Performing a sound history and physical should not add any significant cost to ACL injury assessment. Evaluation and diagnosis of ACL injury using a relevant history and physical examination should have universal acceptability. Most feasible to expect healthcare professionals to perform and incorporate relevant history and physical examination in assessment of ACL injury. Future research could help confirm the most useful history and physical exam findings for the diagnosis of ACL injury and concomitant pathology.

### Five recommendations to address the limitations of patient-reported outcome measures [^112J7w5u]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are reported by the patient and designed to capture patients' unique perspectives of their symptoms, quality of life, function, disability, and overall health status. Despite their important role in the health care landscape, it is important to recognize that PROMs have numerous shortcomings. These include weaknesses in the development of tools and interpretation of scale values, which can lead to variable patient reporting and dissimilarities in study results, potentially influencing the effectiveness of findings. This Viewpoint makes recommendations for how to interpret and best use PROMs, in spite of their shortcomings. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2021;51(12):562–565.

### Physical activity prescription: a critical opportunity to address a modifiable risk factor for the prevention and management of chronic disease: a position statement by the Canadian academy of sport and exercise medicine [^112zMph3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Non-communicable disease is a leading threat to global health. Physical inactivity is a large contributor to this problem; in fact, the WHO ranks it as the fourth leading risk factor for overall morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Canada, at least 4 of 5 adults do not meet the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines of 150min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. Physicians play an important role in the dissemination of physical activity (PA) recommendations to a broad segment of the population, as over 80% of Canadians visit their doctors every year and prefer to get health information directly from them. Unfortunately, most physicians do not regularly assess or prescribe PA as part of routine care, and even when discussed, few provide specific recommendations. PA prescription has the potential to be an important therapeutic agent for all ages in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of chronic disease. Sport and exercise medicine (SEM) physicians are particularly well suited for this role and should collaborate with their primary care colleagues for optimal patient care. The purpose of this Canadian Academy and Sport and Exercise Medicine position statement is to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to better equip SEM and primary care physicians to prescribe PA and exercise, specifically for the prevention and management of non-communicable disease. This will be achieved by addressing common questions and perceived barriers in the field. Author note This position statement has been endorsed by the following nine sport medicine societies: Australasian College of Sports and Exercise Physicians (ACSEP), American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM), British Association of Sports and Exercise Medicine (BASEM), European College of Sport & Exercise Physicians (ECOSEP), Norsk forening for idrettsmedisin og fysisk aktivite (NIMF), South African Sports Medicine Association (SASMA), Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Sportmedizin/Swiss Society of Sports Medicine (SGSM/SSSM), Sport Doctors Australia (SDrA), Swedish Society of Exercise and Sports Medicine (SFAIM), and CASEM.

### What patient factors are associated with clinician likelihood to order a test in a setting of low pretest odds of important pathophysiology? [^115c4Mii]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In clinical settings where the diagnostic yield is low-defined as situations where there is a low probability that a harmful or treatable condition is present-diagnostic tests have more potential for harm than for benefit because they can contribute to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. To limit the potential harm of diagnostic tests, it would be helpful to improve our understanding of the clinician and patient factors associated with an increased likelihood that a clinician would order a test in a low-yield diagnostic scenario, given that good evidence suggests that these tests are ordered frequently in the course of routine practice.

Questions/Purposes

In a survey-based experiment that presented musculoskeletal specialists with patient scenarios that comprised randomized elements and a low probability of detecting a specifically treatable pathophysiology, we asked: (1) What patient factors are associated with the likelihood to order a test? (2) What surgeon factors are associated with the likelihood to order a test?

Methods

Members of the Science of Variation Group (SOVG; an international collaborative effort of fully trained musculoskeletal surgeons that studies sources of variation) were invited to participate in an online, survey-based experiment with an initial email and two reminders in November and December 2024. Among the approximately 200 participants who participate at least once a year, 80% (159 of 200) participated in this experiment (84% [134 of 159] orthopaedic surgeons, 91% [145 of 159] men, 51% [81 of 159] practicing in United States, 82% [130 of 159] supervising trainees). Even though the SOVG consists mostly of American and European White men (not by design, but by participation), we believe it provides a sufficient sample to study variation in care as the associations are likely reproducible in any sample with sufficient differences in opinion (although the exact numbers may vary). Each participant reviewed five scenarios depicting a low-yield diagnostic scenario (nonspecific pain with radiographs showing no signs of pathophysiology) with randomized factors including age, gender, anatomical area of the symptoms, patient language intended to represent a potential source of pressure, symptom duration and intensity, and activity limitations due to pain. Participants then rated their likelihood to order additional testing based on each scenario on a scale from 0, would definitely not order a test, to 100, definitely would order a test. Participants also completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty scale, a validated measure of a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in situations characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, and lack of control. Multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis was used to identify variables independently associated with the likelihood to order additional testing.

Results

Greater specialist likelihood to order a low-yield diagnostic test (overall median [IQR] of 60 [slightly more likely than neutral] [20 to 82]) was moderately associated with symptom duration with regression coefficients (RC) ranging from 10 to 25 for durations of 2 months to 1 year relative to 2 weeks; slightly to moderately associated with all levels of concern relative to "Is easily reassured and monitor things over time" (RC ranging from 6.6 to 19); moderately associated with pain intensity (RC 3.9; considered moderate correlation size given the range of pain intensity is 1 to 9, meaning the maximum mean difference between low and high pain levels is 35); and slightly associated with all levels of incapability relative to "is able to do all activities" (RC ranging from 5.2 to 9.3). The likelihood to order additional testing was not associated with surgeon level of intolerance of uncertainty.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that specialists may be more likely to order low-yield diagnostic tests with greater potential for harm (such as overdiagnosis and overtreatment) than benefit in settings of greater symptom duration and intensity, when patients express more limitations caused by pain, and when specialists perceive greater potential pressure from patients.

Clinical Relevance

Greater awareness and tools such as debiasing checklists (which provide a step-by-step approach of evaluating medical decisions) may help clinicians to limit unhelpful test use. Future studies are needed to further evaluate factors influencing surgeons to order additional testing, particularly in in-person care settings.

### Assessment and management of atherosclerosis in the athletic patient [^116WDmWJ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Many patients and physicians correctly associate physical activity with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vigorous physical exertion is paradoxically associated with a transient increase in the risk of cardiovascular events and sudden cardiac death. This review extrapolates data from the general population to the management of athletes with symptoms suspicious for coronary artery disease or with prior cardiac events. A history to elicit an athlete's concerns and symptoms combined with a physical examination should guide the decision for preparticipation exercise testing for athletes without prior cardiac events. Athletes with established coronary artery disease should receive aggressive secondary prevention regimens, with special attention to adverse effects that may be unique to this group. There may be benefit in taking time away from competitive athletics to allow for stabilization of coronary artery disease with cholesterol-lowering therapy and, therefore, reduction of future risk. Exercise testing is important for defining risk before the return to participation for athletes who have sustained a cardiac event. Many athletes will ultimately be able to return to full participation provided they have received aggressive therapy and understand the residual risk associated with vigorous physical exertion in the setting of coronary artery disease.

### Preparticipation medical evaluation for elite athletes: EFSMA recommendations on standardised preparticipation evaluation form in European countries [^116kpeYQ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

What should be included in the PPE?

The PPE is a medical and legal document developed following a standardised periodic evaluation performed by SEM doctors. It is a complex assessment of the health status, growth and development process and performance level. The SEM doctor assumes responsibility for signing off the PPE, stating that the person can practise a sports activity with the maximal intensity and duration for himself without any contraindications and participate in competitions at the levels indicated. Other important objectives of PPE are to identify factors that may affect performance and factors that increase the risk of future illness and ensure an appropriate medical treatment following antidoping regulation. At the same time, PPE has a great contribution to the scientific management of sports activity to maintain the well-being and health of the athletes.

The PPE should entail the following diagnostic components:

Health status.
Anthropometry.
Functional and exercise capacity.

Health status

Health assessment is based on family medical history, personal medical history, training history, training information and medical complaints: symptoms and signs. Standardised history and clinical examination with digital or 'e-documentation' are recommended, storing or paper documentation should be implicit avoided. Establishing the objective health status by physical examination includes the evaluation of dermatological conditions, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system and resting ECG with 12 leads digital recording and software supported. Abdominal, neurological, ophthalmological and ENT examinations, blood and biochemical tests, urine samples should also be assessed. Important goals of PPE are early detection and prevention of severe complications during sports activities in both leisure time and competitive sports.

The athlete's history forms have been listed above. The needed information consists of the year when the athlete started with sports, current type of sports, and results he obtained in competitions, and types of training the athlete performs. It is also important to hear the athlete's goals in sports to provide optimal opportunities and recommendations for achieving peak performance. Further, particular, monitoring training effects of potential difficulties, injuries or overtraining should be asked for in order to get medical counselling or advice.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^112vjYBW]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of exercise promotion, as a starting point, an assessment of current activity status should be obtained. Whilst questionnaires such as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ‐SF) provide a convenient and cost‐effective method to quantify physical activity, there remains concern regarding potential under‐and overestimation when relying on patient self‐report in isolation on an individual basis. Due to the exponential rise in the availability and use of mobile technologies with in‐built activity sensors (with the functionality to monitor daily step‐count), modern smartphones provide an opportunity to retrospectively review objective physical activity data (with appropriate consent obtained) during consultation.

Incorporating open‐ended questions should be encouraged to understand barriers and facilitators to exercise engagement and physical capacity to lead an active lifestyle (e.g. "how do you feel about your current activity status and/or ability to undertake exercise?"), and in turn, develop personalised recommendations to optimise enjoyment and promote long‐term adherence. Implementing established behaviour change strategies (e.g. goal setting, action planning, positive reinforcement and motivational techniques etc.) should also be utilised, alongside pragmatic advice to increase activities of daily living (e.g. use the stairs rather than escalator at work to increase daily step‐count etc.). For those with limited experience of exercise training, it is important to provide reassurance that an increased perception of effort and mild sensation of breathlessness is a physiologically appropriate and expected response to moderate to vigorous‐intensity exercise. Likewise, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) 24–48 h post exercise is a normal and expected response to vigorous exertion, particularly for untrained individuals or following unaccustomed exercise, and resolves spontaneously within 5–7 days. Finally, educating patients concerning the benefits and relatively low risks of undertaking exercise is imperative given very few asthma deaths in conjunction with exercise or sports participation have been reported over the past three decades.

### The preparticipation physical evaluation [^115Frdea]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is a common reason for young athletes to see a primary care physician. An annual PPE is required by most state high school athletic associations for participation in school-based sports, although there is limited evidence to support its effectiveness for detecting conditions that predispose athletes to injury or illness. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics, with representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians and other organizations, published updated PPE recommendations (PPE5). According to the guideline, the general goals of the PPE are determining general physical and psychological health; evaluating for life-threatening or disabling conditions, including risk of sudden cardiac arrest and other conditions that may predispose the athlete to illness or injury; and serving as an entry point into the health care system for those without a medical home or primary care physician. The guideline recommends that the evaluation take place in the physician's office rather than in a group setting. The PPE should include a structured physical examination that focuses on the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. Screening for depression, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is also recommended. Clinicians should recognize any findings suggestive of the relative energy deficiency in sport syndrome. Additional consideration is required to address the needs and concerns of transgender athletes and athletes with physical and intellectual disabilities. Finally, guidelines have been published regarding return to play for athletes who have had COVID-19.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: principles for the responsible use of regenerative medicine in sports medicine [^116xd8a3]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Outcome measures in regenerative medicine — practices performing regenerative medicine procedures should collect patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for multiple reasons, including the experimental nature of some procedures, quality control and patient safety purposes, improving the informed consent process by discussing efficacy and safety outcomes among patients, conducting clinical research, providing information that may assist with reimbursement, and assisting regulatory bodies and third party payers in examining cost-effectiveness. There are many relevant and validated musculoskeletal-specific PROMs to assess physical function and pain, and these PROMs allow patients to report on their own health directly without interpretation from a medical professional. The FDA has stated that they will also consider real-world evidence (RWE) and outcomes (RWO) when reviewing information on regenerative medicine treatments, and RWE/RWO are gathered outside conventional clinical trials from sources such as patient charts, laboratory reports, patient registries, pragmatic clinical trials, surveys, and mobile health devices, and complement evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials.

Measurement properties for clinical examination and MRI

No single question, test or image can accurately identify an ACL injury, every time. The measurement tools available to the clinician are not perfect, but they do yield valuable information in the clinical context. Knowledge of the measurement properties of clinical tools helps the clinician balance the information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of clinical examination and MRI for ACL tear and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values (Table 1). This means that if the clinical examination or MRI are negative for injury, the chance of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not mean that the clinician can always reliably rule the diagnosis in.

### Strategic assessment of risk and risk tolerance (StARRT) framework for return-to-play decision-making [^115m6nPw]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The sport medicine clinician is faced with return-to-play (RTP) decisions for every patient who wants to return to activity. The complex interaction of factors related to history, physical examination, testing, activity and baseline characteristics can make RTP decision-making challenging. Further, when reasoning is not explicit, unnecessary conflict can arise among clinicians themselves, or among clinicians and patients. This conflict can have negative health consequences for the patient. In 2010, a transparent framework for RTP decisions was proposed. However, some have identified limitations to the framework and found difficulties in its implementation. This paper presents a revised framework that addresses the limitations, and provides concrete examples of how to apply it in simple and complex cases.

### AMSSM position statement on cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes: current evidence, knowledge gaps, recommendations, and future directions [^115hMFS1]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ECG screening risk–benefit — screening carries risks of identifying conditions that may never become symptomatic (overdiagnosis), and if the threat or evidence of harms from early detection with potential overdiagnosis using a specific strategy are large, screening by that means "should be questioned". Use of ECG will increase detection but may raise risks of overdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, unnecessary disqualification, and adverse events or outcomes from restrictions, management, or procedures; adding a test to enhance preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) sensitivity also layers risks via more false‑positives, costly secondary investigations, and potential unnecessary interventions including temporary sports restriction and prohibiting exercise when not indicated. Identification of cardiovascular abnormalities also creates opportunities for risk assessment and disease management, and published studies in relatively small U.S. athlete cohorts have not reported major adverse events/harm or death from screening, although risks and complications from invasive procedures remain a concern; more outcomes data are needed, and history and physical examination alone also carries risks including false‑positive responses, a higher false‑negative rate, and perhaps false reassurance.

The page specifies that the evaluation of health status includes medical factors such as age, personal medical history, symptoms and physical examination, lab tests, and psychological state; sport modifiers include the type of sport, position played, level of competition, and equipment used; and additional modifiers include timing with respect to the season, the athlete's desire to participate, pressure from parents or coaches, financial conflicts of interest, and the fear of litigation. It further emphasizes that beyond exam and labs, clinicians should consider social, emotional, and physical stressors when holding an athlete out from sport.

### Clinical examination, diagnostic imaging, and testing of athletes with groin pain: an evidence-based approach to effective management [^111AsBuh]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Synopsis Groin pain is common in athletes who participate in multidirectional sports and has traditionally been considered a difficult problem to understand, diagnose, and manage. This may be due to sparse historical focus on this complex region in sports medicine. Until recently, there has been little agreement regarding terminology, definitions, and classification of groin pain in athletes. This has made clear communication between clinicians difficult, and the results of research difficult to interpret and implement into practice. However, during the past decade, the field has evolved rapidly, and an evidence-based understanding is now emerging. This clinical commentary discusses the clinical examination (subjective history, screening, physical examination); imaging; testing of impairments, function, and performance; and management of athletes with groin pain in an evidence-based framework.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^1175hT3K]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Preseason evaluation and planning — preparticipation and baseline testing: Preparation for the care of athletes begins before any practice or competition with a preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) and the development and practice of an emergency action plan. The PPE should include past concussion or other traumatic brain injury history and the presence of premorbid/comorbid conditions or modifiers, including learning disorder, attention deficit disorder, motion sickness or sensitivity, mood disorders, migraine history, and current medication use. Several organizations recommend baseline evaluation before sports participation to assist with diagnosis and return-to-play decisions in an athlete with a suspected concussion, and several factors require consideration before implementing any test into an evaluation program for baseline or postinjury purposes; there is considerable normal variation in test performance with repeat testing in noninjured athletes and some tests are associated with a cost.

### Sternoclavicular joint palpation pain: the shoulder's waddell sign? [^113JAE2F]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is a complex and subjective reality and can be magnified by nonorganic or nonanatomic sources. Multiple studies have demonstrated a correlation between psychological factors and patients' perceptions of musculoskeletal pain and disability. In addition, nonorganic findings as part of the physical examination are well and long recognized. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between a shoulder examination test, palpation of the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ), and psychosocial conditions including chronic pain, depression, and anxiety.

Methods

From June until October 2016, all new patients of 2 sports/shoulder fellowship-trained surgeons at an academic practice were screened for study enrollment. After their consent was obtained, patients were given a set of 5 surveys (Pain Catastrophizing Scale; Patient-Health Questionnaire 2; Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire; shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire; and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index) to complete. The physician then completed a comprehensive standardized physical examination, with the examining physician being blinded to the patient's survey responses. Palpation of the SCJ was done with the examiner's thumbs and was accompanied by the question "Does this hurt?" If a positive pain response was given, clarification as to the correct side of the pain was made.

Results

A total of 132 patients were enrolled and completed the surveys and physical examination. Of the patients, 26 (19.7%) reported SCJ pain with SCJ palpation. Patients with and without confirmed pain on SCJ palpation had significantly different (P < .001) mean scores for all 5 surveys. A review of the medical histories between the 2 groups identified a significantly increased prevalence of chronic pain and mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression, in SCJ palpation-positive patients.

Conclusions

Patients who confirmed pain on SCJ palpation had significantly higher scores on various psychological surveys than those who denied pain on palpation, indicating that a portion of their pain was stemming from a nonorganic source. Inclusion of SCJ palpation during a routine shoulder or upper extremity physical examination may improve selection of treatment options for patients.

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: time for a risk-based approach? [^111xxGnv]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 4
Electrocardiogram‐detectable etiologies implicated in 117 cases of sudden cardiac arrest and death in US competitive athletes (age 11‐29 years) 18

When ample sports cardiology resources are available, routine use of ECG is possible in the PPSC of all athletes. However, reserving the ECG for smaller populations of higher risk groups may offer a more pragmatic approach for institutions that are not equipped with the infrastructure and expertise to adequately support an ECG‐based model on a larger scale.

It is prudent, however, to consider the ethical issues of such an approach. Institutions may argue that equivalent screening services should be available to all athletes under their care and not differentiated based on sex, race, or sport. This notion is supported by data from France, Denmark, and the United States, which has demonstrated that the incidence of SCD in recreational athletes and nonathletic individuals, is higher than previously thought. 17, 42, 43 While recreational athletes are not required to undergo a PPCS prior to sports participation, should these individuals be precluded from primary preventative strategies? Critics may also argue that a larger number of epidemiological studies, using mandatory reporting systems for case identification, are warranted before we can reliably define "high‐risk" populations. However, nearly all preventive practices in medicine base the rigor of the screening evaluation on the individual risk of the patient, and thus there is justification in the setting of limited resources to provide the most intensive screening to the athletes shown by current evidence to be at highest risk.

Preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) — Role and objectives in cardiovascular screening note that "The overall role of the PPE is to evaluate the health of the athlete to optimize safe sports participation and provide an opportunity to assess current and future health risks and quality of life matters.1,5,6" Despite use, "Although studies have not shown the PPE to prevent morbidity or mortality in athletes, there is general agreement and acceptance that the primary objective of the PPE is to detect conditions that predispose athletes to serious injury, illness, or sudden death.1" The approach is described: "The current PPE model uses a comprehensive history questionnaire and physical examination", but "Although pragmatic and widely practiced, this model has shown limited effectiveness in screening for conditions associated with sudden death or catastrophic injury". Historically, "In 2004, an evidence-based review questioned the PPE format as an effective method for health risk screening before participation in exercise and sport.7", and currently, "As currently practiced, the PPE may have fallen short of achieving its desired purpose, and its primary goals may need to be revaluated and refocused".

### AMSSM position statement on cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes: current evidence, knowledge gaps, recommendations, and future directions [^116v2ng7]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Future research directions — knowledge gaps and priorities — are suggested, including higher quality data on the etiology of SCA/D in athletes to guide screening strategies with standardized autopsies, wider application of postmortem genetic testing, and review of the diagnosis in cases of SCA with survival. The downstream impact of any screening program requires more research with a better understanding of the natural history of cardiac disorders and more complete outcomes data; the outcomes and clinical course of athletes identified with CV disorders at risk for SCA/D should be monitored inclusive of adverse events from diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, continued participation in sports and exercise, and the occurrence of major CV events or other CV morbidity. Additional priorities include potential avenues to refine the history and physical examination as a screening tool and addressing a potential gap between expert-center ECG screening and more novice sites with less experience, with more data addressing implementation research and the potential impact of technological advances to assist accurate ECG interpretation results.

### Screening for yellow flags in orthopaedic physical therapy: a clinical framework [^111sZWPx]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Psychological factors influence or are associated with physical function, pain, and health care costs among individuals with musculoskeletal pain conditions. Recent clinical practice guidelines recommend screening for psychological factors (also referred to as "yellow flags") in physical therapy practice to help understand prognosis and inform shared decision making for treatment.

Clinical Question

Despite the urgings of clinical practice guidelines and evidence of the influence of psychological factors on clinical outcomes, screening for yellow flags is uncommon in clinical practice. Clinicians may feel uncertain about how to integrate screening tools into clinical practice, and how screening results might inform decision making and care coordination.

Key Results

We outline a 3-step framework for routine yellow flag screening in physical therapy practice: (1) establish a standard first-line screening instrument and process, (2) interpret the results to inform shared decision making, and (3) monitor treatment progress. Four case examples illustrate how yellow flag screening can help clinicians and patients decide whether the patient might benefit most from standard physical therapy, psychologically informed physical therapy, psychologically informed physical therapy with referral to another health care provider, or immediate referral.

Clinical Application

Consider incorporating a standard yellow flag screening process into usual musculoskeletal health care. We present a framework to guide yellow flag screening in practice (1) to help inform treatment pathway selection and (2) to enhance interdisciplinary communication.

### International olympic committee (IOC) consensus paper on sports-related ophthalmology issues in elite sports [^115BR2r4]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Targeted history and assessment of the athlete's eye

Regular assessment of the athlete's eyes

Eye screening — preferably conducted off-season — is essential to maximise visual capacity, protect eye health, and provide an educational opportunity to reduce traumatic eye injury. At the same time, a full ophthalmic examination of the eye examination ought to include history-taking, physical examination, intraocular pressure measurement, slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, dilated fundus examination and ocular imaging. The sports medicine physician is expected to take the history, conduct a physical examination of the eye, perform a red reflex, and perform a funduscopy.

Office or off-field assessment

When managing an ocular injury on the field, the primary priorities are to protect the eye from further harm. In the following, decide which injury may require immediate referral to an ophthalmologist. As a sports medicine physician, you should update yourself on the guidelines for returning an athlete to competition.

History taking

If the athlete is anxious, put the athlete at ease. Note the sport, discipline and injury mechanism, and whether the athlete has symptoms only in one or both eyes. In addition, question the athlete about prior eye diseases, whether protective eyewear was used and whether the athlete has any pain. Following this, assess for blunt, penetrating or perforating injuries; the force and direction of the impact; the possibility of a foreign body/s; pre-existing eye conditions (eg, contact lens use, eye-drops, whether undergone cataract surgery, glaucoma and retinal surgery, refractive surgery, cataract surgery and relevant history (eg, head injury)).

In the dressing room, establish the date of the last tetanus immunisation (for tetanus prophylaxis) and underlying medical conditions (eg, autoimmune disease, allergy).

### AMSSM position statement on cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes: current evidence, knowledge gaps, recommendations, and future directions [^111gazZS]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

AMSSM position statement — cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes emphasizes that cardiovascular (CV) screening in young athletes is widely recommended and routinely performed before participation in competitive sports, but controversy centers on adding a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to the history and physical examination. The absence of definitive outcomes-based evidence at this time precludes AMSSM from endorsing any single or universal CV screening strategy for all athletes including legislative mandates, and the statement presents a new paradigm to assist the individual physician in assessing the most appropriate CV screening strategy unique to their athlete population, community needs, and resources. The decision to implement a CV screening program, with or without the addition of ECG, necessitates careful consideration of the risk of sudden cardiac arrest and death (SCA/D) in the targeted population and the availability of cardiology resources and infrastructure, and it is the individual physician's assessment that the chosen model for early detection provides greater benefit than harm.

### Preparticipation medical evaluation for elite athletes: EFSMA recommendations on standardised preparticipation evaluation form in European countries [^111rqzCp]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Why is PPE needed?

The main scope of the PPE is protecting the health of the athletes. First and importantly PPE objectives are early detection and prevention of severe or threatening complications during sports activities both in leisure time and competitive sports. The PPE is a key tool in the process of screening for conditions that may be life‐threatening, disabling or may predispose to injury or illness. Secondary, PPE is useful to determine and improve the level of performance, to help the athlete's staff (coach, athletic trainer, strength and conditioning trainer, physiotherapist, etc) in the selection process and further optimise the training according to the health status, to counsel the athlete regarding health issue and nonetheless to establish a relationship between SEM physician and athlete.

One of the longstanding debates is the question of including ECG screening in the PPE for all competitive athletes. ECG at rest as a mandatory examination in athletes is strongly recommended in most European countries. As such, there is long-standing controversy about whether ECG at rest should also be performed in all athletes, whereas in the United States and Canada is not required for all. Main arguments against ECG are the lack of large prospective studies with hard endpoints such as cardiac events or mortality. Some authors within former years emphasise the low sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the ECG. However, current studies with newer criteria and interpretation increased the validity of ECG, as false positive and negative findings decreased significantly (four scientific articles from 2013 published by Drezner et al). The ECG at rest in PPE enhances the power of diagnostic value in athletes with genetic diseases such as cardiomyopathies, channelopathies which are predisposing to sudden cardiac arrest or death. In a previous EFSMA statement on ECG for PPELöllgen and colleagues presented the pros and cons of having ECG screening integrated in the PPE and concluded that ECG is very sensitive in cardiac screening, and the specificity is increasing constantly, as more studies emerge. Cardiac complications comprise rhythm disorders, structural cardiac diseases or other inherited diseases. Some of these demonstrate underlying genetic causes. Guidelines for detecting these diseases during PPE are strongly improved by checklists, mostly based on family history and ECG findings with ECG interpretation supported by a special sports medicine software of most ECG devices. The software-based interpretation of ECG is superior to visual analysis only. Furthermore, the superior role of digital supported ECG interpretation over visual approach for screening athletes and physical active people has been demonstrated by two studies. Automatic evaluation of athletes ECG device based on current criteria, have made the interpretation more reliable than visual alone.

Concussion associated with sport is a common occurrence with an estimated 1.6 to 3.8 million sports-related concussions yearly in the United States. The sideline assessment of concussion focuses on four areas: cognitive ability, balance, associated symptoms, and visual tracking. Tools available on the sideline to assist in the diagnosis of concussion are discussed in this article. Some of these tools are validated and reliable and some are developing and have yet to be proven to be sensitive enough for routine use. These tools along with a thorough history and physical examination enable a sideline physician to accurately diagnose concussion.

### Missed opportunities in the preparticipation physical examination for high school athletes [^112Dq1C5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The preparticipation sports examination (PPE) is required for US high school athletes. We queried members of the Illinois Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (ICAAP) about what they actually include in a PPE, allotted PPE time, and counseling about full contact sports participation. Of 2300 ICAAP members contacted electronically, 228 (10%) responded, yielding 205 usable surveys. When performing a PPE, 34 (25%) always complete all of 6 selected AAP-recommended PPE components and 102 (74%) always get a concussion history. In contrast, 29 (21%) always complete all of the 6 selected AAP PPE components and 70 (49%) always get a concussion history as part of well-child checkup. Main interferences with clinician proficiency are lack of time and training cited by 49% and 37%, respectively. Pediatricians were evenly divided about whether or not to counsel against full contact sports, but were more likely to do so after the athlete sustained a first concussion.

Diagnosis of concussion — the diagnosis is challenging and based on clinical assessment; it is complicated by a lack of validated, objective diagnostic tests, reliance on self-reported symptoms, and confounding symptoms from other conditions; nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, mood changes, "fogginess", dizziness, visual changes, fatigue, and neck pain may also originate from other etiologies; symptoms may be delayed or initially unrecognized, and concussion remains a clinical diagnosis made by synthesizing history and physical examination findings as the injury evolves.

### Saving athletes' lives a reason to find common ground? [^112Z1dzt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although both U.S. and European guidelines recommend screening athletes for suspected heart disease before participation in competitive sport, they disagree on which findings are associated with increased risk as well as those athletes whose activities should be restricted. Recent Italian data suggest that screening programs can save lives, but few countries have fully adopted such practices. It is time to develop an international consensus on who should receive pre-participation screening, who should perform the screening, what tests the screening should consist of, and what criteria should be used to restrict participation.

### How do I measure physical activity in my patients? Questionnaires and objective methods [^112CxPzZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

How do healthcare providers know if their patients are getting enough physical activity to promote good health and to reduce their risks of chronic diseases and injury? The first step is to identify the patient's current level of physical activity using questionnaires and/or motion sensors. Questionnaires assess activity levels by having patients answer a set of questions about the types and amounts of activity performed at some time in the past. Motion sensors assess physical activity by patients wearing a small monitoring device that records their body movement as it occurs. If a provider is interested in determining a patient's caloric energy expenditure, he/she can apply statistical regression models to the questionnaire and motion sensor data to estimate kilocalories. If more precise measures of energy expenditure are desired, a provider can use the isotopic doubly labelled water method to estimate kilocalories; however, this method is costly and is impractical in non-research clinical settings.

### Performance of the American Heart Association (AHA) 14-point evaluation versus electrocardiography for the cardiovascular screening of high school athletes: a prospective study [^115jbNR7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, ECG screening surpassed the AHA 14‐point evaluation in all statistical measures of performance. Importantly, the false‐positive rate for ECG, when interpreted by experienced clinicians using modern standards that distinguish physiologic cardiac adaptations from findings suggestive of cardiac pathology, was only 2.4%. The evolution and improved accuracy of ECG interpretation standards for athletes has readily improved specificity without compromising sensitivity. 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 The high number of false‐positive responses to the AHA 14‐point history questions creates a challenge for the examining clinician to determine which responses are clinically concerning and warrant additional investigation. In this study, experienced sports medicine and cardiology physicians determined that approximately half of the positive responses were noncardiac in nature. It is unclear in the broader clinical context how primary care providers react to these responses, if more information is gathered, if additional testing is ordered, or if a large number of positive history responses are simply ignored. Even if every athlete with a clinically relevant positive response undergoes an ECG as in this study, this still does not capture the majority of athletes with detectable conditions at risk for SCD.

Athletes may experience cardiovascular symptoms related to an underlying cardiac disorder. 30 However, it is not evident that screening with a history questionnaire will effectively identify athletes with relevant warning signs or symptoms. In this study, the history questionnaire generated a large number of positive responses, with 45.4% of subjects marking at least 1 affirmative response and 22.5% having at least 1 positive response that could not be excluded as noncardiac after physician review. The most common history responses pertained to "chest pain/pressure/tightness/discomfort related to exertion", "excessive and unexplained shortness of breath/fatigue or palpitations associated with exercise", and a listing of genetic cardiac conditions. The wording of these symptom inquiries is broad and nonspecific and may overlap with common physiologic sensations during exercise. The listing of genetic cardiac conditions is likely unfamiliar to the athlete, and families may mistake common conditions for the genetic disorders listed. More research is needed to understand what questions, with what wording, with what prompts, and in what format (ie, written, video, or verbal) may better detect athletes of all ages with cardiovascular symptoms warranting more evaluation.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^111xeAyY]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) — clinical conclusions and management: SRC is common among athletes and a common reason for medical encounters with sports medicine physicians, and concussion is a complex, heterogeneous brain injury that typically clinically resolves in 1 to 4 weeks. The diagnosis of concussion is challenging because it relies on self-reported symptoms and there are no readily available objective diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis. Sports medicine physicians and others who diagnose concussion should be familiar with the psychometric properties of the sideline and office assessment tools they are using. After a brief period of rest, acutely concussed patients can be encouraged to gradually and progressively increase their physical and cognitive activity while staying below their symptom-exacerbation thresholds. In cases of prolonged symptoms, a multidisciplinary team experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion should be considered. There are many beneficial aspects to participation in sport and exercise that should be balanced against the concern for concussion.

However, approximately 80% of athletes who suffer SCA/D have no documented warning symptoms at the time of PPE screening and may be missed by an evaluation focused primarily on signs and symptoms.

### Effectiveness of screening examinations to detect unrecognized exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^112zFdSS]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if a physician-administered physical examination and screening questionnaire accurately detects exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in adolescent athletes.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study of 256 adolescents participating in organized sports from 3 suburban high schools. The number of persons screened positive for EIB by physical examination and questionnaire was compared with the number of persons with EIB diagnosed by a "gold standard" test that consisted of a 7-minute exercise challenge followed by serial spirometry.

Results

We diagnosed EIB in 9.4% of adolescent athletes. The screening history identified persons with symptoms or a previous diagnosis suggestive of EIB in 39.5% of the participants, but only 12.9% of these persons actually had EIB. Among adolescents with a negative review of symptoms of asthma or EIB, 7.8% had EIB. Among adolescents with no previous diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or EIB, 7.2% had EIB diagnosed by exercise challenge. Persons who screened negative on all questions about symptoms or history of asthma, EIB, and allergic rhinitis accounted for 45.8% of the adolescents with EIB.

Conclusions

EIB occurs frequently in adolescent athletes, and screening by physical examination and medical history does not accurately detect it.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^114sxouC]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

ACSM return-to-activity (RTA) considerations after exertional heat stroke (EHS) or exertional heat illness (EHI) state that a detailed history and physical examination including unique intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, the timing of treatment, and the rate of cooling must be considered in the RTA decision. The athlete should refrain from exercise for at least 7 d after release from initial medical care, at which time the clinician will address the clinical course of the heat stroke incident and carefully assess the status of end-organ function. The clinician should carefully address any intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors associated with the EHS event. When medically eligible for RTA/RTP based on the return of normal end organ function, an individual can begin exercise in a cool environment and gradually increase the duration, intensity, and heat exposure over 2 to 4 wk to initiate environmental acclimatization, improve fitness, and demonstrate heat tolerance. If return to vigorous activity and evidence of the patient's ability to adapt to exercise-heat stress over several days is not accomplished within 4 to 6 wk, consider referral to a physician with experience in heat related disorders for further evaluation that may include HTT in a controlled setting. An athlete may be allowed to resume full competition between 2 and 4 wk after demonstrating sports-specific exercise acclimatization and heat tolerance with no abnormal symptoms or test results during the re-acclimatization period.

### Call for joint informed consent in athletes with inherited cardiac conditions [^113pCZto]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Ψ — This list does not aim to be exhaustive or cover all possible clinical scenarios. It is based on current guidelines/consensus and on the author's personal experience and views.

It is of the utmost importance the physician clearly informs patients (and relatives if the patient is legally a minor) of their condition, the possible risks and seriousness of the situation, areas of evidence and knowledge gaps, which treatment options are available and their effectiveness, and all according to existing data or lack thereof. The clinician should highlight when these are not 100% predictive and if existing data are preliminary.

The question of how much information a physician must give to a patient may be contentious. The General Medical Council document on Good Medical Practice advises that the doctor must tell patients if treatment might result in a serious adverse outcome, even if the risk is very small, and physicians should also tell patients about less serious complications if they occur frequently (point 32). Not informing the patient about a risk the doctor thinks is negligible, and therefore assuming the patient shares the same opinion, can be perceived as medical paternalism. The concept of material risk is of importance in this topic. This is defined as 'either a risk to which a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance or a risk that a doctor knows — or should reasonably know — would probably be deemed of significance by this particular patient'. Therefore, if information is likely to be of significance to the athlete, doctors should disclose it, and should not wait for the athlete to ask for it.

According to the General Medical Council guidance, doctors should respect athlete's decision even if it seems 'wrong or irrational' (point 43), and ascertain the decision is voluntary (point 41) and not happening as a result of pressure from a third party. This certainly will be alarming to many physicians when a patient is perceived to be at very high risk of sudden death (see examples of box 2). In such circumstances, every endeavour should be taken to ensure that the athlete understands the risk and is protected accordingly. However, ultimately the decision lies in the hands of the athletes unless they are officially banned by the club or sports organisation. In spite of this, every effort should be made to create a close partnership with the physician, as avoiding screening or any form of medical contact can result in harm to the athlete.

### Are sports medicine journals relevant and applicable to practitioners and athletes? [^114E3cBs]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the evidence base of sports medicine research and assess how relevant and applicable it is to everyday practice.

Methods

Original research articles, short reports, and case reports published in four major sport and exercise medicine journals were studied and classified according to the main topic of study and type of subjects used.

Results

The most common topic was sports science, and very few studies related to the treatment of injuries and medical conditions. The majority of published articles used healthy subjects sampled from the sedentary population, and few studies have been carried out on injured participants.

Conclusions

There is a dearth of studies addressing diagnostic and treatment interventions in the sports medicine literature. The evidence base for sports medicine must continue to increase in terms of volume and quality.

### Commonalities, differences, and challenges with patient-derived outcome measurement tools: function / activity scales [^117Mt5cx]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a critical need to evaluate the success of orthopaedic treatments through valid outcome measures. Previous attempts to express patient outcomes using a single aggregate score led to scores that were ambiguous, often insensitive to change, and poorly correlated with the patient's assessment of the outcome of surgical procedures. WHERE ARE WE NOW? Numerous patient-reported outcome measurement tools have been developed for assessment of patients' level of activity and functional status, especially after joint arthroplasty. However, most tools assume an idealized set of prescribed activities independent of the age, activity level, and lifestyle of each individual. Few instruments are designed to capture the priorities of individual patients, especially those involved in high-demand sporting and recreational activities. WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO? We need valid outcome measures that provide a meaningful, individualized assessment of the functional status of each patient, taking into account the lifestyle and expectation of each individual. This advance in outcome measurement will allow clinicians to individualize treatment and provide patients with an accurate estimate of the outcome of alternative treatments and procedures. HOW DO WE GET THERE? Much more comprehensive information is needed to characterize the activities, abilities, and physical aspirations of individual patients. This could form a database for the development of predictive models relating individual characteristics to functional outcomes. Statistical tools are needed to minimize the burden on patients in completing questionnaires to access predictive data and to ensure that all outcome assessments are psychometrically valid.

### The Warwick Agreement on Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome (FAI syndrome): an international consensus statement [^1166Pi8m]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The 2016 Warwick Agreement on femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome was convened to build an international, multidisciplinary consensus on the diagnosis and management of patients with FAI syndrome. 22 panel members and 1 patient from 9 countries and 5 different specialties participated in a 1-day consensus meeting on 29 June 2016. Prior to the meeting, 6 questions were agreed on, and recent relevant systematic reviews and seminal literature were circulated. Panel members gave presentations on the topics of the agreed questions at Sports Hip 2016, an open meeting held in the UK on 27–29 June. Presentations were followed by open discussion. At the 1-day consensus meeting, panel members developed statements in response to each question through open discussion; members then scored their level of agreement with each response on a scale of 0–10. Substantial agreement (range 9.5–10) was reached for each of the 6 consensus questions, and the associated terminology was agreed on. The term 'femoroacetabular impingement syndrome' was introduced to reflect the central role of patients' symptoms in the disorder. To reach a diagnosis, patients should have appropriate symptoms, positive clinical signs and imaging findings. Suitable treatments are conservative care, rehabilitation, and arthroscopic or open surgery. Current understanding of prognosis and topics for future research were discussed. The 2016 Warwick Agreement on FAI syndrome is an international multidisciplinary agreement on the diagnosis, treatment principles and key terminology relating to FAI syndrome. Author note The Warwick Agreement on femoroacetabular impingement syndrome has been endorsed by the following 25 clinical societies: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM), Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports and Exercise Medicine (ACPSEM), Australasian College of Sports and Exercise Physicians (ACSEP), Austian Sports Physiotherapists, British Association of Sports and Exercise Medicine (BASEM), British Association of Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers (BASRaT), Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine (CASEM), Danish Society of Sports Physical Therapy (DSSF), European College of Sports and Exercise Physicians (ECOSEP), European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy (ESSKA), Finnish Sports Physiotherapist Association (SUFT), German-Austrian-Swiss Society for Orthopaedic Traumatologic Sports Medicine (GOTS), International Federation of Sports Physical Therapy (IFSPT), International Society for Hip Arthroscopy (ISHA), Groupo di Interesse Specialistico dell'A.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^115VNKmB]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for concussion, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (sport-related concussion, evaluation of prolonged symptoms), AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to evaluate athletes with prolonged symptoms after sport-related concussion for coexisting problems contributing to the lack of symptom resolution. Consider referring these patients to an appropriate healthcare provider able to evaluate and treat these problems.

The survey

The survey was developed by epidemiologists, orthopaedic surgeons, trauma surgeons and sport and exercise medicine physicians with relevant clinical and methodological expertise (OCD, IvdAS, RLD, KWW, JZ, IHFR). It was designed to assess responders' characteristics and the complete applied/preferred management decisions from diagnosis to rehabilitation. In designing the questions, attention was paid to recommendations made in the AAOS guidelines. The survey consisted of a minimum of 21 and a maximum of 35 items, depending on the type of ATR treatment (non-surgical, surgical or both) responders use in their practice. Most questions were presented in multiple-choice format. The Appendix describes the survey questions.

Items in the survey were divided into four major sections: (1) individual characteristics, (2) diagnostic tools used, (3) preferred/applied primary treatment of ATRs, and (4) rehabilitation methods and advised time until return to sport (RTS). In each section responders were asked questions about:

Their medical specialism, years of experience, practice setting and number of ATRs treated per year.
Use of diagnostic tools [physical examination: palpation of tendon gap, Thompson test; imaging: ultrasound (US), MRI, X-ray and CT] for which responders were asked to select all they apply for diagnosis and treatment-planning.
Type of preferred primary treatment (non-surgical or surgical) in the context of the individual patient, dependent on clinical factors such as age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, body mass index (BMI), activity level, tendon gap size and time between presentation and injury. Responders had to report whether they had a general preference for non-surgical or surgical treatment or whether they treated one way or the other exclusively. Subsequently, they were presented with an online pathway asking about the non-surgical and/or surgical treatment methods used.
Methods of rehabilitation, referral to physiotherapists, time advised for commencement of return to sport (RTS) and a selection of multiple outcomes (patient follow-up, questionnaires, physical tests, imaging) deemed relevant when monitoring recovery. For this study, the start of the rehabilitation phase was defined as the period after initial immobilisation in non-surgical patients and 6 weeks after surgery in surgical patients. Rehabilitation methods and advised time to RTS were asked about after both non-surgical and surgical treatment.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^1137rUGV]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for concussion, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, sport-related concussion, return to sport, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining neurocognitive testing after a sport-related concussion to assess for recovery, but not as a sole determining factor to determine when return to play is appropriate. Obtain testing by providers trained in the proper conduction and interpretation of the tests.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on the care of the athlete and athletic person with diabetes [^1157YDUD]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pre-exercise screening in diabetes — recent literature has shown that the risk of cardiac events, hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia is low and that the benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for most individuals with diabetes, and screening of individuals without symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) undergoing low-to moderate-intensity exercise has not been shown to reduce the risk of cardiac events. The American Diabetic Association guidelines state that pre-exercise medical clearance is not necessary for asymptomatic individuals who are receiving diabetes care consistent with the current guidelines who wish to begin a low or moderate-intensity physical activity that does not exceed the demands of brisk walking or everyday living. The American College of Sports Medicine guidelines state that physically inactive individuals with known metabolic disorders or those with signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic diseases should seek medical clearance before starting any exercise program, regardless of the intensity. When screening is performed, evaluation often includes electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing at the discretion of the clinician, and although the risk stratification in this group is more complex, the workup should be the same as in any individual with symptoms of CVD. Indications for pre-exercise screening include patients with symptoms of CVD, regardless of exercise-intensity level.

Step 2: Generating Summary Research Questions and Evidence Verification

Questions from survey 1 were categorized into themes by the steering group through an iterative process. Out-of-scope questions were removed. Patient-clinician dyads formulated summary questions. The steering group reviewed summary questions, and the final wording of the questions was settled by consensus.

Evidence checking was completed by a team convened by one of us (L.M.L.) who provided perspectives from specialized fields, including knowledge translation, research, public policy, and clinical practice. These information specialists examined recent research, databases, and current guidelines. For pragmatic reasons, focused searches to identify systematic reviews, primary research, clinical guidelines, and consensus statements were conducted. We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from 2010 onward for English language publications. Questions were classified as unanswered if the search found no systematic review, if recent systematic reviews found the question unanswered or yielded contradictory results, if there was a lack of primary research, or if there was insufficient evidence in the 5th International Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sportor national concussion evidence-based practice guidelines. Unanswered questions were included for the interim priority-setting survey. Questions considered answered by previous research were compiled separately.

Step 3: Interim Priority Setting (Survey 2)

A second anonymous online survey (available in English and French) shared the long list of unanswered summary questions (finalized in step 2) and requested that participants choose the 10 most important questions from their perspective. The order in which the list of questions was presented was randomized weekly to minimize bias. The survey was pilot tested on 5 people for comprehension, clarity, and time for completion. Demographic data were also collected in survey 2, which was open from January 10 to April 10, 2022; promotion, distribution, and data storage paralleled that of survey 1. A scoring system was used to analyze the data. One point was assigned for each question in a respondent's top 10 list. Points were tallied separately for 2 distinct groups: (1) those with lived experience (eg, patients, caregivers) and (2) clinicians who treat concussion. To ensure equal influence for each group, questions were ranked from highest to lowest for each group and the 2 scores were summed to give a total score which determined the combined rank order for each question. The steering group reviewed the final rankings and reached consensus on the short list of questions for the priority-setting workshop.

### Medical training to achieve competency in lifestyle counseling: an essential foundation for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic medical conditions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1179n29Q]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Physical activity burden and clinical counseling — epidemiology and care processes are highlighted, including that "Only 21% of US adults currently meet the 2008 federal physical activity guidelines for both aerobic and strength training", while "objective measurements of physical activity levels by accelerometry demonstrated that only 8% of US adolescents meet recommended levels of physical activity". The statement notes that "physical inactivity is the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide" and that "approximately one-third of the world's population is not meeting minimal recommendations for physical activity". For clinical practice, "Assessment of physical activity includes a basic history, questionnaires, or logs but could be complemented by diverse current and upcoming technological tools (eg, pedometers and personal tracking devices and systems) and sometimes the need for referral for more comprehensive testing (eg, stress tests), either for safety or optimal workload for fitness improvement". "Exercise prescription can be performed verbally or in writing with various levels of details depending on the situation and physician preference", and "physicians must be aware that they can refer their patients to allied healthcare professionals (eg, physical therapists, exercise physiologists, and kinesiologists) who can help them to be more active and have the expertise to develop and administer a supervised exercise plan and follow-up in the appropriate situation". Additionally, "As suggested by the National Physical Activity Plan and the American College of Sports Medicine, physicians should be personally aware of and engaged in an active lifestyle not only for their own health benefits but also to serve as role models for their patients".

### Recommendations on the use of multimodality cardiovascular imaging in young adult competitive athletes: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography in collaboration with the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography and the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^113JesHA]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Key points for PPCS — screening content and access: Routine PPCS of young CA should include a focused personal and medical history and physical examination, and the addition of a 12-lead ECG may be considered where adequate financial resources and clinical expertise exist. The use of noninvasive imaging including comprehensive and limited transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is not recommended as a first-line strategy during PPCS. PPCS programs should ensure timely access to clinical centers with sports cardiology and clinical imaging expertise to facilitate the comprehensive multimodality imaging required to evaluate findings detected during PPCS.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^11288K3M]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination — sleep history is typically obtained during routine health maintenance evaluation, during evaluation of symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, or as part of the comprehensive evaluation of patients at high risk for OSA; high-risk patients include those who are obese, those with congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, treatment refractory hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, nocturnal dysrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, high-risk driving populations (such as commercial truck drivers), and those being evaluated for bariatric surgery (Consensus). During routine health maintenance, questions should include a history of snoring and daytime sleepiness and an evaluation for obesity, retrognathia, or hypertension (Consensus). A comprehensive sleep history in a patient suspected of OSA should include snoring, witnessed apneas, gasping/choking episodes, excessive sleepiness not explained by other factors with assessment by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, total sleep amount, nocturia, morning headaches, sleep fragmentation/sleep maintenance insomnia, and decreased concentration and memory (Consensus).

### AMSSM position statement on cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes: current evidence, knowledge gaps, recommendations, and future directions [^11719tAD]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular preparticipation screening in athletes — current assessment indicates that history and physical examination has been the traditional standard in the U.S., and the addition of a screening electrocardiogram (ECG) has both potential benefits and potential risks. Regardless of strategy, the optimal age and frequency are uncertain, but screening is generally between the ages of 12 and 14 and repeated every 1 to 3 years. Ideally, preparticipation cardiovascular screening should take place with adequate time before the start of a sports season to perform secondary testing of screening abnormalities.

### American college of lifestyle medicine expert consensus statement: lifestyle medicine for optimal outcomes in primary care [^114TgPnt]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Lifestyle medicine (LM) vital signs and assessments — The crux of successful LM treatment is sustained patient health behavior change, and LM vital signs should be performed when clinically relevant (i.e., at baseline and monitored periodically as needed to track progress over time). The only broadly recognized LM-specific vital sign is the Physical Activity Vital Sign, a validated, three question tool that can quickly assess a patient's weekly minutes of physical activity and number of resistance training sessions, and capturing these data emphasizes importance, allows comparison to guidelines, creates opportunities for discussion, and can serve as the basis to co-create a SMART goal. Validated short and long questionnaires or screening tools exist for all pillars of LM and are preferred; however, current validated tools are not necessarily LM-specific and may not provide the sensitivity or responsiveness needed, so other clinical tools such as the Lifestyle Medicine Assessment could be acceptable adjuncts. Regardless of the instrument, consistent measurement and tracking over time is critical to ensure optimal LM dosing, and further research to validate LM-specific assessments and screening tools would be a beneficial adjunct for LM clinicians.

### BET 2: should children with sport-related concussion observe strict physical rest until symptom-free? [^111GkPS1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether strict physical rest following sports related concussion in children is better than normal activity in reducing post-concussional symptoms. two recent systematic reviews presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. It is concluded that children who present with a sport-related concussion should have a brief period of cognitive and physical rest followed by a gradual increase in activity. Further studies should examine the length of the brief rest period, however at this time 24–48hours of rest should be recommended.

### Evaluation of elbow pain in adults [^115Pp1rg]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

The elbow is a complex joint designed to withstand a wide range of dynamic exertional forces. The location and quality of elbow pain can generally localize the injury to one of the four anatomic regions: anterior, medial, lateral, or posterior. The history should include questions about the onset of pain, what the patient was doing when the pain started, and the type and frequency of athletic and occupational activities. Lateral and medial epicondylitis are two of the more common diagnoses and often occur as a result of occupational activities. Patients have pain and tenderness over the affected tendinous insertion that are accentuated with specific movements. If lateral and medial epicondylitis treatments are unsuccessful, ulnar neuropathy and radial tunnel syndrome should be considered. Ulnar collateral ligament injuries occur in athletes participating in sports that involve overhead throwing. Biceps tendinopathy is a relatively common source of pain in the anterior elbow; history often includes repeated elbow flexion with forearm supination and pronation. Olecranon bursitis is a common cause of posterior elbow pain and swelling. It can be septic or aseptic, and is diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and bursal fluid analysis if necessary. Plain radiography is the initial choice for the evaluation of acute injuries and is best for showing bony injuries, soft tissue swelling, and joint effusions. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for chronic elbow pain. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for an inexpensive dynamic evaluation of commonly injured structures.

### Patellofemoral pain [^112aS254]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) medical screening and referral — Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history and physical examination to determine whether the patient's symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral to another health care provider, and prior to diagnosing a person with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical conditions. Clinicians should recognize the key signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for the presence of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, and medical conditions for which physical therapy is not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a patient's symptoms.

### American College of Sports Medicine expert consensus statement to update recommendations for screening, staffing, and emergency policies to prevent cardiovascular events at health fitness facilities [^113YHtZp]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2020). High credibility.

Therapeutic implications of physical activity (PA) and fitness indicate that low-fit individuals are approximately two to three times more likely to die during follow-up than their more fit counterparts. The absolute risk associated with each bout of exercise is relatively low and regular exercise, including high-volume endurance activity (> 1 h·d−1), reduces the long-term risk of acute cardiovascular events by up to 50%. Accordingly, a habitually sedentary lifestyle appears to be far riskier than a physically active one, and it is probably more important that individuals exercise regularly at a convenient time of day, regardless of the hour.

### Preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE)-AAP… [^111EbA2Q]. AAP (2023). Medium credibility.

Millions of children participate in sports. To ensure safe participation during practice and competition, the AAP encourages youth to receive a preparticipation physical evaluation as part of their routine health supervision visit. The information on these pages can help pediatricians understand the impact sports physicals have on children's lives. Preparticipation Physical Evaluation Overview. Preparticipation Physical Evaluation Overview The PPE, also known as the sports physical, ideally will be conducted in the medical home during the health supervision appointment by the athlete's primary care provider. If this is not possible, the PPE should be conducted at least 6 weeks before the first preseason practice to allow time to evaluate the athlete and treat any medical conditions found during the visit. The frequency of a PPE is determined by the state. Learn more about your state PPE law.

AAP Recommendations The Preparticipation Physical Evaluation Monograph, 5th Edition serves as a resource for medical providers to keep athletes safe and healthy while participating in sports. It provides helpful guidance on the proper timing, setting and structure of the evaluation to improve the health and well being of athletes. Find it on shopAAP. The PPE was developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Sports Medicine, American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine and the American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine. It is also endorsed by the National Athletic Trainers' Association and the National Federation of State High School Associations.

PPE Examination Depending on state law, the PPE examination is conducted by an MD, DO, nurse practitioner or physician assistant with clinical training to evaluate and determine medical eligibility of the athlete on a broad range of health issues. The primary care provider should review the medical history in a private setting with the athlete and their guardian and again in private with the athlete should there be any confidential information the athlete would like to discuss. Physical Evaluation Form The PPE physical evaluation form guides primary care providers in conducting a system-based examination to include cardiovascular, nervous system, general medical conditions, respiratory system, gastrointestinal and urogenital, dermatological, musculoskeletal and mental health. Medical Eligibility When determining medical eligibility, the primary care provider should have expereince in evaluating athletes and determining if they are medically able to compete.

Examinations in locker rooms or gymnasiums are discouraged as it does not provide the athlete with a confidential space for the PPE. After the examination, the primary care provider can find the athlete:.
