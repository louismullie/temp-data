## Question

nocturnal flushing and pots

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nocturnal flushing is associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and how to interpret and manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic criteria for POTS and whether flushing is part of the canonical syndrome. Then, I should verify the evidence linking POTS to mast cell activation, which is a key mechanism for flushing. Next, I will examine how often flushing occurs in POTS cohorts and whether it clusters with hyperadrenergic features. After that, I need to check for confounders and mimics that could explain nocturnal flushing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic and management approach, including when to test for mast cell activation and how to treat if present.

> Let me first confirm the core POTS phenotype so I don't over-attribute symptoms. POTS is defined by chronic orthostatic intolerance with a heart rate increase of at least 30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing (≥ 40 bpm in adolescents) without orthostatic hypotension, and the classic symptoms are lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue; flushing is not listed among the defining features in consensus statements, so I should be cautious about implying it is a primary diagnostic sign [^3dd8e589] [^7a4637e3].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic bridge to flushing. Multiple studies and reviews describe a clinically meaningful association between POTS and mast cell activation, wherein mast cell mediators can provoke flushing, urticaria, angioedema, and gastrointestinal symptoms; importantly, these non-orthostatic features can coexist with orthostatic tachycardia and may signal a hyperadrenergic POTS subtype rather than "typical" POTS, which explains why flushing appears in some patients but not in the core diagnostic criteria [^86b1af3b] [^d66384eb] [^00fbd27a].

> I will now examine how often flushing actually occurs in POTS cohorts. In a prospective study of patients with suspected POTS, flushing and skin rash were more frequent among those with abnormal mast cell–related laboratory findings than in those with normal labs, suggesting that when flushing is present, it flags a higher likelihood of coexisting mast cell activation; however, I should double-check that this does not mean all POTS patients flush, and indeed, flushing is not universal in POTS populations [^d66384eb] [^39f9c8cc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. Nocturnal flushing is plausible in mast cell–driven presentations because triggers can include heat, pressure, meals, and hormonal fluctuations, and symptoms may persist into the night; case-based literature in POTS with mast cell features documents episodic flushing and urticaria, including nocturnal manifestations, though high-quality prevalence data for nocturnal-specific flushing are limited, so I should frame this as biologically plausible and clinically observed rather than definitively quantified [^00fbd27a] [^1d158afb].

> Next, I should review confounders and mimics so I don't anchor on POTS. Medications (e.g., niacin, calcium channel blockers, SSRIs), menopause, carcinoid syndrome, and anxiety can all cause flushing; in POTS patients, I also need to consider hyperadrenergic surges, which can present with flushing and diaphoresis, and medication-induced autonomic effects that might blur the picture, so a careful medication reconciliation and phenotypic review are essential before attributing flushing to mast cell–POTS overlap [^d6d003c9].

> Let me think about diagnostic implications. If a patient with confirmed POTS reports recurrent flushing — especially if accompanied by pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal cramping, or headache — I should consider mast cell activation and, when feasible, pursue targeted testing such as 24-hour urine methylhistamine collected after a flush, plasma tryptase, and prostaglandin D2/F2α, recognizing that single normal results do not exclude MCA and that sampling during or immediately after episodes improves yield; I should confirm that these tests are not routine in POTS workups and should be reserved for suspected overlap [^d66384eb] [^37df4157] [^06afb85c].

> I should confirm management principles. For POTS with suspected mast cell activation, standard POTS therapies (generous salt and water intake, compression, graded exercise) remain foundational, but adding H1/H2 antihistamines and a mast cell stabilizer (e.g., cromolyn) can reduce mediator-driven symptoms like flushing; in refractory cases, case reports describe benefit from low-dose naltrexone and, in select immune-mediated presentations, IVIG, though these are off-label and evidence is limited, so shared decision-making and specialist input are prudent [^29c84e57] [^39f9c8cc] [^1d158afb].

> But wait, what if the flushing is purely nocturnal and there are no daytime orthostatic symptoms? I need to ensure I do not misclassify non-POTS flushing as POTS-related; in that scenario, I should pivot to a broader differential for nocturnal flushing and only revisit POTS if orthostatic features emerge or were previously documented, keeping in mind that POTS itself is a clinical syndrome diagnosed by orthostatic vitals and compatible symptoms rather than by flushing alone [^3dd8e589] [^95ddcfdd].

> In summary, I should emphasize that nocturnal flushing is not a core POTS symptom but can coexist in a subset of POTS patients with mast cell activation or hyperadrenergic features; the prudent approach is to screen for MCA when flushing accompanies POTS, interpret labs in clinical context with sampling during flares, and layer mast cell–directed therapy onto standard POTS care when indicated, while excluding alternative causes of flushing before concluding there is a POTS–mast cell overlap [^d66384eb] [^39f9c8cc] [^29c84e57].

---

Nocturnal flushing is **not a core symptom** of POTS [^3dd8e589] but may occur in a subset with hyperadrenergic or mast cell–related features [^d6d003c9] [^86b1af3b]. It is best viewed as a **non-orthostatic, coexisting symptom** rather than a primary POTS manifestation [^d66384eb]. If nocturnal flushing is prominent, evaluate for mast cell activation or other causes, and tailor therapy accordingly [^39f9c8cc].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking nocturnal flushing to POTS

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** may explain nocturnal flushing in POTS:

- **Hyperadrenergic state**: Increased sympathetic activity can cause vasodilation and flushing, especially at night when parasympathetic tone rises and autonomic balance shifts [^d6d003c9].

- **Mast cell activation**: Mast cell mediators (histamine, prostaglandins) can cause flushing, often with other atopic or gastrointestinal symptoms [^86b1af3b] [^39f9c8cc].

- **Autonomic dysregulation**: Impaired autonomic control of cutaneous vessels may cause nocturnal flushing, particularly with temperature changes or during sleep [^9a73e6d8].

---

## Clinical evidence of nocturnal flushing in POTS patients

Although nocturnal flushing is not a diagnostic criterion, **clinical reports and studies** document its occurrence:

- **Case reports**: Patients with POTS and mast cell activation report episodic flushing, including nocturnal episodes, often with other atopic symptoms [^00fbd27a] [^1d158afb].

- **Clinical series**: Flushing is recognized among dermatologic manifestations in POTS, though less common than livedo reticularis or Raynaud's [^9a73e6d8].

- **Patient surveys**: Large surveys indicate flushing as a reported symptom, though less frequent than core orthostatic features [^d66384eb].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

The exact prevalence of nocturnal flushing in POTS is unknown, but it appears in a **minority of patients** and is generally less common than daytime flushing. Clinically, nocturnal flushing may signal a hyperadrenergic or mast cell–mediated subtype and can worsen sleep and quality of life, so it warrants evaluation for coexisting mast cell activation or other causes [^d66384eb] [^39f9c8cc].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When nocturnal flushing occurs in POTS, a **targeted evaluation** is recommended:

- **Detailed history**: Characterize flushing (triggers, duration, associated symptoms) and screen for mast cell activation features (urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms) [^d66384eb].

- **Laboratory testing**: Consider mast cell mediators (plasma tryptase, urinary methylhistamine, prostaglandin D2/F2α), recognizing limitations and the need to sample during flares [^37df4157].

- **Autonomic testing**: Tilt-table testing or active stand testing to confirm POTS and assess for hyperadrenergic features [^95ddcfdd] [^d6d003c9].

---

## Management strategies

Management of nocturnal flushing in POTS is **individualized**:

- **Non-pharmacologic measures**: Optimize hydration, salt intake, and sleep hygiene; avoid triggers (heat, alcohol, spicy foods) [^29c84e57] [^8a9c2cae].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) may reduce sympathetic overactivity; mast cell stabilizers (cromolyn) and antihistamines (H1/H2) can help if mast cell activation is present [^9e7ee4ad] [^39f9c8cc].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate cardiology, neurology, allergy/immunology, and psychology for comprehensive management [^d0ba36bb].

---

## Conclusion

Nocturnal flushing is **not a primary symptom** of POTS but may occur in a subset with hyperadrenergic or mast cell–related features. It should be evaluated as a coexisting symptom that may guide subtype classification and therapy.

Although diagnostic criteria have been developed characterizing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), no single set of criteria is universally accepted. Furthermore, there are gaps in the present criteria used to identify individuals who have this condition. The reproducibility of the physiological findings, the relationship of symptoms to physiological findings, the presence of symptoms alone without any physiological findings and the response to various interventions confuse rather than clarify this condition. As many disease entities can be confused with POTS, it becomes critical to identify what this syndrome is. What appears to be POTS may be an underlying condition that requires specific therapy. POTS is not simply orthostatic intolerance and symptoms or intermittent orthostatic tachycardia but the syndrome needs to be characterized over time and with reproducibility. Here we address critical issues regarding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of POTS in an attempt to arrive at a rational approach to categorize the syndrome with the hope that it may help both better identify individuals and better understand approaches to therapy.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome of excessive tachycardia with orthostatic challenge, and relief of such symptoms with recumbence. There are several proposed subtypes of the syndrome, each with unique pathophysiology. Numerous symptoms such as excessive tachycardia, lightheadedness, blurry vision, weakness, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, and tremulousness are associated with orthostatic intolerance. Other co-morbid conditions associated with POTS are not clearly attributable to orthostatic intolerance. These include chronic headache, fibromyalgia, functional gastrointestinal or bladder disorders, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. Dermatological manifestations of POTS are also common and wide ranging, from livedo reticularis to Raynaud's phenomenon, from cutaneous flushing to erythromelalgia. Here, we provide three illustrative cases of POTS with dermatological manifestations. We discuss the potential pathophysiology underlying such dermatological manifestations, and how such mechanisms could in turn help guide development of management.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) definition — POTS is "a clinical syndrome usually characterized by (1) frequent symptoms that occur with standing", with physiologic criteria including "an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 beats per minute (bpm) when moving from a recumbent to a standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12 to 19 years of age)" and "the absence of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure)". The standing heart rate in POTS "is often ≥ 120 bpm, and undergoes greater increases in the morning than in the evening", and orthostatic heart rate increases "gradually decrease with age and not abruptly at age 20". The document also notes that "the diagnoses of POTS and vasovagal syncope are not mutually exclusive".

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^0ec41809]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by autonomic dysfunction and an exaggerated sympathetic response to assuming an upright position. Up till recently, it was largely under-recognised as a clinical entity. There is now consensus about the definition of POTS as a greater than 30/min heart rate increase on standing from a supine position (greater than 40/min increase in 12-19-year-old patients) or an absolute heart rate of greater than 120/min within 10 min of standing from a supine position and in the absence of hypotension, arrhythmias, sympathomimetic drugs or other conditions that cause tachycardia. We present two cases of POTS, followed by a discussion of its pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology and management.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^86b1af3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was initially characterized in a small group of highly selected individuals in whom palpitations and lightheadedness, triggered by upright posture, were deemed to be caused by a limited form of autonomic dysfunction. Subsequently, however, the POTS diagnosis has increasingly been suspected and/or applied much more broadly, encompassing patients with often poorly understood symptoms involving multiple organ systems and that are not typically considered to be caused by POTS.

The cause of POTS in individual patients is usually unknown, despite a number of conditions having been implicated; these include viral illnesses, trauma, and various inflammatory diseases. Mast cell activation (MCA) disorder has also been implicated since chemical mediators released from mast cells may cause symptoms suggestive of POTS (eg, postural tachycardia, lightheadedness). On the other hand, MCA mediators may also result in systemic nonorthostatic symptoms that are not typical of POTS such as flushing, urticaria, angioedema, nasal congestion, airway reactivity, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea.

Recently, 2 sets of consensus criteria have been proposed for diagnosis of MCA disorder. While these criteria have some differences, both define the disorder as a chronic condition affecting 2 or more systems driven by the aberrant release of mast cell biochemical mediators. Valent and colleaguesrequire that the acute symptoms be associated with documented elevations of mast cell mediators on at least 2 occasions. Afrin and colleaguesinclude elevations in mast cell mediators (either during an acute episode or at baseline) as 1 criterion, but indicate that it is possible to fulfill diagnostic criteria without elevations in mast cell mediators.

The possibility that MCA disorder may be associated with POTS either as a trigger or as a coexisting condition is now widely accepted, but how often is unknown. This study examined the frequency with which symptoms and laboratory findings suggesting MCA disorder occurred in patients referred for POTS evaluation and who were ultimately diagnosed with POTS based upon currently published criteria.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: clinical presentation, aetiology and management [^42d5f9c6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a variant of cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by an excessive heart rate increase on standing and orthostatic intolerance. POTS affects younger individuals 15–45 years old with a distinct female predominance (≈80%). The prevalence ranges between 0.2% and 1.0% in developed countries. The onset of POTS is typically precipitated by immunological stressors such as viral infection, vaccination, trauma, pregnancy, surgery or psychosocial stress. The most common complaints are dizziness, weakness, rapid heartbeat and palpitation on standing. Moreover, patients often report physical deconditioning and reduced exercise capacity as well as headache, 'brain fog', dyspnoea, gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal pain. The aetiology of POTS is largely unknown and three main hypotheses include an autoimmune disorder, abnormally increased sympathetic activity and catecholamine excess, and sympathetic denervation leading to central hypovolaemia and reflex tachycardia. The golden standard for POTS diagnosis is head-up tilt test with a non-invasive beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring. Although long-term prognosis of POTS is poorly explored, around 50% of patients spontaneously recover within 1–3 years. After the diagnosis has been established, patient should be thoroughly educated about non-pharmacological measures alleviating the symptoms. Exercise training may be very effective and counteract deconditioning. In more symptomatic patients, different drugs directed at controlling heart rate, increasing peripheral vasoconstriction and intravascular volume can be tested. However, the overall effects of pharmacological therapy are modest and the most affected patients remain handicapped. Future efforts should focus on better understanding of POTS pathophysiology and designing randomized controlled trials for selection of more effective therapy.

### The face of postural tachycardia syndrome-insights from a large cross-sectional online community-based survey [^aa50a193]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical condition in which patients experience chronic symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Consensus documents define POTS by a significant heart rate increase (≥ 30 beats per minute within 10 min of upright posture or ≥ 40 beats per minute if under 18 years), with no orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure > 20/10 mmHg within 3 min of upright posture) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. POTS can be associated with significant morbidity, poor sleep quality and diminished quality of life 6, 7, 8. There is no single treatment that can 'cure' a patient of symptoms 9. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment is often needed 9.

Postural tachycardia syndrome is estimated to affect between 500 000 and 3 000 000 people in the United States alone 10, 11. It also has a strong female predominance (5:1) 12, 13. Despite this, there are few published data detailing the demographics, features and clinical course of this condition. Most studies are limited by small sample sizes, referral bias and comprise populations from single, highly specialized tertiary care centres.

Here, we present data from an international survey of patients with POTS. These data provide unique information from the perspective of patients suffering from POTS. We aimed to highlight patients' long‐term experiences in managing POTS, including background demographics, comorbidities, symptom burden and their diagnostic journey with this illness. This online, community‐based survey consists of the largest sample of POTS patients reported to date.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^3be28ab5]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is characterised by the development of excessive tachycardia on standing with maintained blood pressure. We report a case of POTS in a 20-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes who presented with a 3-week history of lethargy, fatigue and orthostatic intolerance. Examination revealed a postural rise in heart rate of over 50 bpm with maintained blood pressure. This was associated with symptoms of light-headedness. Cardiac structure and function as assessed by ECG and ECHO were normal as was thyroid and adrenal function. POTS was confirmed with tilt table testing. Treatment was initiated with increased fluid intake, fludrocortisone and bisoprolol with improvement. POTS is a disabling condition which can significantly limit a patient's activities and working capacity and should be considered in a young, otherwise well patient who presents with orthostatic intolerance and a postural rise in heart rate.

### Treatment of primary… [^e15f5c7d]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Anticholinergics decrease detrusor tone, frequency, and urgency and improve bladder capacity. Anticholinergic therapy may be used in children with primary nocturnal enuresis and daytime wetting and in patients who do not respond to desmopressin. 2, 8, 30 Desmopressin is recommended if the family is unwilling or unable to adhere to nonpharmacologic measures. The drug is most effective in children eight years and older who have monosymptomatic enuresis with nocturnal polyuria, normal bladder capacity, and less frequent bed-wetting.
31. 2 Initial treatment is usually one tablet or one spray every night; the dosage is increased weekly to
0. 6 mg or 40 mcg daily. Desmopressin therapy is combined with fluid restriction and voiding before bedtime. Equivalent oral and intranasal doses have similar potency.

Treatment of Secondary and Nonmonosymptomatic Enuresis If no cause for nocturnal enuresis is evident, primary nocturnal enuresis treatment options are appropriate. Most children with encopresis-associated enuresis and daytime wetting respond to disimpaction, prevention of reaccumulation of stools, and bowel retraining. 38 A history of snoring, mouth breathing, behavioral problems, and daytime somnolence in patients with enlarged tonsils or adenoids on examination may suggest obstructive sleep apnea. Surgical correction of airway obstruction in these patients improves or cures nocturnal enuresis and daytime wetting. 39 Individual psychotherapy, crisis intervention, and family therapy are effective measures for psychogenically induced enuresis.

2 Children with dysfunctional voiding have abnormal urine flow patterns on cystometry, a large amount of post-void residual urine, and a normal upper urinary tract on imaging and benefit from a voiding regimen. Biofeedback is effective for motivated children with primary nocturnal enuresis and dysfunctional voiding. 25 Biofeedback improves nocturnal enuresis, daytime wetting, constipation, frequency, urgency, voiding patterns, and bladder hyperactivity for up to two years after completion of therapy. 25.

### Hyperadrenergic postural tachycardia syndrome in mast cell activation disorders [^00fbd27a]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disabling condition that commonly affects otherwise normal young females. Because these patients can present with a flushing disorder, we hypothesized that mast cell activation (MCA) can contribute to its pathogenesis. Here we describe POTS patients with MCA (MCA+POTS), diagnosed by episodes of flushing and abnormal increases in urine methylhistamine, and compared them to POTS patients with episodic flushing but normal urine methylhistamine and to normal healthy age-matched female controls. MCA+POTS patients were characterized by episodes of flushing, shortness of breath, headache, lightheadedness, excessive diuresis, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Triggering events include long-term standing, exercise, premenstrual cycle, meals, and sexual intercourse. In addition, patients were disabled by orthostatic intolerance and a characteristic hyperadrenergic response to posture, with orthostatic tachycardia (from 79 ± 4 to 114 ± 6 bpm), increased systolic blood pressure on standing (from 117 ± 5 to 126 ± 7 mm Hg versus no change in POTS controls), increased systolic blood pressure at the end of phase II of the Valsalva maneuver (157 ± 12 versus 117 ± 9 in normal controls and 119 ± 7 mm Hg in POTS; P = 0.048), and an exaggerated phase IV blood pressure overshoot (50 ± 10 versus 17 ± 3 mm Hg in normal controls; P < 0.05). In conclusion, MCA should be considered in patients with POTS presenting with flushing. These patients often present with a typical hyperadrenergic response, but beta-blockers should be used with great caution, if at all, and treatment directed against mast cell mediators may be required.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^d66384eb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding methylhistamine, Shibao et al.noted that urinary methylhistamine is usually normal between flares in patients with MCA. Patients should be instructed to collect urine for a 4‐hour period immediately after a severe spontaneous flushing episode. Urine histamine is often measured in the evaluation of flushing but has been considered to be less specific than methylhistamine and less useful in the diagnosis of MCA.

Clinical Differences: Typical POTS Presentation Versus That Associated With Suspected MCA

In its original description, POTS was primarily characterized by symptoms that were provoked on standing, and that were relieved by recumbence. Subsequently, nonpostural symptoms have become accepted as part of the clinical picture. The principal resulting orthostatic symptoms are palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness (including "brain fog"), and near‐syncope. Common nonorthostatic symptoms include nausea, diminished concentration, and tremulousness. However, patients exhibiting MCA disorder may manifest similar complaints.

In our study, palpitations were observed in almost all patients, and the combination of lightheadedness/dizziness/brain fog was the next most common symptom. Furthermore, the frequency of these symptoms did not differ between patients with suspected MCA and patients with POTS. Consequently, one cannot distinguish between these 2 patient groups by conventional symptoms alone. On the other hand, certain symptoms (particularly allergy, gastrointestinal issues, and skin rash/flushing) tended to be more frequent in patients with MCA; these may be helpful diagnostically but must be actively sought for during the history‐taking.,

Initially, greater migraine frequency appeared to distinguish the MCA group from the typical patients with POTS (Table 1). Furthermore, this difference persisted when patients with MCA were compared only with the smaller group of typical patients with POTS in whom laboratory testing results were normal (Table 3); however, the difference was no longer statistically significant. Thus, although release of multiple neurohormones from mast cells (eg, adenylate cycles activating pituitary polypeptide, histamine, and others) provides biologic plausibility for more frequent migraine in MCA, the role of migraine as a clinically differentiating feature cannot be relied upon; further study is needed.

### Blood pressure regulation in post-COVID POTS: beyond sinus tachycardia [^7f8b9bd2]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

The cardiovascular system may be substantially affected in the course of post– COVID-19 condition, and the most prevalent circulatory disorder is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), less known in the prepandemic era but now identified as a major health care burden. Worldwide, about 20 million people may have developed POTS as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the numbers may be underestimated due to diagnostic delay and a broad spectrum of other post–COVID-19 symptoms diverting attention from the correct diagnosis.

POTS is a type of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction characterized by abnormal heart rate increase on standing, symptoms of orthostatic intolerance without hypotension, along with reduced exercise capacity, fatigue, and other nonspecific symptoms such as headache, chest pain, or sleep difficulties, with a duration ≮3 months. Other possible pathogenesis should be excluded for the syndrome to be described as idiopathic, a view shared by the majority of experts.

The steep rise in POTS diagnoses in the wake of the post–COVID-19 condition surge has created a unique opportunity to study the syndrome in detail, offering the hope of understanding that may lead to more effective therapy. In clinical practice, POTS has been seen as an essentially sinus tachycardia-related condition, meaning that taming the orthostatic tachycardia has been the main therapeutic target. However, POTS has also been suggested to be an inadequate blood volume condition with substantial disruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system affecting blood pressure (BP) control mechanisms. – Interestingly, prominent research dating back to the late 90s demonstrated that orthostatic intolerance may be a disorder beyond sinus tachycardia and that the vascular autonomic control may be discordant from the cardiac autonomic control in adults with orthostatic intolerance. – To treat the postulated hypovolemia and impaired vasoconstriction in POTS, some off-label therapeutics that address both vasculature (midodrine)and blood volume control (fludrocortisone)are applied, with weak rationale and without any detailed consideration given to baseline hemodynamics and the effects of therapy.

Clinical Perspective

It is theorized that postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was likely first described in the medical literature in 1871 by Da Costa. In his monograph, he described Civil War soldiers who, in the setting of dysentery‐like illness, presented with multiple orthostatic and gastrointestinal symptoms that caused severe disability. The term "POTS" was subsequently coined in 1982 by Rosen and Cryer in a patient with upright lightheadedness, weakness, palpitations, abdominal and leg pain, and diaphoresis. She had reduced plasma volume and poor sodium balance that responded to increased sodium intake plus mineralocorticoid therapy. Since that time, as initial diagnostic features appeared in 1993and the first consensus document describing diagnostic criteria came out in 2011, recognition of the broadening nature of its cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal symptoms spread. Although significant progress has been made in the past 40 years toward understanding and managing this autonomic disorder, much remains unknown about POTS. Recent discussions on the pathophysiology, appropriate therapies, and the possible role of autoimmune disease, in POTS have garnered attention as the field slowly advances to gain increasingly advanced insights into these diverse aspects of this disorder. Patients with POTS often present with multiple disease‐related symptoms and multiple associated comorbidities, often in the absence of overt or specific clinical or laboratory findings, which can lead to complicated and prolonged diagnostic journeys. Diagnostic delays, misdiagnoses, and inappropriate attribution of POTS symptoms to psychiatric conditionshave all been seen in these patients. These medical misadventures, either alone or in combination, can cause frustration and mistrust of the medical system, engender online research that may or may not be beneficial, and potentially delay access to an appropriate therapeutic approach as well as prolonging school absence and social isolation.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — "Nonpharmacologic treatments should be attempted first with all patients" and include withdrawing medications that might worsen POTS, enhanced salt and fluid intake, compression garments, and limiting deconditioning; for suspected hypovolemia, patients "should drink at least 2–3 L of water per day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to approximately 10–12 g/day". Exercise is advised with a "regular, structured, graduated, and supervised exercise program", and initially "exercise should be restricted to non-upright exercises". For rescue volume expansion, "1 L of normal saline infused over 1 hour decreases orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms for several hours to 2 days"; although not trial-tested, "this approach is recommended as rescue therapy", whereas "Long-term infusions of intravenous saline are not recommended for routine care". To reduce tachycardia and palpitations, "low-dose propranolol (10–20 mg PO) acutely lowers standing heart rate", while higher doses are less tolerated; ivabradine may help, with "Approximately 60% of patients with POTS treated with ivabradine in an open-label study" showing symptom improvement. For cholinergic augmentation, "Pyridostigmine is a peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor", and "The drug blunts orthostatic tachycardia and can improve chronic symptoms but is limited by adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea, and increased urinary urgency and frequency". For venous return and vasoconstriction, midodrine "significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but to a lesser degree than intravenous saline" and "should be administered 3 times daily", with dosing "only… during daytime hours" due to supine hypertension risk.

Discussion

Main Findings

This study provides 4 main findings regarding differences between patients in whom the clinical presentation included symptoms that are not typically considered to be caused by POTS compared with patients with a typical POTS presentation. First, the frequency with which MCA laboratory abnormalities were detected in the former population was relatively high. While solitary laboratory abnormalities cannot provide a definitive MCA diagnosis, the possibility of a coexisting MCA disorder merits consideration given its potential impact on treatment strategy. Second, patients with abnormal laboratory findings manifested a more diverse symptom landscape, particularly including allergy complaints and gastrointestinal issues (most often gastroparesis), and to a lesser extent skin rash/flushing, than did those individuals who had normal laboratory findings (Table 3). Third, while elevated plasma tryptase level is a valuable biochemical marker for mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia, and may be useful in confirming MCA as suggested in Consensus‐1, abnormal tryptase levels were uncommon (9%) among the laboratory findings in our study. Finally, elevated prostaglandins in conjunction with an abnormally elevated histamine marker (ie, plasma histamine or urine methyl‐histamine) was the most frequent diagnostic combination supporting a possible MCA diagnosis in our patients.

Laboratory Recognition of MCA and Its Limitations

Many conditions, including MCA, have been implicated in producing symptoms suggestive of POTS. MCA is particularly important in this regard because its presence markedly alters therapeutic strategy. Specifically, patients with MCA may benefit from histamine receptor (H1 and H2) blockers used in conjunction with mast cell stabilizer agents and possibly vitamin D. These agents are not usually part of a typical POTS treatment regimen.

Mast cells are estimated to contain several hundred chemical mediators that are either stored in situ or manufactured de novo as requirement demands. While many such chemicals may be released by other cells, particularly basophils, the mast cell appears to be the most important.

Chemical mediators released from mast cells may affect multiple systems resulting in diverse symptoms (eg, allergic reactions, cutaneous disturbances, and gastrointestinal complaints) that may wax and wane in severity over time. The result is a potentially very heterogeneous clinical picture, with only some affected individuals having symptoms suggesting POTS. It is in the latter cases that the presence of complaints beyond the typical expected with POTS (ie, palpitations, "lightheadedness", and "brain fog") should raise the possibility of an underlying or coexisting MCA disorder.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^cfab56bc]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) often present with co-occurring struggles with chronic pain (POTS+pain) that may limit daily activities. POTS is a clinical syndrome characterized by orthostatic symptoms and excessive postural tachycardia without orthostatic hypotension. Active research from the medical and scientific community has led to controversy over POTS diagnosis and treatment, yet patients continue to present with symptoms associated with POTS+pain, making treatment recommendations critical. This topical review examines the literature on diagnosing and treating pediatric POTS+pain and the challenges clinicians face. Most importantly, clinicians must employ an interdisciplinary team approach to determine the ideal combination of pharmacologic (e.g., fludrocortisone), non-pharmacologic (e.g., physical therapy, integrative medicine), and psychological (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation) treatment approaches that acknowledge the complexity of the child's condition, while simultaneously tailoring these approaches to the child's personal needs. We provide recommendations for treatment for youth with POTS+pain based on the current literature.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) affects children and adolescents-normally fit and well and yet troubled by a myriad of everyday symptoms. Understanding the pathophysiology of this not uncommon disorder together with a review of the clinical features may well assist the attending clinicians to arrive at a clear diagnosis without the need for extensive testing and multiple investigations. Simple lifestyle measures such as increasing fluid intake, electrolyte and/or salt supplements, adequate sleep, not missing out on meals and instituting an exercise programme to improve muscle tone and strength may avoid the need of pharmacological management. These simple measures may benefit symptoms which generally improve as adulthood approaches. In addition, it is important to recognise the comorbidities that may be associated with POTS, each of which may require specific management strategies. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, clinical features and recommended treatment in the management of POTS.

Conclusion

POTS remains a challenging clinical diagnosis with restricted treatment options. The papers discussed in this month's journal club build upon previous work exploring autoimmunity as a causal factor in a sub-population of patients with POTS disease. Further work is needed to clarify the significance of low platelet storage pool deficiency and altered cytokine levels in patients with POTS. Recent work on the prevalence of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies in POTS patients suggests little overlap between POTS and autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. However, a role may be emerging for immunomodulatory therapy in selected patients with refractory, immune-mediated POTS disease.

### Pediatric postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: where we stand [^693acd6a]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), first described in 1992, remains an enigmatic, yet severely and variably debilitating, disorder. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not understood, and there remains no biomarker indicating the presence of POTS. Although research interest has increased in recent years, there are relatively fewer clinical and research studies addressing POTS in children and adolescents compared with adults. Yet, adolescence is when a large number of cases of POTS begin, even among adult patients who are subsequently studied. This article summarizes reported research in POTS, specifically in pediatric patients, including discussion of aspects of diagnostic criteria, risk factors and outcomes, neurohormonal and hemodynamic abnormalities, clinical assessment, and treatment. The goals of this review are increased recognition and acknowledgment of POTS among pediatric and adolescent providers, as well as to provide an understanding of reported abnormalities of homeostasis, such that symptomatic patients will be able to be recognized and appropriately managed, enabling them to return to their activities of daily living.

Introduction

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by orthostatic symptoms and excessive postural tachycardia without orthostatic hypotension. It is estimated that 1 to 3 million Americans have a POTS diagnosis. Rates in youth are unknown as POTS has only become more recognized in the past 20 years, with the first report of POTS in the pediatric population appearing in 1999. Due to the nascent knowledge of POTS in youth, it may be inappropriate to apply adult clinical management criteria to youth with POTS.

At least one-third of patients develop POTS symptoms prior to age 18 with a median age of symptom onset at 13.1 years of age. Youth with POTS are typically female (5:1), Caucasian, and diagnosed between the ages of 12–40 with over 50% reporting additional somatic symptoms including chronic fatigue, nausea, and sleep difficulties.–Up to 50% of patients have antecedent symptoms of a viral illness with a prolonged course while others have different medical stressors or no identifiable antecedent.

While the individual symptom profile may vary, clinical and physiological symptoms required for diagnosis commonly include both orthostatic difficulties (e.g. dizziness, syncope, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, "brain fog" or difficulty with concentration) and sympathetic overactivation (e.g. shakiness, palpitations, tremor, anxiety, excessive perspiration, and pain). Youth with POTS frequently report the co-occurrence of pain (POTS+pain). It is estimated that 30–88% of youth with POTS report chronic daily headache, migraine, abdominal pain, and/or musculoskeletal pain.–

Evidence-based methods for treating POTS+pain include pharmacological and physiological interventions with only a few early studies incorporating psychosocial factors. Prospective randomized clinical trials in the pediatric population are limited to only two small studies exploring two pharmacological interventions: midodrine and beta-blockers. Ross and colleagues (2014)surmised midodrine hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for POTS in some youth aged 12–20 and Chen and colleagues (2011)reported it can be effective in the treatment of youth aged 6–17 with POTS. Additional studies have shown effectiveness of these pharmacological interventions and have noted additional benefits of exercise when paired with beta-blockers. Other work has demonstrated benefits of exercise, including progressive cardiovascular exercise training in reducing orthostatic intolerance and abnormal cardiac response in adults with POTS, and improvement in symptoms (including pain) and quality of life in youth.

### The evidence for treatments for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a systematic review of randomized trials [^3bea332e]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined as the presence of chronic symptoms of orthostatic intolerance accompanied by an increase in heart rate greater than 30 beats per minute within 10 minutes of assuming an upright posture in the absences of orthostatic hypotension. It is a condition which lacks a definitive treatment strategy, with weak evidence and clinical expertise to support the available guidelines from the Heart Rhythm Society in 2015 and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society in 2020. The limited systematic reviews evaluating the treatment for POTS only reported three or fewer trials when many more trials have been published. In this systematic review, we evaluate the evidence for different treatments for POTS from 21 randomized clinical trials with 750 patients that took place between 2000 and 2023. This review summarizes the available evidence from trials on propranolol, midodrine, pyridostigmine and ivabradine as well as less commonly used medications such as desmopressin, melatonin, atomoxetine, modafinil, sertraline and intravenous immunoglobulins. Moreover, the trial evidence for non-pharmacological treatments is described including increase intake of dietary sodium, exercise training, compression and devices. We conclude that many small trials have evaluated different treatments for POTS. Large randomized trials are needed to determine if mainstay treatments beta-blockers, midodrine, and pyridostigmine should be used as first line treatment(s).

Treatment of children with vasovagal syncope or POTS — there are no quantitative data on outcomes, and in general it is reasonable to reassure patients and their families, promote salt and fluid intake, and teach physical counterpressure techniques. Two randomized clinical trials reported that midodrine improved either hemodynamic changes to orthostasis or clinical symptoms in patients with POTS, and a small randomized trial reported that midodrine was effective in preventing recurrent syncope. Two randomized studies of children with syncope found placebo more effective than fludrocortisone and salt in preventing syncope and placebo more effective than metoprolol in preventing syncope.

### Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) a central nervous system disorder? [^79b1705f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by a rise in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from supine to standing position, has been traditionally viewed as a dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies and evidence from overlapping conditions suggest that in addition to being considered a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, POTS should be viewed also as a central nervous system (CNS) disorder given (1) significant CNS symptom burden in patients with POTS; (2) structural and functional differences found on neuroimaging in patients with POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance; (3) evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion and possible alteration in cerebrospinal fluid volume, and (4) positive response to medications targeting the CNS and non-pharmacologic CNS therapies. This review outlines existing evidence of POTS as a CNS disorder and proposes a hypothetical model combining key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POTS. Redefining POTS as a CNS disorder can lead to new possibilities in pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in patents affected by this disabling syndrome.

Orthostatic intolerance — definition and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) features are described as frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing and are relieved by sitting or lying, most commonly including lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. One condition of note is POTS, in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm; although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS. Treatments that improve symptoms of POTS might decrease the occurrence of syncope, although this is unknown.

Treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) includes several options with conditional strength: A regular, structured, and progressive exercise program for patients with POTS can be effective. It is reasonable to treat patients with POTS who have short-term clinical decompensations with an acute intravenous infusion of up to 2 L of saline. Patients with POTS might be best managed with a multidisciplinary approach. The consumption of up to 2–3 L of water and 10–12 g of NaCl daily by patients with POTS may be considered. It seems reasonable to treat patients with POTS with fludrocortisone or pyridostigmine. Treatment of patients with POTS with midodrine or low-dose propranolol may be considered. It seems reasonable to treat patients with POTS who have prominent hyperadrenergic features with clonidine or alpha-methyldopa.

Case presentation

Case

A 43-year-old Caucasian femaleF experienced MCAS symptoms at age 18: specific foods and odours caused flushing, rashes, itching, wheezing, dizziness and nausea. At age 20, she noted problems with postprandial bloating/pain, constipation, evacuating stool and flatus with rotten egg odour. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) gradually developed. At age 23, she developed orthostatic lightheadedness and tachycardia, body pain, generalised weakness and painful dependent leg oedema. Ultimately, she suffered from 45 individual clinically significant symptoms (table 1). For 6 years, she became disabled owing to orthostatic symptoms, fatigue and body pain. Faecal evacuation resulted in syncope with efforts > 3 min. Early satiety led to a liquid diet. Pressure-induced hives and angioedema, paraesthesia and nocturnal urination (seven times nightly) interfered with sleep. Over 16 years, 19 physicians failed to diagnose POTS and MCAS which were established at a second location of the Mayo Clinic. Supine pulse of 80 beats/min increased to 160 after standing 10 min. Facial rash and oedema, cold, blue hands, Terry's fingernails and dermatographism were present (figure 1).

### Describing clinical characteristics and treatment course of patients with hereditary alpha-tryptasemia: a single-center study [^38bede4e]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HαT) have been shown not only to be more prone to anaphylaxis but also to more severe reactions. The relationship between hypermobility, gastroparesis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and HαT has been variably described in the literature although no causal biochemical or genetic link has been identified. Herein, we sought to describe the clinical presentation, treatment, and co-morbidities of patients diagnosed with HαT within the Penn State Health System. Through a retrospective cross-sectional chart review, we report the clinical and therapeutic characteristics of patients who tested positive for HαT genotypes (2α3β, 3α2β) within Penn State Health. Twenty-six percent of patients within our cohort had co-occurring diagnoses of hypermobility (7, 26.9%), or POTS (7, 26.9%) while more than half of patients had GERD (15, 57.7%). Anaphylaxis was reported among 7 (26.9%) with the average number of anaphylactic episodes per patient prior to HαT identification being less than one. Patients with triplication had higher prevalence of hypermobility and POTS and were more likely to receive treatment with omalizumab or cromolyn. Co-morbid hypermobility, POTS and GERD in patients with flushing, urticaria, or anaphylaxis should warrant further investigation for HαT.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: insights into pathogenesis and treatment [^9a973663]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of chronic dysautonomia, most commonly seen in women of child-bearing age and often associated with reduced quality of life. Current diagnostic criteria require an increase in heart rate of 30 beats per minute (bpm), or over 120 bpm in the first 10 min of standing, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, and associated with orthostatic intolerance. Other symptoms suggestive of autoimmune failure include sudomotor dysfunction and gastrointestinal dysmotility. However, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and uncertainty of pathogenesis, often prompts a search for alternative causes before a diagnosis of POTS, a made.

This months' journal club explores the evidence for an autoimmune basis of dysautonomia in POTS. The first paper evaluates biomarkers of inflammation and possible platelet dysfunction in 34 patients with POTS and autoantibodies against the A1 adrenergic and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The second paper examines the prevalence of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies in patients with POTS compared to healthy controls. The third paper is a case series evaluating use of intravenous immunoglobulin in six patients with refractory immune-mediated POTS.

### Clinical challenges in the diagnosis and management of postural tachycardia syndrome [^cd561c3b]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a multifactorial clinical syndrome defined by an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30bpm on standing from supine position (or ≥ 40bpm in children). It is associated with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion that are worse when upright and improve when in supine position. Patients often have additional symptoms including severe fatigue and difficulty concentrating. There are several possible pathophysiologic mechanisms including hypovolaemia, small-fibre peripheral neuropathy and hyperadrenergic states. POTS can also be associated with several disorders including mastocytosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobility type) and autoimmune disorders. The treatment is focused on symptom relief and not solely on reducing tachycardia. Given its varying presentations, it is important to employ a practical, mechanism-focused approach to the diagnosis and management of POTS.

Deconditioning and anxiety in POTS — Patients often have poor exercise tolerance and deconditioning; deconditioned patients have reduced left ventricular mass, stroke volume, and blood volume, which improve with exercise training, and stroke volume decreases in POTS with impaired cardiac filling when standing; however, it is unclear whether deconditioning is the primary cause or a secondary phenomenon; anxiety and somatic vigilance are significantly higher in POTS, yet detailed studies showed the heart rate response to orthostatic stress is not caused by anxiety but reflects an underlying physiologic abnormality.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in the context of long COVID

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a condition marked by tachycardia and a constellation of autonomic symptoms upon standing, has drawn increasing attention in the context of Long COVID. Originally characterized in 1993 by Philip Low at the Mayo Clinic, POTS is now widely recognized as one of the manifestations of orthostatic intolerance.POTS is defined as a clinical "syndrome" that is usually characterized by:
1) Frequent symptoms that occur with standing such as lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue
2) An increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 beats/min when moving from a recumbent to a standing position held for more than 30 seconds (or ≥ 40 beats/min in individuals 12–19 years of age)
3) The absence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) (> 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure). Typically defined by the following criteria:

### Label: QUININE SULFATE capsule… [^e2a84608]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Quinine sulfate capsule USP is an antimalarial drug indicated only for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Quinine sulfate has been shown to be effective in geographical regions where resistance to chloroquine has been documented. Quinine sulfate capsules USP are not approved for:

- Treatment of severe or complicated P. falciparum malaria.
- Prevention of malaria.
- Treatment or prevention of nocturnal leg cramps. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
2. 1 Treatment of Uncomplicated P. falciparum Malaria For treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in adults: Orally, 648 mg every 8 hours for 7 days. Quinine sulfate capsules USP should be taken with food to minimize gastric upset.
5. 1 Use of Quinine Sulfate for Treatment or Prevention of Nocturnal Leg Cramps.

Chronic renal impairment associated with the development of TTP, and fatalities have also been reported. The risk associated with the use of quinine sulfate in the absence of evidence of its effectiveness for treatment or prevention of nocturnal leg cramps, outweighs any potential benefit in treating and/or preventing this benign, self-limiting condition. Mean urinary recoveries of the three antiepileptics over 24 hours were also profoundly increased by quinine. If concomitant administration with carbamazepine or phenobarbital cannot be avoided, frequent monitoring of anticonvulsant drug concentrations is recommended. Additionally, patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions associated with these anticonvulsants.

Astemizole Elevated plasma astemizole concentrations were reported in a subject who experienced torsades de pointes after receiving three doses of quinine sulfate for nocturnal leg cramps concomitantly with chronic astemizole 10 mg/day. The concurrent use of quinine sulfate with astemizole and other CYP3A4 substrates with QT prolongation potential should also be avoided.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome – current experience and concepts [^88df2072]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood but important cause of orthostatic intolerance resulting from cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. PoTS is distinct from the syndromes of autonomic failure usually associated with orthostatic hypotension, such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Individuals affected by PoTS are mainly young (aged between 15 years and 40 years) and predominantly female. The symptoms — palpitations, dizziness and occasionally syncope — mainly occur when the patient is standing upright, and are often relieved by sitting or lying flat. Common stimuli in daily life, such as modest exertion, food ingestion and heat, are now recognized to be capable of exacerbating the symptoms. Onset of the syndrome can be linked to infection, trauma, surgery or stress. PoTS can be associated with various other disorders; in particular, joint hypermobility syndrome (also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, formerly termed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III). This Review describes the characteristics and neuroepidemiology of PoTS, and outlines possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome, as well as current and investigational treatments.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, more specifically with respect to water and salt intake, CCS 2020 guidelines recommend to encourage oral fluid intake of at least 3 L/day and oral salt intake of 10 g/day via high-salt foods, salt sachets, salt sticks, or salt tablets to increase blood volume in patients with POTS.

### Comparison of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring among patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, autonomic dysfunction, and controls [^f76a70cf]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction (AD) refers to a range of conditions that impair the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, leading to clinical manifestations such as orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal motility disorders. AD can arise from primary disorders of the autonomic nervous system or as a secondary response to systemic diseases. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of AD and characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate upon standing, often accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and lightheadedness. POTS results from a failure to adequately maintain vascular tone, causing blood pooling in the lower extremities and may contribute to blood pressure (BP) fluctuations.

The American Autonomic Society and European Federation of Autonomic Societies recommend ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to evaluate nocturnal hypertension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, particularly those suspected of having neurogenic supine hypertension and those undergoing treatment with anti-hypotensive agents. However, there are currently no established guidelines advocating for, or against, the use of ABPM in patients diagnosed with POTS. The clinical role and potential utility of ABPM in this population remain undefined and warrants further investigation.

Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance — Orthostatic intolerance is a general term referring to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing (usually with a change in position from sitting or lying to an upright position) and are relieved by sitting or lying. Most commonly, the symptoms include lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. These symptoms may be accompanied by hemodynamic disturbances, including blood pressure decrease, which may or may not meet criteria for OH, and heart rate increase, which may be inadequate or compensatory. One condition of note is Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm. Although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

Conclusions

Patients with POTS report a broad‐spectrum symptom burden significantly exceeding predefined normality when compared with healthy individuals, posing significant limitations on functional capacity. The newly developed Malmö POTS symptom score may be useful for the structured evaluation of symptom severity in patients with POTS, offering excellent specificity and sensitivity. Future studies are warranted to test the utility of MAPS score in other populations and clinical settings, and also to track symptom progression/regression and to monitor treatment response over time.

### Abdominal compression as a treatment for postural tachycardia syndrome [^8be6c4a2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic form of orthostatic intolerance defined by orthostatic tachycardia (an increase in heart rate from supine of at least 30 beats per minute in adults or 40 beats per minute in adolescents within 10 minutes of head‐up tilt or standing) combined with chronic orthostatic symptoms including lightheadedness, fatigue, palpitations, and gastrointestinal upset. 1, 2 The origin of POTS is currently unknown and likely heterogeneous. POTS predominately affects premenopausal women and the onset is often trigged by an event such as a viral illness or injury. 1

There is no standard treatment protocol for POTS, and care typically involves a multifaceted approach using both nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions. 3 There are also no pharmacological treatments that are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat POTS, because of an absence of randomized controlled trials. 3 However, in small studies it was found that many medications including β‐blockers, fludrocortisone, midodrine, and intravenous saline have been shown to decrease POTS symptoms. 3 Nonpharmacological approaches to treat POTS include increased salt and fluid intake, exercise, as well as leg and abdominal body compression. 4 Few of these nonpharmacological options for POTS have been validated in clinical trials. Compression garment research has demonstrated effectiveness in other types of orthostatic intolerance including orthostatic hypotension (OH) and vasovagal syncope, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 but there are few published studies using compression in POTS. 10 One study in a pediatric POTS population showed that combined leg and abdominal compression decreased heart rate response to head‐up tilt by 24 beats/minute, when compared with no compression. 10 However, the cardiovascular effects of abdominal compression in POTS are not well understood.

### Stirring the POTS: finding symptom patterns in long COVID [^b5aaf3dc]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although POTS and OH are both classified under orthostatic intolerance, they differ in their clinical profiles — POTS tends to affect younger individuals and is associated with considerable psychological and functional burden, whereas OH is more common among older adults, those with diabetes, or individuals taking diuretics. POTS has also been linked to conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. POTS is typically subtyped into hypovolemic, neuropathic, and hyperadrenergic forms, which often overlap. Understanding these subtypes requires a broader perspective on autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia). From a cardiology perspective, particularly among electrophysiologists, POTS has garnered interest due to its clinical overlap with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. This resemblance prompted the Heart Rhythm Society to address POTS in its 2015 expert consensus statement, which included a discussion of diagnostic criteria and potential treatment strategies. At that time, invasive interventions such as sinus node modification and sinus node–sparing ablation were not recommended, reflecting concerns regarding safety and efficacy. However, with ongoing advancements in mapping and ablation technologies, these strategies are once again being explored in carefully selected cases.POTS, therefore, offers valuable insights into a range of domains — its symptoms are consistently triggered by a defined physical stimulus (orthostasis), its objective correlates are observable in vital signs, and its pathophysiology straddles autonomic dysfunction and, increasingly, abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system. As such, it serves as a clinically rich and mechanistically complex condition. In recent years, numerous cases of POTS have been reported under the diagnosis of Long COVID, highlighting its growing relevance in this emerging context.

### Reduced stroke volume and brain Perfusion drive postural hyperventilation in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^24936cbd]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic, debilitating disorder of the autonomic nervous system that predominantly affects premenopausal women. Adult patients with POTS present with cardiovascular dysregulation and crippling cardiac and neurologic symptoms (eg, light-headedness, blurred vision, shortness of breath, presyncope). While upright, patients can also experience exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity, paralleled by exaggerated increases in ventilation, which decreases carbon dioxide levels in the blood (ie, hypocapnia). Hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood velocity, and exacerbates symptoms. As postural hyperventilation has been implicated as a cause of POTS, identifying the underlying mechanisms is crucial to the development of targeted therapies.

Studies have proposed that heightened peripheral chemoreceptor activity underlies postural ventilation and sympathetic activation in patients with POTS. Peripheral chemoreceptors, mainly the carotid bodies, respond to hypoxia (low O 2), hypercapnia (high CO 2), and hypoperfusion, and they increase ventilation and sympathetic activity when activated. In patients with POTS, reduced cardiac venous return and stroke volume in the upright position, are thought to reduce blood flow to the carotid bodies, leading to hypoperfusion, and subsequent activation.

Alternatively, reduced cerebral blood velocity at the onset of orthostasis can precede increases in ventilation and sympathetic activity in patients with POTS. These findings suggest that brain hypoperfusion may underlie increased ventilation and sympathetic activity when patients are upright. The roles of peripheral chemoreceptor activity and changes in systemic and cerebrovascular hemodynamic status as drivers of postural ventilation and sympathetic activation have not been examined concurrently in patients with POTS.

In this study, we explored potential mechanisms driving postural ventilation in patients with POTS. Initially, we assessed exaggerated peripheral chemoreceptor activity driving postural ventilation and increased sympathetic activity. Next, we examined the relationship among postural hemodynamic status, ventilation, and sympathetic activity in both humans and an in situ preparation.

### The relationship between hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) [^81164646]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

In recent years, an association between hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) has garnered attention and patients are increasingly presenting with this triad. However, a real relationship between these entities is unclear due to a lack of scientific validity. We conducted an extensive review of the literature using two different search strategies. A narrower strategy included 88 searches of various combinations of terms for each of the three conditions, yielding 19 unique papers. A broader search included 136 searches of various combinations of terms but included all forms of EDS and yielded 40 unique papers. Of these, only four and nine papers from the narrower and broader search strategies were original research articles. None of these papers resulted from a combination of the search terms for the three conditions. All three clinical entities are controversial in either existence or pathogenesis. MCAS is a poorly defined clinical entity, and many studies do not adhere to the proposed criteria when establishing the diagnosis. Patients previously diagnosed with EDS hypermobility type may not meet the new, stricter criteria for hEDS but may for a less severe hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD). The pathophysiology of POTS is still unclear. An evidence-based, common pathophysiologic mechanism between any of the two, much less all three conditions, has yet to be described. Our review of the literature shows that current evidence is lacking on the existence of MCAS or hEDS as separate or significant clinical entities. Studies proposing a relationship between the three clinical entities are either biased or based on outdated criteria. The reason behind the purported association of these entities stems from an overlapping pool of vague, subjective symptoms, which is inadequate evidence to conclude that any such relationship exists.

### Treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome with medication: a systematic review [^b94bab2a]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome has been recognized for decades, but treatment is largely based on anecdotal experience and expert opinion. Pharmacologic treatment is inconsistent and unstandardized. We did a systematic review to identify controlled studies from which informed treatment decisions can be made.

Method

Through a standard systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we identified all English-language studies of a medication treatment for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome that included a comparison or control group and followed outcomes for at least 1 week of treatment.

Results

A total of 626 studies were identified by the search criteria, and 8, involving a total of 499 patients, met the criteria. No studies were adequately similar to allow for meta-analysis. Of the identified 8 studies, 2 were randomized controlled trials and 4 had been subjected to peer review. In individual studies, there was some favorable effect with fludrocortisone, beta blockers, midodrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Conclusion

There is a paucity of high-quality data about effectiveness of medication in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Nonetheless, 2 randomized trials and 6 other reports show some favorable effects of medication.

POTS therapy options — The natural history includes "a relatively high frequency of spontaneous recovery for 2 to 3 years", so initial management emphasizes nonpharmacological measures. Fludrocortisone is described as "the historical choice" but with "no double-blind placebo-controlled trials supporting its use". Midodrine hydrochloride "can rapidly increase afterload and decrease symptoms" though it requires "frequent dosing". Small studies report pyridostigmine use, serotonin reuptake inhibitors have "anecdotal data", and "Beta-blockers… have failed most controlled trials". Cognitive behavioral therapy is "an accepted part" for refractory syncope/chronic fatigue, and "Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline… do not seem to have significant cardiac side effects in most people".

### Orthostatic and non-orthostatic headache in postural tachycardia syndrome [^dcb79f0f]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Orthostatic and non-orthostatic headache spectrum was prospectively studied in 24 consecutive patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).

Methods

Patients were interviewed about clinical aspects of headache and its precipitation during head-up tilt (HUT). Autonomic functions were assessed using a standard battery of tests. The relationship of orthostatic headache to cardiovascular variables was examined using unpaired two-tailed t-test.

Results

Orthostatic headache occurred during daily activity in 14 patients (58.3%) and during HUT in 15 patients (62.5%). Age under 30 years and increasing duration of tilt were predictive for orthostatic headache. Of the 24 patients, 23 (95.8%) had non-orthostatic headache fitting the criteria of migraine or probable migraine.

Conclusions

Orthostatic headache affected two-thirds of POTS patients, especially those under age 30. Patients with orthostatic headache should be clinically assessed for POTS and informed of this association to reduce short-term morbidity. Migraine afflicted almost all POTS patients. This co-morbidity should be considered in management of POTS.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^81e45368]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by excessive heart rate (HR) increase on standing and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, posing significant limitations on functional capacity. No objective tool exists to classify symptom burden in POTS.

Methods

We conducted a case–control study in 62 POTS patients and 50 healthy controls to compare symptom burden between groups using the newly developed, self‐rating, 12‐item, Malmö POTS Score (MAPS; 0–10 per item, total range 0–120) based on patients own perception of symptoms through visual analogue scale assessment. We have also explored correlations between symptom severity assessed by MAPS, basic clinical parameters and postural haemodynamic changes.

Results

POTS patients showed significantly higher total MAPS score (78 ± 20 vs. 14 ± 12, p < 0.001), higher baseline systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP and HR (p < 0.001) compared with healthy controls. The most prominent symptoms in POTS were palpitations, fatigue and concentration difficulties. Haemodynamic parameters on standing were significantly correlated with palpitations in POTS after adjustment for age and sex (lower systolic and diastolic BP, and higher HR) (p < 0.001 for all). Orthostatic HR was significantly associated with concentration difficulties and total MAPS score. The optimal cut‐point value of MAPS to differentiate POTS and healthy controls was ≥ 42 (sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 98%).

Conclusions

Symptom severity, as assessed by MAPS score, is fivefold higher in POTS compared with healthy individuals. The new MAPS score can be useful as a semiquantitative system to assess symptom burden, monitor disease progression and evaluate pre‐test likelihood of disease.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^bbb25865]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — a variant of neurally mediated syncope — is recognized by a marked heart rate rise during orthostatic testing, and the syndrome features prominent somatic and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with characteristic circulatory findings. POTS is recognized by a marked "(30–40 bpm) increase in heart rate either during a formal head-up tilt test (HUTT) or during 3- to 10-min stand tests in the office", and "the clinical syndrome is characterized by multiple somatic symptoms", with "nearly 50% of patients" having "significant gastrointestinal symptoms". Adolescent evaluations describe "excessive venous pooling" in legs, pelvic and splanchnic beds with a "marked decrease in the thoracic blood pool", and "at least transient declines in cerebral blood flow velocity" despite preserved mean arterial pressure; nevertheless, "cerebral autoregulation remains intact" and "most measures of baroreflex integrity are normal". Many patients have "decreased blood volume" with "normal plasma renin and low serum aldosterone", and a subset shows "increased angiotensin II and decreased cutaneous nitric oxide" consistent with endothelial dysfunction.

### Complete remission with histamine blocker in a patient with intractable hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome secondary to long coronavirus disease syndrome [^1f6418c7]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a global public health concern and its sequels have barely started to outcrop. A good percentage of patients who suffered from COVID-19 are prone to develop long-COVID or post-COVID condition (PCC), a multisystemic, heterogeneous, chronic disorder. Patients with PCC may experience diverse manifestations, of which cardiovascular and neurological symptoms are among the most frequently reported. Indeed, dysautonomia presented as orthostatic intolerance has gained room following recent reports linking postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with PCC. Disturbances in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) during postural changes are the cornerstones of orthostatic intolerance seen in patients suffering from PCC. A subtype of POTS, hyperadrenergic POTS, has been widely studied because of its association with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). Although a causative relationship between PCC, hyperadrenergic POTS, and MCAS remains unrevealed, these syndromes can overlap. We want to propose here a correlation produced by a close-loop mechanism with positive feedback established after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a previously healthy young patient.

### Topiramate-induced confusion following a single ingestion of 400 mg [^aa6b03be]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Topiramate is an anticonvulsant medication commonly used for a variety of neurological disorders including migraine prophylaxis. Broadened use of topiramate has brought an increased awareness of toxicity from this medication, particularly central nervous system side effects and metabolic acidosis.

Objective

We describe a case of topiramate toxicity occurring in a 22-year-old female following the ingestion of two 200 mg tablets, which she was prescribed for the treatment of migraines.

Results

During her outpatient cardiology evaluation for suspected postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), the patient experienced flushing and anxiety. Upon transfer to our hospital she was tachycardic, hypertensive, and confused. Her autonomic symptoms were consistent with her prior episodes of autonomic instability, while the confusion was new. Admission laboratory values revealed a metabolic acidosis with a mildly elevated anion gap. A blood topiramate level returned a value of 8.4 mg/L 15 h after the ingestion. Her symptoms cleared within 24 h following admission.

Conclusion

Clinicians should consider topiramate toxicity in their differential diagnosis for patients with neurological diseases presenting with acute-onset confusion and metabolic acidosis.

### Restless legs syndrome is increased in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^6707600f]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are both characterized by sleep disturbance along with autoimmune/inflammatory features and autonomic dysfunction. However, to our knowledge, there has been no direct study looking at the prevalence of RLS in patients with POTS patients compared with healthy participants (controls).

Methods

Ninety-six physician-diagnosed patients with POTS (89 female and 7 male) and 130 controls (99 female and 31 male) were administered the Cambridge Hopkins questionnaire. Participants who were diagnosed with probable or definite RLS on the Cambridge Hopkins questionnaire were then contacted to determine the severity of RLS with the International Restless Legs Scale.

Results

More patients with POTS (15 of 96; 15.6%) than controls (6 of 130; 4.6%) were diagnosed with probable or definite RLS on the Cambridge Hopkins questionnaire (P = 0.0048). A sensitivity analysis with only female respondents yielded similar results. RLS severity was in the moderate range (12.23 ± 9.22).

Conclusions

There is a higher prevalence of RLS in patients with POTS patients compared with controls. This association may have to do with shared increased inflammatory/autoimmune load and autonomic dysfunction.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome — orthostatic intolerance with excessive tachycardia upon standing may reflect postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and patients with POTS generally have a heart rate > 30 beats per minute above the supine heart rate after 5–10 minutes of quiet standing (and frequently > 120 beats per minute) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. In a study of 152 patients with POTS predating COVID-19, 42% of cases were preceded by a viral infection. Although much remains to be learned about the relationship between POTS and PASC, it is important to recognize that other forms of tachycardia (eg, sinus, inappropriate sinus) may be commonly found.

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^cc190317]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

When considering a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms must have been present for greater than six months, although some researchers may set this threshold at three months for youth. It is important to note that chronicity is an important defining factor, as some transient causes (e.g. viral infection) may produce similar symptoms to POTS. Finally, symptoms must be present in the absence of other causes. Youth with a POTS diagnosis often begin their diagnostic journey following an acute illness, inactivity due to injury, or an accident (e.g. concussion). These incidents can, in and among themselves, foster a decrease in function and increase in deconditioning.–

POTS has been described as both a primary medical condition that can be a standalone diagnosis and, conversely, as a collection of symptoms. Garland and colleagues (2015) wrote a well-organized review of POTS and its "overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms": chronic fatigue syndrome, Ehler-Danlos Syndrome and other hypermobile joint syndromes, vasovagal syncope, panic attacks, pain, exercise, caffeine, sympathomimetic medications, anticholinergic medications, anemia, dehydration, and sinus tachycardia. Just as the signs and symptoms of POTS overlap with several medical disorders (e.g. autonomic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy), so do the typical compensatory physiologic responses associated with medical conditions or decrease in function (e.g. deconditioning, hypovolemia, anxiety). Diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that patients sometimes present with POTS as well as a concurrent diagnosis of deconditioning. The presence of deconditioning is considered a differential diagnosis (i.e. weighing the probability of one diagnosis versus the other diagnosis when they present with similar clinical features) for POTS and 70% of youth present with a concurrent diagnosis of deconditioning, making it difficult for clinical providers to name POTS as the primary diagnosis. The diagnostic complexity associated with POTS makes it incumbent upon the clinician to perform a thorough history and physical. If another diagnosis is suggested, an appropriate and reasonable workup should be pursued. If necessary, a comprehensive interdisciplinary examination and screening process is warranted.

### Hop to It: the first animal model of autoimmune postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^97eb8f92]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic form of orthostatic intolerance that elicits daily symptoms, such as lightheadedness, fatigue, weakness, and nausea, which can substantially impact quality of life. 1 POTS is defined by the presence of these symptoms and orthostatic tachycardia (an increase in heart rate from supine of at least 30 beats per minute in adults or 40 beats per minute in adolescents within 10 minutes of standing or head‐up tilt). 2 The cause of POTS is currently unknown and likely heterogeneous. POTS predominately affects premenopausal women, and the onset is often trigged by an event such as a viral illness or injury. 1

There is an emerging body of evidence that suggests an autoimmune basis for POTS. 3 Several studies have investigated the presence of autoantibodies in POTS and their effects on cholinergic and adrenergic receptors. 3 Low levels of antibodies to ganglionic cholinergic receptors were found in a minority of people with POTS (5%–29%). However, low levels of these antibodies were found in healthy volunteers and in people with unrelated autoimmune disorders at similar rates. Although the presence of cholinergic receptor antibodies in POTS has both low sensitivity and specificity, functional antibodies to adrenergic receptors may be a potential biomarker for diagnosing POTS. 3 One group has consistently found autoantibodies that bind and activate adrenergic receptors in all patients with POTS tested from 2 different countries. 4, 5 These studies found antibodies that activate the β1 adrenergic receptor in most participants with POTS (n = 28/32), and a smaller subset of participants with POTS was positive for antibodies that activate β2 adrenergic receptors and act as partial agonists/antagonists to α1 receptors. 4, 5 However, these are small studies, and it is unknown whether most or all patients with POTS have functional autoantibodies to the α1 and β adrenergic receptors and how many healthy individuals have similar autoantibodies. Further research on the prevalence of these adrenergic autoantibodies in POTS by other groups and in larger samples is needed to confirm these findings.

### Propranolol decreases tachycardia and improves symptoms in the postural tachycardia syndrome: less is more [^8a7c9be9]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) induces disabling chronic orthostatic intolerance with an excessive increase in heart rate on standing. beta-Blockade is an appealing treatment approach, but conflicting preliminary reports are conflicting. We tested the hypothesis that propranolol will attenuate the tachycardia and improve symptom burden in patients with POTS. In protocol 1, a low dose (20 mg) was compared with placebo, and the dose response was assessed in protocol 2.

Methods and Results

In protocol 1, patients with POTS (n = 54) underwent acute drug trials of propranolol 20 mg orally and placebo, on separate mornings, in a randomized crossover design. Blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms were assessed while the patients were seated and after standing for up to 10 minutes before and hourly after the study drug. Supine (P < 0.001) and standing (P < 0.001) heart rates were significantly lower after propranolol compared with placebo. The symptom burden improvement from baseline to 2 hours was greater with propranolol than placebo (median, -4.5 versus 0 arbitrary units; P = 0.044). In protocol 2, 18 patients with POTS underwent similar trials of high-dose (80 mg) versus low-dose (20 mg) propranolol. Although the high dose elicited a greater decrease than the low dose in standing heart rate (P < 0.001) and orthostatic tachycardia (P < 0.001), the improvement in symptoms at 2 hours was greater with low-dose propranolol (-6 versus -2 arbitrary units; P = 0.041).

Conclusions

Low-dose oral propranolol significantly attenuated tachycardia and improved symptoms in POTS. Higher-dose propranolol did not further improve, and may worsen, symptoms.

### Successful treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia and mast cell activation syndromes using naltrexone, immunoglobulin and antibiotic treatment [^ac48796e]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

IVIg appeared to be effective for multiple manifestations of POTS but this treatment is expensive and has potential significant side effects. In contrast, LDN is inexpensive, safe and appeared to provide effective, adjunctive therapy in both MCAS and POTS. Recognition that small bowel dysfunction in POTS can lead to SIBO is important since antibiotic treatment can lead to significant GI relief.

Patient's perspective

After decades of declining health, despite trying every conventional treatment with 100% compliance, I was pretty discouraged. I used to be such a high achiever and now I couldn't even stand or sit up. I'd seen numerous top specialists and tried everything they recommended. I started seeing doctors for these complaints in 1997, and first received diagnoses of rosacea and restless leg syndrome. Rosacea was treated with antibiotics and numerous laser treatments. RLS was treated unsuccessfully with iron supplements and trials of various drugs (like ropinerole, which made me pass out). My face flushes got better, but other POTS/MCAD/RLS symptoms continued to get worse. Cardiologists didn't find anything, but referred me to a neurologist for dizziness and presyncope. The neurologist thought I had Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, and referred me to the Mayo Clinic in 2006. They determined I did not have LEMS, but did have 'excessive venous compliance', and prescribed compression stockings. After that, the original neurologist was out of ideas and suggested I get a psych evaluation, which I declined. Still getting worse, I got diagnoses of Hashimoto's thyroid in 2007 (treated with synthroid) and 'severe' chronic venous insufficiency of the deep venous system in 2010 (measured three different times by Doppler ultrasound and treated with tighter compression stockings, elevating legs and more activity). That was a bit mysterious at the time because my valves were intact, so they didn't know why my blood was flowing backwards (later they measured some of my veins at much wider diameters than expected, so that probably explains it). I saw a gastroenterologist for my 'potty issues' in 2012, but she didn't seem to think they were a big deal. In 2013, I realised Claritin helped, and that led me to figure out I may have POTS and MCAD. I referred myself to Mayo AZ, who confirmed it, and they started treatment with all the many drugs listed above. I was also diagnosed with 'delayed pressure urticaria /angioedema', DPU which is a mast cell problem where physical pressure leads to localised pain and swelling for days after. It's a comically cruel problem to have along with POTS because one keeps you from being upright while the other keeps you from being able to lie down comfortably more than a few minutes… so you writhe on the ground mostly. But I'm grateful I have it because it's the diagnosis that allowed me to receive IVIg!

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^33adcb5b]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Haemodynamic parameters and symptom severity by MAPS score

We observed a strong positive correlation between total MAPS score and orthostatic HR at 3 min of head‐up tilt in POTS patients and during active standing for healthy controls (Figure 4). Likewise, we observed a significant increase of total MAPS score across supine and orthostatic HR quartiles in POTS compared with controls (Figure 5).

Fig. 4
Relationship between total Malmö POTS Symptom Score (MAPS) score and orthostatic heart rate. Heart rate was measured at 3 min of standing (head‐up tilt test [HUT] for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS] and active standing for controls).

Fig. 5
Malmö POTS Symptom Score (MAPS) score by supine (panel a) and orthostatic (panel b) heart rate (HR) quartiles in the overall study population. HR was measured at 3 min of standing. HUT, head‐up tilt test; oHR, orthostatic heart rate (bpm); POTS, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; sHR, supine heart rate (bpm).

We found, furthermore, a significant correlation between all haemodynamic parameters (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and HR) at 10 min of head‐up tilt and symptoms in POTS compared with healthy controls in the univariate analysis (p < 0.001). After adjustment for age and sex, only palpitations remained significantly associated with all haemodynamic parameters in POTS (p < 0.001), whereas concentration difficulties were significantly associated with increased HR during head‐up tilt in POTS patients (p < 0.05). Other cardiovascular and non‐cardiovascular symptom categories did not demonstrate significant associations with haemodynamic parameters, neither supine nor on standing.

### The face of postural tachycardia syndrome-insights from a large cross-sectional online community-based survey [^a5921385]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptom burden in POTS patients

Symptoms of POTS most frequently reported by survey respondents are detailed in Table 4. The most common symptoms include lightheadedness (n = 3992; 99%), tachycardia (n = 3901; 97%), presyncope (n = 3789; 94%), headache (n = 3797; 94%) and difficulty concentrating (n = 3794; 94%). Of these symptoms, the triad of lightheadedness, tachycardia and presyncope was concomitantly present in 3677 (91%) of respondents. A pentad of all five symptoms was reported by 3331 (83%) of respondents.

Table 4
Symptom profile

Symptom changes over time in POTS patients

Compared to when their symptoms started, 1702 (42%) patients reported that their symptoms had generally improved a little (n = 1167; 29%) or a lot (n = 535; 13%). Ten per cent (n = 400) of participants reported no change in symptoms. Additionally, 1756 (44%) patients reported that their symptoms had worsened a lot (n = 1197; 30%) or a little (n = 559; 14%). Almost two‐thirds of respondents (n = 2552; 63%) believed they have always had a tendency to have POTS‐like symptoms for most of their lives.

Nearly, one‐third (n = 490; 29%) of participants whose symptoms improved a little or a lot reported that medications were the predominant reason for this improvement. A majority of participants reporting some improvement (n = 876; 52%) reported that nonpharmacological factors had also been helpful (in addition to medications). A larger proportion (P < 0.001) of participants seen at an Autonomic Disorders Consortium site reported symptom improvement (n = 187/347; 54%) in comparison with those who were seen elsewhere (n = 1974/3476; 43%).

Participants reported having to go to the emergency department significantly fewer times after their diagnosis of POTS (paired difference in visits: 1.7 (95% CI: 0.9, 2.7; P < 0.001), although they still averaged 8 ± 20 visits postdiagnosis.

### Mast cell activation disorder and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical association [^37df4157]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

The findings reported here are subject to important limitations. First, since both true POTS and MCA disorder are infrequent conditions, our study population is small, limiting the power to detect differences among clinical and laboratory findings. Second, there remain differences of opinion regarding the optimal definition of MCA, with some arguing that the condition is inadequately defined. Consequently, despite the 2 consensus statements upon which we based our observations, the definition of which if any patients actually exhibit MCA disorder may be disputed. In any case, a solitary laboratory abnormality is insufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of MCA disorder; confirmatory laboratory abnormalities should be sought. In this regard, it is widely acknowledged that prostaglandin D2 and F2alpha are known markers of MCA. However, it has been previously cautioned that an increased prostaglandin D2 or F2alpha level should not be relied upon solely as a marker of MCA disorder. In our patients, we found that > 50% of patients with elevated prostaglandin D2 also exhibited an increased histamine marker, thereby strengthening the MCA diagnosis. Third, the blood tests in our studies were not necessarily obtained in conjunction with an acute symptom "flare", but more often at the time of a convenient outpatient visit. In each instance, however, every effort was made to optimize the handling of specimens including appropriate refrigerated centrifugation and storage. Outside laboratories were not used. Nonetheless, false‐negative laboratory findings may have occurred. The sensitivity of testing is currently unknown. Optimal sampling would be in temporal proximity to an acute symptomatic event. Finally, laboratory costs precluded biochemical testing in many of the patients with typical POTS. Consequently, whether such testing may have been positive in some of those patients is unknown. However, among those who were tested, the principal MCA markers were normal (Table 2, Figure 1).

### Quantitative assessment of autonomic symptom burden in postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^1cb03f52]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood disorder characterized by excessive tachycardia in the upright position. In addition, patients with PoTS often complain of non-postural symptoms, including fatigue, gastrointestinal and vasomotor fluctuations. The present study quantitatively assessed autonomic symptom burden in PoTS patients (n = 32) using the COMPASS-31, compared to that of autonomic failure/neuropathy (AF/N; n = 47) and asymptomatic, healthy controls (n = 32). Using AIC model selection and regression analysis, we found differences in the contribution of individual COMPASS-31 domains, depending on the autonomic disorder. In PoTS, fatigue severity, orthostatic intolerance and pupillomotor symptom domains, contributed significantly to differences in COMPASS-31 scores compared to controls. In contrast, the secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder and vasomotor domains, contributed significantly to the AF/N model. Our results confirm an increase in autonomic symptoms across all functional domains in PoTS compared to controls, and with similar severity to AF/N, though with differing significant domain contributions. Our findings provide additional support that PoTS is indeed a syndrome of autonomic dysfunction beyond orthostatic intolerance, but also indicates the likelihood of disease-specific contributions to symptom burden, highlighting the need for application of expanded physiological assessment beyond orthostatic challenge, as well as disease-specific symptom assessment tools for use in PoTS.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^bf8236a8]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia — definitions and haemodynamic patterns — are detailed as follows: Classical orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 20 mmHg and in diastolic BP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing; initial OH is a BP decrease immediately on standing of > 40 mmHg with rapid recovery such that the period of hypotension is short (< 30 s), and tracings show the nadir at 7–10 s followed by recovery; in autonomic failure (ANF), BP may fall immediately after standing to very low levels after 1 min upright with little heart rate (HR) increase; delayed (progressive) OH is not uncommon in elderly persons, is attributed to age-related impairment of compensatory reflexes and stiffer hearts, is characterized by a slow progressive decrease in systolic BP on assuming erect posture, is differentiated by the absence of a bradycardic reflex but may be followed by reflex bradycardia with a less steep fall in BP in the elderly than in the young; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) occurs in some patients, mostly young women, with severe orthostatic intolerance but not syncope and very marked HR increases [> 30 beats per minute (b.p.m.) or to > 120 b.p.m.], is frequently associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, and its underlying pathophysiology remains to be determined.

### Long-term POTS outcomes survey: diagnosis, therapy, and clinical outcomes [^86dc2dc6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on long‐term outcomes in individuals with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We designed an electronic questionnaire assessing various aspects of outcomes among patients diagnosed and treated in a single‐center pediatric POTS clinical program.

Methods and Results

The LT‐POTS (Long Term POTS Outcomes Survey) included questions about quality of life, symptoms, therapies, education, employment, and social impact of disease. Patients age ≤ 18 years at POTS diagnosis who were managed in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia POTS Program were included. A total of 227 patients with POTS responded with sufficient data for interpretation. The mean age of respondents was 21.8 ± 3.5 years. The median age of symptom onset was 13 (interquartile range 11–14) years, with mean 9.6 ± 3.4 years symptom duration. Multiple cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal symptoms were reported. Symptom prevalence and severity were worse for female patients, with 99% of patients reporting ongoing symptoms. Quality of life showed moderate function and limitation, with more severe limitations in energy/fatigue and general health. Nearly three quarters of patients had diagnostic delays, and over half were told that their symptoms were "in their head". Multiple medications were used and were felt to be effective, whereas fewer nonpharmacologic interventions demonstrated efficacy. Nearly 90% of patients required continued nonpharmacologic therapy to control symptoms.

Conclusions

POTS is a chronic disorder leading to significant disability with a range of multisystem problems. Although symptoms can be modifiable, it rarely spontaneously resolves. Improved understanding of POTS presentation and therapeutic approaches may inform provider education, improve diagnostic success, and help patients self‐advocate for appropriate medical management approaches.

### Clinical characteristics of a novel subgroup of chronic fatigue syndrome patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^b76f66a6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

A significant proportion of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) also have postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We aimed to characterize these patients and differentiate them from CFS patients without POTS in terms of clinical and autonomic features.

Methods

A total of 179 patients with CFS (1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria) attending one of the largest Department of Health-funded CFS clinical services were included in this study. Outcome measures were as follows: (i) symptom assessment tools including the fatigue impact scale, Chalder fatigue scale, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), orthostatic grading scale (OGS) and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS-A and -D, respectively), (ii) autonomic function analysis including heart rate variability and (iii) haemodynamic responses including left ventricular ejection time and systolic blood pressure drop upon standing.

Results

CFS patients with POTS (13%, n = 24) were younger (29 ± 12 vs. 42 ± 13 years, P < 0.0001), less fatigued (Chalder fatigue scale, 8 ± 4 vs. 10 ± 2, P = 0.002), less depressed (HADS-D, 6 ± 4 vs. 9 ± 4, P = 0.01) and had reduced daytime hypersomnolence (ESS, 7 ± 6 vs. 10 ± 5, P = 0.02), compared with patients without POTS. In addition, they exhibited greater orthostatic intolerance (OGS, 11 ± 5; P < 0.0001) and autonomic dysfunction. A combined clinical assessment tool of ESS ≤ 9 and OGS ≥ 9 identifies accurately CFS patients with POTS with 100% positive and negative predictive values.

Conclusions

The presence of POTS marks a distinct clinical group of CFS patents, with phenotypic features differentiating them from those without POTS. A combination of validated clinical assessment tools can determine which CFS patients have POTS with a high degree of accuracy, and thus potentially identify those who require further investigation and consideration for therapy to control heart rate.
