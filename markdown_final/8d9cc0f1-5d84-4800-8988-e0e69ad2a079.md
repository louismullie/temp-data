## Question

how does insulin work

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how insulin works. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about insulin's source and physiological context. Then, I should verify the receptor-level mechanism and immediate signaling. Next, I will examine tissue-specific metabolic effects, followed by the central nervous system and vascular actions. After that, I need to check negative feedback and desensitization, then integrate how insulin resistance alters these pathways. Finally, I will consider pharmacologic insulin and its pharmacokinetics, and close with clinical implications and a concise synthesis, making sure each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the source and physiological context. Insulin is synthesized and secreted by pancreatic β-cells within the islets of Langerhans. Its secretion is pulsatile and tightly coupled to ambient glucose, with basal pulses and meal-related surges that coordinate hepatic and peripheral glucose handling, which I should verify as physiologically accurate before moving on [^111AxCRG] [^115xAoFE].

> Wait, let me verify the receptor-level mechanism. Insulin binds the insulin receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, triggering autophosphorylation and trans-activation of the intracellular kinase domains. Structural work shows a stepwise activation model with conformational changes upon ligand binding, and cryo-EM data demonstrate that non-insulin peptides can still engage the receptor into a signaling-competent state, supporting the centrality of receptor conformational control [^115hVeP8] [^116sLDBr].

> I will now examine the immediate intracellular signaling cascade. Insulin receptor activation phosphorylates insulin receptor substrates, which recruit PI3K, generate PIP3, and activate AKT/PKB and atypical PKCs; phosphoproteomic reviews emphasize AKT's central role and the dense phosphorylation network that integrates metabolic and growth responses, so I should confirm that AKT is indeed a key node here [^112ARnmu] [^112SQJvL].

> Next, I should review tissue-specific metabolic effects, starting with skeletal muscle. Insulin drives GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, enabling glucose uptake and subsequent glycogen synthesis. GLUT4 biology and trafficking studies show that insulin regulates docking, priming, and fusion steps, with AS160 phosphorylation contributing to vesicle trafficking, which aligns with the clinical observation that muscle is the principal site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal [^1174Qrjc] [^112SMj1T].

> Hold on, I should verify hepatic effects. Insulin suppresses hepatic glucose production via both direct and indirect pathways; direct hepatic insulin action acutely inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, while indirect effects via adipose and CNS modulate hepatic glucose output over longer time frames, and importantly, the liver clears roughly half of secreted insulin on first pass, which shapes systemic insulin kinetics and may influence clearance-based insulin resistance [^111b7Av6] [^113gnruG].

> Let me consider adipose tissue. Insulin potently inhibits lipolysis, reducing free fatty acid flux to liver and muscle, and promotes lipogenesis. Adipocytes are exquisitely insulin responsive and contribute to systemic nutrient homeostasis beyond mere storage, so I should confirm that adipose insulin action meaningfully restrains hepatic glucose production via reduced substrate supply and signaling crosstalk [^114PnTYe].

> I need to check protein metabolism. Insulin enhances protein synthesis and inhibits proteolysis, reinforcing its role as an anabolic hormone; this is consistent with its broader metabolic mandate to shift cells toward anabolic processes in the fed state, which I should keep in mind when interpreting catabolic states in insulin deficiency [^113vhQrS].

> But wait, what about the brain and vasculature. Insulin acts on the CNS to modulate food intake, hepatic glucose production, and systemic insulin sensitivity; central insulin action can suppress endogenous glucose production and alter reward-driven feeding, though some data argue that direct hepatic insulin signaling dominates acute suppression, so I should acknowledge this ongoing debate while noting converging human and animal evidence for CNS effects [^113b28ZH] [^111ToC7a].

> I should confirm vascular actions. Insulin stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase, promoting vasodilation and capillary recruitment that augment glucose delivery to muscle. Pathway-specific signaling bifurcates metabolic (PI3K-AKT-eNOS) and mitogenic (MAPK) arms, and insulin resistance often manifests as selective impairment of the PI3K-dependent vasodilatory pathway, linking metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes [^111FYnYr] [^115Nd8ZF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about unbridled signaling. I need to ensure I account for negative feedback and desensitization. Chronic insulin exposure induces serine phosphorylation and degradation of IRS proteins, mTOR/S6K-mediated feedback, receptor internalization, and downregulation, all of which contribute to insulin resistance; this helps explain why hyperinsulinemia can paradoxically worsen target tissue responsiveness over time [^113jd9o9] [^113akVbo].

> Next, I should review how insulin resistance alters these pathways. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance reflects impaired signaling downstream of the receptor, with selective pathway defects that spare some anabolic or mitogenic actions while blunting glucose uptake and hepatic suppression. Recent reviews emphasize hyperinsulinemia's role in sustaining lipogenesis and lipoprotein secretion despite reduced glucose disposal, and genetic studies highlight postprandial insulin action and GLUT4 trafficking as key nodes [^113QcJUm] [^111m7EH7].

> I will now examine exogenous insulin and pharmacokinetics. All insulins lower glucose by stimulating peripheral uptake and inhibiting hepatic glucose production; rapid-acting analogs like aspart, lispro, and glulisine have faster onset/offset than regular insulin, while basal analogs like glargine and degludec are engineered for prolonged, relatively peakless profiles via precipitation, albumin binding, or multi-hexamer formation; I should double-check that these mechanistic protraction strategies map to clinical PK/PD advantages [^111o4p9F] [^114NyQZD] [^113JYVXq] [^117A6Y9N].

> Let me verify clinical implications. Insulin is indicated for type 1 diabetes and for type 2 diabetes when other therapies fail or are contraindicated; risks include hypoglycemia and weight gain, and in type 2 diabetes, prolonged hyperinsulinemia may have adverse cardiometabolic consequences, so therapy should be individualized and, when possible, paired with agents that mitigate these risks or enhance insulin sensitivity [^113Xeian] [^116dGAQW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the heart was a primary direct target of insulin for glucose uptake, but I should correct that. While the myocardium uses insulin for metabolic regulation, the dominant acute mechanism for systemic glucose lowering remains skeletal muscle GLUT4-mediated uptake and hepatic suppression; cardiac insulin resistance alters substrate utilization and function, but it is not the principal sink for insulin-mediated glucose disposal, so I need to be precise here [^1174Qrjc] [^111GGCVD].

> Let me synthesize succinctly. Insulin integrates nutrient sensing with anabolic and anti-catabolic programs: it binds its receptor, activates IRS-PI3K-AKT signaling, and coordinates GLUT4 translocation in muscle, suppression of hepatic glucose output, inhibition of lipolysis in adipose, and enhancement of protein synthesis, while also modulating CNS and vascular function. These actions are constrained by negative feedback that, when dysregulated, contributes to insulin resistance and shapes the clinical use of exogenous insulin analogs designed to mimic physiologic profiles [^112ARnmu] [^111b7Av6] [^113b28ZH] [^115xAoFE].

Insulin lowers blood glucose by **binding to its receptor** and activating downstream signaling that increases glucose uptake in muscle and fat and suppresses hepatic glucose production [^114wvZiG] [^112Zofy3]. It also **inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis** while promoting protein synthesis, supporting anabolic metabolism [^113vhQrS]. Insulin resistance or deficiency impairs these actions, causing hyperglycemia and metabolic dysregulation [^113QcJUm].

## Molecular mechanism of insulin action

### Insulin receptor and signaling cascade

- **Receptor binding**: Insulin binds the insulin receptor (IR), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, triggering autophosphorylation and kinase activation [^112WHNyW].
- **IRS phosphorylation**: Activated IR phosphorylates insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1, IRS-2), creating docking sites for downstream signaling proteins [^112WHNyW].
- **PI3K-Akt pathway**: IRS recruits PI3K, generating PIP3 and activating Akt, which mediates metabolic effects including GLUT4 translocation and glycogen synthesis [^112SQJvL].
- **MAPK pathway**: Parallel ERK/MAPK signaling regulates gene expression and cell growth [^112WHNyW].

## Physiological effects of insulin

### Glucose metabolism

Insulin **lowers blood glucose** by increasing glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue and by suppressing hepatic glucose production [^112Zofy3]. It also **promotes glycogen synthesis** in liver and muscle, storing glucose for later use [^114wvZiG].

---

### Lipid metabolism

Insulin **inhibits lipolysis** in adipose tissue, reducing free fatty acid release, and **promotes lipogenesis**, storing energy as triglycerides [^1118T4As].

---

### Protein metabolism

Insulin **stimulates protein synthesis** and **inhibits proteolysis**, maintaining and building muscle mass [^113vhQrS].

---

## Regulation of insulin secretion

Insulin secretion is **primarily regulated by blood glucose**; rising glucose stimulates β-cell insulin release, while low glucose suppresses it [^115xAoFE]. Additional regulation comes from amino acids, gastrointestinal hormones (GLP-1, GIP), and neural inputs that modulate secretion [^116ZQS81].

---

## Insulin resistance and deficiency

Insulin resistance is a reduced responsiveness of target tissues to insulin, leading to hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and metabolic dysregulation [^113QcJUm]. Insulin deficiency — absolute or relative — impairs glucose uptake and hepatic glucose suppression, causing hyperglycemia and diabetes [^115cNSy5].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Diabetes management**: Insulin therapy is essential for type 1 diabetes and advanced type 2 diabetes to maintain glycemic control [^115NqL2T].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: Excess insulin can cause hypoglycemia, requiring careful dosing and monitoring [^114EqF4i].
- **Metabolic complications**: Chronic hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance increase risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome [^116dGAQW].

---

Insulin coordinates glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism through receptor signaling; **impairments in insulin action or secretion** underlie diabetes and related metabolic disorders [^112ARnmu].

Major specific aims

The relative effects of four commonly used glucose-lowering medications with different mechanisms of action when added to metformin will be compared for the following:
Maintenance of metabolic control, defined as time to primary failure with an A1C ≥ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), confirmed, while receiving maximally tolerated doses of both metformin up to 2,000 mg/day and the assigned medication;
The time to secondary metabolic failure with an A1C > 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), confirmed, requiring the addition of basal insulin for oral agent-treated subjects and intensification of insulin therapy for those assigned to basal insulin at baseline;
The time to tertiary metabolic failure with an A1C > 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), confirmed, requiring implementation of intensive insulin therapy with basal plus rapid-acting insulin, while treated with metformin, the assigned study medication, and basal insulin among those not originally assigned to basal insulin;
Cumulative incidence of diabetes complications, such as microalbuminuria; and
Other metabolic outcomes, adverse effects, and effects on CVD risk factors, quality of life, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness.

In addition, we will determine the phenotypic characteristics associated with response to and failure of the four different medication combinations and identify factors that determine the success and/or failure of specific regimens over time, including longitudinal mechanistic investigations of β-cell function.

There have been many advances in insulin with a realistic possibility of mimicking nature to improve insulin replacement, with a view to achieving improved metabolic control. Lessons can be learnt from the evolution of insulin, insulin development, and new advances in technology. This may lead to fewer side effects of therapy resulting in a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and less weight gain, which could in turn could reduce long-term complications for people with diabetes.

### The need for better insulin therapy [^115ATekx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Insulin replacement therapy corrects a core defect of diabetes pathophysiology. Since its introduction as a therapeutic modality almost 100 years ago, insulin therapy has undergone remarkable changes in purity and ability to provide more physiologic control of blood glucose levels. With glucose-lowering potential limited only by risks of hypoglycaemia, which remains the major limitation in our ability to achieve glycaemic goals, insulin replacement therapy remains a cornerstone of therapy. Major progress in reducing the risks of hypoglycemia has occurred with the development of insulin analogs. This review article briefly chronicles the evolution of insulin replacement strategies, highlighting both challenges in pharmaceutical development and patient acceptance, underscoring achievements, as well as denoting what improvements are still needed.

### GLP-1 receptor activated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells: mechanism and glucose dependence [^111twP9U]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The major goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is to control the hyperglycaemia characteristic of the disease. However, treatment with common therapies such as insulin or insulinotrophic sulphonylureas (SU), while effective in reducing hyperglycaemia, may impose a greater risk of hypoglycaemia, as neither therapy is self-regulated by ambient blood glucose concentrations. Hypoglycaemia has been associated with adverse physical and psychological outcomes and may contribute to negative cardiovascular events; hence minimization of hypoglycaemia risk is clinically advantageous. Stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists is known to be glucose-dependent. GLP-1R agonists potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and have little or no activity on insulin secretion in the absence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. This 'glucose-regulated' activity of GLP-1R agonists makes them useful and potentially safer therapeutics for overall glucose control compared to non-regulated therapies; hyperglycaemia can be reduced with minimal hypoglycaemia. While the inherent mechanism of action of GLP-1R agonists mediates their glucose dependence, studies in rats suggest that SUs may uncouple this dependence. This hypothesis is supported by clinical studies showing that the majority of events of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with GLP-1R agonists occur in patients treated with a concomitant SU. This review aims to discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms by which GLP-1R signalling promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells via a glucose-dependent process.

### Intracellular mechanisms of metabolism regulation: the role of signaling via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and other routes [^111C3QGg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The development of diabetes mellitus is the consequence of defects in the action of insulin in skeletal muscles and adipose tissue other than pancreas and liver defects. Insulin action defects are mostly the results of defects of the insulin intracellular signaling transduction pathway. This review summarizes the main mechanisms involved in insulin signaling and possible intracellular defects that lead to insulin resistance. We also report preliminary experimental data that suggest the existence of intracellular alternatives to insulin metabolic pathways stimulated by nutrients such as amino acids (AAs). Indeed, we found that oral supplements with AAs stimulated both glucose transporter-4 and protein synthesis through independent insulin signals in rat hearts. Evidence suggests that the mammalian target of rapamycin and/or other molecules could be involved in this insulin-independent metabolic pathway. This hypothesis suggests the presence of an ancestral metabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells that is not active when insulin intracellular signaling is efficient but can be activated by alternative stimuli, such as AAs, when insulin signaling is impaired. Our observations provide molecular evidence that supports the use of anabolic nutrients such as AAs, together with standard therapies, to overcome insulin resistance syndrome.

### Insulin action research and the future of diabetes treatment: the 2017 banting medal for scientific achievement lecture [^112d6YJz]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetes is caused by combined abnormalities in insulin production and action. The pathophysiology of these defects has been studied extensively and is reasonably well understood. Their causes are elusive and their manifestations pleiotropic, likely reflecting the triple threat of genes, environment, and lifestyle. Treatment, once restricted to monotherapy with secretagogues or insulin, now involves complex combinations of expensive regimens that stem the progression but do not fundamentally alter the underlying causes of the disease. As advances in our understanding of insulin action and β-cell failure reach a critical stage, here I draw on lessons learned from our research on insulin regulation of gene expression and pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation to address the question of how we can translate this exciting biology into mechanism-based interventions to reverse the course of diabetes.

### Insulin resistance and vascular function [^115Nd8ZF]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

It has become clear that amongst its many actions insulin is also a vasoactive hormone. Its effect to cause endothelial-nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation is physiologic and dose-dependent. Recent data suggest that insulin's metabolic and vascular actions are closely linked. Indeed, insulin resistant states, which by definition, exhibit diminished insulin-mediated glucose uptake into peripheral tissues also display impaired insulin mediated vasodilation as well as impaired endothelium dependent vasolidation to the muscarinic receptor agonist acetylcholine. Free fatty acids are elevated in states of insulin resistance and also cause endothelial dysfunction along with impaired insulin-mediated vasodilation. Thus, a picture is emerging linking insulin action in peripheral tissues to its action in endothelium. More recent data suggest that insulin signaling mechanisms in peripheral tissues and endothelium may be shared. Thus mechanisms causing insulin resistance via defects in insulin signaling might be expected to be manifest in both tissues. The protective action of nitric oxide and healthy endothelial function are critical to prevent atherosclerotic vascular disease. If follows that endothelial dysfunction associated insulin resistance through common defects in insulin signaling presents a parsimonious mechanism to account for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with insulin resistance.

### Imbalanced insulin actions in obesity and type 2 diabetes: key mouse models of insulin signaling pathway [^114Gatmp]. Cell Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR), researchers have been engaged in intensive efforts to resolve physiological functions of IR and its major downstream targets, insulin receptor substrate 1 (Irs1) and Irs2. Studies conducted using systemic and tissue-specific gene-knockout mice of IR, Irs1, and Irs2 have revealed the physiological roles of these molecules in each tissue and interactions among multiple tissues. In obesity and type 2 diabetes, selective downregulation of Irs2 and its downstream actions to cause reduced insulin actions was associated with increased insulin actions through Irs1 in variety tissues. Thus, we propose the novel concept of "organ- and pathway-specific imbalanced insulin action" in obesity and type 2 diabetes, which includes and extends "selective insulin resistance". This Review focuses on recent progress in understanding insulin signaling and insulin resistance using key mouse models for elucidating pathophysiology of human obesity and type 2 diabetes.

### Insulin matters: a practical approach to basal insulin management in type 2 diabetes [^112XiN6n]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Several factors underlie the importance of the initiative put forth by this expert panel: there is a rising prevalence of diabetes; half of the T2D population is not at target, among which 61% were receiving insulin therapy, suggesting delayed insulin initiation and intensification; there are multiple titration algorithms to choose from which adds to the confusion and complexity for patients and providers; and the arrival of new long-acting basal insulins and other pharmacological and technological advances that require consideration. This document was developed by a multidisciplinary panel to address frequently asked questions on insulin initiation and titration, and it establishes simple and practical guidelines for diabetes HCPs for effective initiation and titration of basal insulin, with the intent that it may translate to effective glycemic outcomes in clinical practice.

### Insulin lispro-aabc (Lyumjev) [^114tg7vS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of LYUMJEV is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin lispro-aabc, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. Receptor-bound insulin lowers glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhance protein synthesis.

### Insulin at 100: still central in protein-based therapy for chronic disease [^112AMYpc]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

At the centenary of the discovery of insulin, the medical and scientific communities pause to reflect on what the pancreatic hormone has meant not just for people with diabetes but indeed for medicine and science in general. As made clear by others, insulin instantly became a life-saving therapy for people with type 1 diabetes and has played a critical role to lower blood glucose and reduce late-stage complications in type 2 diabetes. However, it is equally worthwhile to think forward and consider the many novel developments that are in store, arguably as consequences of the learnings gained with insulin over the past 100 years. Here, we do just that based on a brief review of the key insulin-related achievements in medicine and science.

### Activation of the human insulin receptor by non-insulin-related peptides [^116sLDBr]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The human insulin receptor signalling system plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis. Insulin binding brings about extensive conformational change in the receptor extracellular region that in turn effects trans-activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains and downstream signalling. Of particular therapeutic interest is whether insulin receptor signalling can be replicated by molecules other than insulin. Here, we present single-particle cryoEM structures that show how a 33-mer polypeptide unrelated to insulin can cross-link two sites on the receptor surface and direct the receptor into a signalling-active conformation. The 33-mer polypeptide engages the receptor by two helical binding motifs that are each potentially mimicable by small molecules. The resultant conformation of the receptor is distinct from — but related to — those in extant three-dimensional structures of the insulin-complexed receptor. Our findings thus illuminate unexplored pathways for controlling the signalling of the insulin receptor as well as opportunities for development of insulin mimetics.

### Consensus recommendations on GLP-1 RA use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: south Asian task force [^115Mrv2T]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action of GLP-1

GLP-1 elicits protracted glucose-lowering in a glucose-dependent manner owing to its insulinotropic mechanism of action in pancreatic β-cells. In contrast, its non-insulinotropic action is marked by extra-pancreatic effects which might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of diabetes‐related complications and comorbidities presented independently of glycaemic control.

Insulinotropic Mechanism of Action

The insulinotropic activity of GLP-1 is (at least) partly exerted through interaction with the GLP-1 receptors located on the cell membrane of the β-cells. Figure 3 depicts the molecular mechanisms underlying the insulinotropic effects of GLP-1 along with a brief summary of the mechanism of action.

Fig. 3
Molecular mechanisms underlying insulinotropic effects of GLP-1. Binding of GLP-1 to GLP-1 receptors leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. Increased cAMP levels subsequently activate PKA and the cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor II (cAMP-GEFII, also known as Epac2). Activation of PKA leads to the closure of K ATP channels, thereby facilitating membrane depolarisation (1). PKA activation also leads to the inhibition of delayed rectifying K + (K v) channels, which is a negative regulator of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, thus resulting in prolongation of action potentials (2). Depolarisation results in the opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, leading to an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations (3). Increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations mobilise Ca 2+ from intracellular stores through PKA- and Epac2-dependent mechanisms (4). The increased Ca 2+ concentration leads to the events as follows: insulin-containing granules fuse with the plasma membrane and insulin is secreted from β-cells (5); Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ mobilisation from intracellular stores stimulates ATP synthesis in mitochondria which further enhances membrane depolarisation through K ATP channel closure (6); Transcription of the proinsulin gene is promoted (7); Activation of EPAC2 also increases the density of insulin-containing granules near the plasma membrane to potentiate insulin secretion from β-cells (8). cAMP cyclic adenosine monophosphate, GLP-1 glucagon-like peptide-1, PKA protein kinase A

### Insulin action and resistance are dependent on a GSK3 β-FBXW7-ERR α transcriptional axis [^1118T4As]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Humans have evolved to metabolically adapt to unpredictable diets by storing calories as fat when well-fed and burning fat during food shortage to maintain euglycemia. This intricate control upon fasting and feeding is predominantly governed by insulin, which is the primary glucose-lowering and fat-conserving hormone. Insulin is uniquely required for anabolic processes like lipogenesis, glycogenesis and protein synthesis in adipose, liver and muscle, and for simultaneous suppression of adipose lipolysis, hepatic glucose production, and protein breakdown. Insulin resistance instills when target tissues lose their responsiveness to the hormone and has long been considered to be central to the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Insulin resistance develops from defects in multiple tissues and the intracellular mechanisms are highly complex. While the molecular events underlying insulin action have been substantially studied, major gaps still persist in our full comprehension of the downstream mechanisms involved in insulin signaling. Given that many signaling pathways eventually converge at the transcriptional level, gene dysregulation is among one of the main causes of insulin resistance. Transcriptional regulation is crucial in the fasting-feeding transition by turning on and off thousands of genes involved in fuel metabolism. Indeed, transcription factors such as FoxO1 and SREBP1 have been identified as regulators of insulin action and participants in the progression of insulin resistance via their control of the expression of specific genes in glucogenic and lipogenic pathways.

### Insulin human (Myxredlin) [^113vhQrS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of insulin, including MYXREDLIN is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

MYXREDLIN is a short-acting insulin. The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different individuals, within the same individual, and different doses. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, euglycemic glucose clamp study described below, the average onset of action, defined as start of intravenous glucose infusion during the clamp, was approximately 21 minutes after starting of the intravenous infusion administration. The glucose infusion rate gradually increased to a maximum response of 13.7 mg/kg/min after 5 hours of human insulin infusion.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, euglycemic glucose clamp study, fifty eight healthy male subjects between 19 and 50 years of age received an intravenous infusion of either MYXREDLIN or another human insulin at 1 milliUnit/kg/min for 6 hours (0.36 units/kg total dose). On average, insulin concentrations of about 300 pM were attained approximately from 1.5 hours to 6 hours after starting intravenous infusion of MYXREDLIN, followed by a return to the baseline level 1.5 hours after stopping intravenous infusion.

Metabolism and Elimination

The mean terminal half-life from concentration data after stopping the intravenous infusion was estimated to be 23.4 minutes in healthy volunteers.

Specific Population

The effects of gender, age, obesity, renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of insulin human injection have not been studied.

### Metformin (metformin hydrochloride) [^114kWZzo]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.

### Role of insulin signaling in maintaining energy homeostasis [^111VAZ7c]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the role that insulin signaling plays in modulating metabolic functions involving both peripheral and hypothalamic systems.

Methods

We review the literature regarding insulin signaling as it relates to energy homeostasis.

Results

Insulin signaling in the periphery is known to affect hepatic glucose production and glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. In the brain, insulin is involved in a variety of signaling pathways that control positive and negative aspects of food intake and energy metabolism. Disruption of insulin signaling can affect key cellular pathways that serve to maintain energy balance and glucose homeostasis, which can then lead to insulin resistance and progression toward various metabolic disorders, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The use of exogenous insulin as therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes is traditionally associated with increases in weight.

Conclusion

An enhanced understanding of how these insulin signaling pathways function may provide answers about how to control weight gain associated with exogenous insulin use. Pharmacologic agents, such as the long-acting insulin analogues and particularly insulin detemir, that may reduce these weight effects hold considerable advantage.

### Impact of the mode of protraction of basal insulin therapies on their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and resulting clinical outcomes [^117A6Y9N]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

8 SUMMARY

Several mechanisms of protraction have been used to improve the PK/PD characteristics of basal insulins and all have resulted in prolonged action to varying extents. The early basal insulin analogues, IGlar U100 (precipitation) and IDet (dimerization and albumin binding), increased duration such that it approached a 24‐hour glucose‐lowering effect, and improved the level of day‐to‐day and intra‐patient variability in insulin action. Newer basal insulin analogues have used up‐concentration in addition to precipitation (IGlar U300), and multihexamer formation in addition to albumin binding (IDeg U100 and U200). The latter mechanism has resulted in a further increase in duration of action and decreased variability versus other available basal insulin therapies. Clinically, the major advantage of these analogues has been a reduction in hypoglycaemia with similar HbA1c control. The recent development of hepato‐preferential or very long‐acting (once‐weekly) insulins promises the potential to achieve further clinical improvements, but the safety of these new preparations and clinical applicability remains to be demonstrated.

### Insulins today and beyond [^115NqL2T]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The advent of insulin almost 80 years ago revolutionised treatment of diabetes and must be one of the most outstanding achievements of twentieth century medicine. Since then, there has been an ever-increasing awareness and acceptance of the need to achieve and sustain near-normoglycaemia to delay onset and retard progression of diabetic angiopathy. Physiological insulin replacement is therefore central to management of patients with diabetes who are unable to make insulin. Insulin formulations, treatment strategies, and methods and routes of delivery have changed much, with more and more options for monitoring the effect on blood glucose concentrations. Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes need insulin much more aggressively than previously. Parallel developments in glucose-sensing technologies are welcomed as an integral part of safe and optimum implementation of insulin replacement therapy.

### GLP-1 receptor activated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells: mechanism and glucose dependence [^114EqF4i]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Plasma glucose is tightly regulated by the coordinated actions of the pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon, which act in opposition to keep plasma glucose levels constant. Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) often experience β-cell failure leading to reduced production and secretion of insulin. The reduced insulin secretion is compounded by increased insulin resistance, excessive glucagon-mediated release of glucose from hepatic stores, and rapid glucose influx during meals. Together, the inability to maintain glucose homeostasis leads to a perpetual state of hyperglycaemia. Exogenous insulin or sulphonylurea (SU)-based therapies, while valuable in reducing hyperglycaemia, continue to act even after an ideal glucose concentration has been met and therefore pose the risk of over-correction and hypoglycaemia. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia can range from trembling and weakness to poor coordination and impaired cognition. Studies of the effects of hypoglycaemia on patient quality of life (QoL) suggest that QoL is reduced in patients experiencing moderate to profound hypoglycaemia compared to patients reporting mild or no symptoms of hypoglycaemia. In addition to unwanted symptoms, hypoglycaemia has been associated with QT interval prolongation, arrhythmias and other adverse cardiovascular events. Thus, hypoglycaemia is a significant clinical concern for patients with diabetes and minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia is important in any diabetes therapy.

The glucose-dependent T2D therapies such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, promote glucose control by minimizing both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1; 7–36 amide), an incretin hormone secreted by intestinal L-cells in response to glucose and other ingested nutrients, induces insulin secretion via the GLP-1R in a glucose-regulated manner. While effects of GLP-1R signalling, such as suppression of glucagon secretion, slowed gastric emptying, and increased satiety, are also involved in glucose control by GLP-1R agonists, pancreatic β-cell-mediated insulin secretion is the best characterized GLP-1R activity (for additional review see Ref.). The ability of GLP-1 and GLP-1R agonists to promote insulin secretion depends upon elevated blood glucose levels. As such, the activity of GLP-1 and its receptor agonists is self-limiting, ceasing when blood glucose levels fall in response to the secreted insulin. With the increasing use of GLP-1R agonists for treatment of T2D, a clarification of the current understanding of the mechanisms by which GLP-1 receptor signalling promotes insulin secretion and the dependence of this process on glucose is warranted.

### Metformin er 500 mg (metformin) [^1113iwPU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Chain splitting of insulin: an underlying mechanism of insulin resistance? [^111qrK3J]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite decades of intense research, the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance are still poorly understood. What if one of the major causes of insulin resistance is not related to defects in the target tissues and/or insulin receptor signaling, but rather to a reduced survival of endogenously secreted insulin on its way to activating the receptor on the cell surface of the target tissues? Here, we present data and lay out arguments in support of this novel hypothesis, which is fundamentally different from the common view that insulin resistance is caused by the body's cells becoming less sensitive to insulin.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^112w7L8G]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride combines two antidiabetic medications with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, and metformin hydrochloride, a biguanide. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas biguanides act primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Metformin hydrochloride

Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or healthy subjects [except in specific circumstances, [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Insulin and insulin analogs as antidiabetic therapy: a perspective from clinical trials [^113vDa1o]. Cell Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The discovery of insulin in 1921 and the progress achieved in the ensuing century highlight the promise and challenge of biochemically modifying the molecule to achieve optimization of its delivery and therapeutic efficacy. Normal endogenous insulin secretion consists of a highly orchestrated physiologic loop wherein multiple metabolic signals trigger the pancreatic β cells to secrete the precise amount of insulin into the portal system required to maintain euglycemia. Accordingly, in the treatment of diabetes, attempting to replicate this complex physiology with exogenous insulin therapy given subcutaneously presents a clinical challenge. In this context, recombinant DNA-based technology has enabled the development of insulin analogs that have been specifically designed to confer advantageous pharmacodynamic features that can better mimic endogenous insulin secretion. In this review, we discuss the development of the most widely available insulin preparations and provide evidence-based insight into their use in clinical practice.

### Pulsatile insulin secretion: detection, regulation, and role in diabetes [^111AxCRG]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

Insulin concentrations oscillate at a periodicity of 5–15 min per oscillation. These oscillations are due to coordinate insulin secretory bursts, from millions of islets. The generation of common secretory bursts requires strong within-islet and within-pancreas coordination to synchronize the secretory activity from the beta-cell population. The overall contribution of this pulsatile mechanism dominates and accounts for the majority of insulin release. This review discusses the methods involved in the detection and quantification of periodicities and individual secretory bursts. The mechanism by which overall insulin secretion is regulated through changes in the pulsatile component is discussed for nerves, metabolites, hormones, and drugs. The impaired pulsatile secretion of insulin in type 2 diabetes has resulted in much focus on the impact of the insulin delivery pattern on insulin action, and improved action from oscillatory insulin exposure is demonstrated on liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. Therefore, not only is the dominant regulation of insulin through changes in secretory burst mass and amplitude, but the changes may affect insulin action. Finally, the role of impaired pulsatile release in early type 2 diabetes suggests a predictive value of studies on insulin pulsatility in the development of this disease.

### Exenatide [^113nHdH4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and exhibit other antihyperglycemic actions following their release into the circulation from the gut. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cell, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.

The amino acid sequence of exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP-1. Exenatide has been shown to bind and activate the human GLP-1 receptor in vitro. This leads to an increase in both glucose-dependent synthesis of insulin, and in vivo secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells, by mechanisms involving cyclic AMP and/or other intracellular signaling pathways.

Exenatide improves glycemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes through the actions described below.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Glucose-Dependent Insulin Secretion

Exenatide has acute effects on pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose leading to insulin release predominantly in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia. However, exenatide does not impair the normal glucagon response to hypoglycemia.

First-Phase Insulin Response

In healthy individuals, robust insulin secretion occurs during the first 10 minutes following intravenous (IV) glucose administration. This secretion, known as the "first-phase insulin response", is characteristically absent in patients with type 2 diabetes. The loss of the first-phase insulin response is an early beta-cell defect in type 2 diabetes. Administration of exenatide at therapeutic plasma concentrations restored first-phase insulin response to an IV bolus of glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (Figure 1). Both first-phase insulin secretion and second-phase insulin secretion were significantly increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with exenatide compared with saline (p < 0.001 for both).

Figure 1: Mean (+SEM) Insulin Secretion Rate during Infusion of Exenatide or Saline in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and during Infusion of Saline in Healthy Subjects

Glucagon Secretion

In patients with type 2 diabetes, exenatide moderates glucagon secretion and lowers serum glucagon concentrations during periods of hyperglycemia. Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output and decreased insulin demand.

### Pharmacology, physiology, and mechanisms of incretin hormone action [^116ZQS81]. Cell Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Incretin peptides, principally GLP-1 and GIP, regulate islet hormone secretion, glucose concentrations, lipid metabolism, gut motility, appetite and body weight, and immune function, providing a scientific basis for utilizing incretin-based therapies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Activation of GLP-1 and GIP receptors also leads to nonglycemic effects in multiple tissues, through direct actions on tissues expressing incretin receptors and indirect mechanisms mediated through neuronal and endocrine pathways. Here we contrast the pharmacology and physiology of incretin hormones and review recent advances in mechanisms coupling incretin receptor signaling to pleiotropic metabolic actions in preclinical studies. We discuss whether mechanisms identified in preclinical studies have potential translational relevance for the treatment of human disease and highlight controversies and uncertainties in incretin biology that require resolution in future studies.

### The GLUT4 glucose transporter [^1174Qrjc]. Cell Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Few physiological parameters are more tightly and acutely regulated in humans than blood glucose concentration. The major cellular mechanism that diminishes blood glucose when carbohydrates are ingested is insulin-stimulated glucose transport into skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle both stores glucose as glycogen and oxidizes it to produce energy following the transport step. The principal glucose transporter protein that mediates this uptake is GLUT4, which plays a key role in regulating whole body glucose homeostasis. This review focuses on recent advances on the biology of GLUT4.

### Insulin resistance: metabolic mechanisms and consequences in the heart [^111GGCVD]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is a characteristic feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and impacts the heart in various ways. Impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake is a uniformly observed characteristic of the heart in these states, although changes in upstream kinase signaling are variable and dependent on the severity and duration of the associated obesity or diabetes mellitus. The understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological role of insulin resistance in the heart is evolving. To maintain its high energy demands, the heart is capable of using many metabolic substrates. Although insulin signaling may directly regulate cardiac metabolism, its main role is likely the regulation of substrate delivery from the periphery to the heart. In addition to promoting glucose uptake, insulin regulates long-chain fatty acid uptake, protein synthesis, and vascular function in the normal cardiovascular system. Recent advances in understanding the role of metabolic, signaling, and inflammatory pathways in obesity have provided opportunities to better understand the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in the heart. This review will summarize our current understanding of metabolic mechanisms for and consequences of insulin resistance in the heart and will discuss potential new areas for investigating novel mechanisms that contribute to insulin resistance in the heart.

### Insulin action in brain regulates systemic metabolism and brain function [^112XuA7r]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the discovery of insulin over 90 years ago, much progress has been made in unraveling the mechanism of insulin action and its physiological functions, especially in classic target tissues, such as liver, muscle, and fat. Over the past decade, work from our laboratory and others has shown that insulin action is also important in tissues previously thought to be insulin insensitive, including the brain, β-cell, and vascular endothelium. In this review, we will describe recent discoveries regarding insulin action in the brain, and illustrate how this can affect both the brain and peripheral metabolism. In addition, we will explore how insulin action in the brain can affect brain function and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

### FGF21 regulates metabolism through adipose-dependent and-independent mechanisms [^115q8sMe]. Cell Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

FGF21 is an endocrine hormone that regulates energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. The mechanism of FGF21 action and the tissues responsible for these effects have been controversial, with both adipose tissues and the central nervous system having been identified as the target site mediating FGF21-dependent increases in insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, and weight loss. Here we show that, while FGF21 signaling to adipose tissue is required for the acute insulin-sensitizing effects of FGF21, FGF21 signaling to adipose tissue is not required for its chronic effects to increase energy expenditure and lower body weight. Also, in contrast to previous studies, we found that adiponectin is dispensable for the metabolic effects of FGF21 in increasing insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. Instead, FGF21 acutely enhances insulin sensitivity through actions on brown adipose tissue. Our data reveal that the acute and chronic effects of FGF21 can be dissociated through adipose-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

### Insulin glargine (insulin glargine U-300) [^112Zofy3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.

### Insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: opportunities and challenges? [^111Rg2EU]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Given the continued interest in defining the optimal management of individuals with type 2 diabetes, the Editor of Diabetes Care convened a working party of diabetes specialists to examine this topic in the context of insulin therapy. This was prompted by recent new evidence on the use of insulin in such people. The group was aware of evidence that the benefits of insulin therapy are still usually offered late, and thus the aim of the discussion was how to define the optimal timing and basis for decisions regarding insulin and to apply these concepts in practice. It was noted that recent evidence had built upon that of the previous decades, together confirming the benefits and safety of insulin therapy, albeit with concerns about the potential for hypoglycemia and gain in body weight. Insulin offers a unique ability to control hyperglycemia, being used from the time of diagnosis in some circumstances, when metabolic control is disturbed by medical illness, procedures, or therapy, as well as in the longer term in ambulatory care. For those previously starting insulin, various other forms of therapy can be added later, which offer complementary effects appropriate to individual needs. Here we review current evidence and circumstances in which insulin can be used, consider individualized choices of alternatives and combination regimens, and offer some guidance on personalized targets and tactics for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.

### Hepatic insulin clearance in regulation of systemic insulin concentrations-role of carbohydrate and energy availability [^114XN2vL]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinemia is the hallmark of insulin resistance in obesity, and the relative importance of insulin clearance, insulin resistance, and insulin hypersecretion has been widely debated. On the basis of recent experimental evidence, we summarize existing evidence to suggest hepatic insulin clearance as a major and immediate regulator of systemic insulin concentrations responding within days to altered dietary energy and, in particular, carbohydrate intake. Hepatic insulin clearance seems to be closely associated with opposite alterations in hepatic lipid content and glucose production, providing a potential mechanistic link to hepatic insulin sensitivity. The molecular regulation of insulin clearance in the liver is likely to involve changes in insulin binding and receptor internalization in response to the dietary alterations, the molecular mechanisms of which await further research.

### Insulin degludec [^113JYVXq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Degludec, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin also inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. Insulin Degludec forms multi-hexamers when injected into the subcutaneous tissue resulting in a subcutaneous insulin degludec depot. The protracted time action profile of Insulin Degludec is predominantly due to delayed absorption of insulin degludec from the subcutaneous tissue to the systemic circulation and to a lesser extent due to binding of insulin-degludec to circulating albumin.

### New horizons: next-generation insulin analogues: structural principles and clinical goals [^115EL6hz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Design of "first-generation" insulin analogues over the past 3 decades has provided pharmaceutical formulations with tailored pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties. Application of a molecular tool kit-integrating protein sequence, chemical modification, and formulation-has thus led to improved prandial and basal formulations for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Although PK/PD changes were modest in relation to prior formulations of human and animal insulins, significant clinical advantages in efficacy (mean glycemia) and safety (rates of hypoglycemia) were obtained. Continuing innovation is providing further improvements to achieve ultrarapid and ultrabasal analogue formulations in an effort to reduce glycemic variability and optimize time in range. Beyond such PK/PD metrics, next-generation insulin analogues seek to exploit therapeutic mechanisms: glucose-responsive ("smart") analogues, pathway-specific ("biased") analogues, and organ-targeted analogues. Smart insulin analogues and delivery systems promise to mitigate hypoglycemic risk, a critical barrier to glycemic control, whereas biased and organ-targeted insulin analogues may better recapitulate physiologic hormonal regulation. In each therapeutic class considerations of cost and stability will affect use and global distribution. This review highlights structural principles underlying next-generation design efforts, their respective biological rationale, and potential clinical applications.

### Direct autocrine action of insulin on β-cells: does it make physiological sense? [^113akVbo]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

What concentrations of insulin are islet β-cells exposed to in vivo?

There is probably only one of two possibilities. Either the β-cells are bathing in a very high concentration of locally secreted insulin, or secreted insulin is rapidly dispensed into the circulation leaving the locality of an islet but then has to complete an entire lap around the body where it is cleared by other tissues before returning to the β-cells at a much lower concentration. The net result of these two possibilities would likely be the same. A direct autocrine biological effect of insulin on the β-cell in vivo is unlikely.

Why? Prolonged exposure to insulin, and/or high concentrations of insulin in all cells that express the insulin receptor effectively desensitizes the IRS signaling pathway downstream of the receptor as well as downregulates expression of insulin receptor itself. There is no reason to think the β-cell is any different. Internalization of the insulin receptor into an endosomal compartment, once insulin is bound contributes to this desensitization reducing the availability of cell-surface insulin receptors. Some desensitization mechanisms are normal physiological feedback inhibition aimed at preventing potentially harmful effects of prolonged exposure to insulin such as hypoglycemia and/or oncogenesis (Fig. 2). Once the insulin receptor is downregulated and downstream signaling desensitized, some time without insulin is needed to restore normal insulin sensitivity. Considering that the insulin receptor is ubiquitously expressed, such feedback inhibition mechanisms provide a dynamic means of locally controlling insulin receptor activity rather than a more complex regulation of controlling insulin receptor gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. Indeed, some believe that the chronic hyperinsulinemia found in obesity and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes can make a major contribution to the insulin-resistant state because of these desensitization mechanisms (Fig. 2).

### A stepwise activation model for the insulin receptor [^115hVeP8]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In this review, we describe IR structures and proposes a model to explain the early-stage IR activation mechanism. We focus mainly on the structural transition from an apo to a fully active single-insulin-bound IR under physiological conditions because several excellent reviews have discussed multiple-insulin-bound IR structures. We further address the biological and structural backgrounds of selective agonist-bound IRs and provide insights into the design of selective agonists and their clinical implications.

### Insulin action and resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes [^117Y9RRs]. Nature Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Nutritional excess is a major forerunner of type 2 diabetes. It enhances the secretion of insulin, but attenuates insulin's metabolic actions in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, conflicting evidence indicates a lack of knowledge of the timing of these events during the development of obesity and diabetes, pointing to a key gap in our understanding of metabolic disease. This Perspective reviews alternate viewpoints and recent results on the temporal and mechanistic connections between hyperinsulinemia, obesity and insulin resistance. Although much attention has addressed early steps in the insulin signaling cascade, insulin resistance in obesity seems to be largely elicited downstream of these steps. New findings also connect insulin resistance to extensive metabolic cross-talk between the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas and skeletal muscle. These and other advances over the past 5 years offer exciting opportunities and daunting challenges for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

### Insulin human (humulin) [^116Cb7c8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins, including HUMULIN R U-500. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhance protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In a euglycemic clamp study of 24 healthy obese subjects (BMI = 30–39 kg/m2), single doses of HUMULIN R U-500 at 50 units (0.4–0.6 unit/kg) and 100 units (0.8–1.3 unit/kg) resulted in a mean time of onset of action of less than 15 minutes at both doses and a mean duration of action of 21 hours (range 13–24 hours). The time action characteristics reflect both prandial and basal activity, consistent with clinical experience. This effect has been attributed to the high concentration of the preparation.

Figure 1 should be considered a representative example since the time course of action of insulin may vary in different individuals or within the same individual. The rate of insulin absorption and consequently the onset of activity is known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption — In a euglycemic clamp study of 24 healthy obese subjects, the median peak insulin level occurred between 4 hours (50 unit dose) and 8 hours (100 unit dose) with a range of 0.5–8 hours.

Metabolism — The uptake and degradation of insulin occurs predominantly in liver, kidney, muscle, and adipocytes, with the liver being the major organ involved in the clearance of insulin.

Elimination — Mean apparent half-life after subcutaneous administration of single doses of 50 units and 100 units to healthy obese subjects (N ≥ 21) was approximately 4.5 hours (range = 1.9–10 hours) for HUMULIN R U-500.

### Regulated membrane trafficking of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 in adipocytes [^111d2sn8]. Endocrine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of insulin roughly 80 yr ago, much has been learned about how target cells receive, interpret, and respond to this peptide hormone. For example, we now know that insulin activates the tyrosine kinase activity of its cell surface receptor, thereby triggering intracellular signaling cascades that regulate many cellular processes. With respect to glucose homeostasis, these include the function of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production and to increase glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissues, the latter resulting from the translocation of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the cell surface membrane. Although simple in broad outline, elucidating the molecular intricacies of these receptor-signaling pathways and membrane-trafficking processes continues to challenge the creative ingenuity of scientists, and many questions remain unresolved, or even perhaps unasked. The identification and functional characterization of specific molecules required for both insulin signaling and GLUT4 vesicle trafficking remain key issues in our pursuit of developing specific therapeutic agents to treat and/or prevent this debilitating disease process. To this end, the combined efforts of numerous research groups employing a range of experimental approaches has led to a clearer molecular picture of how insulin regulates the membrane trafficking of GLUT4.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact) [^114dSXoM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

DUETACT combines 2 antihyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and glimepiride, a member of the sulfonylurea class. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues that act primarily by stimulating release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Glimepiride

Glimepiride primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin.

### Insulin: too much of a good thing is bad [^116dGAQW]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin shares a limited physiological concentration range with other endocrine hormones. Not only too low, but also too high systemic insulin levels are detrimental for body functions.

Main Body

The physiological function and clinical relevance of insulin are usually seen in association with its role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. However, insulin is an anabolic hormone which stimulates a large number of cellular responses. Not only too low, but also excess insulin concentrations are detrimental to the physiological balance. Although the glucoregulatory activity of insulin is mitigated during hyperinsulinemia by dampening the efficiency of insulin signaling ("insulin resistance"), this is not the case for most other hormonal actions of insulin, including the promotion of protein synthesis, de novo lipogenesis, and cell proliferation; the inhibition of lipolysis, of autophagy-dependent cellular turnover, and of nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidative; and other defense mechanisms. Hence, there is no general insulin resistance but selective impairment of insulin signaling which causes less glucose uptake from the blood and reduced activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Because of the largely unrestricted insulin signaling, hyperinsulinemia increases the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease and decreases health span and life expectancy. In epidemiological studies, high-dose insulin therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Randomized controlled trials of insulin treatment did not observe any effect on disease risk, but these trials only studied low insulin doses up to 40IU/day. Proof for a causal link between elevated insulin levels and cardiovascular disease risk comes from Mendelian randomization studies comparing individuals with genetically controlled low or high insulin production.

Conclusions

The detrimental actions of prolonged high insulin concentrations, seen also in cell culture, argue in favor of a lifestyle that limits circadian insulin levels. The health risks associated with hyperinsulinemia may have implications for treatment regimens used in type 2 diabetes.

### Structural biology of insulin and IGF1 receptors: implications for drug design [^115FKacv]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — in which the body produces insufficient amounts of insulin or the insulin that is produced does not function properly to control blood glucose — is an increasingly common disorder. Prospective clinical studies have proven the benefits of tighter glucose control in reducing the frequency and severity of complications of the disease, leading to the advocation of earlier and more aggressive use of insulin therapy. Given the reluctance of patients with type 2 diabetes to inject themselves with insulin, orally active insulin mimetics would be a major therapeutic advance. Here, we discuss recent progress in understanding the structure-function relationships of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptors, their mechanism of activation and their implications for the design of insulin-receptor agonists for diabetes therapy and IGF1-receptor antagonists for cancer therapy.

### A single bout of one-legged exercise to local exhaustion decreases insulin action in nonexercised muscle leading to decreased whole-body insulin action [^116XPXUi]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

A single bout of exercise enhances insulin action in the exercised muscle. However, not all human studies find that this translates into increased whole-body insulin action, suggesting that insulin action in rested muscle or other organs may be decreased by exercise. To investigate this, eight healthy men underwent a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp on 2 separate days: one day with prior one-legged knee-extensor exercise to local exhaustion (∼2.5 h) and another day without exercise. Whole-body glucose disposal was ∼18% lower on the exercise day as compared with the resting day due to decreased (∼37%) insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the nonexercised muscle. Insulin signaling at the level of Akt2 was impaired in the nonexercised muscle on the exercise day, suggesting that decreased insulin action in nonexercised muscle may reduce GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin. Thus, the effect of a single bout of exercise on whole-body insulin action depends on the balance between local effects increasing and systemic effects decreasing insulin action. Physiologically, this mechanism may serve to direct glucose into the muscles in need of glycogen replenishment. For insulin-treated patients, this complex relationship may explain the difficulties in predicting the adequate insulin dose for maintaining glucose homeostasis following physical activity.

### Efficacy and safety of insulin in type 2 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111Nf9wW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Another well-known side effect of insulin-based regimen is weight gain, which secondarily increases insulin resistance.

The fact that insulin has shown no impact on clinically relevant outcomes is of major importance. Theoretically, insulin has potential negative clinical consequences, due to the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. From a patho-physiological point of view it is understandable that insulin is vital in the case of absolute insulin deficiency, such as type 1 diabetes. However, in T2D, where insulin resistance and high circulating levels of endogenous insulin are key concepts, the role of exogenous insulin is unclear. Observational studies have shown an association between endogenous insulin levels and cardiovascular risk, and do not seem to be in favour of exogenous insulin either. In a retrospective cohort study, insulin therapy was associated with an increase in total mortality, (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.75; 95%CI: 1.24 to 2.47 for low insulin exposure and HR = 2.79; 95%CI: 2.36 to 3.30 for high insulin exposure, compared to no exposure). Other observational studies suggest an increased risk of cancer. Our meta-analysis of RCTs shows no increase in deaths by cancer and cancer cases were not reported in many of the included studies. However, these results are to be taken with caution due to the possible lack of power of our meta-analysis. In vitro, the mitogenic effect of insulin is well established.

The underlying mechanism of the higher risk associated with insulin is unclear. Positive associations could be explained by confounding factors: patients with T2D using insulin are usually older, with a longer history of diabetes, more comorbidities, at higher cardiovascular risk and with greater insulin resistance. Although observational studies may partially adjust for these factors, residual confounding factors may be responsible for the reported associations. However, it is also possible that hypoglycaemia plays a role (via sympathoadrenal activation, abnormal cardiac repolarization, increased thrombogenesis, inflammation and vasoconstriction) or that a direct atherogenic/mitogenic effect exists (cell growth, differentiation and proliferation), or that there is another specific effect of insulin that remains unknown.

### Direct and indirect control of hepatic glucose production by insulin [^111b7Av6]. Cell Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

There is general agreement that the acute suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin is mediated by both a direct and an indirect effect on the liver. There is, however, no consensus regarding the relative magnitude of these effects under physiological conditions. Extensive research over the past three decades in humans and animal models has provided discordant results between these two modes of insulin action. Here, we review the field to make the case that physiologically direct hepatic insulin action dominates acute suppression of glucose production, but that there is also a delayed, second order regulation of this process via extrahepatic effects. We further provide our views regarding the timing, dominance, and physiological relevance of these effects and discuss novel concepts regarding insulin regulation of adipose tissue fatty acid metabolism and central nervous system (CNS) signaling to the liver, as regulators of insulin's extrahepatic effects on glucose production.

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride [^114d9U61]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride combines two antihyperglycemic agents: pioglitazone and metformin.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

Metformin hydrochloride

Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or healthy subjects [except in specific circumstances, see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.

### Mechanism of action of imeglimin: a novel therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes [^1156SqV7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Imeglimin is the first in a new tetrahydrotriazine‐containing class of oral antidiabetic agents referred to as 'glimins'. 1 Its discovery was enabled by an in vivo phenotypic screen (based on antihyperglycaemic activity in rodents), followed by additional chemical modification of a lead molecule (Figure 1 depicts the chemical structure). Imeglimin is under investigation, with three pivotal phase III clinical trials having been recently completed in Japan. Clinical experience with Imeglimin in Japanese and Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to date has shown significant and durable antihyperglycaemic activity, generally favourable safety and tolerability, and a lack of severe hypoglycaemia in multiple trials, including combinations with metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors, insulin and other classes. 1, 2, 3, 4

FIGURE 1
Chemical structure of Imeglimin hydrochloride salt

As described in this review, the mode of action of Imeglimin is unique and distinct compared with other major classes of therapeutic agents. It involves dual effects, both to enhance insulin action and to reverse pancreatic β‐cell dysfunction. 5 The mode of action of Imeglimin is generally well aligned with our current understanding of the pathophysiology of T2D. A genetic predisposition plus key environmental factors, principally overnutrition and reduced energy expenditure, are drivers of disease. 6 Consequently, defects in insulin action plus pancreatic islet β‐cell dysfunction develop and conspire to yield glucose intolerance and, subsequently, the onset of overt diabetes. 7, 8, 9

Insulin resistance occurs in several tissues including skeletal muscle 10 and in the liver, where the effect of insulin to suppress glucose production is attenuated. 11 Deficient β‐cell function is evident from a marked reduction in the acute insulin secretory response to glucose — both in vivo and in islets isolated from patients — and partial loss of the response to other stimuli including glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1). 8, 12, 13, 14 A clear loss of β‐cell mass has also been documented in humans with T2D. 15, 16

### Complications of diabetes therapy [^113L6LNq]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Current strategies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus promote individualized plans to achieve target glucose levels on a patient-by-patient basis while minimizing treatment related risks. Maintaining glycemic control over time is a significant challenge because of the progressive nature of diabetes as a result of declining β-cell function. This article identifies complications of non-insulin treatments for diabetes. The major classes of medications are reviewed with special focus on target population, mechanism of action, effect on weight, cardiovascular outcomes and additional class-specific side effects including effects on bone. Effects on β-cell function are also highlighted.

### Central nervous pathways of insulin action in the control of metabolism and food intake [^113b28ZH]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Insulin acts on the CNS to modulate behaviour and systemic metabolism. Disturbances in brain insulin action represent a possible link between metabolic and cognitive health. Current findings from human research suggest that boosting central insulin action in the brain modulates peripheral metabolism, enhancing whole-body insulin sensitivity and suppressing endogenous glucose production. Moreover, central insulin action curbs food intake by reducing the salience of highly palatable food cues and increasing cognitive control. Animal models show that the mesocorticolimbic circuitry is finely tuned in response to insulin, driven mainly by the dopamine system. These mechanisms are impaired in people with obesity, which might increase their risk of developing type 2 diabetes and associated diseases. Overall, current findings highlight the role of insulin action in the brain and its consequences on peripheral metabolism and cognition. Hence, improving central insulin action could represent a therapeutic option for people at an increased risk of developing metabolic and cognitive diseases.

### Pioglitazone (Actos) [^116B5S9v]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

ACTOS is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. ACTOS decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver.

### Direct autocrine action of insulin on β-cells: does it make physiological sense? [^113jd9o9]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

FIG. 2.
Feedback inhibition of IRS signaling cascade pathways. Once insulin has activated IRS signal transduction pathways in cells, after a period of time there are internal physiological feedback inhibition signals (indicated by red arrows) that ensure that the "insulin signal" is not chronically sustained. Under hyperinsulinemic conditions, this feedback results in chronic desensitization of IRS signal transduction and contributes to the insulin-resistant state. Downstream activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases-1 and -2 (Erk-1/2) (as described in Fig. 1) can lead to Erk-1/2 protein kinase–mediated serine phosphorylation (pS) of IRS-1/2, which results in dissociation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1/2 interaction together with IRS-1/2 degradation. This is one route of delayed feedback inhibition of insulin signaling. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) activation can result in downstream activation atypical protein kinase-C (PKC) isoforms, such as PKC ζ, which can also serine phosphorylate (pS) IRS-1/2 to promote their degradation, representing another route of delayed feedback inhibition for insulin signal transduction. In contrast, protein kinase-B (PKB; also known as Akt) can serine phosphorylate IRS-1/2 at alternative sites to stabilize IRS-1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation state and thus enhance downstream signaling. However, PKB-mediated phosphorylation activation of some of its other substrates can have a more dominant-negative feedback effect on IRS signaling. Both target of rapamycin complex-1 (TORC1) and p70 S6-ribosomal kinase (p70 S6K) (the latter amplified by PDK1 phosphorylation) can serine phosphorylate IRS-1/2 to promote their degradation, which then dampens IRS signaling. This denotes a third route for delayed feedback inhibition of insulin signaling. A fourth route may be via the Src-homology domain–tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2), which upon binding to certain phosphotyrosine residues on IRS-1/2 becomes activated and can then remove phosphate from phosphotyrosines on IRS-1/2, thus dampening downstream signaling. FoxO1 and -3a have been shown to be critical factors for driving IRS-2 expression under basal conditions, especially FoxO3a in β-cells. But when IRS signaling is triggered by insulin, FoxO1/3a transcriptional activity is inactivated, resulting in another route of temporal feedback inhibition by decreasing IRS-2 expression. Several of these IRS signaling feedback mechanisms have indeed been shown to be present in pancreatic β-cells. Another consideration for feedback inhibition of insulin action is that when insulin binds to its receptor, the insulin/insulin receptor complex is internalized into the cell where it dissociates in an endosomal compartment, allowing the "free" insulin receptor to return to the surface. When insulin levels are high, this cycle is biased toward there being minimal insulin receptors on the surface of the cell with the majority being internalized, and acts as an additional physiological mechanism to prevent prolonged activation of IRS signal transduction by insulin. Under chronic hyperinsulinemia, insulin receptor internalization makes a contribution to insulin resistance. This long-term hyperinsulinemia also leads to downregulation of insulin receptor gene expression by a mechanism not yet well defined.

### Insulin action in adipocytes, adipose remodeling, and systemic effects [^114PnTYe]. Cell Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

On this 100 th anniversary of the discovery of insulin, we recognize the critical role that adipocytes, which are exquisitely responsive to insulin, have played in determining the mechanisms for insulin action at the cellular level. Our understanding of adipose tissue biology has evolved greatly, and it is now clear that adipocytes are far more complicated than simple storage depots for fat. A growing body of evidence documents how adipocytes, in response to insulin, contribute to the control of whole-body nutrient homeostasis. These advances highlight adipocyte plasticity, heterogeneity, and endocrine function, unique features that connect adipocyte metabolism to the regulation of other tissues important for metabolic homeostasis (e.g., liver, muscle, pancreas).

### Clinical review 125: the insulin receptor and its cellular targets [^112SQJvL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

The pleiotropic actions of insulin are mediated by a single receptor tyrosine kinase. Structure/function relationships of the insulin receptor have been conclusively established, and the early steps of insulin signaling are known in some detail. A generally accepted paradigm is that insulin receptors, acting through insulin receptor substrates, stimulate the lipid kinase activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The rapid rise in Tris-phosphorylated inositol (PIP(3)) that ensues triggers a cascade of PIP(3)-dependent serine/threonine kinases. Among the latter, Akt (a product of the akt protooncogene) and atypical protein kinase C isoforms are thought to be involved in insulin regulation of glucose transport and oxidation; glycogen, lipid, and protein synthesis; and modulation of gene expression. The presence of multiple insulin-regulated, PIP(3)-dependent kinases is consistent with the possibility that different pathways are required to regulate different biological actions of insulin. Additional work remains to be performed to understand the distal components of insulin signaling. Moreover, there exists substantial evidence for insulin receptor substrate- and/or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent pathways of insulin action. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to provide clues to the pathogenesis and treatment of the insulin resistant state that is characteristic of type 2 diabetes.

### Domain-dependent effects of insulin and IGF-1 receptors on signalling and gene expression [^112WHNyW]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signalling pathways are closely related and well conserved throughout evolution. Insulin binds with high affinity to the insulin receptor (IR), while IGF-1 binds with highest affinity to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R). For both receptors, ligand binding activates intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity and downstream signalling cascades, which in turn regulate gene transcription, glucose, lipid and protein metabolism as well as cell growth and differentiation. Despite the high degree of receptor homology and the use of almost identical intracellular pathways, the biological processes regulated by these two signalling pathways are strikingly distinct. Mutations in the IR in humansor knockout of the IR in miceresult in severe hyperglycaemia, usually without major growth defects, whereas humans with mutations in the IGF1Ror mice lacking IGF1Rshow severe growth retardation, but no major disturbance in glucose homoeostasis. These results, along with studies in vitro, demonstrate that IR primarily mediates metabolic effects, while IGF1R is more involved in the mitogenic control.

Understanding the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the functional differences between IR and IGF1R is quite challenging. Overall, IR and IGF1R share more than 50% sequence homology and over 80% homology in the intracellular kinase domain. Both insulin and IGF-1 are able to bind to and activate each other's receptors, albeit with reduced affinity, and both IR and IGF1R also elicit common downstream signalling with phosphorylation of a family of IR substrates and activation of two major downstream signalling pathways, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway and the Shc-Ras-MAPK pathway. Separating the actions of these two hormones is even more difficult since one α/β heterodimer of the IR can disulfide bond to one α/β heterodimer of the IGF1R to form hybrid IR/IGF1R receptors, which can also bind both insulin and IGF-1 and elicit signalling events.

### Insulin glulisine (Apidra) [^114NyQZD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs, including insulin glulisine. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis and enhance protein synthesis.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

Studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that APIDRA has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously.

In a study in patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 20), the glucose-lowering profiles of APIDRA and regular human insulin were assessed at various times in relation to a standard meal at a dose of 0.15 units/kg (see Figure 1).

The maximum blood glucose excursion (ΔGLUmax; baseline subtracted glucose concentration) for APIDRA injected 2 minutes before a meal was 65 mg/dL compared to 64 mg/dL for regular human insulin injected 30 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1A), and 84 mg/dL for regular human insulin injected 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1B). The maximum blood glucose excursion for APIDRA injected 15 minutes after the start of a meal was 85 mg/dL compared to 84 mg/dL for regular human insulin injected 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1C).

Figure 1: Serial mean blood glucose collected up to 6 hours following a single dose of APIDRA and regular human insulin. APIDRA given 2 minutes (APIDRA - pre) before the start of a meal compared to regular human insulin given 30 minutes (Regular - 30 min) before start of the meal (see Figure 1A) and compared to regular human insulin (Regular - pre) given 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1B). APIDRA given 15 minutes (APIDRA - post) after start of a meal compared to regular human insulin (Regular - pre) given 2 minutes before a meal (see Figure 1C). On the x-axis, zero (0) is the start of a 15-minute meal.

In a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study, 16 healthy male subjects received an intravenous infusion of APIDRA or regular human insulin with saline diluent at a rate of 0.8 milliunits/kg/min for two hours. Infusion of the same dose of APIDRA or regular human insulin produced equivalent glucose disposal at steady state.

### Insulin and neurodegenerative disease: shared and specific mechanisms [^111j4joy]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

Insulin has functions in the brain and dysregulation of these functions may contribute to the expression of late-life neurodegenerative disease. We provide a brief summary of research on the influence of insulin on normal brain function. We then review evidence that perturbation of this role may contribute to the symptoms and pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. We conclude by considering whether insulin dysregulation contributes to neurodegenerative disorders through disease-specific or general mechanisms.

### Central regulation of glucose metabolism in an insulin-dependent and-independent manner [^1141wykD]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

The central nervous system (CNS) contributes significantly to glucose homeostasis. The available evidence indicates that insulin directly acts on the CNS, in particular the hypothalamus, to regulate hepatic glucose production, thereby controlling whole-body glucose metabolism. Additionally, insulin also acts on the brain to regulate food intake and fat metabolism, which may indirectly regulate glucose metabolism. Studies conducted over the last decade have found that the CNS can regulate glucose metabolism in an insulin-independent manner. Enhancement of central leptin signalling reverses hyperglycaemia in insulin-deficient rodents. Here, I review the mechanisms by which central insulin and leptin actions regulate glucose metabolism. Although clinical studies have shown that insulin treatment is currently indispensable for managing diabetes, unravelling the neuronal mechanisms underlying the central regulation of glucose metabolism will pave the way for the design of novel therapeutic drugs for diabetes.

### Insulin as a neuroendocrine hormone [^116dCXKv]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

The year 2021 marks 100 years since the discovery of insulin and this Special Issue of the Journal of Neuroendocrinology was conceived as a way to mark that historic breakthrough. The discovery of insulin and its subsequent use in the treatment of diabetes is one of the most striking success stories in biomedical research. From a neuroendocrinology perspective, the recognition that insulin also exerts widespread and varied actions in the brain is more recent, but potentially also of equal importance with relevance for conditions ranging from obesity to dementia. The reviews contained in this Special Issue were selected to cover the range of known actions of insulin in neuroendocrine function, and also to highlight areas where further understanding of insulin actions in the brain hold great promise for further improvements in human health.

### Oral insulin: the rationale for this approach and current developments [^111wJF1Q]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Insulin remains the most effective and durable hypoglycemic agent for the treatment of diabetes. The addition of an effective oral insulin dosage form to the antidiabetes armamentarium may have significant benefits in terms of fostering compliance and adherence among patients, as well as physiologic advantages due to the fact that such a dosage form replicates the natural route of insulin secretion and absorption through the portal vein and targets the liver directly. Several companies have developed technological platforms that protect polypeptides and proteins from enzymatic hydrolysis, enable their transport across the epithelial lining, and promote their absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. A review of the potential physiological rationale and advantages, as well as of current pertinent technologies used specifically with insulin, is herewith provided.

### Selective insulin and leptin resistance in metabolic disorders [^111FeqeE]. Cell Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity represents a major risk factor for the development of insulin and leptin resistance, ultimately leading to a pleiotropic spectrum of metabolic alterations. However, resistance to both hormones does not uniformly affect all target cells and intracellular signaling pathways. In contrast, numerous clinical phenotypes arise from selective hormone resistance, leading to inhibition of defined intracellular signaling pathways in some tissues, while in other cell types hormone action is maintained or even overactivated. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms and clinical outcomes resulting from selective insulin and leptin resistance, which should ultimately guide future strategies for the treatment of obesity-associated diseases.

### Oral insulin [^116JpKLn]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin has saved the lives of countless people, since its discovery in 1922. However, the difficulties associated with subcutaneous administration, need for frequent self monitoring of glucose, and non-physiological action profiles of insulin prompted many physicians (and their patients!) to ask for non-injectable methods of insulin delivery.

The first oral insulin preparations were tried, with poor results, by Joslin, in 1922 and 1923. Since then, many researchers have worked on this concept, with no success.

Currently, however, a few insulin molecules designed for oral administration are in clinical trials, and promise to reach clinical use soon. This review analyses the current status of oral insulin. It focuses only on those preparations which are actively being worked on, and does not cover methodologies on which work has stopped. Clinical data on this topic is relatively scarce, and this explains the short length of the review.

### Dissecting multiple steps of GLUT4 trafficking and identifying the sites of insulin action [^112SMj1T]. Cell Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is central to glucose homeostasis. Functional assays to distinguish individual steps in the GLUT4 translocation process are lacking, thus limiting progress toward elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism. Here we have developed a robust method, which relies on dynamic tracking of single GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) in real time, for dissecting and systematically analyzing the docking, priming, and fusion steps of GSVs with the cell surface in vivo. Using this method, we have shown that the preparation of GSVs for fusion competence after docking at the surface is a key step regulated by insulin, whereas the docking step is regulated by PI3K and its downstream effector, the Rab GAP AS160. These data show that Akt-dependent phosphorylation of AS160 is not the major regulated step in GLUT4 trafficking, implicating alternative Akt substrates or alternative signaling pathways downstream of GSV docking at the cell surface as the major regulatory node.

### The cellular fate of glucose and its relevance in type 2 diabetes [^113ZsRdA]. Endocrine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a complex disorder with diminished insulin secretion and insulin action contributing to the hyperglycemia and wide range of metabolic defects that underlie the disease. The contribution of glucose metabolic pathways per se in the pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. The cellular fate of glucose begins with glucose transport and phosphorylation. Subsequent pathways of glucose utilization include aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, glycogen formation, and conversion to other intermediates in the hexose phosphate or hexosamine biosynthesis pathways. Abnormalities in each pathway may occur in diabetic subjects; however, it is unclear whether perturbations in these may lead to diabetes or are a consequence of the multiple metabolic abnormalities found in the disease. This review is focused on the cellular fate of glucose and relevance to human type 2 diabetes.

### Insulin resistance, adipose depots and gut: interactions and pathological implications [^111yb5Gp]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

This review article focuses on the many metabolic actions of insulin at the level of muscle, liver and adipose tissue. In terms of pathogenetic mechanisms, the condition of insulin resistance is complex, as multiple genetic and environmental factors, among which an increasingly sedentary lifestyle associated with high-fat diet, mutually interact according to variable patterns in time in any given individual. It is well recognized that obesity (in particular abdominal obesity) favours the development of insulin resistance. Here we evaluate the impact of obesity and ectopic fat accumulation (visceral and hepatic) on insulin resistance at the level of different target organs, i.e., muscle, liver and adipose tissue. The roles of the gut and the liver, in particular of bile acids and gut microflora, are also discussed as possible determinants of energy balance and glucose metabolism.

### Assessment of insulin action on carbohydrate metabolism: physiological and non-physiological methods [^112baiJr]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Carbohydrate metabolism in humans is regulated by insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and glucose disposal by insulin-sensitive tissues. Insulin facilitates glucose utilization in peripheral tissues and suppresses hepatic glucose production. Any defects in insulin action predispose an individual to glucose intolerance and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Early detection of defects in insulin action could provide opportunities to prevent or delay progression of the disease state. There are different approaches to assess insulin action. Initial methods, such as peripheral insulin concentration and simple indices, have several limitations. Subsequently, researchers developed methodologies using intravenous glucose infusion to determine glucose fluxes. However, these methodologies are limited by being non-physiological. Newer, innovative techniques that have been developed are more sophisticated and physiological. By modelling glucose kinetics using isotope dilution techniques, several robust parameters can be obtained that are physiologically relevant and sound. This brief review summarizes most of the non-physiological and physiological methodologies used to measure the variables of insulin action.

### Development of insulin and its pharmacology and perioperative use: a narrative review [^115cNSy5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of action of insulin

Insulin is a peptide anabolic hormone produced by β-cells of the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas. It has several effects depending on plasma concentration. At the lowest concentrations it switches off ketone production, then stops hepatic gluconeogenesis (i.e. prevents glucose rising). At higher plasma concentrations it then allows for cellular glucose uptake, then glycogen synthesis, and is finally an anabolic hormone. Insulin resistance will lead to reduced insulin sensitivity and altered metabolic states, whereas absolute absence of insulin will cause a catabolic state and promote ketogenesis.

### Pioglitazone [^113BTY9i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.

In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin- dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.

Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.

### Cardiovascular actions of insulin [^111FYnYr]. Endocrine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Insulin has important vascular actions to stimulate production of nitric oxide from endothelium. This leads to capillary recruitment, vasodilation, increased blood flow, and subsequent augmentation of glucose disposal in classical insulin target tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent insulin-signaling pathways regulating endothelial production of nitric oxide share striking parallels with metabolic insulin-signaling pathways. Distinct MAPK-dependent insulin-signaling pathways (largely unrelated to metabolic actions of insulin) regulate secretion of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 from endothelium. These and other cardiovascular actions of insulin contribute to coupling metabolic and hemodynamic homeostasis under healthy conditions. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in insulin-resistant individuals. Insulin resistance is typically defined as decreased sensitivity and/or responsiveness to metabolic actions of insulin. This cardinal feature of diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia is also a prominent component of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis that are all characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Conversely, endothelial dysfunction is often present in metabolic diseases. Insulin resistance is characterized by pathway-specific impairment in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling that in vascular endothelium contributes to a reciprocal relationship between insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. The clinical relevance of this coupling is highlighted by the findings that specific therapeutic interventions targeting insulin resistance often also ameliorate endothelial dysfunction (and vice versa). In this review, we discuss molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular actions of insulin, the reciprocal relationships between insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, and implications for developing beneficial therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

### The insulin signalling network [^112ARnmu]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Insulin signalling is a central regulator of metabolism, orchestrating nutrient homeostasis and coordinating carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism. This network operates through dynamic, tightly regulated protein phosphorylation events involving key kinases such as AKT, shaping cellular responses with remarkable precision. Advances in phosphoproteomics have expanded our understanding of insulin signalling, revealing its intricate regulation and links to disease, particularly cardiometabolic disease. Major insights, such as the mechanisms of AKT activation and the influence of genetic and environmental factors, have emerged from studying this network. In this Review, we examine the architecture of insulin signalling, focusing on its precise temporal regulation. We highlight AKT's central role in insulin action and its vast substrate repertoire, which governs diverse cellular functions. Additionally, we explore feedback and crosstalk mechanisms, such as insulin receptor substrate protein signalling, which integrates inputs through phosphorylation at hundreds of distinct sites. Crucially, phosphoproteomics has uncovered complexities in insulin-resistant states, where network rewiring is characterized by disrupted phosphorylation and the emergence of novel sites that are absent in healthy cells. These insights redefine insulin signalling and its dysfunction, highlighting new therapeutic opportunities.

### Lipid sensing and insulin resistance in the brain [^1137nWMq]. Cell Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Lipid sensing and insulin signaling in the brain independently triggers a negative feedback system to lower glucose production and food intake. Here, we discuss the underlying molecular and neuronal mechanisms of lipid sensing and insulin signaling in the hypothalamus and how these mechanisms are affected in response to high-fat feeding. We propose that high-fat feeding concurrently disrupts hypothalamic insulin-signaling and lipid-sensing mechanisms and that experiments aimed to restore both insulin action and lipid sensing in the brain could effectively lower glucose production and food intake to restore metabolic homeostasis in type 2 diabetes and obesity.

### Lighting up insulin action [^116jhnXn]. Diabetic Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Understanding the mechanism of insulin action remains one of the most important challenges in modern medical biology. Recent advances in cell imaging techniques, increased processing power of computers and the internet, and the introduction of novel fluorescent reagents such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) have revolutionized our ability to scrutinize insulin action by time-lapse microscopy at the single-cell level. This article outlines some of the advances made in the authors' laboratory, with particular reference to imaging the movements of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, and the generation of phosphoinositide lipids.

### Genome-wide association study and functional characterization identifies candidate genes for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake [^111m7EH7]. Nature Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Distinct tissue-specific mechanisms mediate insulin action in fasting and postprandial states. Previous genetic studies have largely focused on insulin resistance in the fasting state, where hepatic insulin action dominates. Here we studied genetic variants influencing insulin levels measured 2 hours after a glucose challenge in > 55,000 participants from three ancestry groups. We identified 10 novel loci (P < 5x10–8) not previously associated with post-challenge insulin resistance, 8 of which were shown to share their genetic architecture with type 2 diabetes in colocalization analyses. We investigated candidate genes at a subset of associated loci in cultured cells and identified 9 candidate genes newly implicated in the expression or trafficking of GLUT4, the key glucose transporter in postprandial glucose uptake in muscle and fat. By focusing on post-prandial insulin resistance, we highlight mechanisms of action at T2D loci that are not adequately captured by studies of fasting glycaemic traits.

### Insulin lispro (Admelog) [^117Xfw7p]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro products. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis and enhance protein synthesis.

### Direct autocrine action of insulin on β-cells: does it make physiological sense? [^1145vxFE]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Does insulin affect insulin secretion?

As previously noted, there is an in vivo temporal negative feedback of insulin on stimulated insulin secretion that is mediated via the CNS in humans. However, there is an intriguing suggestion that insulin may also have a positive effect to enhance its own secretion. Corroborating evidence for this has been indicated in humans in vivo. But an alternative explanation could be that the effect was mainly mediated via alleviating the negative feedback of insulin through the CNS, as previously discussed. Yet, the majority of studies arguing for a positive autocrine effect of insulin to drive insulin secretion have been conducted in vitro where central control no longer operates, or in transgenic mouse models where a primary effect of insulin in the CNS to which β-cells act secondarily cannot be ruled out. Thus, an in vivo positive autocrine effect of insulin on the β-cell remains questionable. But in our minds, a feed-forward positive effect of insulin on insulin secretion from the β-cell does not make sense physiologically. If this were the case, the more insulin secreted the bigger the autocrine stimulus would be for further insulin secretion, which would forever be increasing with time and eventually have serious deleterious consequences. In this scenario, it would be difficult to see how insulin secretion would be efficiently shut off to critically avoid hypoglycemia. One could consider the temporal feedback loops in insulin signaling (Fig. 2), or "natural" protective insulin resistance, would be expected to control this, but such built-in "off mechanisms" take time (a few hours) to be effective. In contrast, it is established that upon removal of a stimulus, such as glucose, insulin secretion returns to basal levels in minutes. As such, in the in vivo physiological context, it seems unlikely that insulin itself will modulate local insulin secretion.

### Selective insulin receptor modulators (SIRM): a new class of antidiabetes drugs? [^111FFfte]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a complex disease that causes life-threatening complications and often requires life-long treatment. In the last few decades, drugs with different antidiabetes mechanisms have become available. These drugs include insulin-sensitizers (metformin and glitazones), secretagogues (sulphonylureas and incretins), and insulin-mimetics (both short- and long-acting analogs). These therapeutic tools have facilitated more tailored and efficacious therapy. When pancreatic insulin secretion is insufficient or absent, the injection of exogenous insulin or an insulin analog is the only available treatment to activate insulin receptors and restore the biological effects of insulin on target cells. This treatment, however, is associated with hypoglycemia, weight gain, and excess mitogenic activity that may promote the progression of pre-existing subclinical cancers. In these patients, an ideal treatment would activate the insulin receptor and replicate the beneficial metabolic actions of insulin, without causing adverse effects.

### Insulin therapy and cancer [^115PUqe8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

METHODS

Literature searching for this review was not systematic. Search terms around insulin, malignancy, and cancer and narrowed for specific areas to observational studies, randomized controlled trials, insulin therapy, growth promotion, and insulin analog(ue)s still revealed very large numbers of sources in the literature (> 2,000,000), from which the reviewer then selected, with potential bias, papers of higher quality or interest and those more often quoted by other authors and supported by studies referred to from the initially identified reports.

In handling the evidence, I attempt to take the data from a study in the context of prior knowledge and asks the question, "How does this study shift the probability that such and such an effect is real to the extent that it should help determine routine clinical practice or promote further research activity?" The limitations of the available literature restrict the conclusions that can be made, as in any scientific review.

### Evidence against a physiologic role for acute changes in CNS insulin action in the rapid regulation of hepatic glucose production [^111ToC7a]. Cell Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This Perspective will discuss the physiologic relevance of data that suggest CNS insulin action is required for the rapid suppression of hepatic glucose production. It will also review data from experiments on the conscious dog, which show that although the canine brain can sense insulin and, thereby, regulate hepatic glucoregulatory enzyme expression, CNS insulin action is not essential for the rapid suppression of glucose production caused by the hormone. Insulin's direct hepatic effects are dominant, thus it appears that insulin's central effects are redundant in the acute regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism.

### Insulin aspart injection (fiasp) [^111o4p9F]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The primary activity of FIASP is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin aspart, the active ingredient in FIASP, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. Receptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by facilitating cellular uptake of glucose into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and by inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The average pharmacodynamic profile (i.e., glucose lowering effect measured as glucose infusion rate (GIR) in a euglycemic clamp study) for subcutaneous administration of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 unit/kg of FIASP in 46 patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus is shown in Figure 2 and key characteristics of the timing of the effect are described in Table 6 below.

Table 6. Timing of insulin effect (i.e., mean pharmacodynamic effect) after subcutaneous administration of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 unit/kg of FIASP in patients (N = 46) with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and corresponding to the data shown in Figure 2

Figure 2. Mean insulin effect (i.e., mean pharmacodynamic effect) over time after subcutaneous administration of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 unit/kg of FIASP in patients (N = 46) with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

On average, the pharmacodynamic effects of FIASP, measured as area under the glucose infusion rate-time curve (AUCGIR), was 697 mg/kg, 1406 mg/kg, and 2427 mg/kg following administration of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 unit/kg of FIASP.

The day-to-day variability in glucose-lowering-effect of FIASP within patients was ~18% for total glucose lowering (AUCGIR, 0–12h) and ~19% for maximum glucose lowering effect (GIRmax).

### Insulin-driven PI3K-AKT signaling in the hepatocyte is mediated by redundant PI3K α and PI3K β activities and is promoted by RAS [^112PqhtF]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activity is aberrant in tumors, and PI3K inhibitors are investigated as cancer therapeutics. PI3K signaling mediates insulin action in metabolism, but the role of PI3K isoforms in insulin signaling remains unresolved. Defining the role of PI3K isoforms in insulin signaling is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of insulin action and to develop PI3K inhibitors with optimal therapeutic index. We show that insulin-driven PI3K-AKT signaling depends on redundant PI3Kα and PI3Kβ activities, whereas PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ are largely dispensable. We have also found that RAS activity promotes AKT phosphorylation in insulin-stimulated hepatocytes and that promotion of insulin-driven AKT phosphorylation by RAS depends on PI3Kα. These findings reveal the detailed mechanism by which insulin activates AKT, providing an improved mechanistic understanding of insulin signaling. This improved model for insulin signaling predicts that isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors discriminating between PI3Kα and PI3Kβ should be dosed below their hyperglycemic threshold to achieve isoform selectivity.

### Network medicine-travelling with the insulin receptor: encounter of the second type [^113gnruG]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

4 Perspectives

We now know that hyperglycemia can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors that affect circulating insulin concentration or action. The liver is a major organ that controls insulin action on metabolic homeostasis. Circulating glucose availability is regulated through the insulin dependent reversible storage of glucose and glycogen as well as increased lipogenesis with canonical insulin signaling pathways. Since approximately 50% of the insulin secreted by the pancreas is removed after its first pass by the liver before reaching the peripheral circulation, hepatic extraction through insulin-mediated endocytosis is also viewed as an adaptive mechanism that could relieve the stress on pancreatic β-cells imposed by insulin resistance. Alternatively or in addition, a moderate chronic hyperinsulinemia due to a reduction in insulin clearance may be the primary mechanism resulting in insulin resistance. How the identification of a T2D disease module hidden in the close neighborhood of the internalized IR can be of importance for a better understanding of the primary mechanism of the disease, precision medicine and new drug therapy? A priori, hepatic endosomes might not be the best place to find a module as, consistent with a beta cell-centric classification model, the T2D genetic risk is indeed more associated with reduced beta cell function. This suggests a disease model where T2D cases lie across a continuous distribution with regard to beta cell dysfunction versus insulin resistance aetiologies. At the opposite end of the spectrum, obese cases presumably need fewer diabetes risk variants to push them towards diabetes, as they are already under strain from the modern physiological impact of obesity and insulin resistance. The T2D disease module clearly fits in this model as it contains elements related with the T1D, islets physiology, and also new signaling pathways that are more related with insulin resistance, trafficking and metabolism. What is the relationship of these noncanonical pathways found in the T2D disease module and other pathways? Insulin resistance may be viewed as an evolutionary conserved homeostatic response favoring catabolism over anabolism in the conditions of overnutrition. This is not favored by the fact that the adipocyte becomes also insulin resistant overtime leading to several late complication including lipid accumulation elsewhere and subsequent insidious signaling consequences including inflammatory processes. Insulin resistance could also result from pathological activated kinases that are unrelated with the normal insulin response (e.g. PKCs, JNK) but similar enough to the kinases mediating normal negative feedback. This could only have occurred if the actual overnutrition state rarely or never appeared in the evolutionary history to not exert selective pressure against the use of unrelated signaling elements. Several evidence indicate the pathways identified in the T2D disease module belong to the first category as they are highly associated with the genetic disease risk. Their evolutionary conservation is reminiscent, for example, of the integrated stress response (ISR), which is an organelle homeostatic response, that can be modulated by a small interactor (ISRIB) with the potential for future therapy of complex diseases. Insulin resistance might be also an essential endosomal response that limit anabolic processes to nutrient oversupply.

### The evolution of insulin and how it informs therapy and treatment choices [^115xAoFE]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Physiological Insulin Secretion

Normal physiologic insulin secretion includes both a continuous basal (low-level) insulin secretion and an incremental postprandial secretion associated with meals. For endogenous insulin, there is a feedback mechanism controlling insulin secretion based on changes in the blood glucose level sensed by the pancreatic islets and other tissues. When insulin is injected exogenously, there is no such feedback loop to make the adjustment to the doses. In order to adjust exogenous insulin, one needs to measure blood glucose and carbohydrate intake, which would then guide insulin doses.

Early insulin replacement therapy required multiple daily injections of 1 type of insulin only, with the risk of over or undershooting the immediate requirement. This situation was complicated by the lack of home blood glucose monitoring technology, an advance that did not come until the late 1970s. There was a recognized need for longer-acting insulin to provide better between-meal coverage, as well as a faster-acting/faster-dissipating insulin for mealtime use (the concept of basal/bolus therapy).

The limitations of human regular insulin injection as a bolus insulin are illustrated in Fig. 3C, where the PK profiles of endogenously secreted insulin (in healthy volunteers) and SC-administered human regular insulin (in persons with type 1 diabetes) following a meal are shown. Relative to the endogenous insulin response (blue line), the time to an increase in serum insulin concentration for SC-administered human regular insulin (red line) is notably slower, and the duration of the insulin in serum is significantly protracted. Consequently, an injection of human regular insulin requires administration at least 30 to 60 minutes prior to the meal to match maximal activity and minimize prolonged exposure. This is not only inconvenient for most people but can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia both before and after a meal if the insulin injection is not timed appropriately for the meal. These limitations of human regular insulin as bolus insulin were overcome using biotechnology to design and engineer rapid-acting insulin analogs.

### Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113QcJUm]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Insulin resistance is an integral pathophysiological feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we review established and emerging cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance, their complex integrative features and their relevance to disease progression. While recognizing the heterogeneity of the elusive fundamental disruptions that cause insulin resistance, we endorse the view that effector mechanisms impinge on insulin receptor signalling and its relationship with plasma levels of insulin. We focus on hyperinsulinaemia and its consequences: acutely impaired but persistent insulin action, with reduced ability to lower glucose levels but preserved lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion. We emphasize the role of insulin sensitization as a therapeutic goal in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Insulin signalling and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism [^114wvZiG]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In both disorders, tissues such as muscle, fat and liver become less responsive or resistant to insulin. This state is also linked to other common health problems, such as obesity, polycystic ovarian disease, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of insulin resistance involves a complex network of signalling pathways, activated by the insulin receptor, which regulates intermediary metabolism and its organization in cells. But recent studies have shown that numerous other hormones and signalling events attenuate insulin action, and are important in type 2 diabetes.

### Insulin-PI3K signalling: an evolutionarily insulated metabolic driver of cancer [^116cVhGx]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Cancer is driven by incremental changes that accumulate, eventually leading to oncogenic transformation. Although genetic alterations dominate the way cancer biologists think about oncogenesis, growing evidence suggests that systemic factors (for example, insulin, oestrogen and inflammatory cytokines) and their intracellular pathways activate oncogenic signals and contribute to targetable phenotypes. Systemic factors can have a critical role in both tumour initiation and therapeutic responses as increasingly targeted and personalized therapeutic regimens are used to treat patients with cancer. The endocrine system controls cell growth and metabolism by providing extracellular cues that integrate systemic nutrient status with cellular activities such as proliferation and survival via the production of metabolites and hormones such as insulin. When insulin binds to its receptor, it initiates a sequence of phosphorylation events that lead to activation of the catalytic activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase that coordinates the intake and utilization of glucose, and mTOR, a kinase downstream of PI3K that stimulates transcription and translation. When chronically activated, the PI3K pathway can drive malignant transformation. Here, we discuss the insulin-PI3K signalling cascade and emphasize its roles in normal cells (including coordinating cell metabolism and growth), highlighting the features of this network that make it ideal for co-option by cancer cells. Furthermore, we discuss how this signalling network can affect therapeutic responses and how novel metabolic-based strategies might enhance treatment efficacy for cancer.

### Glycation and insulin resistance: novel mechanisms and unique targets? [^111Uzu5W]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple biochemical, metabolic, and signal transduction pathways contribute to insulin resistance. In this review, we present evidence that the posttranslational process of protein glycation may play a role in insulin resistance. The posttranslational modifications, the advanced glycation end products (AGEs), are formed and accumulated by endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. AGEs may contribute to insulin resistance by a variety of mechanisms, including generation of tumor necrosis factor-α direct modification of the insulin molecule, thereby leading to its impaired action, generation of oxidative stress, and impairment of mitochondrial function, as examples. AGEs may stimulate signal transduction via engagement of cellular receptors, such as receptor for AGEs. AGE-receptor for AGE interaction perpetuates AGE formation and cellular stress via induction of inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduction in the expression and activity of the enzyme glyoxalase I that detoxifies the AGE precursor, methylglyoxal. Once set in motion, glycation-promoting mechanisms may stimulate ongoing AGE production and target tissue stresses that reduce insulin responsiveness. Strategies to limit AGE accumulation and action may contribute to the prevention of insulin resistance and its consequences.

### Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among individuals on basal insulin requiring treatment intensification [^1173nZf8]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

What's new?

Many patients with Type 2 diabetes require supplemental insulin as β‐cell function declines.
Treatment intensification is often required as patients are unable to achieve or maintain glycaemic control on basal insulin. For these patients, use of combination injectable treatments with different, complementary mechanisms of action can allow physicians to specifically target the glycaemic defects of their patient.
In this rapidly changing field, this evidence‐based review examines the available options for treatment intensification, including new fixed‐ratio combinations of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists and basal insulin.

### 100 years of insulin: why is insulin so expensive and what can be done to control its cost? [^116f8C3U]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The discovery of insulin 100 years ago and subsequent improvements in insulin formulations and delivery devices have changed the lives of people with diabetes. Unfortunately, the average price of insulin in the United States has nearly tripled over the past decade, and the high cost of insulin has become a barrier to diabetes treatment. On the 100th anniversary of insulin's discovery, this life-saving treatment is financially out of reach for as many as one-third of people with diabetes. The challenge now is to ensure that insulin is available for all people with diabetes who need it. We explore reasons for the high cost of insulin and recommend some clinical and policy interventions to improve insulin access and affordability.
