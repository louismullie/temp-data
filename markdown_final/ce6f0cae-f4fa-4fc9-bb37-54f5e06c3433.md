## Question

28 yr female: throat discomfort red and blisters

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a 28-year-old woman with throat discomfort, redness, and blisters. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate airway risk and stabilization. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis based on mucosal involvement and blister morphology. Next, I will outline the focused history, examination, and diagnostic workup, including when to biopsy and perform direct immunofluorescence. After that, I need to detail initial management pathways for the leading diagnoses and clarify what to avoid. Finally, I should address disposition, follow-up, and patient counseling, while continuously verifying each step against guidelines and case-based evidence.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation come first, and with oropharyngeal blisters I must actively exclude impending airway compromise from angioedema, epiglottitis, or severe mucocutaneous drug reactions; I should not delay securing the airway if there is stridor, drooling, dysphonia, or rapidly progressive edema, and I need to keep a low threshold for ENT/anesthesia involvement and early intubation in the OR if epiglottitis or deep neck space infection is suspected [^113s5yXU] [^115NaFdV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should construct a tiered differential that accounts for mucosal blisters and throat involvement in a young adult. Tier 1 emergencies include severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions such as SJS/TEN, autoimmune blistering diseases like pemphigus vulgaris or mucous membrane pemphigoid, and deep neck space infections including Lemierre's syndrome; Tier 2 includes infectious etiologies such as HSV stomatitis, Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis, and atypical hand-foot-and-mouth disease in adults; Tier 3 includes benign entities like angina bullosa hemorrhagica and less likely mimics such as SSSS in adults, which typically spares mucosa and is more common in children [^114uYtfa] [^116bsSzs] [^112YiA1Q] [^114Lz7en] [^114Mj39t] [^111SutuU].

> Wait, let me verify the key discriminators that will narrow this quickly: medication exposure within the prior 1–8 weeks, fever and systemic toxicity, pain versus pruritus, blister morphology and distribution, mucosal involvement pattern, Nikolsky sign, and rapidity of progression. Severe drug reactions and autoimmune blistering diseases often show painful mucosal erosions and may progress over days, whereas HSV tends to be recurrent and grouped vesicles, and MIRM follows a respiratory infection with prominent oral and conjunctival involvement; SSSS in adults is rare and usually lacks mucosal disease, which helps deprioritize it here [^114uYtfa] [^111JqBmh] [^117C31je] [^111SutuU].

> I will now examine the patient with a focus on the airway, oropharynx, and skin. I need to check for mucosal erosions, hemorrhagic bullae, targetoid lesions, conjunctival involvement, and any cutaneous blisters on trunk or extremities; I should test for Nikolsky sign carefully and document whether blisters are flaccid versus tense, as flaccid erosions favor pemphigus vulgaris while tense blisters favor pemphigoid; I must palpate the neck for lymphadenopathy and assess for jugular tenderness or crepitus suggesting deep space infection [^114KBQib] [^114Lz7en].

> Next, I should review the history in a structured way: timing of symptom onset, recent new medications or OTC agents, prior similar episodes, sick contacts, fever and systemic symptoms, dysphagia/odynophagia severity, hemoptysis, and any respiratory symptoms; I need to ask specifically about NSAIDs, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, allopurinol, and modafinil because these are classic SJS/TEN triggers, and I should confirm autoimmune symptoms or family history that might suggest pemphigus/pemphigoid or SLE-related blistering disease [^116bsSzs].

> Let me think about the initial diagnostics I should order while ensuring I do not delay critical care. I should obtain CBC, CMP, CRP/ESR, and consider blood cultures if systemic toxicity is present; if there is mucosal bleeding, I need to check PT/INR, aPTT, and platelets; for suspected drug eruption or autoimmune blistering disease, I should send ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-SSA/SSB, and consider anti-desmoglein 3/1 and anti-BP180/230; if GAS is suspected clinically, I should use a validated decision rule and obtain RADT with culture backup as indicated; if COVID-19 is in the differential, I should obtain SARS-CoV-2 testing per IDSA guidance; if MIRM is suspected, I should test for Mycoplasma pneumoniae; if HSV is suspected, I should obtain HSV PCR from lesion base [^115dgucv] [^1128DuC8] [^111jJyMU] [^117C31je] [^114ExcDM].

> Hold on, I should verify when to biopsy and what studies to request, because this is pivotal for autoimmune blistering diseases. If pemphigus vulgaris or mucous membrane pemphigoid is suspected, I should obtain a perilesional mucosal biopsy for routine histology and direct immunofluorescence to detect IgG/IgA/C3 at the basement membrane zone for pemphigoid versus intercellular IgG/C3 for pemphigus; if TEN is suspected, full-thickness epidermal necrosis on histology supports that diagnosis; if ABH is suspected, biopsy is usually not necessary unless the diagnosis is uncertain or recurrent [^114KBQib] [^116bsSzs] [^116wNxHZ].

> I need to ensure my initial management aligns with the most likely diagnosis while protecting the airway. If SJS/TEN is suspected, I should stop the culprit drug immediately, admit to a burn center when feasible, initiate supportive care, and consider systemic corticosteroids only in the early inflammatory phase with caution given conflicting data; if pemphigus vulgaris is suspected, I should start high-dose systemic corticosteroids and arrange urgent dermatology/ENT input for rituximab or other steroid-sparing therapy; if MIRM is diagnosed, I should treat the Mycoplasma infection and consider systemic corticosteroids for severe mucositis; if HSV is confirmed, I should start acyclovir; if ABH is likely, reassurance and supportive care are appropriate given the benign course [^117C31je] [^115c8XK2] [^116wNxHZ].

> But wait, what if I am overcalling a drug reaction when this is actually an infectious mucocutaneous eruption? I should double-check for MIRM features such as recent respiratory infection, oral and conjunctival involvement, and targetoid lesions, and send Mycoplasma serology or PCR before committing to long-term immunosuppression; similarly, I should confirm HSV with PCR if the history suggests recurrences or typical vesicles, and I should remember that adult HFMD, while uncommon, can present with oral ulcers and vesicular or papular lesions on hands, feet, and buttocks, particularly with coxsackievirus A6 [^117C31je] [^114Mj39t] [^114EbZbr].

> I should confirm disposition and follow-up plans now. Any patient with mucosal blisters and oropharyngeal involvement warrants close observation for airway compromise; admission is appropriate if there is dysphagia, odynophagia limiting oral intake, systemic toxicity, rapid progression, or diagnostic uncertainty; ENT and dermatology consultations should be obtained early; I need to counsel the patient to avoid new medications until the etiology is clarified and to return urgently for worsening dyspnea, drooling, or stridor [^113s5yXU] [^112YiA1Q].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing: stabilize airway and hemodynamics; characterize blisters and mucosal pattern; obtain targeted history including drugs and systemic symptoms; order initial labs and directed infectious testing; perform biopsy with DIF when autoimmune blistering is suspected; initiate disease-specific therapy promptly while avoiding harmful interventions; and arrange appropriate level of care and specialty follow-up. This stepwise approach balances the need for rapid diagnosis with the risks of invasive testing and immunosuppression, and it is consistent with contemporary dermatology and infectious diseases guidance for vesiculobullous eruptions with mucosal involvement [^114qTLAM] [^114KBQib].

---

The most likely cause of a 28-year-old woman with throat discomfort, redness, and blisters is **herpes simplex virus (HSV) pharyngitis** [^113NtSjx], given the classic mucosal vesicles and erythema. Other considerations include **acute bacterial pharyngitis** (GAS or Fusobacterium) [^115dgucv] [^114Lz7en], **angina bullosa hemorrhagica** [^116wNxHZ], and **drug-induced SJS/TEN** [^114uYtfa] if new medications were started. Rapid testing for GAS [^1135UNVK], HSV PCR [^114ExcDM], and a CBC are first-line; if autoimmune blistering is suspected, biopsy with direct immunofluorescence is indicated [^114iuraF]. Management is etiology-specific: acyclovir for HSV [^notfound], antibiotics for bacterial causes [^115fzMKu], and immediate cessation of offending drugs with supportive care for SJS/TEN [^notfound].

## Infectious etiologies

### Viral infections

- **Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**: HSV-1 is a leading cause of painful oral/pharyngeal vesicles and ulcers, often with fever and lymphadenopathy [^113NtSjx]; diagnosis is by PCR from lesion swabs [^114ExcDM].

- **Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD)**: Coxsackie A16/EV71 cause oral vesicles with hand/foot lesions; adults can be affected, especially with CVA6 [^114ZSMMt] [^114EbZbr].

- **Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)**: Infectious mononucleosis presents with sore throat, tonsillar exudate, and fatigue; oral ulcers can occur.

---

### Bacterial infections

- **Group A Streptococcus (GAS)**: Pharyngitis with erythema, exudate, and petechiae; vesicles are uncommon but can occur [^116mUoB4].

- **Fusobacterium necrophorum**: Severe pharyngitis with systemic toxicity; consider Lemierre's syndrome if neck pain/swelling and pulmonary symptoms occur [^114Lz7en] [^116UMc1H].

---

## Non-infectious etiologies

### Autoimmune blistering diseases

Autoimmune blistering diseases include **pemphigus vulgaris**, characterized by intraepidermal acantholysis with painful oral mucosal erosions and flaccid bullae, and **mucous membrane pemphigoid**, which presents with subepithelial blisters and scarring; both require biopsy with direct immunofluorescence for diagnosis [^111JqBmh] [^112YiA1Q].

---

### Drug-induced reactions

Drug-induced reactions include **Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)** [^114uYtfa], severe mucocutaneous reactions with widespread blisters and mucosal involvement, typically triggered by medications such as allopurinol, sulfonamides, or anticonvulsants [^111M5edg].

---

### Benign mucosal conditions

Benign mucosal conditions include **angina bullosa hemorrhagica (ABH)** [^116wNxHZ], presenting with sudden, painless, blood-filled oral blisters that rupture spontaneously and heal without scarring.

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for GAS [^1135UNVK] | Screen for streptococcal pharyngitis [^115dgucv] |
| 2 | HSV PCR from lesion swab [^114ExcDM] | Confirm HSV infection |
| 3 | Complete blood count (CBC) | Assess for infection or inflammation |
| 4 | Throat culture | Identify bacterial pathogens if RADT is negative |
| 5 | Biopsy with direct immunofluorescence [^114iuraF] | Diagnose autoimmune blistering diseases [^112YiA1Q] |
| 6 | Drug history review | Identify potential drug-induced reactions [^115y5tc8] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying etiology**:

- **HSV infection**: Acyclovir 400 mg orally five times daily for 7–10 days [^notfound].

- **GAS pharyngitis**: Penicillin V 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days; amoxicillin or cephalosporins if allergic [^notfound].

- **SJS/TEN**: Immediate cessation of offending drug, supportive care, and transfer to burn center [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune blistering diseases**: Systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy [^112YiA1Q].

- **ABH**: Reassurance and supportive care; no specific treatment required [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications vary by **etiology**. HSV can lead to secondary bacterial infection and, in immunocompromised patients, systemic dissemination [^notfound]. GAS may progress to rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, or invasive infections [^115fzMKu]. SJS/TEN carries a high risk of mortality, permanent scarring, and ocular involvement [^notfound]. Autoimmune blistering diseases can cause significant mucosal scarring and functional impairment [^112YiA1Q].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of throat discomfort with redness and blisters in a 28-year-old woman is **HSV pharyngitis** [^115c8XK2], but bacterial pharyngitis, autoimmune blistering diseases, drug-induced reactions, and benign mucosal conditions must be considered. A structured diagnostic approach and targeted therapy are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Tense blisters in a previously healthy young woman [^116bsSzs]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 20-year-old Black woman reported sore throat, odynophagia, cough, and skin blistering. Examination revealed tense vesicles, bullae, and well-demarcated erosions on the thighs and ulcerations on the tongue, buccal, and oropharyngeal mucosa. High-dose corticosteroids initiated at an outside hospital did not improve her condition. Antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Ro/SSA, and anti-La/SSB antibodies were positive. Hand swelling, joint pain, difficulty swallowing, and hemoptysis ensued. Bullae formation progressed with erosions involving the ears, nose, lips, extremities, and back (Fig 1). Biopsies for histology and direct immunofluorescence were performed; IgG, IgA, C3, and IgM stained the basement membrane zone (Figs 2 and 3).

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^114uYtfa]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old African woman presented with fever, throat pain, and a rapidly deteriorating rash after taking moxifloxacin for 10 days. She exhibited extensive erythematous and purpuric macules, blisters, and significant mucosal involvement, covering 40% of her body surface area (Figs 1 and 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)
B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome
C. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
D. Erythema multiforme major
E. Pemphigus vulgaris

Answers:

A. TEN or Lyell's syndrome – Correct. This diagnosis is supported by the extensive epidermal necrosis involving more than 30% of the body surface and the significant mucosal involvement observed in the patient. TEN is a serious and life-threatening dermatological condition characterized by diffuse erythematous and purpuric maculae aggregating into large areas of skin detachment. The presence of Nikolsky's sign, where slight mechanical pressure causes further skin detachment, is indicative of the severe epidermal damage observed in TEN. Given these clinical features and the patient's history of moxifloxacin use, TEN is the most appropriate diagnosis.
B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome – Incorrect. This involves less than 10 percent of the body surface.
C. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. This typically spares mucosal surfaces and can be excluded based on the extensive involvement and mucosal lesions in this patient.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme major usually presents with less extensive target lesions and skin detachments.
E. Pemphigus vulgaris – Incorrect. This shows intraepidermal acantholysis on histopathology rather than the full-thickness epidermal necrosis seen in TEN.

### Spontaneous angina bullosa haemorrhagica causing laryngospasm and requiring emergency intubation intraoperatively [^115emMcX]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Alternative causes for the blood-filled blisters were considered, such as drug reactions, coagulation disorders or infection. However, given the known patient history of ABH, the visualised ruptured bullae and unremarkable blood results, this clinical presentation was likely due to spontaneous bullae formation due to her ABH.

### A 27-year-old woman with rapidly progressive shortness of breath and severe alopecia [^114SUq9f]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 27-year-old previously healthy woman with no known exposure history presented with a 20-day history of progressively worsening breathlessness. She progressed from being breathless while hurrying on level ground to becoming breathless at rest and unable to complete sentences within 2 days. She reported multiple episodes of hemoptysis (approximately 30 mL daily) over the past 6 to 7 days, along with generalized weakness and fatigue for the last 7 days, and sudden onset of hair loss for the past 2 days. She reported episodic bluish discoloration of fingers on exposure to cold for the last 3 years but denied history of joint pain or skin rash.

### Hemorrhagic bullae of the oral mucosa [^116wNxHZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Angina bullosa hemorrhagica (ABH) is a rare benign disorder characterized by sudden onset of painless, blood-filled, blisters of the oral cavity that quickly expand and rupture spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours. First reported in 1967, ABH has been noted under other diagnostic terms including recurrent or traumatic oral hemophlyctenosis and benign hemorrhagic bullous stomatitis. Localization of blisters is usually restricted to the soft palate, yet the buccal mucosa, tongue, and lips may also be involved. Associated symptoms have been noted in some cases, including hoarseness and blood-tinged sialorrhea. Blisters tend to heal without scarring. Most cases occur in adults, ages 50 to 70, with no differentiation in incidence between men or women. Because it is infrequently encountered in the clinical setting and sparsely reported in the dermatologic literature, its recognition and diagnosis make it challenging for providers. We report a recent case of ABH in a middle-aged man with idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including its emergent presentation and relevant histopathology.

### A sore throat – potentially life-threatening? [^114Lz7en]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A sore throat, which is most commonly viewed as a minor ailment, can be a manifestation of a life-threatening disorder known as Lemierre's syndrome caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report a new case of Lemierre's syndrome that occurred in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old woman, who initially presented with fever and sore throat. The diagnosis was not made until a week later when blood cultures became available. This syndrome should be suspected until proven otherwise in any patient with signs of pharyngitis, a painful swollen neck, and pulmonary symptoms. By presenting this curable, but potentially life-threatening case of Lemierre's syndrome, we hope to increase the awareness of the early clinical manifestations of Lemierre's syndrome and to emphasize the importance of careful physical examination with special attention to the neck. Clinicians should be aware that exclusion of streptococcal infection in a patient with severe tonsillar infection does not exclude a bacterial cause.

### Doctor, I have a sore throat [^111Wskzp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Lemierre's syndrome is a rare yet potentially fatal cause of sore throat. Recently published literature suggests an increase in the incidence of this 'forgotten disease', highlighting Lemierre's syndrome as a clinically important differential diagnosis of sore throat. We present a case report of an 85-year-old man who developed a sore throat, which illustrates the re-emergence of Lemierre's syndrome. Reducing the morbidity and mortality from this disease requires a high index of clinical suspicion to ensure prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate multidisciplinary management.

### Pralatrexate (Folotyn) [^113AKaSk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Your healthcare provider will do blood tests before and during treatment with FOLOTYN.

Your healthcare provider may stop treatment, delay treatment, or change your dose of FOLOTYN based on results of your blood tests and if you have certain side effects.

What are the possible side effects of FOLOTYN? FOLOTYN may cause serious side effects, including:

Low blood cell counts: Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check your blood cell counts before and during treatment with FOLOTYN. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any signs of infection, fever, bleeding or tiredness during treatment with FOLOTYN.
Redness and sores of the mucous membrane lining of the mouth, lips, throat, digestive tract, and genitals (mucositis). Mucositis is common with FOLOTYN and can be severe. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop redness or painful sores in your mouth or throat, or have trouble speaking, eating or drinking. Your healthcare provider will tell you about ways to reduce your risk of getting mucositis, and how to maintain nutrition and help control the discomfort from mucositis.
Severe skin reactions. FOLOTYN can cause severe skin reactions that may lead to death. In people with lymphoma, severe skin reactions may happen on and under your skin. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop any f the following skin reactions:
rash
peeling and loss of skin
sores
blisters

### A blistering eruption of the head and neck in an 18-year-old [^116gQPTS]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

An 18-year-old presented with an atypical blistering eruption. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of perilesional skin showed strong linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermoepidermal junction. Her presentation was unusual and posed a diagnostic challenge, as this condition is very rare in this age group.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: are clinical criteria really good enough? [^113aYefM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high. In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Exuberant oral lesions in an immunocompromised patient [^113NtSjx]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the etiological agent commonly associated with this disease?
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18
D. Herpes simplex virus 1
E. Epstein-Barr virus

Answers:

A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32 — Incorrect. The HPVs 13 and 32 are low-risk oncogenic subtypes and related to Heck disease.
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4 — Incorrect. HPVs 2 and 4 are more associated to common warts present in the oral cavity.
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18 — Correct. HPV 6 and 11 are associated with a low oncogenic risk, while HPV 16 and 18 are related to a high oncogenic risk. These four HPV subtypes are commonly detected in oral condyloma accuminatum. The molecular analysis was positive for high-risk oncogenic deoxyribonucleic acid-human papillomavirus in the presented case.
D. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) — Incorrect. HSV-1 is an alphaherpesvirus, which causes an infection that is usually asymptomatic, affecting skin and mucosa. Gingivostomatitis is the most common manifestation of primary HSV (HSV-1) infection, mainly manifesting as multiple painful oral lesions, swollen gums, blisters, and sores. The lesions described are incompatible with those reported in this case, which were painless.
E. Epstein-Barr virus — Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus is a herpesvirus, which is widespread throughout the world. A typical clinical manifestation is infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis, an increase of cervical lymph nodes sensitivity and size, and moderate-to-high fever. The clinical findings are not compatible with those observed in the present case.

### Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: diagnosis and management [^111SutuU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a common disorder that is usually seen in infants and children and rarely seen in adults. SSSS usually presents with a prodrome of sore throat or conjunctivitis. Extremely tender flaccid bullae, which are Nikolsky sign-positive, develop within 48 hours and commonly affect the flexures; occasionally, large areas of the skin may be involved. The bullae enlarge and rupture easily to reveal a moist erythematous base, which gives rise to the scalded appearance. SSSS in adults is a rare disorder, though there are now over 50 documented cases. Usually SSSS occurs in predisposed individuals, but not all adults have an underlying illness. Whereas mortality in childhood SSSS is approximately 4%, the mortality rate in adults is reported to be greater than 60%. SSSS is caused by an infection with a particular strain of Staphylococcus aureus, which leads to blistering of the upper layer of the skin, by the release of a circulating exotoxin. It has recently been demonstrated that the exfoliative exotoxin responsible for SSSS leads to the cleavage of desmoglein 1 complex, an important desmosomal protein. The same toxins that are responsible for causing SSSS also cause bullous impetigo. There appears to be a relationship between the disease extent, the amount of toxin produced and whether the toxin is released locally or systemically. As a result there is likely to be a spectrum of disease and there are likely to be a number of milder cases of adult SSSS that go undiagnosed. Social improvements and hygiene have led to a dramatic fall in the number of cases of SSSS. Treatment is usually straightforward, when there is no coexistent morbidity and the presentation is mild, but can be demanding if the patient is particularly ill. SSSS is still associated with mortality, particularly when it occurs in adults.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113G3CNF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The COVID Symptom Study app

Users of the COVID Symptom Study appwere recruited through social media outreach and included anyone able to download the app, either themselves or by proxy. On sign‐up the app collects data on sex, age and ethnicity (Asian, black, Chinese, Middle East, mixed or white); core health risk factors, including height, weight and common disease status (e.g. cancer, diabetes, and heart, kidney and lung disease); the use of medications (e.g. corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and blood pressure medications); and whether the user is a healthcare worker. From 7 May 2020, users were prompted to self‐report if they had ever had a SARS‐CoV‐2 test, including how it was performed (e.g. nose or throat swab, antibody testing) and the result (positive, negative, failed or waiting). Users could provide daily updates on their health status and the presence of up to 14 COVID‐19‐related symptoms: abdominal pain, chest pain, delirium, diarrhoea, fatigue, fever, headache, hoarse voice, anosmia, persistent cough, shortness of breath, skipped meals, sore throat and unusual muscle pains. From 29 April 2020, two cutaneous manifestations were also added: raised, red, itchy weals on the face or body or sudden swelling of the face or lips (body rash); and red/purple sores or blisters on the feet or toes (acral rash). Asking the participants to differentiate between a transient urticarial rash and a fixed erythematopapular or vesicular rash was problematic, so the body rashes were collected together, as done elsewhere.

### Just a sore throat? Uncommon causes of significant respiratory disease [^116UMc1H]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present two uncommon underlying causes of a sore throat which, if missed or delayed in diagnosis, can lead to disastrous consequences. Our first case is of Lemierre's syndrome diagnosed in a 21-year-old man presenting with a 5-day history of sore throat, fever, right-sided pleuritic chest pain and bilateral pulmonary nodules on CT imaging. Fusobacterium necrophorum cultured from peripheral blood and an occluded left internal jugular vein on ultrasound lead to an eventual diagnosis. Our second case presents a 29-year-old woman with a 5-day history of sore throat, fever and right-sided pleuritic chest pain. A left-sided quinsy was diagnosed and aspirated and the patient was discharged home. She represented shortly with worsening pleuritic pain and was found to have a right-sided pleural effusion with descending mediastinitis originating from the tonsillar abscess. Delayed diagnosis resulted in open thoracotomy, decortication and prolonged intravenous antibiotics.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^114Mj39t]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hand-foot-and-mouth disease:

- **Definition**: HFMD is a common viral illness caused by enteroviruses, primarily affecting infants and children, although it can occasionally occur in adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: HFMD is caused by enteroviruses, most commonly Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71. It transmitted through direct contact with the saliva, nasal mucus, blister fluid, and feces of infected individuals.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of HFMD in China is estimated at 197 per 100,000 person-years. HFMD shows seasonal variation, with a peak in cases typically occurring in spring and early summer, and possesses the potential to escalate to epidemic levels.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for HFMD include young age, having close contact with infected individuals, being in group settings like schools or daycare centers, the summer and early fall seasons, and poor hygiene practices.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of HFMD typically include fever, sore throat, and a characteristic skin rash that presents as small, red, painful papules progressing to blisters on the hands, feet, and sometimes in the mouth, which can subsequently develop into ulcers.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The disease course is generally self-limiting, with symptoms resolving within a week without specific treatment. However, in rare cases, severe cardiac and neurologic complications can occur.

### Laryngeal manifestations of bullous pemphigoid: case report and review of the literature [^113fpxeS]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease that affects primarily the skin and rarely involves the mucosa of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, or esophagus. Diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation, histology, and immunopathological examination. Laryngeal involvement in BP is extremely rare and patients may be asymptomatic or may present with dysphonia, dysphagia, and/or respiratory distress. The authors of this article report a rare case of BP with laryngeal involvement with a review of the literature. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is highly recommended to prevent any long-term complications.

A 12-year-old girl presented with red spots appearing on the left side of her face. The girl was usually healthy and fully vaccinated, including varicella vaccination. Six years prior to her presentation, she had suffered an episode of blister rash on the left side of her face, including lesions in the ear canal and buccal mucous membrane. A diagnosis of herpes zoster was made, and she was treated with acyclovir with complete skin recovery. A hearing examination demonstrated mild-to-moderate left neurosensory hearing loss. Since then, she is having short episodes of redness on her face without pain or sweating at the exact distribution of the zoster blisters 6 years ago. The appearance of spots is related to sour foods, such as sour flavoured candies, yoghourt and green apples. The diagnosis of postherpetic Frey syndrome was made, and observational approach was adopted due to the benign character of symptoms.

### Unusual purpuric eruption in a child [^116TtaSf]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 5-year-old, previously healthy girl presented with new-onset, persistent, red, burning hives covering large segments of her body. Associated symptoms included angioedema, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The lesions resolved after 24 hours, leaving behind areas of bruising. On physical examination, the patient appeared well, with scattered, variably sized, purpuric patches and urticarial plaques on the torso and extremities (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3). Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, normal C1q antibody levels, and decreased C4 levels. Two weeks after the initial presentation, she developed the same purpuric eruption accompanied by acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?

### Persistent sore throat: a case of laryngeal mucous membrane pemphigoid [^112YiA1Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a case of a 72-year-old women who presented with a persistent sore throat and productive cough. On flexible nasendoscopy examination, she was found to have a fairly superficial ulcer affecting the laryngeal surface and tip of her epiglottis. On her second microlaryngoscopy and biopsy, direct immunofluorescent staining of the biopsy was analysed and the histological findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP). MMP is a rare chronic autoimmune condition characterised by the presence of blistering subepithelial lesions that can cause scarring. Laryngeal MMP affects only 1 in 10million people and can lead to life-threatening airway compromise arising from scarring and stenosis. As there is a large spectrum of disease, it is important to adopt a multidisciplinary approach including dermatologists, otolaryngologists and ophthalmologists for prompt diagnosis and early recognition of potential complications, maximising functional outcomes for patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing a rapidly expanding pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website describes fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the primary symptoms of the disease, but it does not describe cutaneous manifestations of the illness. Understanding how COVID-19 might present on the skin may help practitioners and patients recognize and manage the disease more effectively.

Burns: Cooling thermal burns — Background and referral context: Thermal burns are caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, hot surfaces, and hot gases. Burns can lead to damaging physical, functional, cosmetic, and psychosocial consequences. Superficial (first-degree) burns are characterized by skin redness and pain without blistering or other loosening or destruction of the skin surface, and the intact skin maintains its barrier function. First-degree burns generally heal without scarring, and the risk of infection is low. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns involve destruction of the epidermis and injury to deeper layers and often require treatment beyond what can be provided in the first aid setting to speed healing, prevent infection, and reduce scarring. Large partial-thickness burns (partial-thickness burns that involve the face, hands, feet, or genitalia), all full-thickness burns, and concern for inhalation injury (sore throat around the nose or mouth, difficulty breathing) require hospital treatment. Although burn-cooling sprays have also been studied, the majority of studies involve immediate application of cool running water.

### Features of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal lesions in bullous pemphigoid [^116ozD2H]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by skin lesions, with or without oral lesions. The occurrence of pharyngolaryngeal lesions is very rare in affected patients. We conducted a study to investigate the characteristics of oral and pharyngolaryngeal lesions in bullous pemphigoid. Our study population was made up of 6 consecutively presenting outpatients-2 men and 4 women, aged 40 to 83 years (mean: 68.2)-who had been referred to our department over an 11-year period. Presenting symptoms included sore throat in all 6 patients and oral pain in 3. The sites of mucosal lesions included the soft palate, epiglottis, gingiva, hypopharynx, tongue, nasal cavity, and buccal mucosa. These lesions appeared as erosions, erosions with white coating, erythematous patches, and/or blisters. Mucosal lesions preceded skin lesions in 2 patients, appeared after skin lesions in 1 patient, and appeared simultaneously with skin lesions in 3 patients. We conclude that bullous pemphigoid sometimes involves the mucosa, such as that of the laryngopharynx and the oral cavity, and it can manifest as skin lesions. In the differential diagnosis of refractory pharyngolaryngeal lesions, bullous pemphigoid should be considered.

### Beyond the surface: investigating the relationship between autoimmune blistering disorders and venous thromboembolism [^1167pQqo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which encompasses deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, refers to the formation of blood clots within the venous system.VTE is a complex disease, and its pathogenesis remains incompletely elucidated. Stasis, vascular injury, and a hypercoagulable state, known collectively as Virchow's triad, play a vital role in the onset of thrombosis. The intersection of these conditions amplifies the likelihood of venous thrombosis, which may consequently precipitate the progression of VTE. Immune alterations and vascular inflammation are also known to play a pivotal role in the thrombogenic mechanism and the pathogenesis of VTE.

Several medical conditions are known to increase the risk of developing VTE. These include blood clotting disorders or a history of blood clots, cancer and its treatments (including chemotherapy and surgery), diabetes, heart conditions (eg, heart attack or congestive heart failure), infections, pregnancy, immobilization, antiphospholipid syndrome, kidney disease, spinal cord injury, and obesity. As an illustration, patients with COVID‐19 may have thrombotic and coagulation abnormalities, promoting a hypercoagulable state and resulting in an increased rate of thrombotic and thromboembolic events.

Pemphigus and pemphigoid represent distinct, albeit related, autoimmune blistering disorders, defined by the production of autoantibodies that target desmosomes or hemidesmosomes, structures vital for skin integrity. In pemphigus, the immune system targets desmogleins, a component of desmosomes, the intercellular junctions maintaining adhesion between keratinocytes. This results in a phenomenon known as acantholysis, the dissolution of epidermal cellular bonds, causing intraepidermal blistering. Pemphigus often presents with painful blisters on mucous membranes such as the mouth and throat, and may progress to involve the skin extensively. Conversely, pemphigoid encompasses a group of subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases, characterized by autoantibodies against components of the hemidesmosome, essential for dermal‐epidermal junction integrity. In pemphigoid, blister formation occurs beneath the epidermis, yielding tense blisters. Both disorders exemplify the sophisticated and delicate interrelationship between the immunological processes and skin tissue homeostasis.

### Down in the mumps [^113hesg7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

A 10-week-old female infant presented with a right-sided facial swelling without any constitutional symptoms. The swelling was nontender, nonfluctuant, with no erythema or induration. On the basis of the clinical picture, magnetic resonance imaging findings and serology, a diagnosis of unilateral mumps parotitis was made. The United Kingdom is currently experiencing a mumps epidemic with a 28-fold rise in the number of cases over the last 10 years. Infants are being increasingly affected. Mumps parotitis, which was previously unreported in infants, needs to be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when a small child presents with swelling of the parotid gland.

### Emergency evaluation and management of the sore throat [^113s5yXU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Although sore throat is a very common complaint in the emergency department and is often associated with benign conditions, such as pharyngitis, it can be the early onset of something much more serious and even life threatening. A thorough history and examination are vital to the correct diagnosis but a high index of suspicion must be maintained to diagnose less common but serious pathology, such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Airway management is paramount to survival, and aggressive means should be taken early when epiglottitis is considered.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^1118kGyS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:

A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

### The rational clinical examination. does this patient have strep throat? [^116L3a4d]. JAMA (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context

Sore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence.

Objective

To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat.

Data Source

MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination.

Study Selection

Large blinded, prospective studies (having ≥ 300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies.

Data Synthesis

The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations.

Conclusions

While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.

### Clinicopathological challenges of diagnosing reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption [^117C31je]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

Case 1

An adolescent male presented to an Emergency Department (ED) with an 8 day history of sore throat. He had cough and high-grade fevers. His lips were erythematous, and he had left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. His medical history included scarlet fever and three episodes of Group A Streptococcus tonsillitis confirmed by throat cultures. He had a documented penicillin allergy, so had been prescribed erythromycin by a general practitioner on the fifth day of the illness. However, the commencement of erythromycin was thought to be unrelated to his symptoms including the development of cracked, bleeding lips, painful ulcers of the oropharynx (figure 1) and preputial mucosa on the third day of the illness.

At the ED, he was moderately dehydrated. He was admitted for intravenous (IV) fluid support and treated with cephalexin for suspected bacterial pharyngitis. He later developed non-purulent limbic-sparing conjunctivitis and dyspnoea. A chest X-ray revealed right upper lobe pneumonia. Initial differential diagnoses included Kawasaki disease and Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS). However, IgM serology returned positive for M. pneumoniae, and a diagnosis of RIME was made. His antibiotic therapy was changed to roxithromycin.

Case 2

A young girl with no significant medical history presented with a blistering rash, with conjunctivitis and labial and oropharyngeal mucositis (figure 2a-c). There was no history of recent new medications preceding the onset of symptoms.

Figure 2
Examples of non-mucosal involvement, such as pseudotargetoid lesions (a), purpuric macules (b) and papulonodules (c).

Nitrous oxide sedation was used because of severe pain and procedural anxiety. This helped to facilitate IV access, blood tests, ophthalmology and dermatology assessments. The rash had both well-circumscribed vesicles surrounded by erythematous rings and areas of yellow crusted ulceration. Ophthalmology examination revealed purulent bilateral conjunctivitis. There was extensive haemorrhagic mucositis and crusting of the lips, mouth and throat. Blood tests showed a high C-reactive protein level, but the white cell count was normal. Nasopharyngeal PCR testing for viral and bacterial pathogens returned positive for influenza B only.

Both children in this case series required nasogastric feeding support until the oropharyngeal lesions improved with a course of steroids and analgesia.

### Classic findings, mimickers, and distinguishing features in primary blistering skin disease [^114KBQib]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

Blistering diseases comprise a large group of clinically polymorphic and sometimes devastating diseases. During the past few decades, we have developed an elegant understanding of the broad variety of blistering diseases and the specific histopathologic mechanism of each.

Objective —

To review examples of the classic findings of specific blistering diseases and emphasize the importance of considering unrelated conditions that can mimic the classic finding.

Data Sources —

This article combines data from expert review, the medical literature, and dermatology and pathology texts.

Conclusions —

We have chosen several common examples of classic blistering diseases that are mimicked by other cutaneous conditions to highlight the basic findings in blistering conditions and the importance of clinician-to-pathologist communication.

### Sore throat in a young man: guess what… [^111ZATdp]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Sore throat is a common complaint in the outpatient and emergency room settings. Typically, little workup is necessary and includes visual inspection with or without swabs for bacterial infection. We present a case that demonstrates an important entity to be excluded by simple history and physical examination in patients presenting with pain in the throat or neck. The most important cause of pneumomediastinum is previous instrumentation. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is uncommonly seen in young adults. Most cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum are uncomplicated, as mediastinal pressures rarely mount to dangerous levels. However, when the patient presents with distended neck veins, cyanosis or marked dyspnoea, further action is necessary. Lastly, since pneumomediastinum can be caused by oesophageal rupture and occasionally present with concurrent pneumothorax, these dangerous entities must be excluded.

### Pharyngitis [^116cRSaQ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e., group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

### Paraneoplastic mucous membrane pemphigoid with ocular and laryngeal involvement [^113EJxv7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 73-year-old woman was treated 8 years previously for synchronous breast and uterine neoplasms. She presented with a severe sore throat, odynophagia, dysphonia, dyspnoea, ocular irritation and weight loss over the last 3 months. Physical examination revealed ulcerations in the oral cavity, posterior pharyngeal wall and supraglottic larynx, nasal crusting, bilateral conjunctivitis and three cutaneous blisters. A diagnosis of anti-laminin 5 mucous membrane pemphigoid was retained, based on skin biopsy, direct immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. A positron emission tomography (PET)-CT detected multiple adenopathies. Cytology revealed adenocarcinoma with an immunocytology compatible with a breast origin and this was considered as a late metastatic recurrence of her previous breast cancer. A treatment of prednisone, dapsone and hormonotherapy was introduced, but intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab were added due to new mucosal lesions. Despite treatment, a posterior laryngeal scar and bilateral symblepharon were developed. After 3 years, the patient is still alive and reports a satisfactory quality of life.

### Sore throat [^111nDhv3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of people present to primary healthcare services with sore throat each year. The causative organisms of sore throat may be bacteria (most commonly Streptococcus) or viruses (typically rhinovirus), although it is difficult to distinguish bacterial from viral infections clinically.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions to reduce symptoms of acute infective sore throat? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 6 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and paracetamol.

What are the possible side effects of oseltamivir phosphate capsules?

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules may cause serious side effects, including:

- Serious skin and allergic reactions. Oseltamivir phosphate capsules can cause serious skin and allergic reactions. Stop taking oseltamivir phosphate capsules and get medical help right away if you get any of the following symptoms:

o skin rash or hives o swelling of your face, eyes, lips, tongue, or throat

o your skin blisters and peels o trouble breathing

o blisters or sores in your mouth o chest pain or tightness

o itching

- Change in behavior. People, especially children, who have the flu, can develop nervous system problems and abnormal behavior that can lead to death. During treatment with oseltamivir phosphate capsules, tell your healthcare provider right away if you or your child have confusion, speech problems, shaky movements, seizures, or start hearing voices or seeing things that are not really there (hallucinations).

The most common side effects of oseltamivir phosphate capsules when used for treatment of the flu include nausea, vomiting, and headache.

The most common side effect of oseltamivir phosphate capsules when used for prevention of the flu include nausea, vomiting, headache, and pain.

### Unusual external auditory canal relapse in pemphigus vulgaris [^111JqBmh]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering disease characterized by autoantibodies against desmogleins (DSGs), resulting clinically in the formation of blisters. Histopathologic analysis shows suprabasal acantholysis with loss of adhesion between adjacent keratinocytes with a tombstone appearance. Bullous lesions can involve different sites on both skin and mucosa such as oropharyngeal, laryngeal, nasal, conjunctival, genital, anal, and esophageal mucosa. The frequency of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) involvement in PV is clearly highlighted in previous studies, but ear involvement has been only occasionally reported, characterized by pain and ear canal obstruction as reported first symptoms.

We present an unusual case of a patient with mucocutaneous PV who, after a period of clinical and immunologic remission, presented with a relapse manifested only by auricular symptoms and signs that preceded the appearance of oral blisters.

### Lemierre's syndrome and 2016 American college of physician guidelines for pharyngitis: no to empiric coverage for bacterial pharyngitis. while no role for routine Fusobacterium PCR, keep suspicion for this pathogen [^116XmpDR]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

An 18-year-old woman presented to clinic with acute pharyngitis with 4/4 Centor criteria. Rapid streptococcal antigen test was negative. The patient, who was allergic to penicillin, was prescribed azithromycin. Ultimately, after 5days and without any corticosteroids, she presented to the emergency department with 10/10 chest pain and was admitted to the intensive care unit. CT showed nodular lung disease and blood cultures on admission grew Fusobacterium, likely Fusobacteriumnucleatum. She sustained two cardiac arrests, three tube thoracostomies, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis and ventilatory failure requiring tracheostomy. After 16 days in hospital and 18 days in long-term acute care, the patient was discharged home. It is unclear how much of this could have been prevented by prescribing an antimicrobial that had activity against Fusobacterium When severe pharyngitis occurs, Fusobacterium needs to be considered as an underlying cause. In vitro macrolides have marginal activity against most anaerobes, such as this pathogen, and should be avoided.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^115f5YQi]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — Initial infection describes transmission and asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is typically spread by direct contact, most often from virus shed into saliva or genital secretions, and can be acquired by contact with virus-laden saliva of asymptomatic individuals, who may be a common source of transmission. After initial acquisition of HSV-1, active replication in mucosa or skin spreads through neurons to dorsal root ganglia or, in the face, the trigeminal ganglia. Some patients have symptoms during the initial acute infection but most do not, and nearly two-thirds of primary HSV infections are either unrecognized or asymptomatic.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^115y5tc8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Drug allergy — open drug challenge protocols for nonsevere delayed reactions outline 1-step or 2-step dosing with observation, an alternative multiple-day challenge or graded reintroduction, and explicit reaction criteria and cautions. The 1-step option is 1 tab or full PO with 60 min to 2 h observation; the 2-step option uses Step 1: 1/10 IV/IM/SC dose with 30 min observation followed by Step 2: full PO/IV/IM/SC dose with 60 min to 2 h observation. Positive reactions are defined as fever, urticaria, facial swelling, exanthem, hypoxia, hypotension, mouth, urogenital or eye soreness, fixed or blistering eruption, target or atypical target lesions; possible reactions include isolated joint pain, appetite change, persistent pruritus without rash; and doubtful reactions include dizziness, tachycardia, subjective lip/tongue swelling, subjective throat tightness, lump in throat, dyspnea, transient pruritus without rash, headache. The "Other" option is multiple-day challenge or graded reintroduction performed as an outpatient procedure. Footnotes state these approaches are sometimes called desensitization or induction of drug tolerance, are contraindicated for severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions or documented organ failure, that nonsevere delayed challenges may be initiated by the patient at home with telehealth follow-up when necessary, that comparably dosed oral solution may be used (1/10 or full dose), that very low-risk or more distant reactions (> 5 years) may allow single full-dose challenge, that placebo-controlled challenges or placebo lead-in can help confirm or refute delayed HSR, and that for mild exanthems a single full-dose challenge may be used.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^115DXo91]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CASE STUDY: PHARYNGITIS

One week into the new school year, an 8-year-old girl experiences acute onset of sore throat. Her mother notes the presence of fever (103.5°F) and a bright red throat. The following morning the patient is seen in an urgent care clinic. The health care provider confirms the aforementioned signs and symptoms as well as an abdomen that is slightly tender to palpation. Tonsillar enlargement/exudates and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy are absent. The provider, suspecting acute bacterial pharyngitis, performs a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for group A Streptococcus (GAS) — the result is negative. A throat swab sample is sent to a clinical microbiology laboratory for culture-based confirmation. The mother is informed that a prescription will be provided if the culture is positive. Twenty-four hours later the laboratory notes the presence of β-hemolytic colonies suggestive of GAS embedded within normal flora. The suspicious colonies require subculturing for isolation. At forty-eight hours, isolated colonies are confirmed to be GAS using traditional microbiology methods. The provider receives the positive test result, electronically transmits the antibiotic prescription to the pharmacy of choice and notifies the mother to pick up the prescription. This process delays diagnosis and treatment, which increases the days the child is symptomatic, potentially spreading infection to others, and the risk of infection-associated complications, such as invasive head and neck infection.

This case highlights the challenges experienced by health care providers in outpatient/urgent care clinics and emergency departments that do not have access to rapid, near-patient diagnostic testing. Traditional culture-based confirmatory testing delays patient management by 24 to 48 hours. Even when considering new, state-of-the art clinical microbiology laboratories that incorporate total laboratory automation with real-time monitoring of culture growth and mass spectrometry-based pathogen identification directly from the culture plate, confirmatory testing will take a minimum of 16 hours. This approach, although promoting appropriate antibiotic utilization, negatively impacts operational efficiency of health care organizations, leads to additional school day absences, and lost wages for parents caring for ill children. Due to these testing delays, most physicians treat empirically in the outpatient setting. As such, antibiotic overuse is a much more common problem than delayed treatment or undertreatment.

### Fulminant supraglottitis from Neisseria meningitidis [^114pk6NS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Blood cultures have been positive from all reported case-patients. Two isolates were typed as serogroup B, 4 as serogroup Y, and the serotype of 1 was unreported. Meningococcal strains causing supraglottitis appear to be more locally aggressive but cause less disseminated disease, possibly due to decreased tropism for endothelial cells.

To our knowledge, ours is the second case of meningococcal supraglottitis reported with severe neck edema and cellulitis; a 44-year-old woman in a prior review had features similar to our patient. An 81-year-old woman with diabetes was noted to have "reddish swelling" on the right side of the neck, but little was described beyond that. All 3 had serogroup Y infection. We wondered whether serogroup Y might have a propensity to cause cellulitis; however, a review of 10 cases of meningococcal cellulitis included patients with multiple serogroups: C (4 cases), B (2 cases), Y (2 cases), and unknown (2 cases).

N. meningitidis may cause supraglottitis more frequently than is recognized. Timely drawing of blood cultures in relation to administration of antimicrobial drugs is most likely to identify this pathogen in this setting. Because of its public health implications and potential for rapid progression to airway compromise, N. meningitidis should be considered among the differential diagnoses of supraglottitis/epiglottitis.

### A skin organoid-based infection platform identifies an inhibitor specific for HFMD [^112RREmW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. EV-A71 is a major pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and mainly affects infants and young children mostly ≤ 5 years of age. EV-A71 is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route. The virus enters the human body through contact with contaminated feces or hands, and the gastrointestinal tract has been identified as the primary target of infection. The most common clinical symptoms of EV-A71 infection are low-grade fever with discomfort, macular papules or blisters on the skin of hands, feet, and buttocks, and painful ulcerative lesions in the throat, mouth, and tongue. Although the virus is easily cultured from skin vesicles and oral secretions, the replication site and pathogenesis of EV-A71 in human skin remain unknown. In addition, EV-A71 is a highly neurotropic virus, and the central nervous system (CNS) is also an important target for EV-A71 infection. Following EV-A71 infection of the CNS, inflammation can occur in different anatomical regions or simultaneously in multiple regions, causing encephalitis, meningitis, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and acute flaccid paralysis. Thus, timely identification and treatment of EV-A71 infections is important.

### Burning pain on the upper labial mucosa [^117NwjPn]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 36-year-old pregnant woman presented with 1 week of burning pain on the upper labial mucosa and new onset headache. Six days prior, the patient's 3-year-old child tested positive for streptococcal pharyngitis after exposure at daycare and was treated with antibiotics. Physical examination was remarkable for pink thin plaques with white, polycyclic borders on the upper labial mucosa (Fig 1) that could not be wiped away. The patient was empirically treated for streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin V owing to her symptoms and pregnancy status. Lip pain and rash began to improve within 3 days and resolved completely within 4 weeks.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lichen planus
B. Candidiasis
C. Aphthous stomatitis
D. Geographic lip
E. Herpetic gingivostomatitis

Answers:

A. Lichen planus – Incorrect. Oral lichen planus may involve labial mucosa and can be associated with sensitivity to acidic or spicy food similar to geographic tongue. However, this condition presents more commonly with bilateral white reticulations, which are frequently associated with erythema and erosions and yellow fibrinous exudate.
B. Candidiasis – Incorrect. Although oral candidiasis may present with burning pain and can involve any mucosal surface, this condition classically presents as curd-like white papules and plaques that can be wiped off.
C. Aphthous stomatitis – Incorrect. This common condition affects approximately 20% to 50% of the population and favors labial mucosa but presents more commonly with ovoid ulcers with a white-to-yellow base and an erythematous rim.
D. Geographic lip – Correct. Geographic tongue is a benign, inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology that predominantly involves the dorsal and lateral tongue. Ectopic geographic tongue (in this case, geographic lip specifically) may involve any oral mucosa and classically presents as flattened or atrophic lesions varying from a few millimeters to several centimeters with a serpiginous white border.
E. Herpetic gingivostomatitis – Incorrect. Herpetic gingivostomatitis may involve the labial mucosa but frequently presents with vesicles at the vermillion border that break to form erosions and ulcers that subsequently crust.

### Atypical presentations of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6 – Minnesota, 2014 [^114ZSMMt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

HFMD is a common, contagious childhood disease caused by members of the genus Enterovirus, usually the coxsackieviruses. HFMD is typically a mild, febrile illness, characterized by mouth sores and a red, sometimes blistery rash involving the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Nail loss occasionally occurs, often weeks after symptom onset. In the United States, HFMD is commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16. Cases of HFMD with atypical rashes, involving the arms, legs, trunk, perioral regions, buttocks, and genitalia have been recently reported in association with CVA6. Although HFMD is most common among children aged ≤ 5 years, adults can also be infected. However, clusters of HFMD in adults are unusual.

During 2011–2012, an outbreak of HFMD caused by CVA6 occurred in North America. Sixty-three cases were reported to CDC, including 15 among adults. Approximately 50% of the adult patients had reported exposure to children with HFMD. The college outbreak reported here might also have begun with an exposure to a symptomatic child. The spread of HFMD among adults in a college setting has not been previously described.

Most cases of HFMD are mild and treatment is supportive, although CVA6 has been associated with more severe disease. HFMD is transmitted person-to-person through contact with vesicle fluid, respiratory secretions, and feces. Hand washing and routine disinfection of surfaces help prevent spread. Awareness of unusual features of CVA6, including the occurrence of a varicella-like rash (,–) or a rash with an atypical distribution, can assist health care providers in diagnosing HFMD and recommending appropriate care.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^112R8Xai]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Combination adapalene and benzoyl peroxide — prescribing information for acne vulgaris indicates topical treatment in patients ≥ 9 years of age, with dosing to apply a thin film to affected areas of the face or trunk once daily after washing and to use a pea-sized amount for each area of the face (eg, forehead, chin, and each cheek). Contraindications include known hypersensitivity to adapalene or any ingredient in the formulation. In clinical trials, 21–47% of patients had successful treatment (using Investigator's Global Assessment). Adverse effects/toxicities include erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, contact dermatitis, skin irritation, eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness, and allergic contact dermatitis. Interactions list keratolytic agents and photosensitizing agents. Other issues state that exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized and that weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating. Pregnancy category is C; for nursing, it is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk. Pediatric use specifies that safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients < 9 years of age has not been established.

### Case report of a 5-year-old with epiglottitis: an atypical presentation of an uncommon disease [^115NaFdV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Epiglottitis is a rarely encountered infection in pediatrics since the advent of the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine first introduced in the United States in 1985. However, the disease remains a much feared infection in pediatrics. The literature reiterates the importance of early recognition, avoidance of agitating the patient, and the need for securing the airway in the operating room as key and essential features to a good outcome. However, with only 1 case per 200,000 children reported in the United States in 2006, most practitioners have never encountered this infection. The following is a case of a previously healthy and immunized child who presented to our emergency department and whose condition was ultimately diagnosed as epiglottitis.

### A rare case of skin blistering and esophageal stenosis in the course of epidermolysis bullosa-case report and literature review [^114EvYxm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A fourty-year-old man with DEB diagnosed at the age of eight was admitted to the department of gastroenterology because of the dysphagia for two previous months. The diagnosis of DEB was established due to the presence of single blisters on the whole body since the sixth month of life. His sister was also diagnosed with DEB and had similar symptoms of the disease. To our knowledge, the presented patient and his sister are the oldest diagnosed with EB living in Poland. At the age of four the patient started experiencing heartburn occasionally. Five years later dysphagia appeared for the first time. It was an episodal and periodical ailment. He reported a deterioration of dysphagia at the age of nineteen; he mostly consumed liquids and soft consistency meals during that time. Nonetheless, the patient admitted that this esophageal discomfort still was not a constant one and there were time intervals without this ailment. In the past there were also episodes of mild esophageal bleeding. The only one endoscopic esophageal dilatation in this patient took place in 1997; a stenosis was located then approximately 18 cm from incisors. The performed procedure ameliorated swallowing difficulty. A barium swallow test obtained one year after the endoscopic dilatation of the esophagus also revealed esophageal constriction on the same level. In 2014 the patient was diagnosed because of hematochezia and pain in hypogastrium. Tissue samples obtained in colonoscopy revealed the presence of nonspecific inflammatory infiltration in the ascending colon and terminal part of the ileum. Interestingly, 3 years ago he complained of hemoptysis and there was a suspicion of bleeding to pulmonary alveoli in the course of DEB. However, a CT scan did not confirm bleeding. On admission to our department the patient was complaining of painful swallowing of solids. Two months earlier he was diagnosed in the cardiology unit because of the chest pain and elevated level of troponin I. An electrocardiogram did not show any abnormalities. The patient refused to undergo coronarography and no more cardiological diagnostic procedures were performed Additional file 1. On admission to our unit he did not complain of the chest pain. On physical examination he appeared comfortable, afebrile with pulse 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 per minute and the body mass index (BMI) was 24.7 kg/m 2. The patient presented blisters, skin reddening and crust formation on the upper and lower limbs. There were also contractures and disabled movement in his hand joints together with a loss of a finger and toenails (Fig. 2). The apex of the tongue and left palatine arch were covered by superficial ulcerations. During his hospital stay, performed laboratory tests did not reveal any abnormalities. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed a thickening of the esophageal wall at maximum to 7 mm on the level from the fourth cervical vertebra to the fourth thoracic vertebra (Fig. 3). A probe of gastroscopy under sedation with benzodiazepine failed due to an esophageal stenosis. An attempt of examination with paediatric endoscope was also unsuccessful. A barium swallow test revealed a narrowing of upper esophageal lumen to 7 mm along the length of 4 cm together with two diverticula on the right side not emptying of contrast. During swallowing other two diverticula appeared which were emptying of contrast (Fig. 4). A barium swallow test also showed a noticeable weakening of the esophageal mucous membrane. After the performed investigation the patient was qualified to endoscopic dilatation of esophageal stenosis and endoscopic management of diverticula. However, he did not agree to undergo this procedure during current hospital stay. In our unit the patient was treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and prokinetic drugs administered intravenously, which caused an amelioration of esophageal discomfort. He was discharged in a good general condition with a recommendation of a diet based on soft consistency meals, oral PPI and prokinetic drugs administration and the next follow-up in a month.

### A 62-year-old woman with refractory wheezing [^113zH1zY]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 62-year-old Hispanic woman, a resident of Puerto Rico, presented with symptoms of chronic cough and shortness of breath for the past 2 years that were slowly and progressively getting worse. She received a diagnosis of asthma on the basis of her history of symptomatic "wheezing" and had been on treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids with minimal symptomatic improvement. The peculiarity of her symptoms was that her dyspnea was worse when she was reclining in bed and she would often hear a "whistling" noise in her throat during those times. Additionally, she reported difficulty swallowing and would often drink water to aid in swallowing food. There was no prior history of endotracheal intubations or surgeries. She denied any history of joint pain, skin rashes, eye pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, photosensitivity, diarrhea, blood-mixed stool, or blood in the urine.

### Conjunctivitis, mucosal erosions, and moist cutaneous plaques [^116MBNLb]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old man with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presented to the emergency department with a fever and 2-month history of recurrent painful mouth sores. A review of systems obtained from his mother was notable for weight loss, eye irritation, and an uncharacteristically wide-based gait. The physical examination found conjunctival injection, erosions on the labial and buccal mucosa, and moist malodorous exophytic periumbilical (Fig 1, A) and inguinal (Fig 2) plaques. Comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were unremarkable; HIV screen was negative. The results of histopathologic examination of the periumbilical plaque are shown in Fig 1, B and C.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Secondary syphilis
B. Pyoderma gangrenosum
C. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans
D. Pemphigus vegetans
E. Herpes simplex virus infection
Answers:
A. Secondary syphilis – Incorrect. Secondary syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It typically presents 1 to 3 months after the appearance of the primary chancre and is characterized by a generalized papulosquamous rash. Condyloma lata, moist exophytic plaques containing spirochetes, may develop in the oral and anogenital regions.
B. Pyoderma gangrenosum – Incorrect. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis associated with a variety of systemic disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and blood dyscrasias. The classic lesion starts as a painful papule, pustule, or nodule that ulcerates with a violaceous undermined border. A rare superficial vegetative form of pyoderma gangrenosum has been described.
C. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans – Incorrect. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans, associated with inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by sterile pustules on edematous mucosa that rupture to form "snail track" erosions. Pustules and brown annular vegetating plaques may develop on the skin, particularly overlying intertriginous areas.
D. Pemphigus vegetans – Correct. Pemphigus vegetans is the rarest variant of pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune bullous disease of the mucous membranes and skin characterized by IgG autoantibodies against the keratinocyte adhesion protein desmoglein (DSG) 3. It is clinically divided into the Neumann type, with extensive often intertriginous vegetations overlying blisters and erosions as observed in this case, and the relatively benign Hallopeau type, with grouped or annular pustules progressing to verrucous cobblestoned plaques.
E. Herpes simplex virus infection – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus infection may be primary or recurrent. The classic presentation is umbilicated vesicles in the orolabial or anogenital regions that rupture to form painful ulcerations. The exophytic lesions of herpes simplex vegetans, a variant associated with immunodeficient states, can mimic verrucous carcinoma.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^112CBRBR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — history and physical examination for initial clinical diagnosis emphasizes that Key elements of the history in patients presenting with AR include seasonal, perennial or episodic, exposure-associated itching of the nose, palate, or eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, sniffing, clear rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip. Children may only complain of malaise or fatigue, often associated with a cough, and the history must include specific questions about rhinorrhea and nasal and ocular itch in order to elicit these complaints. Symptoms of other sinonasal diseases such as sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and granulomatous diseases can overlap with AR symptoms and should be differentiated from AR, and Less typical symptoms such as epistaxis, unilateral rhinorrhea, unilateral nasal blockage, severe headache, or anosmia suggest alternative diagnoses and should be investigated further. Viral upper respiratory infections may produce similar symptoms but tend to be of a shorter duration and often include other symptoms such as fever and myalgia. A family history of AR, asthma, or atopic dermatitis strengthens the diagnosis of AR in patients with compatible symptoms. Findings on physical examination that support the diagnosis of AR include several classic findings, such as clear rhinorrhea and pale pink or bluish swelling of the nasal turbinate mucosa, and Frequent throat clearing is often present as well, reflecting postnasal drip. Although definitive diagnosis depends on the finding of an IgE-mediated response to a specific allergen, detected through cutaneous or blood testing in most patients, it is reasonable to make an initial diagnosis and begin therapy based on the history and physical examination, and A good response to avoidance of suspected allergens or appropriate empiric therapy supports the diagnosis of AR and may preclude the need for further testing.

### Coxsackievirus A6-related hand foot and mouth disease: skin manifestations in a cluster of adult patients [^114EbZbr]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood manifestation of enterovirus (EV) infection. It predominantly affects young children, and has been mainly associated with coxsackievirus (CV) A16 and EV 71.

Objectives

We report an unusual cluster of adult patients with HFMD.

Study Design

Throat swabs and vesicular fluid samples obtained from patients admitted to the emergency room (ER) with HFMD were tested for EV by reverse transcription (RT)-real time PCR, and further subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

Results

CVA6 was identified as the causative agent of HFMD in five epidemiologically-unrelated adult patients (28–37 years old) admitted to the ER between December 2012 and February 2013. Phylogenetic analysis mapped the CVA6 strains into one cluster. All patients manifested with fever and a severe vasculitis-like rash, followed by spontaneous recovery.

Conclusions

This cluster identifies CVA6 as an emerging cause of HFMD of unusual age distribution, seasonality, and clinical severity, underscoring the need for continued alertness and clinical-genotypic surveillance of EV HFMD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1135UNVK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to rapid antigen detection test, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to obtain a rapid antigen detection test for GAS pharyngitis in most patients with symptoms of acute pharyngitis because the clinical features alone do not reliably discriminate between group A streptococcal and viral pharyngitis, except when overt viral features such as rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers, and/or hoarseness are present.

### Symptoms of scarlet fever | Group A strep… [^116T6hUF]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Skin rash and sore throat are common symptoms of scarlet fever.
- Physical signs of scarlet fever can appear on the tongue or skin and in the throat or neck.
- Complications aren't common after scarlet fever.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about scarlet fever. Signs and symptoms General symptoms Some symptoms of scarlet fever are common to other infections, too. These may include:

- Fever or chills
- Headache or body aches
- Nausea or vomiting
- Sore throat and pain when swallowing
- Stomach pain. Physical signs Some physical signs are typical of scarlet fever. They show in the following areas:

- Skin
- **Tongue, throat, and neck Skin Signs of scarlet fever on the skin include**:

- A red rash that feels rough like sandpaper
- Brighter red skin in the creases of the underarm, elbow, and groin
- Pale area around the mouth
- Skin peeling as the rash fades.

Tongue, throat, and neck Signs in these areas include: Early in illness: Whitish coating on the tongue Later in illness: "Strawberry" tongue
- Red and swollen tonsils
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- Very red throat
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils. How symptoms change over time Rash appears and spreads One to 2 days after the illness begins, a red rash usually appears. However, the rash can appear before illness or up to 7 days later. The rash may first appear on the neck, underarm, and groin. Over time, the rash spreads over the body. The rash usually begins as small, flat blotches that slowly become fine bumps that feel like sandpaper.

### Vaginal candidiasis (yeast… [^116qikYb]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of candidiasis depend on what part of the body is infected.
- Infections and symptoms can affect the vagina, the mouth and throat, or the esophagus.
- Invasive candidiasis causes fever and chills and can cause different symptoms if it spreads to organs, bones, or joints. Symptoms Symptoms depend on the part of the body that is infected. Different types of infections can cause similar symptoms. Healthcare providers can test to see if you have candidiasis. Vaginal candidiasis The symptoms of vaginal candidiasis include:

- Vaginal itching or soreness
- Pain during sexual intercourse
- Pain or discomfort when urinating
- Abnormal vaginal discharge Vaginal candidiasis is often mild. However, some women can develop severe infections involving redness, swelling, and cracks in the wall of the vagina.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat and esophagus Candidiasis in the mouth and throat can have many different symptoms, including:

- White patches on inner cheeks, tongue, roof of the mouth, and throat.
- Redness or soreness
- Cotton-like feeling in the mouth
- Loss of taste
- Pain while eating or swallowing
- Cracking and redness at the corners of the mouth Symptoms of candidiasis of the esophagus include pain and difficulty swallowing. Most people who get candidiasis of the esophagus also have mouth and throat infections. Invasive candidiasis Most people are not at risk for invasive candidiasis, including candidemia. People who develop invasive candidiasis are often already sick from other medical conditions, so it can be difficult to know which symptoms are related to a Candida infection. The most common symptoms of invasive candidiasis are fever and chills that don't improve after antibiotic treatment for suspected bacterial infections.

Other symptoms can develop if the infection spreads to other parts of the body, such as the heart, brain, eyes, bones, or joints.

- Symptoms often include pain and fever
- Some people are at increased risk
- A simple test gives fast results. Bacteria cause strep throat Viruses cause most sore throats. However, strep throat is an infection in the throat and tonsils caused by bacteria called group A Streptococcus. How you get strep throat Group A strep bacteria are very contagious. Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through
- Respiratory droplets
- Direct contact Rarely, group A strep bacteria can be spread through food that isn't handled properly.

It usually takes 2 to 5 days after exposure to become ill with strep throat. Respiratory droplets Group A strep bacteria often live in the nose and throat. People who are infected spread the bacteria by talking, coughing, or sneezing. This creates respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria. People can get sick if they:

- Breathe in respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria
- Touch their mouth or nose after touching something with those droplets on it
- Use the same plate, utensil, or glass as a person infected with the bacteria. Symptoms often include pain and fever In general, strep throat is a mild disease, but it can be very painful. Common symptoms may include:

- Fever
- Pain when swallowing
- Sore throat that started very quickly and may look red
- Red and swollen tonsils
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck.

Less common symptoms may include vomiting and headache Some people, especially children, may have other symptoms, too. Other symptoms may include:

- Headache
- Stomach pain
- Nausea or vomiting
- Rash.
