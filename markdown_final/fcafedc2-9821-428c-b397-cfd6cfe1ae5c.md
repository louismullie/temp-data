## Question

Allowable mme state of Florida

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the "allowable MME" in the state of Florida and how to interpret prescribing limits and thresholds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether Florida law sets a hard MME cap or only duration limits. Then, I should verify what the CDC 2022 guideline says about MME thresholds and whether those are mandatory or advisory. Next, I will check how Florida's House Bill 21 (HB21) actually restricts prescribing and whether it mentions MME. After that, I should review the evidence on overdose risk by dose and reconcile it with real-world practice. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with caveats and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the legal framework in Florida. Florida's HB21, implemented July 1, 2018, limits Schedule II opioid prescriptions for acute pain to a 3-day supply, with a 7-day supply allowed only if the prescriber documents an "acute pain exception", and it explicitly exempts chronic pain, cancer, palliative care, and certain traumatic injuries; critically, HB21 does not impose a maximum daily MME limit or a total MME cap per prescription, so there is no statutory "allowable MME" ceiling in Florida law [^115cp3qY] [^116yQaBC].

> Wait, let me verify the scope so I don't overgeneralize. HB21 applies to Schedule II opioids for acute pain and does not regulate non-Schedule II opioids or chronic pain prescriptions; thus, any MME-based thresholds for chronic therapy are not codified in Florida statute, even though clinicians may still consider professional guidelines and payer policies in practice [^115cp3qY].

> Next, I should review the CDC 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline. The CDC recommends avoiding dosage increases to 50 MME/day or higher without careful reassessment, and to avoid increasing to 90 MME/day or higher unless benefits clearly outweigh risks; importantly, these are voluntary, evidence-based recommendations intended to guide shared decision-making, not rigid legal limits, and they emphasize individualized care and risk mitigation rather than a hard cap [^112dgYFH] [^1119jbEB] [^112U4wgZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "allowable" meaning "legal". I initially thought Florida might have adopted a 90 MME/day statutory limit like some states, but that would be incorrect; Florida's law is duration-limited for acute pain and does not set an MME ceiling, so any numeric MME threshold clinicians use reflects guideline-based practice rather than state law [^115cp3qY] [^1165F243].

> I need to check the dose–risk evidence to contextualize thresholds. Multiple studies and guidelines show that overdose risk rises progressively with higher daily MME: risk approximately doubles at 50–99 MME/day and increases several-fold at 100 MME/day or more compared with less than 20 MME/day; this supports using 50 and 90 MME/day as cautionary benchmarks rather than legal cutoffs, and underscores the need for enhanced monitoring, naloxone, and reassessment as doses approach or exceed these levels [^113hBnpt] [^112dgYFH] [^1119jbEB].

> Let me consider real-world impacts in Florida to ensure I'm not missing unintended effects. After HB21, studies show reductions in days' supply and total MME per prescription for acute pain, with no increase in emergency department visits or additional prescriptions in several settings, suggesting that duration limits can reduce exposure without worsening short-term outcomes; however, these studies do not demonstrate a state-imposed MME cap because none exists in Florida law [^116yQaBC] [^113hHXTr] [^112HdjTm].

> I should double-check chronic pain guidance so I don't understate complexity. For chronic non-cancer pain, professional societies advise using the lowest effective dose, generally avoiding escalation beyond 50–90 MME/day, and implementing risk mitigation at or above 50 MME/day; again, these are clinical recommendations, not Florida statutory limits, and they call for shared decision-making, functional goals, and periodic reassessment rather than automatic dose reductions [^112dgYFH] [^1119jbEB] [^112U4wgZ].

> But wait, what if a payer or health system imposes its own MME limits? I need to ensure I distinguish law from policy. Some insurers and health systems operationalize 50 or 90 MME/day thresholds for prior authorization or safety triggers; these are contractual or institutional policies and do not create a state-law "allowable MME" in Florida, though they can shape prescribing behavior in practice [^111tyEBH].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. In Florida, there is no statutorily defined "allowable MME" cap; HB21 restricts Schedule II opioid duration for acute pain to 3 days (extendable to 7 days with documentation), while chronic pain prescribing is not limited by MME in state law. Clinicians should apply CDC 2022 guidance to avoid routine escalation beyond 50 MME/day and to justify doses at or above 90 MME/day with careful risk–benefit assessment, enhanced monitoring, and overdose risk mitigation, recognizing these as professional standards rather than legal mandates [^115cp3qY] [^112dgYFH] [^1119jbEB].

---

Florida does not have a **statutory MME limit** for opioid prescriptions. The state's main restriction is a **3-day supply limit** for acute pain prescriptions, extendable to 7 days with documentation [^115cp3qY] [^116yQaBC]. For chronic pain, there is **no legal MME cap**, but prescribers should follow clinical guidelines that recommend caution at or above 50 MME/day and avoid exceeding 90 MME/day without strong justification [^112dgYFH] [^1119jbEB]. Prescribers must also consult the PDMP and document medical necessity for higher doses [^notfound].

---

## Florida's opioid prescribing laws and regulations

Florida's opioid prescribing laws focus on **duration limits** for acute pain and do not impose a specific MME limit:

- **House Bill 21 (HB 21)**: Effective July 1, 2018, HB 21 limits the supply of Schedule II opioids for acute pain to 3 days, extendable to 7 days only if the prescriber documents medical necessity [^115cp3qY] [^116yQaBC].

- **Exemptions**: The law does not apply to chronic pain, cancer pain, palliative care, or traumatic injuries with an Injury Severity Score of 9 or greater [^115cp3qY].

- **PDMP requirement**: Prescribers must consult the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) before prescribing controlled substances [^11547cXQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Although Florida law does not set an MME limit, clinical guidelines provide **evidence-based recommendations**:

- **CDC guideline**: Recommends caution when prescribing opioids at or above 50 MME/day and advises against exceeding 90 MME/day without strong justification [^112dgYFH] [^1119jbEB].

- **VA/DoD guideline**: Emphasizes individualized dosing, with careful risk assessment and monitoring, and does not specify a hard MME limit [^115MbDpF].

- **ASIPP guideline**: Recommends low-dose opioid therapy with careful monitoring and risk mitigation strategies [^115QgzpJ].

---

## Risks associated with high MME prescriptions

Higher opioid doses are associated with **increased risks** of overdose, misuse, and adverse effects:

- **Overdose risk**: Increases progressively with higher doses, particularly at or above 50 MME/day [^113hBnpt].

- **Misuse and dependence**: Higher doses are associated with increased risk of opioid use disorder and dependence [^1154BiF8].

- **Adverse effects**: Higher doses increase risks of respiratory depression, sedation, and other serious adverse effects [^1119jbEB].

---

## Monitoring and documentation requirements

Prescribers in Florida must adhere to **monitoring and documentation requirements**:

- **PDMP checks**: Required before prescribing controlled substances [^11547cXQ].

- **Medical necessity**: Documentation of medical necessity is required for prescriptions exceeding the acute pain supply limits [^115cp3qY].

- **Patient assessment**: Regular assessment of pain, function, and risk factors is recommended, especially at higher doses [^112U4wgZ].

---

## Comparison with other states

Several states have implemented **specific MME limits**, whereas Florida has not:

| **State** | **Mme limit** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Rhode Island | 30 MME/day for acute pain | Strict enforcement |
| Massachusetts | 100 MME/day for chronic pain | Requires consultation |
| Washington | 120 MME/day | Requires specialist consultation |
| Florida | No specific MME limit | Focuses on duration limits |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Florida does not have a **statutory MME limit** for opioid prescriptions. Prescribers should follow clinical guidelines recommending caution at or above 50 MME/day and avoid exceeding 90 MME/day without strong justification. Regular monitoring, PDMP checks, and documentation of medical necessity are essential to safe prescribing practices.

### Safety concerns with the centers for disease control opioid calculator [^111sXnpi]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Morphine milligram equivalence (MME) and other comparable acronyms have been employed in federal pain guidelines and used by policy makers to limit opioid prescribing.–On March 18, 2016, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guidelines provided 12 recommendations for "primary care clinicians prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care". One of the CDC recommendations states that clinicians "should avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day".

There has been controversy regarding the methodology used to develop the CDC opioid prescribing guidelines, including concern regarding the bias of the guideline committees due to its domination by the anti-opioid group, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. The CDC used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for producing evidence-based recommendations; however, the guidelines deviated significantly from the established GRADE methodology without associated justification. There is a significant mismatch in the strength of the recommendations made in the guidelines and the supporting evidence. When considering that all recommendations were based on level 3 or 4 evidence yet eleven of the recommendations were assigned grade A, this is a major deviation from the National Clearing House guidelines on levels of evidence and grades of recommendations. The CDC guidelines excluded studies with observation periods of less than 1 year for basing their recommendations on the benefits and risks of opioids. According to the CDC guidelines, "No evidence shows a long-term benefit of opioids in pain and function versus no opioids for chronic pain with outcomes examined at least 1 year later". This is inconsistent with current standards on analgesic study durations in chronic pain. The international harmonized standards adopted by the United States for approval of chronic pain interventions recommend 12 weeks for efficacy assessment. Tayeb et al conducted a review evaluating analgesic trial durations for opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and behavioral therapy. The authors found that nearly all trials had active treatment durations of 12 weeks or less across 869 articles. Commenting on CDC's recommendation on nonopioid therapies, Tayeb et al wrote, "if a one year minimum threshold for duration of active treatment were required to justify using any of the major typical therapies for chronic pain, then none of these nonopioid therapies could be recommended".

Introduction

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were nearly 47,000 poisoning deaths involving opioids in 2018. Opioids accounted for almost 70% of all overdose (poisoning) deaths that year (n = 67,367). In recent years, both national and state-level regulations and statutory actions have been enacted to address opioid prescribing and dispensing behaviors to mitigate the risk of opioid-related harms. As of February 2020, 37 states have enacted exposure-avoidance policies to limit either opioid prescription days' supply or morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) for the treatment of acute pain conditions, with the majority of these laws enacted since 2018. The state of Florida implemented House Bill 21 (HB21) on July 1, 2018, which limited the days' supply of Schedule II opioids (e.g. hydrocodone) to3 days for a prescription for patients with acute pain, in most cases. The prescription may extend to a 7-day's supply if the prescriber documents this as an "acute pain exception". The acute pain definition in Florida statute exempts pain related to cancer, terminal conditions, incurable or progressive illnesses during palliative care, or traumatic injury with an Injury Severity Score of 9 or greater.HB21 contains no limitations on the days' supply of opioids prescribed for non-acute pain (i.e. chronic pain) outside of the current federal regulations or on non-Schedule II opioids. HB21 does not impose limitations to prescribed dosage strength (MMEs) or number of units dispensed.

### Opioid taper practices among clinicians [^115agBbx]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The target audience for these guidelines was primary care providers treating chronic pain patients. The guidelines provided recommendations to limit morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and, more specifically, to avoid increasing > 90 mg/day without careful justification or guidance as to how to taper patients to these doses. Statements regarding MME are concerning as they were made without acknowledging the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability among different opioids. The guidelines also failed to note the variability among MME calculations/calculators which limits standardized conversion from one opioid to another. Subsequent data has indicated that providers, payers and policy makers have misapplied these recommendations. For this reason we have included questions pertaining to comfort level tapering at various MME in the survey.

Prior to and in response to these guidelines several states passed laws establishing maximum daily doses for opioids and many third-party payers have followed suit by limiting coverage based on maximum MMEs. Individual providers have often erred by applying the guidelines inflexibly and without regard for patient specific factors. Others have misapplied the recommendations to populations beyond the scope of the guideline such as those with cancer, those receiving medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction or post-surgical patients. In a commentary published approximately three years after the writing of the guidelines two of the authors commented that better evidence is needed to guide clinical decisions regarding when and how to reduce high dose opioids for patients receiving long term therapy. These laws and plan limitations pose multiple problems in our health care system including limiting patient access to necessary medications, potentially putting patients in danger of opioid withdrawal if their therapy is abruptly discontinued, and increased suicidality.

Prescription opioids and opioid epidemic — United States prescription trends show declines in morphine milligram equivalents (MME) dispensed and in high daily-dose segments. Use of prescription opioids, measured by MME dispensed, increased from 27 billion MME in 1992 to 246 billion MME in 2011, then decreased to an estimated 100 billion MME in 2020. From 2018 to 2019, every state experienced a decline in MME per capita, and declines were largest in states that previously had the highest rates of opioid prescribing. Segmented by daily MME, 2011–2019 changes were a 70% decline for 90+ MME per day, 52% for 50 to 90 MME per day, 32% for 20 to 50 MME per day, and 11% for less than 20 MME per day; the figure shows a total -51% change. CDC dispensing data are available from 2006 to 2020 at national, state (per 100 persons), and county levels.

Change in Morphine Milligram Equivalents

Prior to HB21, there was a decreasing trend in MMEs per day (rate of −.09 MMEs per study month, 95% CI −.16, −.04 MMEs per study month) (P = 0.002) with a mean MMEs per day of 34.7 for all opioids during the study period; following implementation there was a non-significant increase in MMEs for all opioids to 37.4 (change of 2.69 MMEs, 95% CI −.51, 5.89 MMEs) (P = 0.105) (Table 1; Figure 2). However, after incorporating the total MMEs (MMEs multiplied by days' supply), there was an immediate mean reduction of 25.6 MMEs per prescription (95% CI −44.76, −6.44 MMEs) (P < .001, Figure 2). For hydrocodone-containing products, there was an immediate significant reduction of 24.2 mean MMEs per prescription (95% CI −39.8, −8.7 MMEs) (P = 0.004). Similarly, for oxycodone-containing products, there was an immediate significant reduction of 38.9 mean MMEs per prescription (95% CI −73.3, −4.4 MMEs) (P = 0.032) (Supplementary material). There were no statistically significant changes in MMEs for non-Schedule II opioids.

### Changes in quantity of opioids dispensed following Florida's restriction law for acute pain prescriptions [^113U7MP5]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Legislative policies that limit both the allowed MMEs and the total day's supply to be prescribed for new prescription orders for Schedule II controlled substances indicated for acute pain exist in other states in the United States (Arizona, Maine, Nevada, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Vermont). In addition to those 7 states mentioned above that have legislation restricting both the MME/day and the day's supply of initial opioid prescriptions that can be prescribed, there are currently a total of 30 other states in the United States that have legislation in place restricting only the day's supply allowed to be prescribed for initial opioid prescriptions. Some states with unique legislation include Pennsylvania with a 7-day's supply limit only in Schedule II prescriptions prescribed to children, Maryland with a requirement for health professionals to prescribe the lowest effective dose of an opioid, and Illinois with a maximum day's supply limit of 30 days.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^112eaxGM]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP dose descriptions — morphine milligram equivalents (MME) thresholds and overdose risk note that, with overwhelming evidence for the risk of misuse and limited efficacy of chronic opioid therapy, the rationale for high-dose opioids is limited and absolute MME cut offs remain inconsistent. Generally, patients who do not respond to low or medium opioid doses are unlikely to respond to higher doses. Guidance thresholds cited include State of Washington advice that the daily dose of opioids should not exceed 120 mg of MME; American Pain Society/AAPM defining "high doses" as 100 mg MME; CDC guidelines recommended a limit of 50–90 MME; ASIPP designation of low dose as 40 MME; and a Canadian "watchful dose" at 200 MME. Reported overdose risk signals include increased risk when dose is equivalent to 50 MME or higher, a 9-fold increase in overdoses at higher doses of opioids (> 100 MME) versus lower doses (< 20 MME), greater overdose risk if daily doses are above 40 MME, and much higher overdose death rates at higher doses (200–400 MME) and at very high doses > 400 MME).

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### Physician dispensing of oxycodone and other commonly used opioids, 2000–2015, United States [^113PfKNc]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

An average of 91 people in the United States die every day from an opioid-related overdose (including prescription opioids and heroin). The direct dispensing of opioids from health care practitioner offices has been linked to opioid-related harms. The objective of this study is to describe the changing nature of the volume of this type of prescribing at the state level.

Methods

This descriptive study examines the distribution of opioids by practitioners using 1999–2015 Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System data. Analyses were restricted to opioids distributed to practitioners. Amount distributed (morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs]) and number of practitioners are presented.

Results

Patterns of distribution to practitioners and the number of practitioners varied markedly by state and changed dramatically over time. Comparing 1999 with 2015, the MME distributed to dispensing practitioners decreased in 16 states and increased in 35. Most notable was the change in Florida, which saw a peak of 8.94 MMEs per 100,000 persons in 2010 (the highest distribution in all states in all years) and a low of 0.08 in 2013.

Discussion

This study presents the first state estimates of office-based dispensing of opioids. Increases in direct dispensing in recent years may indicate a need to monitor this practice and consider whether changes are needed. Using controlled substances data to identify high prescribers and dispensers of opioids, as well as examining overall state trends, is a foundational activity to informing the response to potentially high-risk clinical practices.

Opioid dosing considerations — MME guidance does not apply to opioid use disorder: Guidelines for morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for chronic pain are not applicable to opioid use disorder; higher MME dosages are necessary and clinically indicated, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifically advises against misapplication of chronic pain guidelines to patients receiving or starting treatment for opioid use disorder.

### Changes in quantity of opioids dispensed following Florida's restriction law for acute pain prescriptions [^113hHXTr]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of Florida's 3-day opioid prescription supply law, effective July 2018, on opioids dispensed for acute pain patients.

Methods

Pharmacy claims from a health plan serving a large Florida employer from January 2015 through March 2019 were analyzed. We used an interrupted time series study design accounting for autocorrelation of trends before and after policy change. Acute pain patients met inclusion criteria if they had not received any opioid containing medications in the past 180days. Patients could contribute to additional new use time if subsequent opioid claims occurred ≥ 180days since the previous claim. Outcomes included mean number of units dispensed of the initial opioid prescription, mean morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per day of initial prescription by month, and mean total MMEs per initial prescription by month.

Results

A total of 8,375 enrollees had 10,583 unique opioid starts in the given timeframe. Following the policy, there was an immediate significant decrease in the units dispensed per prescription of 4.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] -8.95, -.82 units). Additionally, there was a significant immediate reduction in total MMEs dispensed per prescription of 25.6 (95% CI -44.76, -6.44 MMEs).

Conclusions

Among a group of privately-insured plan enrollees in Florida, and as a result of the law, there were significant decreases in the number of units dispensed, and total MMEs of opioid prescriptions. The immediate reduction in new opioid utilization following policy implementation suggests effective policy; however, impacts on chronic pain patients were not assessed.

### Impact of opioid dose reduction on individuals with chronic pain: results of an online survey [^117Xmq77]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline on opioid prescribing suggests that clinicians "should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully reassess the evidence of individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, and should avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day". These recommendations are presented as "voluntary, rather than prescriptive standards", and the guideline asserts that "clinical decision-making should be based on a relationship between the clinician and patient and an understanding of the patient's clinical situation, functioning, and life context".

The American Medical Association (AMA) has expressed concerns about the CDC guideline, including the potential for insurers and other payers to consider guideline recommendations as inflexible rules, rather than points for prescribers to consider, and use the recommendations to deny coverage. The guideline recommendations also may be used by pharmacies to deny prescriptions that exceed the recommended thresholds. State medical board opioid guidelines (eg, guidelines from the Federation of State Medical Boards)discourage clinicians from prescribing opioid dosages higher than the CDC guideline thresholds, and some payer policieslink the guideline to supply limits for opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain. As a result, the guideline may have unintended consequences of not only creating barriers to initial prescription but also disrupting care in otherwise stable patients, even though the guideline itself notes that the dosing recommendations are less applicable to established patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy. Furthermore, reports from patients and health care providers corroborate the concerns about CDC guidelines expressed by the AMA.

The objective of this study, which was conducted after the publication of the CDC guidelines, was to assess the incidence and impact of opioid dose reduction on patients with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy.

### State-to-state variation in opioid dispensing changes following the release of the 2016 CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^111wSaz7]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

High-Dose Dispensing Rate

There was a national baseline of approximately 700 high-dose prescriptions each month per 100 000 population. Prior to the 2016 CDC Guideline release there was a national average decrease of 3.52 high-dose prescriptions per 100 000 population, and that rate of decrease more than doubled, to 7.63, following the guideline release (β₃ = −4.11; 95% CI, −4.73 to −3.49). A large majority of states (48 of 51 [94%]) had a statistically significant change in the slope of the high-dosage (90 MME/d or higher) dispensing rate (Figure 4). Florida was the only state with a negative preguideline slope that showed a statistically significant shallowing (ie, decrease in magnitude) during the postguideline period (ie, prescribing rates were declining at a slower rate following the 2016 CDC Guideline release); following the 2016 CDC Guideline release, all other states had either an acceleration of the preguideline decreasing trend or a reversal of the increasing trend (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). Additionally, the Midwest was the only region showing statistically significant postguideline slope changes in all states (eTable 2 in Supplement 1), with magnitudes ranging from 1.11 to 7.94 (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). Of note, the trend difference was the smallest for DC, where the preguideline decreasing slope of 1.04 prescriptions per 100 000 per month changed to a decreasing slope of 1.76 prescriptions 100 000 per month in the postguideline period. The largest change was seen in Maine, where the monthly decrease of 2.83 high-dosage prescriptions per 100 000 persons further changed more than 6-fold to a 16.51-monthly decrease.

### Damaging state legislation regarding opioids: the need to scrutinize sources of inaccurate information provided to lawmakers [^116nywC6]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Contrary to popular belief, ill-informed state legislation may be more responsible for the current plight of patients with pain than is the oft-blamed CDC Guideline, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, or regulations imposed on physicians by state medical boards. Gilson and Rich have recently noted that state laws regarding opioid prescribing, unlike federal laws, generally fail to recognize the importance of opioid analgesia to public health. Consequently, a great deal of individual state legislation pertaining to opioid prescribing that "misses the forest for the trees" has been passed and enacted. For example, the state of Rhode Island instituted a law in 2017, limiting daily prescription of opioids for acute pain to 30 milligrams morphine equivalents (MME). Besides being arbitrary and without evidence-basis, this law fails to take into account that "a regulatory approach that takes into account prescriber intent and patient-specific factors that influence prescribing is likely more effective than a strict limitation on the amount or duration of opioid prescribing".

### State-to-state variation in opioid dispensing changes following the release of the 2016 CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^114Gdhf2]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Mean MME per Capita

The mean per capita MME dispensed in early 2012 was approximately 62.2. Similar to the other outcomes, mean MME per capita was decreasing nationally prior to the guideline release (0.22 MME per capita per month), and that rate of decrease more than doubled (0.58 MME per capita per month) following the guideline release (β₃ = −0.36; 95% CI, −0.42 to −0.30). There were 50 states (98%) with a statistically significant reduction in the mean MME per capita slope following the 2016 CDC Guideline release (Figure 5). As with the other outcomes, most of these changes reflected an acceleration of preexisting decreasing trends (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). Of note, all states in the Northeast, Midwest, and West regions observed statistically significant slope changes toward reduced dispensing (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Additionally, the smallest slope change was seen in Hawaii (the monthly slope changed from −0.28 preguideline to −0.35 postguideline), while the largest change was in Arkansas, where a nearly flat preguideline slope shifted to a decreasing slope of 0.86 MME per capita per month.

Figure 5.
Estimated State-Level Change of the Mean Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) per Capita Slope Following the 2016 CDC Guideline Release

States are colored relative to the magnitude of estimated mean MME per capita slope changes from the preguideline to the postguideline period. Darker colors correspond to larger changes (preguideline slope – postguideline slope) in the slope. Changes were not statistically significant for Florida.

Baseline Dispensing Rates and Postguideline Changes

In eFigure 5 in Supplement 1 we show scatterplots of the dispensing rates in each state in January 2012 vs the postguideline slope change. We observed weak Pearson correlations for the overall dispensing rate (R² = 0.08), high-dose dispensing rate (R² = 0.03), and the mean MME per capita (R² = 0.05), suggesting that the baseline dispensing rate was negligibly associated with the postguideline slope change for those outcomes. For long-acting dispensing there was a larger effect size for the association (R² = 0.36), showing that states with larger dispensing rates in January 2012 tended to have larger postguideline slope changes.

### Changes in opioid use after Florida's restriction law for acute pain prescriptions [^116yQaBC]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Several US states have enacted laws to limit either opioid prescription days' supply or morphine milligram equivalents for the treatment of acute pain. On July 1, 2018, Florida implemented House Bill 21 (HB21), which limits the days' supply of Schedule II opioids to 3 days for acute pain prescriptions. Prescribers can extend to a 7-day supply if they document an exception. This quality improvement study aims to assess the outcomes associated with Florida's restriction law on opioid prescribing by evaluating the number of new opioid users and the number of units dispensed per prescription before and after the policy change.

### Changes in quantity of opioids dispensed following Florida's restriction law for acute pain prescriptions [^116PfUDN]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study documents an immediate and significant decrease in the number of units dispensed per opioid prescription and total number of MMEs per prescription following the implementation of a 3-days' supply opioid prescription policy in Florida within a large employer-provided health plan, while controlling for previous trends in opioid utilization. These findings were consistent for opioids overall, but the magnitude of the observed effect was larger for Schedule II opioids, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, than for non-Schedule II opioids. There are few evaluations of this or similar policies by which to compare these findings. Dave and colleagues also reported a reduction in total MMEs of opioid prescriptions in an analysis of commercial prescription claims from three states, where each of these states implemented seven-days' supply restrictions in 2016. These findings align with that report.

When extrapolating the observed reduction in the mean number of units dispensed per prescription (4.9) to the approximately 3.5 million individuals in Florida who would be categorized as opioid naive new users in 2016 (according to our definition and as calculated in previously published reports), we estimate that this policy may result in an approximate reduction of 17 million units of opioids available in the community in the first year following implementation in Florida alone. In fact, the annual report for the Florida's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (E-FORCSE) indicates that across the state, there were significant reductions in opioid supply.

The intention of this policy was to restrict initial Schedule II opioid prescriptions for acute pain indications, but one potential unintended consequence resulting from quantity restrictions could be an observed increase in the number of doses per day within the shortened prescription duration. The slight increase in observed MMEs per prescription in this study, which is a marker of this unintended consequence, was nonsignificant, and ultimately the reduction in days' supply was more impactful than adjustments to doses per day within prescriptions. There are also numerous other potential unintended consequences that may arise from this or similar prescription opioid restriction policies.

### Effect of Florida's prescription drug monitoring program and pill mill laws on opioid prescribing and use [^116jZ415]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) and pill mill laws are among the principal means states use to reduce prescription drug abuse and diversion, yet little high-quality evidence exists regarding their effect.

Objective

To quantify the effect of Florida's PDMP and pill mill laws on overall and high-risk opioid prescribing and use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We applied comparative interrupted time-series analyses to IMS Health LifeLink LRx data to characterize the effect of PDMP and pill mill law implementation on a closed cohort of prescribers, retail pharmacies, and patients from July 2010 through September 2012 in Florida (intervention state) compared with Georgia (control state). We conducted sensitivity analyses, including varying length of observation and modifying requirements for continuous observation of individuals throughout the study period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Total opioid volume, mean morphine milligram equivalent (MME) per transaction, mean days' supply per transaction, and total number of opioid prescriptions dispensed. Analyses were conducted per prescriber and per patient, in aggregate and after stratifying by volume of baseline opioid prescribing for prescribers and use for patients.

Results

From July 2010 through September 2012, a cohort of 2.6 million patients, 431,890 prescribers, and 2829 pharmacies was associated with approximately 480 million prescriptions in Florida and Georgia, 7.7% of which were for opioids. Total monthly opioid volume, MME per transaction, days' supply, and prescriptions dispensed were higher in Florida than Georgia before implementation. Florida's laws were associated with statistically significant declines in opioid volume (2.5 kg/mo, P < .05; equivalent to approximately 500,000 5-mg tablets of hydrocodone bitartrate per month) and MME per transaction (0.45 mg/mo, P < .05), without any change in days' supply. Twelve months after implementation, the policies were associated with approximately a 1.4% decrease in opioid prescriptions, 2.5% decrease in opioid volume, and 5.6% decrease in MME per transaction. Reductions were limited to prescribers and patients with the highest baseline opioid prescribing and use. Sensitivity analyses, varying time windows, and enrollment criteria supported the main results.

Conclusions and Relevance

Florida's PDMP and pill mill laws were associated with modest decreases in opioid prescribing and use. Decreases were greatest among prescribers and patients with the highest baseline opioid prescribing and use.

### Trends in use of prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications before vs after implementation of a Florida law restricting opioid prescribing for acute pain [^115Ag1oi]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

In light of continued increases in opioid-related overdose deaths in the US, many state governments have enacted legislation intended to reduce the opioid prescription supply. Recent datashow that most opioid-related deaths are associated with use of nonprescription opioids (ie, illicit sources such as fentanyl and heroin products); however, more than half of all states have enacted legislation to restrict opioid prescribing or dispensing for acute pain indications. Many states have adopted legislation that restricts first-time opioid prescriptions to a certain number of days' supply or the total morphine milligram equivalent of the prescription. The laws vary from state to state, and Tennessee, Kentucky, and Florida currently have the strictest policies.

On July 1, 2018, Florida implemented House Bill 21 (HB21), which limited the prescription of a Schedule II controlled substance to a 3-day supply or, in certain cases, a 7-day supply. Previous research, has shown that the number of days' supply per prescription and first-time opioid use decreased after implementation of the law, leading to a lower supply of opioids in the state, as intended by the bill. A retrospective studyevaluating prescription patterns for acute pain after surgery found no increase in the percentage of patients visiting the emergency department postoperatively for pain control immediately after the law was implemented, but limited evidence is available to examine pain management for other conditions after opioid restrictions. Therefore, it is still unclear whether prescription opioid restriction legislation has unintended consequences for patients requiring analgesics.

### Standardizing research methods for opioid dose comparison: the NIH HEAL morphine milligram equivalent calculator [^112XFhiA]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We developed the National Institutes of Health helping to end addiction long-term initiative morphine milligram equivalent (MME) calculator to standardize MME calculations across pain research studies, addressing a critical barrier to effective research synthesis and meta-analysis. The tool provides evidence-based mapping factors for 29 opioids through a research electronic data capture-based calculator and companion Web site (research-mme.wakehealth.edu). Development involved systematic evidence evaluation of literature from 1949 to March 2024, following PRISMA guidelines. From an initial screening of over 170,050 articles, we identified 24 studies providing evidence for conversion factors. The calculator incorporates 4 standardized time-window calculation methods aligned with current research approaches and includes traditional full agonists, partial agonists, and mixed-mechanism agents. Using modified GRADE methodology, we evaluated evidence quality for each conversion factor, documenting levels from high-quality randomized controlled trials to pharmacokinetic extrapolation. Our tool replicates most existing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conversion factors while expanding coverage to 7 additional opioids and 6 formulations not included in the 2022 CDC conversion table. The calculator features options to analyze results with or without buprenorphine, accommodating its emerging role in pain research. This standardized framework enables researchers to map opioid doses using consistent, evidence-based ratios and harmonize data collection across research networks. While the tool represents a significant advance in standardizing MME calculations for research, limitations in the underlying evidence base highlight the need for continued validation through clinical research.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^115gGVWw]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid dose–risk evidence indicates that higher morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and tramadol dosing are associated with adverse outcomes. In patients on moderate doses (< 200 MME), an overdose rate of 7.92 (9.94 per 1,000 population) was reported, and patients receiving > 120 MME per day were more likely to have drug-related encounters than those getting lower doses. Implementation of guidelines that considered 120 MME as a high dose reduced overall opioids per day by 27% and long-acting Schedule II opioids by 37% among those on > 120 MME per day, and the number of deaths was reduced by 50% from 2009 to 2010. High dose tramadol (> 400 mg) showed an increasing frequency of adverse effects with 2 patients experiencing seizures. Doses > 100 MME per day have not been validated in clinical trials and should be considered excessive, and available literature correlates increasing mortality with increasing doses.

### Laws limiting prescribing and dispensing of opioids in the United States, 1989–2019 [^1165F243]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Opioid overdose is a public health emergency in the United States. In an attempt to reduce potentially inappropriate opioid prescribing, many US states have adopted legal restrictions on the ability of medical professionals to prescribe or dispense opioids for pain. This review describes the major elements of relevant US state laws and the ways in which they have changed over time.

Methods

Systematic legal review in which two trained legal researchers collected and reviewed all US state laws that limit the amount or duration of opioids that medical professionals may prescribe or dispense for pain. These laws were then coded on a set of pre-selected measures, including when the law was enacted, dosage and duration limits imposed, circumstances in which the restrictions do not apply and whether additional requirements or restrictions apply to prescriptions issued to minors.

Results

The number of US states with opioid limitation laws increased from 10 in 2016 to 39 by the end of 2019. The provisions of these laws vary between states and have shifted within states over time. At the end of 2019 the modal duration limit was 7 days, with a range of 3 to 31. Fourteen states imposed limits on the dosage of opioids that can be prescribed, ranging from 30 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) to a 120 MME daily maximum. In 16 states, different limits apply to prescriptions issued to minors.

Conclusions

The number of US states with opioid limitation laws nearly quadrupled between 2016 and 2019, with a great amount of heterogeneity between state restrictions and changes over time.

### Relationship between high-risk patients receiving prescription opioids and high-volume opioid prescribers [^117Q7cpV]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

(1) To characterize the amount of prescription opioids prescribed for high-risk patients by low-volume prescribers; (2) to quantify how high- and low-volume prescribers differ systematically in their prescribing patterns.

Design

Cross-sectional study using 2015 longitudinal, all-payer QuintilesIMS pharmacy claims. We conducted an aggregated analysis for the first aim and an individual-level analysis for the second aim.

Setting

California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, and Washington, USA.

Participants

Among 4046275 patients, we identified 375848 concomitant users (filling more than 30-days of concomitant opioids and benzodiazepines), 150814 chronic users (using 100+ morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per day for more than 90 days), and 3190 patients prescribed opioids by > 3 prescribers and filling opioids at > 3 pharmacies during any 90-day period. Among 192126 prescribers, we identified 8023 high-volume prescribers, who comprised the highest fifth percentile of opioid volume during four calendar quarters.

Measurements

(1) MME dose per transaction, (2) days supplied per transaction, (3) total opioid volume per patient and (4) number of prescriptions per patient. We also examined differences in opioid dispensing between high- and low-volume prescribers among patients receiving opioids from both.

Findings

Low-volume prescribers accounted for 15–29% of opioid volume and 18–56% of opioid prescriptions for high-risk patients, compared with 28–37% and 53–58% for low-risk patients. After accounting for state of residence, comorbid burden, prescriber specialty and care sequence, patients were more likely to receive higher doses (60.9 versus 53.2 MMEs per day, P < 0.01), longer supplies (22.1 versus 15.6 days, P < 0.01), more prescriptions (4.0 versus 2.6 prescriptions, P < 0.01) and greater opioid volume (5.6 versus 1.9 g, P < 0.01) from high- than low-volume prescribers.

Conclusions

In the United States, high-risk patients obtain a substantial proportion of prescription opioids from low-volume prescribers. The differences in prescribing patterns between high- and low-volume prescribers suggest the importance of interventions targeting prescriber behaviors.

### Opioid moderatism and the imperative of rapprochement in pain medicine [^113aKXvm]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Washington State's Medical Director of workers compensation began his war on opioids in 2005, publishing a retrospective study in which he and his colleagues found a positive correlation between high-dosage opioids and overdose death in workers compensation patients. In 2007, a group that he led developed an "educational" opioid prescribing guideline, followed by a "recommended" guideline in 2010and an updated guideline in 2015. Each iteration was more restrictive regarding its recommended arbitrary opioid limits or "triggers" than the previous one, and was based on "consensus" rather than "evidence". Although these guidelines were promoted as "voluntary", their "chilling effect" resulted in widespread fear among Washington physicians, thereby reducing prescribing.

As soon as the 2015 Washington State guideline was published, many of its authors began working with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on its 2016 guideline, which was also touted as "voluntary". However, even before it was released, concerns were expressed that its intention was to become de facto law: "In fact, the CDC imprimatur makes it more likely that these guidelines become de facto requirements through adoption by state health departments, professional licensing bodies or insurers". Tragically, this is what appears to have happened, in state legislatures, state medical boards, and among both private and public insurers. State legislatures have already passed draconian legislation mandatorily limiting opioid dosing for acute pain, with no evidence of societal benefit. For example, Florida recently enacted a law that generally limits duration of opioid prescription for acute pain to 3 days, without regard for elderly, impoverished patients who may not have transportation to get new prescriptions as well as not being able to afford additional copays. Similar legislation was already in place in Kentucky. The law in Florida becomes potentially even more destructive, in that it requires that all prescribers take a 2-hour continuing education course on the law at each license renewal in order to maintain their controlled substance licenses. This type of overreaching legislation may discourage some physicians from prescribing controlled substances altogether. Although no state has yet passed legislation that limits MME below levels recommended by the CDC guideline, states are writing guidelines and laws that require prescribers to consult with a "pain specialist" in order to prescribe MME well below those recommended by the CDC guideline. Given the shortage of board-certified pain specialists and that primary care physicians are generally ill-equipped and poorly supported, this may pose a problem, particularly in rural and other underserved areas. Perhaps one of the best known of such laws is that of Indiana, stipulating that after 3 months of a mere 15 MME, a "trigger" necessitating that prescribers alter their standard prescribing practices goes into effect. Although there appears to be considerable "internet chatter" regarding individual state legislatures passing de jure laws creating "hard ceilings" for opioid MMEs, any such laws, at this point, are de facto rather than de jure. Unfortunately, anecdotally, patients in numerous states are being told by their physicians that they have to cut back their opioid dosages due to state laws requiring them to do so, which is inaccurate and disingenuous.

### Changes in initial opioid prescribing practices after the 2016 release of the CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^1156WtBq]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the "Guideline For Prescribing Opioids For Chronic Pain" (hereafter, CDC guideline) in 2016, but its association with prescribing practices for patients who are opioid naive is unknown.

Objective

To estimate changes in initial prescribing rates, duration, and dosage practices to patients who are opioid naive after the release of the CDC guideline.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used 6 sequential cohorts to estimate preguideline trends in prescribing among patients who were opioid naive, project that trend forward, and compare it with postguideline prescribing practices. Participants included commercially insured adults without current cancer or hospice care diagnoses and with no past-year opioid claims in the US from 2011 to 2017. All adjusted models were controlled for patient demographics and state-fixed effects. Data were analyzed from January 2020 to May 2021.

Exposures

The release of the CDC guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Indicators of any opioid prescription fills during a 9-month period, the number of days' supply of the initial prescription, and the binary indicator of whether the initial prescription was for 50 or more morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per day.

Results

There were 12 870 612 eligible unique patients across cohorts (mean [SD] age in 2016, 51.2 [18.7] years; 6 553 458 [50.9%] women); and the mean (SD) age of the cohorts increased annually, from 48.7 (17.9) years in the April 2011 to December 2012 cohort to 51.9 (19.2) years in the April 2016 to December 2017 cohort. The postguideline prescribing prevalence was 532 962 of 5 834 088 individuals (9.1%), which exceeded that projected from the preguideline trend, estimated at 9.0% (95% CI, 9.0%-9.1%). Among patients receiving prescriptions during follow-up, adjusted mean days' supply was 4.7% (95% CI, 4.3%-5.1%) lower in the first year after release of the guideline and 9.8% (95% CI, 9.3%-10.3%) lower in the second year after release, compared with the expected rate from the preguideline trend. The adjusted odds of receiving a high-dose (ie, ≥ 50 MME/d) initial prescription were lower in the first year (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96–0.98) and in the second year (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93–0.96) after the release of the CDC guideline compared with the odds expected from the preguideline trend.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that patients who were opioid naive continued to initiate opioid therapy after the release of opioid prescribing guidelines by the CDC, but trends in prescribing duration reversed and decreased, after increasing in each of 4 preguideline cohorts examined. High-dose prescribing rates were already decreasing, but those trends accelerated after the CDC guideline release. These results suggest that nonmandatory, evidence-based guidelines from trusted sources were associated with prescribing practices. Guideline-concordant care has potential to improve pain management and reduce opioid-related harms.

### Changes in quantity of opioids dispensed following Florida's restriction law for acute pain prescriptions [^114XTCpe]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent paper that evaluated the impact on opioid restricting policies in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York, all with a seven-day restriction on new opioid prescriptions, identified reductions in prescription duration immediately following implementation, along with reductions of MMEs in the subsequent months. These new laws, along with similarly structured payer and health-system restriction policies, have the potential to impact care decisions and access to opioid therapies for several million patients.

Our previous evaluation of the Florida HB21 law showed a significant decrease in both the number of opioid users and the number of days supplied among amongst a population of enrollees in a single health plan who were classified as new users of opioids. We found that the incidence of opioid use decreased immediately following the policy to 4.6 per 1,000 enrollees (change of −.92 per 1,000 enrollees, 95% CI −1.53, −.31 per 1,000 enrollees). Similarly, we found an immediate reduction in day's supply of 4.2 days per prescription (change of −1.13 days, 95% CI −1.78, −.48 days) with a continuous decreasing trend over the following 8 months. We focused this analysis on enrollees with new opioid use as the intent of the policy was reduction of opioid supply in the setting of acute pain, and not those individuals with chronic opioid therapy. With a decrease in the number of day's supply, we hypothesized that prescribers would counter this limitation with either an increase in the strength of the opioid medication or an increase in the number of units (e.g. tablets) for the prescription. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of the days' supply restriction from the HB21 law on opioid prescribing changes. We evaluated the pre- and post-policy changes on 1) number of units dispensed per prescription, 2) MMEs per day, and 3) total MMEs per prescription.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1119jbEB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should generally avoid unnecessary dosage increases, use caution when increasing opioid dosages, and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount because overdose risk increases with increases in opioid dosage. Although evidence to recommend specific intervals for dosage titration is limited, rapid dosage increases put patients at greater risk for sedation, respiratory depression, and overdose. For opioid-naïve outpatients with acute pain treated with an opioid for a few days or less, dosage increases are usually unnecessary and should not be attempted without close monitoring because of the risks for respiratory depression. In the context of long-term opioid use, when dosage is increased, clinicians should reevaluate patients after increasing dosage for changes in pain, function, and risk for harm (see Recommendation 7).

Before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause, considering that dosage increases to > 50 MME/day are unlikely to provide substantially improved pain control for most patients while overdose risk increases with dosage, and carefully reassess evidence of benefits and risks. If a patient's opioid dosage for all sources of opioids combined reaches or exceeds 50 MME/day, clinicians should implement additional precautions, including increased frequency of follow-up (see Recommendation 7), and offer naloxone and overdose prevention education to both the patient and the patient's household members (see Recommendation 8).

Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to increase dosage after an individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences.

Certain states require clinicians to implement clinical protocols at specific dosage levels. For example, before increasing long-term opioid therapy dosage to > 120 MME/day, clinicians in Washington state must obtain consultation from a pain specialist who agrees that the increase is indicated and appropriate. Clinicians should be aware of policies related to MME thresholds and associated clinical protocols established by their states.

### Efficacy and durability of opioid restrictive state legislation two years after implementation for total knee arthroplasty [^116hMzdc]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To curtail the U.S. opioid crisis, many states have instituted regulations that mandate time and/or dosage limits for opioid prescriptions. This study evaluates the impact of one such law, Florida House Bill 21, on postoperative opioid prescribing patterns for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and the durability of the law's impact over time.

Methods

All patients who underwent TKA at a single institution during the same three-month period in 2017 (pre-law), 2018 (post-law), and 2020 (2 years post-law) were identified. Outcomes and measures included: prescribed morphine milligram equivalents (MME) at discharge and for the 90-day surgical episode, refill quantity with associated MME, and quantity of opioid prescribers. Patients with established chronic pain or those who underwent contralateral TKA during the 90-day window were excluded. Data was compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Significance was set at alpha < 0.05.

Results

The average MME of filled opioid prescriptions per patient during the 90-day post-surgical episode decreased from 1310 MME in 2017 to 891 MME in 2018 (P < .001). The average MME in 2020 was 814 MME, which was significantly lower than the average in 2017 (P < .001), and statistically stable compared to the average in 2018 (P = 0.215).

Conclusion

Restrictive opioid state policy implementation was associated with reduced overall MME prescription to patients undergoing TKA at discharge and for the 90-day surgical episode. There was no increase in the number of opioid refills or opioid prescribers. Durable change and continued improvement were observed 2 years after implementation of law.

### Trends and patterns of geographic variation in opioid prescribing practices by state, United States, 2006–2017 [^1152UzZi]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Definitions and Variables

Six measures are described at the national and state level: (1) milligrams of a prescribed opioid weighted to the US or state populations, expressed as MME, based on its analgesic potency relative to morphine; (2) mean annual duration per prescription (in days); and (3) 4 weighted annual prescribing rates per 100 persons, namely, opioid prescriptions filled in high dosages (≥ 90 MME/d), prescriptions filled for 3 days or fewer or 30 days or longer, and prescriptions filled as extended-release and long-acting formulations. The annual amount of opioids prescribed in MME per person and 4 annual prescribing rates were calculated as population-based rates by weighting raw values to national and state populations of each study year. The exception was the mean duration per prescription, which was unweighted.

We defined high-dosage prescriptions as those filled for 90 or more MME/d, above which the risk of opioid use disorder, overdose, and death are greatly increased. Duration (days of supply filled per prescription) was classified as short-term if 3 or fewer days, which is often sufficient to treat acute pain, or as long-term if 30 or more days, which is more likely used to treat chronic pain. A 30-day span likely coincides with refills occurring at monthly checkups. Although others define long-term opioid therapy as 90 or more days' use, 0.3% of all single prescriptions in 2017 noted herein exceeded 89 days' duration (data not shown). Prescription formulation was categorized as (1) an immediate-release opioid (eg, oxycodone hydrochloride or terephthalate, oxymorphone hydrochloride, hydrocodone bitartrate, or morphine sulfate) or (2) an extended-release and long-acting opioid, such as either methadone hydrochloride or transdermal fentanyl citrate or as an extended-release and long-acting formulation of an immediate-release drug.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^116F7SK7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department discharge prescribing — consumption, early long‑term risk, and exposure sources show that the median amount of opioid actually consumed after an opioid prescription is less than 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME), and that there is increased risk for opioid‑naive patients to develop long‑term use beginning with the third day of therapy. Among ED patients with current opioid dependence, greater than one third reported first exposure via legitimate prescriptions for acute painful conditions, and in 11% the index prescription came from an ED visit. The policy scope focuses on prescribing at discharge rather than administration during the visit, and the document notes there is not an accurate method of predicting which patients will develop opioid use disorder (OUD) or experience adverse effects versus benefit at discharge.

Morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosing — conversion method and cautions for full opioid receptor agonists state that all doses are expressed as mg/d except for fentanyl, and to multiply the daily opioid dose by the conversion factor to determine the equianalgesic dose in MME, recognizing these conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability. The guidance specifies not to use the calculated MME dose to set the dose of a new opioid when converting; the new opioid is typically dosed at substantially lower than the calculated MME dose (33–50% less) to avoid accidental overdose due to incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. Particular caution is advised with fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/d, and absorption is affected by heat and other factors. The HHS conversion factors table does not have an associated MME conversion factor for buprenorphine products.

### Trends and patterns of geographic variation in opioid prescribing practices by state, United States, 2006–2017 [^115MiHab]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The recent decline in US life expectancy is attributed, in part, to premature deaths from opioid overdose. Prescription opioids were involved in approximately 36% of all deaths in the United States associated with opioid overdose in 2017. The risk of opioid use disorder (commonly called addiction), overdose, and death increases as prescription opioids are taken in higher dosages, for longer periods of time, or as extended-release and long-acting formulations. Duration of use is the strongest predictor of opioid use disorder and overdose. Each additional week of use has been associated with a 20% increased risk for the development of an opioid use disorder or occurrence of an overdose. Dosage is also important. Overdose risk is dosage dependent, doubling from 50 to 99 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day and increasing up to 9-fold at dosages of 100 MME or greater per day compared with overdose risk at dosages less than or equal to 20 MME/d. Use of extended-release and long-acting agents also increases risk; unintentional overdoses are twice as likely to occur in those initiating therapy with extended-release and long-acting formulations compared with those starting with immediate-release opioids, especially in the first 2 weeks of use. Prescribing opioids in excess of the patient's needs may harm the patient as well as others if unused pills are diverted to street sales or misused. Misuse refers to drugs taken for a purpose other than that directed by the prescribing physician, in greater amounts, more often, or for a longer duration than prescribed. Although the epidemic is shifting from prescription opioids toward street drugs (heroin, fentanyl, and fentanyl analogues), 66% to 83% of new users of heroin report that their addiction began with the misuse of a prescription opioid.

Large variation among states has been observed in opioid-related overdose rates and consequent emergency department visits, hospital use, and deaths. Long-term trend data on opioid prescribing have been published at the county but not the state level. However, the states have jurisdictional responsibility to establish and fund state- and often county-level intervention programs, as well as to change state policies, licensing, regulations, legislation, medical reimbursements, surveillance, and professional education concerning prescriptions written. Accordingly, we examined key measures of opioid prescriptions filled in each state from 2006 through 2017, to help guide the development of state-specific interventions.

### State-to-state variation in opioid dispensing changes following the release of the 2016 CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^114nDSWe]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Evidence suggests that opioid prescribing was reduced nationally following the 2016 release of the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain by the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). State-to-state variability in postguideline changes has not been quantified and could point to further avenues for reducing opioid-related harms.

Objective

To estimate state-level changes in opioid dispensing following the 2016 CDC Guideline release and explore state-to-state heterogeneity in those changes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study included information on opioid prescriptions for US individuals between 2012 and 2018 from an administrative database. Serial cross-sections of monthly opioid dispensing trajectories in each US state and the District of Columbia were analyzed using segmented regression to characterize preguideline dispensing trajectories and to estimate how those trajectories changed following the 2016 guideline release. Data were analyzed January to March 2023.

Exposure

The March 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Four measures of opioid dispensing: opioid dispensing rate per 100 000 persons, long-acting opioid dispensing rate per 100 000 persons, high-dose (90 or more morphine milligram equivalents [MME] per day) dispensing rate per 100 000 persons, and average per capita MME. All measures were calculated monthly, from January 2012 through December 2018.

Results

Data from approximately 58 900 retail pharmacies were included in analysis, representing approximately 92% of US retail prescriptions. The overall monthly dispensing rate in the US in early 2012 was approximately 7000 per 100 000 population. Following the 2016 guideline release, the already-decreasing slope accelerated nationally for the overall dispensing rate (preguideline slope, -23.19; postguideline slope, -48.97; change in slope, 25.97 [95% CI, 18.67–32.95]), long-acting dispensing rate (preguideline slope, -1.03; postguideline slope, -5.94; change in slope, 4.90 [95% CI, 4.26–5.55]), high-dose dispensing (preguideline slope, -3.52; postguideline slope, -7.63; change in slope, 4.11 [95% CI, 3.49–4.73]), and per-capita MME (preguideline slope, -0.22; postguideline slope, -0.58; change in slope, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.30–0.42]). For all outcomes, nearly all states showed analogous acceleration of an already-decreasing slope, but there was substantial state-to-state heterogeneity. Slope changes (preguideline-postguideline slope) ranged from 9.15 (Massachusetts) to 74.75 (Mississippi) for overall dispensing, 1.88 (Rhode Island) to 13.41 (Maine) for long-acting dispensing, 0.71 (District of Columbia) to 13.68 (Maine) for high-dose dispensing, and 0.06 (Hawaii) to 0.91 (Arkansas) for per capita MME.

Conclusions and Relevance

The 2016 CDC Guideline release was associated with broad reductions in prescription opioid dispensing, and those changes showed substantial geographic variability. Determining the factors associated with these state-level differences may inform further improvements to ensure safe prescribing practices.

### Vital signs: changes in opioid prescribing in the United States, 2006–2015 [^113wxP5f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Results

In the United States, annual opioid prescribing rates increased from 72.4 to 81.2 prescriptions per 100 persons from 2006 to 2010, were constant from 2010 to 2012, and then decreased by 13.1% to 70.6 per 100 persons from 2012 to 2015 (Figure 1). Annual high-dose opioid prescribing rates remained stable from 2006 to 2010 and then declined by 41.4% from 11.4 per 100 persons in 2010 to 6.7 in 2015. Annual prescribing rates for prescriptions of ≥ 30 days' supply increased 58.9% from 17.6 per 100 persons in 2006 to 28.0 per 100 persons in 2012 and leveled off from 2012 to 2015. Annual prescribing rates for prescriptions of < 30 days' supply were stable from 2006 to 2012 and decreased 20.2% from 53.2 per 100 persons in 2012 to 42.4 in 2015. Average daily MME per prescription remained stable from 2006 to 2010 and then decreased 16.9% from 58.0 in 2010 to 48.1 in 2015. Average days' supply prescribed increased 33.0% from 13.3 in 2006 to 17.7 in 2015.

FIGURE 1
Annual opioid prescribing rates, by number of days' supply, average daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) per prescription, and average number of days' supply per prescription — United States, 2006–2015

From 2010 to 2015, the amount of opioids prescribed in the United States decreased from 782 to 640 MME per capita (data not shown). In 2010 and 2015, the amount of opioids prescribed across counties varied substantially (Figure 2). From 2010 to 2015, among counties with sufficient data MME per capita decreased in 49.6% of counties, remained stable in 27.8% of counties, and increased in 22.6% of counties (Table 1). Overall prescribing rates decreased in nearly half (46.5%) of counties, whereas high-dose opioid prescribing rates and average daily MME per prescription decreased in the majority of counties, with 86.5% and 72.1% of counties, respectively, experiencing decreases. From 2010 to 2015, average number of days' supply increased in 73.5% of counties.

### Changes in prescribing by provider type following a state prescription opioid restriction law [^111yeHFF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many states have implemented opioid days' supply restriction policies, leading to reductions in opioid prescribing. Although research within certain provider types exist, no study has evaluated a restriction policy by various provider types.

Objective

To evaluate changes in opioid utilization following a days' supply restriction policy stratified by provider type: surgery, emergency medicine, primary care, specialty care, and dentistry.

Design

Interrupted time series (ITS) PARTICIPANTS: Opioid prescription claims of patients in a private health plan serving a large Florida employer from 1/1/2015 to 3/31/2019. Provider types were determined using the Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code associated with the national provider identifier (NPI).

Interventions

Florida's opioid restriction policy implemented on July 1, 2018.

Main Measures

Changes in mean morphine milligram equivalent (MMEs), mean days' supply, and mean number of units dispensed per opioid prescription before and after policy implementation.

Key Results

There were 10,583 opioid initial prescriptions dispensed. Treating providers were classified as surgery (16.4%; n = 1732), emergency care (14.3%; n = 1516), primary care (21.2%; n = 2241), specialty care (11.4%; n = 1207), and dentistry providers (23.7%; n = 2511). Significant reductions in mean days' supply were observed across most provider types ranging from 14% reduction for dentistry providers to 41% reduction for specialty care providers. Significant changes were observed for emergency care and specialty care providers with a 30% (p = 0.001)and 29% (p < 0.001) reduction in mean MME, respectively, and a 27% (p = 0.040) reduction in mean number of units dispensed in emergency care providers, after implementation. Pre-implementation trends in opioid prescribing varied by provider type impacting the effects of the opioid days' supply restriction policy.

Conclusions

Pre-policy opioid prescribing varied by provider type with a differential impact on mean MMEs, mean days' supply, and mean number of units dispensed per prescription following implementation.

### Trends and rapidity of dose tapering among patients prescribed long-term opioid therapy, 2008–2017 [^111ftNi5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

A 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prescribing guideline cautioned against higher-dose long-term opioid therapy and recommended tapering daily opioid doses by approximately 10% per week if the risks outweigh the benefits. Warnings have since appeared regarding potential hazards of rapid opioid tapering.

Objectives

To characterize US trends in opioid dose tapering among patients prescribed long-term opioids from 2008 to 2017 and identify patient-level variables associated with tapering and a more rapid rate of tapering.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used deidentified medical and pharmacy claims and enrollment records for 100 031 commercial insurance and Medicare Advantage enrollees, representing a diverse mixture of ages, races/ethnicities, and geographical regions across the United States. Adults with stable, higher-dosage (mean, ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs]/d) opioid prescriptions for a 12-month baseline period and 2 or more months of follow-up from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017, were included in the study.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Tapering was defined as 15% or more relative reduction in mean daily MME during any of 6 overlapping 60-day windows within a 7-month follow-up period. The rate of tapering was computed as the maximum monthly percentage dose reduction.

Results

Among the 100 031 participants (53 452 [53.4%] women; mean [SD] age, 57.6 [11.8] years), from 2008 to 2015, the age- and sex-standardized percentage of patients tapering daily opioid doses increased from 10.5% to 13.7% (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] per year, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.05–1.06]) before increasing to 16.2% in 2016 and 22.4% in 2017 (aIRR in 2016–2017 vs 2008–2015, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.16–1.25]). Patient-level covariates associated with tapering included female sex (aIRR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.10–1.15]) and higher baseline dose (aIRR for ≥ 300 MMEs/d vs 50–89 MMEs/d, 2.57 [95% CI, 2.48–2.65]). Among patients tapering daily opioid doses, the mean (SD) maximum dose reduction was 27.6% (17.0%) per month, and 18.8% of patients had a maximum tapering rate exceeding 40% per month (ie, faster than 10% per week). More rapid dose reduction was associated with 2016–2017 vs 2008–2015 (adjusted difference, 1.4% [95% CI, 0.8%-2.1%]) and higher baseline dose (adjusted difference, 2.7% [95% CI, 2.2%-3.3%] for 90–149 vs 50–89 MMEs/d).

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients using long-term opioid therapy are increasingly undergoing dose tapering, particularly women and those prescribed higher doses; in addition, dose tapering has become more common since 2016. Many patients undergoing tapering reduce daily doses at a rapid maximum rate.

### Principles for ensuring the safe management of pain medication prescriptions by occupational and environmental physicians [^111AYdE1]. ACOEM (2016). Medium credibility.

Pain medication prescription safety — prior to a trial of opioids for chronic use or after 4 weeks of opioid use, the following should occur: Comprehensive history and physical; screening for abuse potential and psychological associated issues; baseline and random drug screening with appropriate interpretations and action; Doctor-patient agreement; doses not exceeding 50 morphine equivalents per day in opioid naïve patients; regular functional assessments to determine the success of opioid use — providers must understand the patient's job duties to determine if they present a hazard to the patient when using opioids; and continuation of active therapy, cognitive behavioral or other supportive psychological therapy as prescribed. Benzodiazepines as well as other sedating medications should generally not be prescribed with opioids as they increase the risk for respiratory depression. During the course of treatment, prescribing physicians should regularly consult their state's prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP), and PDMPs should be required to: 1) interact over state boundaries; 2) allow trained and registered provider staff to access information to assist providers when prescribing opioids; and 3) integrate with EHRs as consistent with other federal requirements. Functional goals should be addressed with patients from the outset and assessed at every visit and functional improvements documented to assure that patients have the highest quality of life, and drug screening for drugs of abuse and metabolites of the drug being prescribed are also essential at intervals to assure safe medication use and identify non-use, diversion, and other substance use which would require the opioid to be withdrawn. Providers should always be especially vigilant of patients on doses of 50 or greater morphine equivalent milligrams per day or greater as they are at a high risk of unintentional deaths, and additional research should be conducted under the auspices of the federal government on the long-term efficacy of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain to provide an evidence-based foundation to inform public policy.

### High opioid doses, naloxone, and central nervous system active medications received by Medicare-enrolled adults [^114BDPCf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

From an initial sample of 55,951, a total of 4568 patients were included, of which 3452 (76%) had a daily MME < 50 and 1116 (24%) had a daily MME ≥ 50. The majority of patients were ≥ 65 years of age (75%), predominantly female (66%), and had ≥ 4 prescribers (74%) with 1 prescribing opioids (54%). Patients were also mostly with ≥ 11 unique medications (81%), used 2 pharmacies (58%), and predominantly (80%) resided in regions where more than 10% of households lived below the federal poverty level. Complete demographic information appears in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Results from logistic regression assessing relationship between patient characteristics and prescribing of mean daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) ≥ 50

A multivariate logistic regression found age (p < 0.001), sex (p = 0.003), and number of unique medications (p < 0.001) associated with having a daily MME ≥ 50. Patients < 85 years of age compared to individuals ≥ 85 had 1.57–4.19 times the odds of being prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50. Males were more likely than females to be prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50, (OR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.08–1.45, p = 0.003). While the number of medications was significantly associated with being prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50, only patients with ≥ 17 unique medications compared to patients with 8–10 medications had a significant association with having a daily MME ≥ 50 (OR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.25–1.93, p < 0.001). Complete results from the regression are presented in Table 1.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^114kBCfr]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Opioid dose–overdose relationships (United States 2010–2019) — The page reports that "the relationships between total opioid doses, any opioid deaths (AOD), prescription opioid deaths (POD), opioid treatment admissions (OTA), and annual prescription opioid sales (i.e., morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per capita) are either non-existent, or significantly negative/inverse", and that "the data from 2010 to 2019 – notably concurrent with initiation of CDC guidelines in 2016 – demonstrate that TOD, AOD, and OTA in 1,000s continued to escalate with distinct decline in both POD and MME per capita of prescription opioids". It adds that "the CDC assertion of a continued direct relationship between these factors simply is not valid", consistent with findings "in the United States from 2010 to 2019" that "there is no longer a direct correlation", with TOD defined as total overdose deaths (TOD).

### Changes in quantity of opioids dispensed following Florida's restriction law for acute pain prescriptions [^114LKL6m]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Population

We analyzed pharmacy prescription claims for opioid medications dispensed from January 1, 2015, through March 31, 2019 from a single health plan that serves over 45,000 employees of a large university and health system employer in Florida. Our study period started on January 1, 2015 to avoid contamination with the rescheduling of hydrocodone-containing products implemented on October 2014 from Schedule III to the stricter Schedule II. We included single entity and combination products of hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, codeine, tramadol, meperidine, and tapentadol. This study received approval from the institutional review board at the University of Florida.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Individuals were required to be enrolled for at least 180 days prior to their initial opioid claim to be eligible for inclusion. The enrollee was considered opioid naïve if there were no other prescription claims for any of the previously defined opioid medications in the preceding 180 days. Individuals could contribute to additional new use time if subsequent opioid claims occurred ≥ 180 days since the previous opioid claim.

Opioid claims were excluded if the first opioid was nonoral (e.g. injectable, patch). We also excluded opioid claims not filled in a Florida pharmacy since HB21 would not be applicable to enrollees prescribed opioids from outside of this state.

Outcomes

We calculated: 1) the mean number of units dispensed of the initial opioid prescription by month (i.e. number of tablets, capsules, or number of each 5 mg of oral oxycodone solution dispensed); 2) the mean MMEs per day of the initial prescription by month; and 3) the mean total MMEs per prescription of the initial prescription by month. We analyzed each of the three outcomes separately for prescriptions of all opioid containing medications, prescriptions for hydrocodone, prescriptions for oxycodone, and prescriptions for non-Schedule II drugs.

### Changes in quantity of opioids dispensed following Florida's restriction law for acute pain prescriptions [^112ar4yA]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Overall, there were a total of 54,409 individual opioid prescriptions dispensed to plan enrollees between January 2015 and the end of March 2019. After applying the exclusion criteria, there were a total of 8,375 enrollees with 10,583 unique opioid starts. Specifically, 21.3% (n = 1,788) of patients contributed to ≥ 2 unique opioid starts. The median age of opioid new-users was 36 (IQR 27–49) years old and 63.3% (n = 5,298) were female. There were 0.71% of enrollees who filled two unique opioids on the day of the initial fill, which was incorporated into the number of tablets and MMEs evaluations. The most commonly utilized opioid was hydrocodone, which accounted for 44.5% of prescriptions, followed by oxycodone (37.6%), and tramadol (12.0%).

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112G7HuZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder — dosing guidance, adherence, monitoring, and overdose reversal: Opioid dosing guidelines developed for chronic pain, expressed in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), are not applicable to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders. Oral naltrexone for the treatment of opioid use disorder is often adversely affected by poor medication adherence and should not be used except under very limited circumstances; clinicians should reserve its use for patients who would be able to comply with special techniques to enhance their adherence, for example, observed dosing, and extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, issues with medication adherence. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) should be checked regularly for the purpose of confirming medication adherence and to monitor for the prescribing of other controlled substances. Naloxone, for the reversal of opioid overdose, should be provided to patients being treated for, or with a history of, opioid use disorder, and patients and family members/significant others should be trained in the use of naloxone in overdose.

Our interrupted times series analysis (Table 2) included all patients in the analytic sample. We estimated a cumulative trend change in the first opioid prescription of −3.61 MME/month (95% CI, −4.87 to −2.35 MME/month; P < .001) associated with the CDC guideline release, with a similar cumulative change in the mean total 30-day amount prescribed after surgery (−3.52 MME/month; 95% CI, −5.20 to −1.84 MME/month; P < .001). The days' supply of opioids in the initial postoperative prescription decreased by 0.05 days/month (95% CI, −0.07 to −0.04 days/month; P < .001). Mean daily MME dispensed in the initial prescription decreased by 0.18 MME/month (95% CI, −0.32 to −0.04 MME/month; P = 0.02) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). While refill rates were comparatively stable, the rate of change after the guideline release date was smaller in magnitude compared with before the guideline release, resulting in a small cumulative increase in refill rate trends of 0.14% per month (95% CI, 0.06% to 0.23% per month; P = 0.001). We did not observe a significant change in the level of the time series (as opposed to the trend) for any of our 3 outcome measures associated with the guideline release.

### Effects of state opioid prescribing laws on use of opioid and other pain treatments among commercially insured U.S. adults [^113vWmoB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is concern that state laws to curb opioid prescribing may adversely affect patients with chronic noncancer pain, but the laws' effects are unclear because of challenges in disentangling multiple laws implemented around the same time.

Objective

To study the association between state opioid prescribing cap laws, pill mill laws, and mandatory prescription drug monitoring program query or enrollment laws and trends in opioid and guideline-concordant nonopioid pain treatment among commercially insured adults, including a subgroup with chronic noncancer pain conditions.

Design

Thirteen treatment states that implemented a single law of interest in a 4-year period and unique groups of control states for each treatment state were identified. Augmented synthetic control analyses were used to estimate the association between each state law and outcomes.

Setting

United States, 2008 to 2019.

Patients

7 694 514 commercially insured adults aged 18 years or older, including 1 976 355 diagnosed with arthritis, low back pain, headache, fibromyalgia, and/or neuropathic pain.

Measurements

Proportion of patients receiving any opioid prescription or guideline-concordant nonopioid pain treatment per month, and mean days' supply and morphine milligram equivalents (MME) of prescribed opioids per day, per patient, per month.

Results

Laws were associated with small-in-magnitude and non-statistically significant changes in outcomes, although CIs around some estimates were wide. For adults overall and those with chronic noncancer pain, the 13 state laws were each associated with a change of less than 1 percentage point in the proportion of patients receiving any opioid prescription and a change of less than 2 percentage points in the proportion receiving any guideline-concordant nonopioid treatment, per month. The laws were associated with a change of less than 1 in days' supply of opioid prescriptions and a change of less than 4 in average monthly MME per day per patient prescribed opioids.

Limitations

Results may not be generalizable to non-commercially insured populations and were imprecise for some estimates. Use of claims data precluded assessment of the clinical appropriateness of pain treatments.

Conclusion

This study did not identify changes in opioid prescribing or nonopioid pain treatment attributable to state laws.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112U4wgZ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation.
Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day. (Overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day.) (See Recommendation 4.)
Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone, because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage.
An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.
Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days to reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and prevent unintentional initiation of long-term opioid therapy. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently for most patients.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at higher risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation.
In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted.
At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives and goals, determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function, and determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid use disorder.
Clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression, anxiety, or other psychological comorbidities is optimized.
Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, considering their effects on pain and function relative to any adverse effects experienced. If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g. if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g. dosages of ≥ 50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see from Recommendation 5).
Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).

### Changes in initial opioid prescribing practices after the 2016 release of the CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^112VrpdE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Opioid prescribing began to increase in the US in the 1990s, continued to increase thereafter, and peaked in 2010, resulting in millions of people using opioids for pain management. Although the public health crisis of opioid overdose has evolved over time, with use of heroin and other synthetic opioids (eg, fentanyl)increasing in relative importance in the past decade, prescription opioid overdose death rates have remained high. In addition, individuals receiving prescription opioids are at increased risk of developing opioid use disorder, with approximately 4 in 5 people who initiate heroin use having previously misused prescription opioids, and many patients presenting with heroin overdose have a history of having received an opioid prescription. Given these facts and the lack of evidence-based guidelines to encourage opioid stewardship, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the "Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain"in 2016 (hereafter, CDC guideline).

The voluntary CDC guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to encourage clinicians in primary care settings to use caution when prescribing opioids for adults with chronic, noncancer pain. The purpose of the guideline is to (1) improve patient-physician communication about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy, (2) enhance safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and (3) reduce risks of long-term opioid use. When opioids are prescribed, the CDC guideline provides recommendations on dosage and duration, including when opioids are used for acute pain prescribing for a period similar to the expected duration of severe pain (in which 3 days or less is often sufficient and more than 7 days is rarely needed) and the lowest daily dosage at which pain is reduced should be used (with special care taken surrounding dosages of 50 morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs] or more per day). How these recommendations corresponded to changes in prescribing for patients who are opioid naive, beyond just those affected by chronic pain, remains an open question.

### Changes in postpartum opioid prescribing after implementation of state opioid prescribing limits [^113EwLWK]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Exposure and Outcomes

In line with previous studies, we defined opioid prescribing limits as those that restrict the quantity or dosage of opioid analgesics that can be prescribed to a patient at one time. –, We included all laws that met this definition and were implemented between July 1, 2016, and January 1, 2019 (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Using these criteria, 36 states implemented an opioid prescribing limit (ie, the treatment or exposure group) that applied to adults. The 12 states (plus Washington, DC) that had not implemented an opioid prescribing limit by January 1, 2019, and Nebraska (whose prescribing limit only applied to minors) composed the comparison group. The limit in Illinois was implemented in 2012, and Hawaii's limit only applied to benzodiazepine and opioid coprescribing; both states were excluded from this analysis.

We identified all opioid analgesic prescriptions indicated for treating pain that were filled during the 30 days after delivery (eFigure 1 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1). The outcomes were the (1) total number of opioid prescriptions per delivery, (2) proportion of prescriptions with a supply greater than 7 days, (3) number of milligrams of morphine equivalent (MMEs) prescribed per delivery, and (4) number of MMEs per prescription. As most of these limits restricted each prescription to a 7-day supply of opioids, clinicians could compensate for the introduction of these limits by writing more prescriptions for shorter durations or by substituting more potent formulations of opioid pain relievers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Opioid and Oral MME Conversion were use to standardize the dosages of each opioid prescription.

We excluded monoproduct buprenorphine products (ie, Probuphine and Subutex) and buprenorphine-naloxone combination products, as these are commonly used to treat opioid use disorder rather than pain. We included any opioid analgesic prescriptions filled 3 days before and 30 days after the delivery date to account for scheduled deliveries for which opioids may be prescribed in advance.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^116Y2cPv]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) opioid prescribing guidelines — background and scope state that opioid prescribing in the United States is decreasing while the opioid epidemic is "continuing at an uncontrollable rate", with "a significant number of opioid deaths, primarily associated with illicit fentanyl use", and that "the data show no clear correlation between opioid prescribing (either number of prescriptions or morphine milligram equivalent [MME] per capita), opioid hospitalizations, and deaths". The document states that "the 2016 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resulted in notable problems including increased hospitalizations and mental health disorders" related to "lack of appropriate opioid prescribing" and "inaptly rapid tapering or weaning processes", and notes that "a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic has been emerging". Objectives are "to provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain", based upon "a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence" by a multidisciplinary panel "assessing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations". Methods included developing objectives and key questions, use of "trustworthy standards" with "appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest(s)", literature review of opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences, and panel review with tabulated comments and incorporated changes. The multidisciplinary panel "finalized 20 guideline recommendations for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain", and the summary reports "over 90% agreement for the final 20 recommendations".

### Changes in initial opioid prescribing practices after the 2016 release of the CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^116Hm2qt]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Initial Prescribing Dosage

Figure 3 shows the frequency distribution of initial doses across cohorts. There were increasing proportions across time of initial dosages that were less than 30 MME/d, and this trend predated the CDC guideline. Additionally, there were decreasing proportions of dosages of 50 to 90 MME/d beginning in preguideline cohort 3, and the proportion of dosages in this category continued to drop through postguideline cohort 2. Compensatory increases were observed in the increased frequency of initial doses in the 0 to 29.9 MME/d range (Figure 3).

Figure 3.
Distribution of Initial Doses of New Opioid Prescriptions in Morphine Milligram Equivalents per Day in Each Year Among Patients Who Were Opioid Naive and Who Subsequently Received Opioids, United States, 2011–2017

Preguideline indicates the 2016 release of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's "Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain"; postguideline indicates after the release.

eTable 9 in the Supplement shows rates of initial dosages of 50 MME/d or more by cohort. There were reductions in high-dose initial prescribing compared with projections based on the preexisting trend evident by postguideline cohort 2 (projected: 22.5% (95% CI, 22.3%-22.7%); observed: 112 312 patients [21.1%]). Similar reductions were observed in other patient subpopulations, with the exception of Medicare Advantage patients, in whom the observed reductions in initial prescriptions of 50 MME/d or more overshot the preexisting secular trend. Logistic regression analysis of prescriptions of 50 MME/d or more is shown in Table 2. Consistent with the unadjusted analyses, men, White patients, and those with commercial insurance were more likely to be initiated at 50 MME/d or more. Adjusting for state-level effects and for secular time trends, the odds of 50 MME/d or greater initial prescribing were lower in the first (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96–0.98) and second (odds ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.93–0.96) years after the CDC guideline release compared with projected rates based on preguideline trends.

U.S. opioid prescription trends and dosage reductions — mandated production cuts by the Drug Enforcement Administration of 25% in 2017 and 20% in 2018 and other measures showed a decline in total opioid prescriptions from 252 million in 2013 to 196 million in 2017, with a decreasing rate of prescriptions of over 9% annually; in 2017, 23.3 billion fewer morphine milligram equivalents (MME) were dispensed, dispensed prescriptions decreased 12.2%, and patients receiving high doses (greater than 90 MMEs per day) declined by 16.1%, yet opioid abuse and death rates are not decreasing because of the availability of illicit narcotics.

### A proposed opioid tapering tool [^115cjQCA]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Previous studies suggest a lack of confidence among primary care providers in managing patients on chronic opioid therapy (COT) for chronic non-cancer related pain (CNCP). The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently introduced guidelines on opioid tapering. In light of these recommendations, our group developed an opioid tapering software to assist healthcare providers in managing patients on COT.

Methods

The initial iteration of our software utilizes RedCap for the application programming interface (API). This tool is designed to reduce a patient's prescribed chronic opioids by 5–10% every month, or 5 morphine milligram equivalents per day (MME), whichever is the greatest, in line with HHS guidelines. Users can also adjust the rate of taper.

Discussion

Our group plans to use this software in an upcoming pilot study to taper patients on COT for CNCP. We are exploring the possibility of transitioning our software into other available APIs with the goal of integrating this software into major electronic health record systems. Our group envisions that our software will provide an additional tool within a patient-centered, multi-modal framework in managing patients on COT for CNCP.

* Among counties with sufficient data, changes of ≥ 10% were considered to represent an increase or decrease, whereas changes of < 10% were considered stable.

† High-dose prescribing rates include prescriptions with daily dosage ≥ 90 MME.

Despite reductions in prescribing, the amount of opioids prescribed in 2015 remained high relative to 1999 levels and varied substantially across the country, from an average of 203 MME per capita in the lowest quartile to 1,319 MME per capita in the highest quartile. Opioid prescribing amounts varied across several county-level characteristics (Table 2). After adjustment in the multivariable model, the following characteristics were associated with higher amounts of opioids prescribed: a larger percentage of non-Hispanic whites; higher rates of uninsured and Medicaid enrollment, lower educational attainment; higher rates of unemployment; micropolitan status; more dentists and physicians per capita; a higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, arthritis, and disability; and higher suicide rates. Together, these factors explain approximately 32% of the variation in the amount of opioids prescribed at the county-level.

### Impact of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) on opioid utilization among Medicare beneficiaries in 10 US States [^114amYkN]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) are a principal strategy used in the United States to address prescription drug abuse. We (1) compared opioid use pre- and post-PDMP implementation and (2) estimated differences of PDMP impact by reason for Medicare eligibility and plan type.

Design

Analysis of opioid prescription claims in US states that implemented PDMPs relative to non-PDMP states during 2007–12.

Setting

Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Vermont, Georgia, Wisconsin, Maryland, New Hampshire and Arkansas, USA.

Participants

A total of 310105 disabled and older adult Medicare enrolees.

Measurements

Primary outcomes were monthly total opioid volume, mean daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dose per prescription and number of opioid prescriptions dispensed. The key predictors were PDMP status and time. Tests for moderation examined PDMP impact by Medicare eligibility (disability versus age) and drug plan [privately provided Medicare Advantage (MAPD) versus fee-for-service (PDP)].

Findings

Overall, PDMP implementation was associated with reduced opioid volume [-2.36 kg/month, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.44, -1.28] and no changes in mean MMEs or opioid prescriptions 12 months after implementation compared with non-PDMP states. We found evidence of strong moderation effects. In PDMP states, estimated monthly opioid volumes decreased 1.67 kg (95% CI = -2.38, -0.96) and 0.75 kg (95% CI = -1.32, -0.18) among disabled and older adults, respectively, and 1.2 kg, regardless of plan type. MME reductions were 3.73 mg/prescription (95% CI = -6.22, -1.24) in disabled and 3.02 mg/prescription (95% CI = -3.86, -2.18) in MAPD beneficiaries, but there were no changes in older adults and PDP beneficiaries. Dispensed prescriptions increased 259/month (95% CI = 39, 479) among the disabled and decreased 610/month (95% CI = -953, -257) among MAPD beneficiaries.

Conclusions

Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are associated with reductions in opioid use, measured by volume, among disabled and older adult Medicare beneficiaries in the United States compared with states that do not have PDMPs. PDMP impact on daily doses and daily prescriptions varied by reason for eligibility and plan type. These findings cannot be generalized beyond the 10 US states studied.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115y5ko4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations – treatment options (5–10) — Patients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting, and persons who are regularly using alcohol or other sedatives but do not meet criteria for a specific substance use disorder should be carefully monitored. The prescribing of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with caution in patients who are prescribed methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder, and while combined use increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. Methadone is recommended for patients who may benefit from daily dosing and supervision in an OTP or for those for whom buprenorphine has been used unsuccessfully in an OTP or OBOT setting. Opioid dosing guidelines developed for chronic pain, expressed in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), are not applicable to medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders. Regarding naltrexone, oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances due to poor medication adherence; clinicians should reserve its use for patients who have been unable to comply with special adherence techniques (e.g., observed dosing), and extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not eliminate, adherence issues. The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) should be checked regularly to confirm medication adherence and to monitor the prescribing of other controlled substances.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^115QgzpJ]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Opioid prescribing in the United States is decreasing, however, the opioid epidemic is continuing at an uncontrollable rate. Available data show a significant number of opioid deaths, primarily associated with illicit fentanyl use. It is interesting to also note that the data show no clear correlation between opioid prescribing (either number of prescriptions or morphine milligram equivalent [MME] per capita), opioid hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, the data suggest that the 2016 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resulted in notable problems including increased hospitalizations and mental health disorders due to the lack of appropriate opioid prescribing as well as inaptly rapid tapering or weaning processes. Consequently, when examined in light of other policies and complications caused by COVID-19, a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic has been emerging.

Objectives

In light of this, we herein seek to provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain. These clinical practice guidelines are based upon a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence and have been developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts assessing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations and offer a clear explanation of logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes.

Methods

The methods utilized included the development of objectives and key questions for the various facets of opioid prescribing practice. Also utilized were employment of trustworthy standards, and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest(s). The literature pertaining to opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences was reviewed. The recommendations were developed after the appropriate review of text and questions by a panel of multidisciplinary subject matter experts, who tabulated comments, incorporated changes, and developed focal responses to questions posed. The multidisciplinary panel finalized 20 guideline recommendations for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Summary of the results showed over 90% agreement for the final 20 recommendations with strong consensus. The consensus guidelines included 4 sections specific to opioid therapy with 1) ten recommendations particular to initial steps of opioid therapy; 2) five recommendations for assessment of effectiveness of opioid therapy; 3) three recommendations regarding monitoring adherence and side effects; and 4) two general, final phase recommendations.

Limitations

There is a continued paucity of literature of long-term opioid therapy addressing chronic non-cancer pain. Further, significant biases exist in the preparation of guidelines, which has led to highly variable rules and regulations across various states.

Conclusion

These guidelines were developed based upon a comprehensive review of the literature, consensus among expert panelists, and in alignment with patient preferences, and shared decision-making so as to improve the long-term pain relief and function in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Consequently, it was concluded - and herein recommended - that chronic opioid therapy should be provided in low doses with appropriate adherence monitoring and understanding of adverse events only to those patients with a proven medical necessity, and who exhibit stable improvement in both pain relief and activities of daily function, either independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1141wRjQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g. if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g. dosages of ≥ 50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or to taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see Recommendation 5). Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).

Assessing Risk and Addressing Potential Harms of Opioid Use

Recommendation 8

Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid-related harms and discuss risk with patients. Clinicians should work with patients to incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

### Effects of state opioid prescribing cap laws on providers' opioid prescribing patterns among patients with chronic non-cancer pain [^111miA7b]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior work suggests opioid prescribing cap laws are not associated with changes in opioid prescribing among patients with chronic pain. It is unknown how these effects differ by provider specialty, provider opioid prescribing volume, or patient insurer. This study assessed effects of state opioid prescribing cap laws on opioid prescribing among providers of patients with chronic non-cancer pain, by high volume prescribing, provider specialty, and patient insurer. We identified 224,290 providers of patients with low back pain, fibromyalgia, or headache from the IQVIA administrative database. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we examined impacts of opioid prescribing cap laws implemented between 2016 and 2018 on the annual proportion of a provider's patient panel who received any opioid prescription, as well as on dose and duration of opioid prescriptions. For providers overall, high volume prescribers, all specialties, and patient insurance categories, prescribing cap laws were associated with non-significant changes of < 1.0, 1.5, and 3.5 percentage points in the proportion of chronic non-cancer patients receiving any opioid prescription, a prescription with 7 days' supply, or with > 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, per year, respectively. There were two exceptions with high dose prescribing: prescribing cap laws were associated with a 1.5 percentage point increase in the proportion of high-volume prescribers' patient panel receiving an opioid prescription with ≥ 50 MME/day, and a 3.0 percentage point decrease in the same measure among surgeons. Among nearly all measured subgroups of providers and patient insurers, opioid prescribing cap laws were not associated with changes in opioid prescribing.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^114fRvUg]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

U.S. prescription opioid utilization — morphine milligram equivalents (MME) trends show sustained declines with redistribution across payers. Prescription opioid use in the US continues to decline rapidly, with only 100 billion MME expected to be dispensed in 2020, a 60% decline from 246 billion MME in 2011. Between 2019 and 2020, there is an expected 17.1% decline in MME, marking the ninth consecutive year of declines and the third year of double-digit change. Historically, use was approximately 16 pills or 134 MME per adult Americans in 1992, rose to a peak of 55 pills or 790 MME in 2011, then declined by 54% to 29 pills and 366 MME per capita in 2019, while population growth has been 5.4% since 2011. In 2020, the projected decline in MME per capita is 17.1%, and by the end of 2020 MME per capita is expected to drop to 298, nearing 2000 levels, which was 270 MME per capita. Despite overall reductions, Medicare Part D prescriptions have increased by 2% since 2011, rising from 53 million to 54 million in 2019; the Medicare Part D share increased from 21% to 35% as the over 65 population increased by 31%. Even then, compared to 2019, prescriptions have declined 17% from 66 million in 2014, and commercial prescriptions still comprised the largest share of prescription opioids, with 48% of the volume in 2019 down from 58% in 2011.

### State-to-state variation in opioid dispensing changes following the release of the 2016 CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^111tSDSv]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In March 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (hereafter the 2016 CDC Guideline)to curb opioid-related harms that have escalated over the past 2 decades. The 2016 CDC Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on prescribing opioids to patients aged 18 years and older in primary care settings to treat chronic pain, excluding active cancer pain, palliative care, and end-of-life care. The goal of this voluntary guideline was to reduce opioid-related harms by enhancing safety of pain care, improving communication between physician and patient on the risks and benefits of opioid therapy and reducing the risks of long-term opioid use (eg, opioid use disorder), while also providing patients with chronic pain needed pain relief.

Prior evaluations of the 2016 CDC Guideline have estimated changes in opioid prescribing following the guideline release. The first evaluation showed accelerations of previously decreasing trends in several opioid prescribing outcomes including overall prescribing, high-dose prescribing, mean morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per capita, and opioid and benzodiazepine coprescribing. Subsequent evaluations showed opioid prescribing decreased substantially relative to the preguideline trends among certain patient populations with chronic pain, that rates and characteristics of opioid initiation changed following the 2016 CDC Guideline release, and that the observed accelerating declines were observed across most specialties. Other analyses showed accelerating rates of rapid tapering of opioids — treatment not consistent with guideline-concordant care — following the guideline release, which reflects broader concerns about unintended consequences of the 2016 CDC Guideline and the undertreatment of pain. Emphasizing individualized patient-centered care and shared decision-making is one of many goals of the updated 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain. While other related analyses have been conducted — such as analyses showing increased rates of nonopioid prescribing following the 2016 CDC Guideline release — none have examined state-to-state variability in the changes following the 2016 CDC Guideline release, which is the purpose of this report.

### Effects of state law limiting postoperative opioid prescription in patients after cesarean delivery [^112HdjTm]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of the Florida State law House Bill 21 (HB 21) restricting the duration of opioid prescriptions for acute pain in patients after cesarean delivery is unknown. Our objective was to assess the association of the passage of Florida State law HB 21 with trends in discharge opioid prescription practices following cesarean delivery, necessity for additional opioid prescriptions, and emergency department visits at a large tertiary care center.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at a large, public hospital. The 2 cohorts represented the period before and after implementation of the law. Using a confounder-adjusted segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series, we evaluated the association between HB 21 and trends in the proportions of patients receiving opioids on discharge, duration of opioid prescriptions, total opioid dose prescribed, and daily opioid dose prescribed. We also compared the need for additional opioid prescriptions within 30 days of discharge and the prevalence of emergency department visits within 7 days after discharge.

Results

Eight months after implementation of HB 21, the mean duration of opioid prescriptions decreased by 2.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2–0.5) and the mean total opioid dose decreased by 20.1 morphine milligram equivalents (MME; 95% CI, 4–36.3). However, there was no change in the proportion of patients receiving discharge opioids (95% CI of difference, -0.1 to 0.16) or in the mean daily opioid dose (mean difference, 5.3 MME; 95% CI, -13 to 2.4). After implementation of the law, there were no changes in the proportion of patients who required additional opioid prescriptions (2.1% vs 2.3%; 95% CI of difference, -1.2 to 1.5) or in the prevalence of emergency department visits (2.4% vs 2.2%; 95% CI of difference, -1.6 to 1.1).

Conclusions

Implementation of Florida Law HB 21 was associated with a lower total prescribed opioid dose and a shorter duration of therapy at the time of hospital discharge following cesarean delivery. These reductions were not associated with the need for additional opioid prescriptions or emergency department visits.

### Trends and patterns of geographic variation in opioid prescribing practices by state, United States, 2006–2017 [^113mNgNT]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

This study raises several issues. Because duration of use is the factor most often associated with opioid use disorder and overdose, the increase in mean duration per prescription and prescribing rate for 30 or more days is notable and worth further investigation. However, the decline in short-duration prescriptions may indicate a growing awareness by prescribers that nonopioid medications and other pain-control measures, such as exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy, can be effective for short-term pain relief. Physician surveys or medical record reviews could help assess this effectiveness. If that is the case, some risk of early-onset opioid use disorder from prescription opioids may be lessened.

Although the number of opioid-related deaths from all sources increased since 2012, the number of deaths each year associated with use of prescription opioids alone has not increased since then. This may be partly owing to an overall decline in the amount of opioids prescribed. Meanwhile, the relatively recent rise in opioid-related deaths may be owing to greater use of illicit drugs, especially if they are cheaper than prescription opioids. Death may then result from illicit drug use by itself, or tainted by fentanyl or its analogues, or combined with prescription opioids. Accordingly, both illicit street drugs and prescription opioids must become less available. This highlights the complexity of solving the current epidemic. Closing the path to opioid use disorder will require addressing overprescription of legal opioids, reducing the availability of illicit opioids, and getting patients with opioid use disorder into treatment.

Limitations

This study is subject to several limitations. This administrative database contained no clinical information, including the reason opioids were prescribed or continued, nor any longitudinal data linking patients to clinical outcomes. We could not link the patient's and physician's personal identification, demographic information, or physician specialty. Data were not age adjusted. The number of prescriptions filled may be smaller than the number prescribed if prescriptions were not filled. Cutoff values of 3 or fewer days, 30 or more days, and 90 or more MME per day were applied to all patients without knowledge of individual needs or their total duration of opioid therapy. Because prescriptions were anonymized, it is impossible to identify patients receiving multiple simultaneous prescriptions, although each patient received a mean of 3.4 prescriptions in 2017. We acknowledge that, in pain treatment, 1 size does not fit all, and different approaches and cutoff values may be needed for some groups of individuals. Population-based analysis may not apply to an individual's prescription or needs.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1154BiF8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence reviews identified an observational study finding long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioid prescription to be associated with considerably increased risk for a new opioid use disorder diagnosis for all dosages of long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioids prescribed compared with no opioids prescribed, with adjusted odds ratios of 15, 29, and 122 at low (1–36 MME/day), medium (36–120 MME/day), and high (≥ 120 MME/day) opioid dosages, respectively. Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction.

Multiple experts from OWG stated that they appreciated this recommendation because of the importance of highlighting both pain and function, sharing realistic expectations with patients before initiating treatment, and paying attention to tapering and exit strategies. Although some experts reasoned the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies "may be preferred" or "may be effective" for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid therapies "are preferred" for chronic pain because opioid therapies are associated with small short-term benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short-term benefits compared with nonopioid therapies, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harms.

Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. Although evidence on long-term benefits of nonopioid therapies also is limited, these therapies also are associated with short-term benefits, no evidence exists for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g. serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g. headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.

### Impact of 30-day prescribed opioid dose trajectory on fatal overdose risk: a population-based, statewide cohort study [^113yJxZd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Both increases and decreases in patients' prescribed daily opioid dose have been linked to increased overdose risk, but associations between 30-day dose trajectories and subsequent overdose risk have not been systematically examined.

Objective

To examine the associations between 30-day prescribed opioid dose trajectories and fatal opioid overdose risk during the subsequent 15 days.

Design

Statewide cohort study using linked prescription drug monitoring program and death certificate data. We constructed a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model that accounted for time-varying prescription-, prescriber-, and pharmacy-level factors.

Participants

All patients prescribed an opioid analgesic in California from March to December, 2013 (5,326,392 patients).

Main Measures

Dependent variable: fatal drug overdose involving opioids. Primary independent variable: a 16-level variable denoting all possible opioid dose trajectories using the following categories for current and 30-day previously prescribed daily dose: 0–29, 30–59, 60–89, or ≥ 90 milligram morphine equivalents (MME).

Key Results

Relative to patients prescribed a stable daily dose of 0–29 MME, large (≥ 2 categories) dose increases and having a previous or current dose ≥ 60 MME per day were associated with significantly greater 15-day overdose risk. Patients whose dose decreased from ≥ 90 to 0–29 MME per day had significantly greater overdose risk compared to both patients prescribed a stable daily dose of ≥ 90 MME (aHR 3.56, 95%CI 2.24–5.67) and to patients prescribed a stable daily dose of 0–29 MME (aHR 7.87, 95%CI 5.49–11.28). Patients prescribed benzodiazepines also had significantly greater overdose risk; being prescribed Z-drugs, carisoprodol, or psychostimulants was not associated with overdose risk.

Conclusions

Large (≥ 2 categories) 30-day dose increases and decreases were both associated with increased risk of fatal opioid overdose, particularly for patients taking ≥ 90 MME whose opioids were abruptly stopped. Results align with 2022 CDC guidelines that urge caution when reducing opioid doses for patients taking long-term opioid for chronic pain.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^116QA6sk]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Experts from OWG noted that although little evidence exists for specific follow-up time frames, the recommendation was reasonable and reflects common practice and therefore supported the recommendation. Experts further noted that social determinants of health affecting ability to return frequently for care (e.g. role as unpaid caregiver or work at a job with minimal paid time off) or payer issues (e.g. copays) could have consequences when recommending frequent visits and should be considered.

Clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day, because the overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day (see Recommendation 4). Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage. An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.

### Impact of state opioid regulation on postoperative opioid prescribing patterns for total knee arthroplasty: a retrospective analysis [^1116eDbL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited studies have assessed the impact of state regulations on opioid prescribing patterns for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study evaluates how Florida House Bill 21 (FL-HB21) affected postoperative opioid prescribing for patients after TKA.

Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained to retrospectively review all patients who underwent TKA during 3 months of 2017 (pre-law) and 2018 (post-law) by five arthroplasty surgeons in Florida. Prescribed opioid quantity in morphine milligram equivalents (MME), quantity of refills, and number of prescribers were recorded for each patient's 90-day postsurgical episode. The differences between pre-law and post-law prescription data and short-term postoperative pain levels were compared.

Results

The average total MME was notably reduced by over 30% for all time periods for the post-law group. The average MME per patient decreased by 169 MME at the time of discharge, by 245 MME during subsequent postoperative visits, and by 414 MME for the 90-day postsurgical episode (P < 0.001 for all). The quantity of refills was unchanged (1.6 vs. 1.6, P = 0.885). The total number of prescribers per patient for the 90-day postsurgical episode was unchanged (1.31 vs. 1.24 prescribers/patient, P = 0.16). Postoperative pain levels were similar at discharge (3.6 pre-law vs. 3.3 post-law, P = 0.272).

Discussion

Restrictive opioid legislation was associated with notably reduced postoperative opioid (MME) prescribed per patient after TKA at the time of discharge and for the entire 90-day postsurgical episode. There was no increase in the number of prescribers or refills required by patients.

Level Of Evidence

Level III retrospective cohort.

### Vital signs: changes in opioid prescribing in the United States, 2006–2015 [^116rTdpA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Prescription opioid–related overdose deaths increased sharply during 1999–2010 in the United States in parallel with increased opioid prescribing. CDC assessed changes in national-level and county-level opioid prescribing during 2006–2015.

Methods

CDC analyzed retail prescription data from QuintilesIMS to assess opioid prescribing in the United States from 2006 to 2015, including rates, amounts, dosages, and durations prescribed. CDC examined county-level prescribing patterns in 2010 and 2015.

Results

The amount of opioids prescribed in the United States peaked at 782 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per capita in 2010 and then decreased to 640 MME per capita in 2015. Despite significant decreases, the amount of opioids prescribed in 2015 remained approximately three times as high as in 1999 and varied substantially across the country. County-level factors associated with higher amounts of prescribed opioids include a larger percentage of non-Hispanic whites; a higher prevalence of diabetes and arthritis; micropolitan status (i.e. town/city; nonmetro); and higher unemployment and Medicaid enrollment.

Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice

Despite reductions in opioid prescribing in some parts of the country, the amount of opioids prescribed remains high relative to 1999 levels and varies substantially at the county-level. Given associations between opioid prescribing, opioid use disorder, and overdose rates, health care providers should carefully weigh the benefits and risks when prescribing opioids outside of end-of-life care, follow evidence-based guidelines, such as CDC's Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, and consider nonopioid therapy for chronic pain treatment. State and local jurisdictions can use these findings combined with Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data to identify areas with prescribing patterns that place patients at risk for opioid use disorder and overdose and to target interventions with prescribers based on opioid prescribing guidelines.

### Application of the 2022 CDC guidelines-does in-hospital opioid dosage after lumbar fusion affect long-term opioid use and outcomes for opioid Naïve patients? [^111MAbPR]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

To examine long term opioid use in opioid-naïve patients who received > or < 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day while at the hospital.

Summary Of Background Data

The 2022 CDC guidelines suggest that > 50 MME/day does not provide additional pain/function benefit, but likely increases risks of misuse, overdose and death. To date, there are no studies that examine whether opioid-naïve patients who consume higher quantities of opioids are at increased risk of long-term opioid use.

Methods

All adult patients with > 1 year without opioid use (opioid naïve) who underwent lumbar fusion (2018–2019) were identified. Patients were stratified by > or < 50 MME/day during their postoperative inpatient hospital stay. Patients were retrospectively reviewed for demographic and surgical information. Total opioid prescriptions and MME were tracked from one year preoperatively to two years postoperatively, utilizing the Pennsylvania Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. Linear and Poisson regressions were conducted using MME per day within the first 90 days and 90–365 days postoperatively as dependent variables.

Results

143 opioid naïve patients consumed < 50 MME/day, while 180 consumed > 50 MME/day. The > 50 MME/day group were younger with lower CCI scores and a shorter length of stay. The > 50 MME/day group consumed more MMEs from 0–90 days, and 90–365 days, but were similar after 365 days. Multivariate regression identified CCI and inpatient MME/day as independent predictors of elevated MME within the first year postoperatively.

Conclusions

Daily MME consumption after lumbar fusion was an independent predictor of post-discharge MME consumption for up to a year amongst opioid naïve patients. However, higher inpatient opioid consumption does not appear associated with chronic opioid usage beyond one year. Further prospective research should examine the more granular effects that this tradeoff may have to optimize narcotic analgesic risk benefit ratios and to maximize value.

### Vital signs: changes in opioid prescribing in the United States, 2006–2015 [^116EjciW]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Prescription opioid-related overdose deaths increased sharply during 1999–2010 in the United States in parallel with increased opioid prescribing. CDC assessed changes in national-level and county-level opioid prescribing during 2006–2015.

Methods

CDC analyzed retail prescription data from QuintilesIMS to assess opioid prescribing in the United States from 2006 to 2015, including rates, amounts, dosages, and durations prescribed. CDC examined county-level prescribing patterns in 2010 and 2015.

Results

The amount of opioids prescribed in the United States peaked at 782 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per capita in 2010 and then decreased to 640 MME per capita in 2015. Despite significant decreases, the amount of opioids prescribed in 2015 remained approximately three times as high as in 1999 and varied substantially across the country. County-level factors associated with higher amounts of prescribed opioids include a larger percentage of non-Hispanic whites; a higher prevalence of diabetes and arthritis; micropolitan status (i.e., town/city; nonmetro); and higher unemployment and Medicaid enrollment.

Conclusions and Implications For Public Health Practice

Despite reductions in opioid prescribing in some parts of the country, the amount of opioids prescribed remains high relative to 1999 levels and varies substantially at the county-level. Given associations between opioid prescribing, opioid use disorder, and overdose rates, health care providers should carefully weigh the benefits and risks when prescribing opioids outside of end-of-life care, follow evidence-based guidelines, such as CDC's Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, and consider nonopioid therapy for chronic pain treatment. State and local jurisdictions can use these findings combined with Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data to identify areas with prescribing patterns that place patients at risk for opioid use disorder and overdose and to target interventions with prescribers based on opioid prescribing guidelines.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^11547cXQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Experts raised varying points regarding frequency of PDMP use, with many agreeing that PDMPs should be consulted before every opioid prescription, several agreeing that universal application would mitigate bias in application to different patients, and others believing it might not be warranted or feasible to check the PDMP in all cases, particularly before prescribing opioids for acute pain for a small number of days. Ideally, PDMP data should be reviewed before every opioid prescription for acute, subacute, or chronic pain. This practice is recommended in all jurisdictions where PDMP availability and access policies make it practicable (e.g. clinician and delegate access permitted). At a minimum, PDMP data should be reviewed before initial opioid prescriptions for subacute or chronic pain and then every 3 months or more frequently during long-term opioid therapy. Recommendation category B acknowledges variation in PDMP availability and circumstances (e.g. a clinician might reasonably determine that a patient with severe acute pain in the emergency department during a PDMP system access failure would be adversely affected by waiting hours for a prescription). However, because PDMP information can be most helpful when results are unexpected and, to minimize bias in application, clinicians should apply this recommendation when feasible to all patients rather than differentially on the basis of assumptions about what they will learn about specific patients.

Clinicians should review PDMP data for prescription opioids and other controlled medications patients might have received from additional prescribers to determine the total amount of MME prescribed and to assess if the total dosage or combinations (e.g. opioids combined with benzodiazepines) put the patient at high risk for overdose. If patients are found to have total opioid dosages or combinations of medications that might put them at risk for overdose, or multiple controlled substance prescriptions written by different clinicians, clinicians should take actions to improve patient safety (see Recommendation 9, Implementation Considerations).

Recommendation 10

When prescribing opioids for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should consider the benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed medications as well as other prescribed and nonprescribed controlled substances (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 4).

### Changes in single-specialty postoperative opioid prescribing patterns in response to legislation: single-institution analysis over time [^113mJEEj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine changes in the prescriptions of postoperative opioids in response to Florida state legislation restricting the number of days for which these medications could be prescribed to 3 days in most circumstances or 7 days at provider discretion.

Study Design

A retrospective review was performed for all patients undergoing 7 common outpatient otolaryngology surgical procedures.

Setting

Single-institution academic center in Florida.

Methods

Query of the state's online prescription drug monitoring program was used to compare prescription habits 3 months before and after the law and then again 1 year later.

Results

A total of 561 patients were identified meeting criteria. The number of days that opioids were prescribed decreased significantly, from 6.42 to 4.48 to 3.03 days. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients receiving any postoperative opioid prescription, from 0.80 to 0.52 to 0.32. The total morphine milligram equivalents prescribed decreased from 28.4 before the law to 18.4 at 1 year after.

Conclusions

Legislative restrictions on the length of opioid prescriptions were associated with significant decreases in the proportion of patients receiving any opioids, the number of days that opioids were prescribed, and the total morphine milligram equivalents 3 months after the law went into effect, with even more dramatic changes at the 1-year time point. We opine that these changes are due to providers learning that many procedures do not require postoperative opioids and therefore increasingly considering and utilizing nonopioid alternatives in this setting.

### Characteristics of initial prescription episodes and likelihood of long-term opioid use-United States, 2006–2015 [^113ErDg7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Patients were followed from the date of their first prescription until loss of enrollment, study end date, or discontinuation of opioids, which was defined as ≥ 180 days without opioid use. The duration of use and number of prescriptions and cumulative dose (expressed in morphine milligram equivalents*) for the first episode of opioid use (defined as continuous use of opioids with a gap of no greater than 30 days) were calculated. The number of days' supply and average daily dose in morphine milligram equivalents for the first prescription were also calculated. The first opioid prescription was categorized into six mutually exclusive categories: long-acting; oxycodone short-acting; hydrocodone short-acting; other Schedule II short-acting; Schedule III–IV and nalbuphine; and tramadol. †

The Kaplan-Meier statistic was used to estimate median time to discontinuation of opioid use; probability of continued opioid use at 1 year and 3 years for different treatment duration thresholds (daily for 1–40 days and weekly for 1–26 weeks); number of prescriptions (1–15); and cumulative dose of the first episode of opioid use (50–2000 morphine milligram equivalents). Similarly, the relationship between the number of days' supply, choice of first opioid prescription, and probability of continued opioid use at 1 and 3 years was also examined. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by modifying the discontinuation definition from ≥ 180 opioid-free days to ≥ 90 opioid-free days, changing the allowable gap in the first episode of opioid use from 30 days to 7 days, and excluding patients whose average daily dose of the first prescription exceeded 90 morphine milligram equivalents.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111vpjyP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients who started opioid therapy for acute pain and are continuing to receive opioids for subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days. Clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment, but only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient. Clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and optimize pain management as needed (see Recommendation 2).

In analyses of placebo-controlled trials, the clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on mean improvement in pain and in function were greater at 1–3 months than at 3–6 months. A cohort study found an association between longer duration of therapy and increased risk for new-onset depression. Because of potential changes in the balance of benefits and risks of opioid therapy over time, clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently. Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2). Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at greater risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation. In addition, policymakers can consider evidence-based methods of minimizing barriers to care (e.g. paid sick leave). In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted when available.

### Impact of 30-day prescribed opioid dose trajectory on fatal overdose risk: a population-based, statewide cohort study [^117KDzg9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the flow chart for cohort construction. Our cohort comprised 5,326,392 patients who filled ≥ 1 opioid prescription between March 1 and December 31, 2013. Fewer than 1% of prescriptions had missing or duplicate data.

Over the study period, we recorded 797 overdose deaths involving opioids and 108,352 deaths from other causes. Table 1 shows the distribution of overdose deaths by month, stratified by the month of each patient's first opioid dose. Nearly two-thirds (66%) of all overdoses occurred among patients who received their initial opioid prescription in March; 15% of all overdoses occurred among patients who received their first opioid prescription in April. As shown in Table 2, patients who died from an opioid-related overdose were more likely to be male and less likely to be age 65 years or older, compared to patients who did not. Approximately 22% of patients who died from an overdose were prescribed ≥ 90 MME per day both at the last assessment before their overdose and 30 days previously, compared to only 4% of patients who did not. Among patients who died from an overdose, 26% were not prescribed any opioids at either the last assessment before their overdose or 30 days previously Table 3.

Trend of high-dose opioid utilization

From 2007 through 2014, the average percentage of days exposed to each opioid dose category increased, whereas the percentage of days exposed to 0MME per day decreased (Fig. 1). The largest increase was in the average percentage of days exposed to high-dose utilization (2007: 13.9%; 2014: 26.1%) and doses 30 to < 60MME per day (2007: 12.2%; 2014: 16.0%). Between 2007 and 2014, the average annual increase in the percentage of days exposed to opioid doses ≥ 120MME per day after adjustment for age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity was 2.1% (p -value: < 0.0001).

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^1122KKgf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department opioid prescribing — retrospective national insurance claims analysis (Delgado et al., 2018) evaluated the association between initial opioid prescription intensity and transition to prolonged use from 2011 to 2015, defining prolonged use as ≥ 4 opioid prescriptions 30 to 180 days after index visit and including dosing thresholds such as > 225 MMEs. Among 30,832 included patients, 7,739 (25.1%) received an opioid with median MME of 100 (IQR 75 to 113), a tab quantity of 15 (IQR 12 to 20), for a median of 3 days (IQR 2 to 4 days). Among 25,849 with 6-mo continuous enrollment after the index emergency department (ED) visit, 6,463 (25%) received an opioid prescription MMEs > 225 (≥ 30 tabs of oxycodone 5 mg). Adjusted prolonged opioid use was 4.9% (95% CI 1.8% to 8.1%) compared with 1.1% (95% CI 0.7% to 1.5%), and limitations noted that there appears there is no adjustment for clustering by provider or state.

### Association between initial opioid prescribing patterns and subsequent long-term use among opioid-Naïve patients: a statewide retrospective cohort study [^112iQ93B]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term efficacy of opioids for non-cancer pain is unproven, but risks argue for cautious prescribing. Few data suggest how long or how much opioid can be prescribed for opioid-naïve patients without inadvertently promoting long-term use.

Objective

To examine the association between initial opioid prescribing patterns and likelihood of long-term use among opioid-naïve patients.

Design

Retrospective cohort study; data from Oregon resident prescriptions linked to death certificates and hospital discharges.

Participants

Patients filling opioid prescriptions between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013, with no opioid fills for the previous 365 days. Subgroup analyses examined patients under age 45 who did not die in the follow-up year, excluding most cancer or palliative care patients.

Main Measures

Exposure: Numbers of prescription fills and cumulative morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) dispensed during 30 days following opioid initiation ("initiation month").

Outcome

Proportion of patients with six or more opioid fills during the subsequent year ("long-term users").

Key Results

There were 536,767 opioid-naïve patients who filled an opioid prescription. Of these, 26,785 (5.0%) became long-term users. Numbers of fills and cumulative MMEs during the initiation month were associated with long-term use. Among patients under age 45 using short-acting opioids who did not die in the follow-up year, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for long-term use among those receiving two fills versus one was 2.25 (95% CI: 2.17, 2.33). Compared to those who received < 120 total MMEs, those who received between 400 and 799 had an OR of 2.96 (95% CI: 2.81, 3.11). Patients initiating with long-acting opioids had a higher risk of long-term use than those initiating with short-acting drugs.

Conclusions

Early opioid prescribing patterns are associated with long-term use. While patient characteristics are important, clinicians have greater control over initial prescribing. Our findings may help minimize the risk of inadvertently initiating long-term opioid use.

### Alternatives to opioid education and a prescription drug monitoring program cumulatively decreased outpatient opioid prescriptions [^113ZgrbJ]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Deaths have increased, and prescription medications are involved in a significant percentage of deaths. Emergency department (ED) changes to managing acute pain and prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) can impact the potential for abuse.

Methods

We analyzed the impact of a series of quality improvement initiatives on the opioid prescribing habits of emergency department physicians and advanced practice providers. We compared historical prescribing patterns with those after three interventions: 1) the implementation of a PDMP, 2) clinician education on alternatives to opioids (ALTOs), and 3) electronic health record (EHR) process changes.

Results

There was a 61.8% decrease in the percentage of opioid-eligible ED discharges that received a prescription for an opioid from 19.4% during the baseline period to 7.4% during the final intervention period. Among these discharges, the cumulative effect of the interventions resulted in a 17.3% decrease in the amount of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) prescribed per discharge from a mean of 104.9 MME/discharge during the baseline period to 86.8 MME/discharge. In addition, the average amount of MME prescribed per discharge became aligned with recommended guidelines over the intervention periods.

Conclusions

Initiating a PDMP and instituting an aggressive ALTO program along with EHR-modified process flows have cumulative benefits in decreasing MME prescribed in an acute ED setting.

### Changes in postpartum opioid prescribing after implementation of state opioid prescribing limits [^116F7tRj]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

IMPORTANCE

In response to the growing opioid crisis, states implemented opioid prescribing limits to reduce exposure to opioid analgesics. Research in other clinical contexts has found that these limits are relatively ineffective at changing opioid analgesic prescribing.

OBJECTIVE

To examine the association of state-level opioid prescribing limits with opioid prescribing within the 30-day postpartum period, as disaggregated by type of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean) and opioid naivete.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS

This retrospective, observational cohort study used commercial claims data from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021, from 49 US states and a difference-in-differences staggered adoption estimator to examine changes in postpartum opioid prescribing among all deliveries to enrollees between the ages of 18 and 44 years in the US.

EXPOSURES

The implementation of a state opioid prescribing limit between 2017 and 2019.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASUREMENTS

The primary outcomes for this analysis were the number of prescriptions for opioid analgesics, proportion of prescriptions with a supply greater than 7 days, and milligrams of morphine equivalent (MMEs) per delivery between 3 days before and 30 days after delivery.

RESULTS

A total of 1 572 338 deliveries (enrollee mean [SD] age, 30.20 [1.59] years) were identified between 2014 and 2021, with 32.3% coded as cesarean deliveries. A total of 98.4% of these were to opioid-naive patients. The mean MMEs per delivery was 310.79, with higher rates in earlier years, states that had an opioid prescribing limit, and cesarean deliveries. In a covariate-adjusted difference-in-differences regression analysis, opioid prescribing limits were associated with a decrease of 148.70 MMEs per delivery (95% CI, −657.97 to 360.57) compared with states without such limits. However, these changes were not statistically significant. The pattern of results was similar among other opioid-prescribing outcomes and types of deliveries.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE

The results of this cohort study suggest that opioid prescribing limits are not associated with changes in postpartum opioid prescribing regardless of delivery type or opioid naivete, which is consistent with research findings on these limits in other conditions or settings. Future research could explore what kinds of prevention mechanisms reduce the risk of opioid prescribing during pregnancy and postpartum.

### Impact of 30-day prescribed opioid dose trajectory on fatal overdose risk: a population-based, statewide cohort study [^1115DEDr]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This project examined the impact of 30-day prescribed opioid dose trajectories on patients' risk of fatal opioid-related overdose for all patients in California in 2013. For patients prescribed low daily opioid doses, large dose increases (≥ 2 categories) over 30 days were associated with significant increases in overdose risk during the subsequent 15 days compared to staying at their previous dose. These findings align with recommendations in the CDC guidelines to prescribe patients the lowest effective opioid dose and avoid major dose increases over short periods of time.

We also found that nearly all patients prescribed daily doses ≥ 60 MME faced significantly greater overdose risk than patients prescribed stable, low opioid doses regardless of whether their dose increased, decreased, or was stable over 30 days (Table 4 a). Patients prescribed ≥ 60 MME per day who experienced large dose reductions (≥ 2 categories) were at increased overdose risk compared to patients prescribed stable, high doses; this increased risk was significantly greater for patients prescribed ≥ 90 MME per day whose opioids were abruptly stopped. These findings suggest that much of the increased overdose risk for these patients is due to their high (≥ 60 MME per day) baseline opioid dose rather than their 30-day dose trajectory. However, large dose decreases in these patients are associated with increased overdose risk.

Most importantly, our results underscore that, for patients taking ≥ 90 MME per day, abruptly stopping prescription opioids drastically increases risk of fatal overdose during the subsequent 15 days. These results are consistent with prior studies showing that among patients with likely physical dependence from long-term use, opioid discontinuation is associated with greater overdose risk than dose decreases without discontinuation. Almost all patients prescribed ≥ 90 MME per day have physical opioid dependence and so may have sought illicit opioids when their prescriptions were stopped. In contrast, some patients may have had their prescriptions cut off because they had high overdose risk for other reasons (e.g. due to uncontrolled opioid use disorder). Regardless, our results underscore that clinicians should closely monitor all patients prescribed ≥ 90 MME per day, avoid unilaterally stopping opioids for these patients, obtain patient agreement before considering any dose changes, prescribe naloxone, and screen them for opioid use disorder. These recommendations align with the 2019 US Health and Human Services guidelines on opioid dose reduction and the revised 2022 CDC guidelines, which both urge caution when reducing opioid doses.

### An exploratory analysis of differential prescribing of high-risk opioids by insurance type among patients seen by the same clinician [^1155zC1K]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

For each payer group, we performed bivariate analyses to identify associations between prescriber status (balanced, moderate, unbalanced, high-risk) and prescriber and county characteristics. To identify factors associated with being an unbalanced prescriber, we used multivariable regression to compare unbalanced prescribers to all other prescribers, by specialty and controlling for county urbanicity, opioid per capita dispensed, fatal overdose rate, and percent of non-White residents. We controlled for minimum log-transformed volume of patients of each prescriber receiving opioids to correct uncertainty in the unbalanced group that could be introduced by disproportionately high-volume prescribers. We included state fixed effects and robust standard errors clustered at the county level to account for unobserved correlation structures across observations within a county. We performed bivariate analyses of patient characteristics by episode overall and by prescriber status for each dyad, and conducted sensitivity analyses where high-dose prescriptions were defined as MME daily dose > 90. The study was approved with a waiver of consent by the corresponding author's IRB.

### Electronic advisories increase naloxone prescribing across health care settings [^116bZ5dy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Naloxone is a life-saving, yet underprescribed, medication that is recommended to be provided to patients at high risk of opioid overdose.

Objective

We set out to evaluate the changes in prescriber practices due to the use of an electronic health record (EHR) advisory that prompted opioid prescribers to co-prescribe naloxone when prescribing a high-dose opioid. It also provided prescribers with guidance on decreasing opioid doses for safety.

Design

This was a retrospective chart abstraction study looking at all opioid prescriptions and all naloxone prescriptions written as emergency department (ED) discharge, inpatient hospital discharge, or outpatient medications, between July 1, 2018, and February 1, 2020. The EHR advisory went live on June 1, 2019.

Subjects

Included in the analysis were all adult patients seen in the abovementioned settings at a large county hospital and associated outpatient clinics.

Main Measures

We performed an interrupted time series analysis looking at naloxone prescriptions and daily opioid dosing in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), before and after initiation of the EHR advisory.

Key Results

The EHR advisory was associated with changes in prescribers' behavior, leading to increased naloxone prescriptions and decreased prescribed opioid doses.

Conclusions

EHR advisories are an effective systems-level intervention to enhance the safety of prescribed opioids and increase rates of naloxone prescribing.

### Total inpatient morphine milligram equivalents can predict long-term opioid use after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion [^115kNo27]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study from a single institution.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the thresholds for postoperative opioid consumption, which are predictive of continued long-term opioid dependence.

Summary Of Background Data

The specific sum total of inpatient opioid consumption as a risk factor for long-term use after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has not been previously studied.

Methods

Charts of patients who underwent a one, two, or three-level primary TLIF between 2014 and 2017 were reviewed. Total morphine milligram equivalents (MME) consumed was tabulated and separated into three categories based on ROC curve analysis of opioid utilization at 6-month follow-up. Multivariate binary regression analysis assessed these MME dosage categories. A further subanalysis grouped patients on the basis of whether they had used opioids preoperatively.

Results

One hundred seventy-two patients met the inclusion criteria and were separated into groups who received less than 250 total inpatient MME (44%), between 250 and 500 total inpatient MME (26%), and greater than 500 total inpatient MME (27%). Patients undergoing a TLIF who received < 250 total MME in the immediate postoperative period had a 3.73 (odds ratio) times smaller probability of requiring opioids at 6-month follow-up [P = 0.027, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.084–0.86]. Patients who received > 500 total MME had a 4.84 times greater probability (P = 0.002, 95% CI 1.8–13) of requiring opioids at 6-month follow-up. A subanalysis demonstrated individuals with preoperative opioid use who received < 250 total MME had a 7.09 times smaller probability (P = 0.033, 95% CI 0.023–0.85) of requiring opioids at 6-month follow-up while those who received > 500 total MME had a 5.43 times greater probability (P = 0.033, 95% CI 1.6–18) of requiring opioids at 6-month follow-up.

Conclusion

Exceeding the threshold of 500 total MMEs in the immediate postoperative period after a TLIF is a significant risk factor that predicts continued opioid use at 6-month follow-up, particularly among patients with a history of preoperative opioid utilization.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1134Sn5w]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with Previous Overdose

Previous opioid overdose is associated with substantially increased risk for future nonfatal or fatal opioid overdose. Yet, a cohort study of commercially insured patients found that opioids were dispensed to 91% of patients who had a previous overdose; a substantial percentage experienced a repeated opioid overdose, with a cumulative incidence at 2 years of 17% among patients receiving ≥ 100 MME/day, 15% among those prescribed 50–100 MME/day, 9% among those prescribed < 50 MME/day, and 8% among those prescribed no opioids.

If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate them for opioid use disorder and provide or arrange treatment if needed. Treatment with buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder after overdose is associated with reduced all-cause and opioid-related deaths. Clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage and discontinue opioids when indicated (see Recommendation 5) and should ensure continued close monitoring and support for patients prescribed or not prescribed opioids. If clinicians continue opioid therapy in patients with previous opioid overdose, they should discuss increased risks for overdose with patients; carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh substantial risks; and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan, such as offering naloxone (see Offering Naloxone to Patients), involving patient-identified trusted family members, and increasing frequency of monitoring combined with shorter prescription durations (see Recommendation 7).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113hBnpt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Four observational studies identified in the clinical evidence reviews consistently found an association between higher doses of long-term opioids and risk for overdose or overdose death. Opioid dosages for chronic pain of 50 to < 100 MME/day in observational studies have been associated with increased risks for opioid overdose by factors of 1.9–4.6 compared with dosages of 1 to < 20 MME/day, and dosages of ≥ 100 MME/day were found to be associated with increased risks for overdose 2.0–8.9 times the risk at 1 to < 20 MME/day, after adjusting for confounders on the basis of demographics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and other factors. When opioids are prescribed for acute pain, similar associations have been found, with dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day associated with 4.73 times the risk for overdose and dosages of ≥ 100 MME/day associated with 6.64 times the risk, compared with dosages of 1 to < 20 MME/day. The MME cut points in these studies (e.g. 20 MME, 50 MME, and 100 MME) were selected by the authors for research purposes, and whereas their findings are consistent with progressive increases in overdose risk being associated with increases in prescribed opioid dosages, they do not demonstrate a specific dosage threshold below which opioids are never associated with overdose. In a national sample of Veterans Health Administration patients with chronic pain who were prescribed opioids, mean prescribed daily opioid dosage among patients who died from opioid overdose was 98 MME (median: 60 MME), compared with mean prescribed daily opioid dosage of 48 MME (median: 25 MME) among patients not experiencing fatal overdose. A narrative review conducted by FDA staff concluded that, although there is not a single dosage threshold below which overdose risk is eliminated, the studies included in the review indicated an increasing risk for serious adverse health outcomes, including misuse, overdose, and death associated with increasing opioid dose. These studies examined dose-response risk for overdose for full agonist opioids and not for partial agonist opioids such as buprenorphine, which is unlikely to have the same continuous association between dosage and overdose risk because respiratory depressant effects of buprenorphine reach a plateau.

### Opioid prescribing patterns among medical providers in the United States, 2003–17: retrospective, observational study [^116QUPzC]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To examine the distribution and patterns of opioid prescribing in the United States.

Design

Retrospective, observational study.

Setting

National private insurer covering all 50 US states and Washington DC.

Participants

An annual average of 669495 providers prescribing 8.9 million opioid prescriptions to 3.9 million patients from 2003 through 2017.

Main Outcome Measures

Standardized doses of opioids in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) and number of opioid prescriptions.

Results

In 2017, the top 1% of providers accounted for 49% of all opioid doses and 27% of all opioid prescriptions. In absolute terms, the top 1% of providers prescribed an average of 748000 MMEs-nearly 1000 times more than the middle 1%. At least half of all providers in the top 1% in one year were also in the top 1% in adjacent years. More than two fifths of all prescriptions written by the top 1% of providers were for more than 50 MMEs a day and over four fifths were for longer than seven days. In contrast, prescriptions written by the bottom 99% of providers were below these thresholds, with 86% of prescriptions for less than 50 MMEs a day and 71% for fewer than seven days. Providers prescribing high amounts of opioids and patients receiving high amounts of opioids persisted over time, with over half of both appearing in adjacent years.

Conclusions

Most prescriptions written by the majority of providers are under the recommended thresholds, suggesting that most US providers are careful in their prescribing. Interventions focusing on this group of providers are unlikely to effect beneficial change and could induce unnecessary burden. A large proportion of providers have established relationships with their patients over multiple years. Interventions to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing should be focused on improving patient care, management of patients with complex pain, and reducing comorbidities rather than seeking to enforce a threshold for prescribing.
