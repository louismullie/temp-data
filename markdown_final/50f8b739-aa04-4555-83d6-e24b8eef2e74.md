Covid quarantine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about COVID-19 quarantine strategy, including duration, testing, timing, adherence, and special populations, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental distinction between isolation and quarantine. Then, I should verify the incubation period and how it informs baseline duration. Next, I will examine the evidence for shortened quarantine with and without testing, including the role of exit testing and variant-specific changes. After that, I need to check the optimal timing of testing within quarantine. I will then assess adherence and support measures that modify risk. Finally, I should review special populations and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't conflate terms. Isolation applies to people who are sick or test positive, whereas quarantine applies to people who are exposed but not yet ill; this distinction drives different durations and testing strategies, and I should keep it explicit in all subsequent reasoning [^117MwmEK] [^113ymuxZ].

> I need to verify the incubation distribution to anchor duration choices. The median incubation period is about 5.1 days, with 97.5% of symptomatic cases developing within about 11.5 days, which historically justified a 14-day quarantine as the conservative upper bound; however, the tail extends beyond 14 days in rare cases, so any shortening trades a small residual risk for feasibility [^115ePcwN] [^116eDFqY].

> Next, I should review the baseline effectiveness of quarantine itself before discussing shortening. Modelling and systematic reviews consistently show that quarantine of exposed contacts reduces incident cases and deaths substantially, with estimates ranging from roughly 44% to 96% reduction in incident cases depending on assumptions and combinations with other measures; this establishes that quarantine is effective, even if the certainty is low to very low due to the predominance of modelling studies [^113myzqT] [^116CVrXZ] [^112csw5Z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about 14 days being mandatory; I should examine shortened options. Empirical cohorts and modelling suggest that 7-day test-based quarantine can achieve transmission reduction comparable to 14 days when paired with a negative test, albeit with a small residual post-quarantine transmission risk; for example, university data show about 13% of those who ultimately test positive are still negative and asymptomatic at day 7, implying a nontrivial post-quarantine risk if released at day 7 without precautions [^112PeGRo] [^114Mco1v].

> Wait, let me verify the role of testing timing because entry versus exit testing changes risk. Models and real-world applications indicate that testing on exit (or entry plus exit) meaningfully reduces post-quarantine transmission compared with entry testing alone; in offshore cohorts, a substantial fraction of positives were detected only on the exit test after a negative entry test, supporting the biological plausibility that early infection is often below PCR detection thresholds [^115TfJYF] [^1149J41U] [^115zTz3n].

> I should double-check the optimal day to test when exposure timing is known versus unknown. When the exposure date is known, testing around day 6 of quarantine minimizes post-quarantine transmission probability; when exposure timing is unknown, exit testing provides the greatest marginal benefit for quarantines up to about 7 days, aligning with the rising pre-symptomatic infectiousness window [^113TpZL5] [^115zTz3n].

> But wait, what if variants change the window of infectiousness; I need to check that. With Omicron's shorter incubation and earlier peak viral load, some jurisdictions shifted to 5-day quarantine with masking, reflecting earlier transmission dynamics; modelling also shows that the utility of antigen tests wanes if the infectivity peak occurs later relative to symptom onset, reinforcing that test choice and timing should be variant- and context-aware [^111VGRAJ] [^111ZrYwA] [^117VsLpb].

> Next, I should review adherence and support, because effectiveness depends on feasibility. Strict quarantine is associated with faster conversion and fewer infections than nonstrict quarantine, and support measures such as clear communication, financial assistance, and mental health resources improve adherence; conversely, prolonged quarantine is linked to dose-dependent increases in depression and anxiety, arguing for the shortest effective period with safeguards [^116J9eNS] [^1128f36d] [^112qBKcY].

> I will now examine special populations where my threshold for longer quarantine or more stringent testing might change. Household contacts have higher secondary attack rates and a meaningful fraction convert after day 7, so extending to 10 days or adding exit testing is reasonable; athletes in congregate settings had a mean time to positivity of about 3.8 days, but risk persists through day 10, supporting shortened options with careful monitoring; immunocompromised hosts may have prolonged incubation and shedding, warranting extended quarantine and test-based strategies; essential workers may require tailored return-to-work policies balancing absence and transmission risk [^11582451] [^117NUZxz] [^116eDFqY] [^111mCCeT].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach while acknowledging uncertainties. For low-risk, non-household exposures with good adherence support, a 7-day quarantine with a negative PCR or antigen test on day 5–7 and continued masking through day 10 is reasonable, accepting a small residual risk; for high-risk exposures such as household or congregate settings, 10 days with exit testing or 14 days without testing remains conservative; for travel or unknown exposure timing, 5–7 days with exit testing reduces burden while capturing late converters; throughout, symptom-triggered testing and isolation should override calendar-based release [^114Mco1v] [^116DJujH] [^111VGRAJ].

> Hold on, I should verify that my recommendations align with evolving guidance and note where they diverge. WHO and CDC have moved toward symptom-based isolation and shorter quarantine in some contexts, reflecting changing immunity and transmission dynamics; IDSA emphasizes testing exposed individuals when results will change management, typically at or after day 5 post-exposure, and cautions that testing alone does not obviate quarantine in many scenarios, which I should integrate into shared decision-making [^111RiMjz] [^111VGRAJ] [^112g2ReN] [^114UtcRC].

> Finally, I need to ensure I've addressed key caveats. Evidence quality is largely from modelling and observational studies, so magnitude estimates carry uncertainty; residual post-quarantine transmission risk exists and rises as quarantine shortens; test sensitivity varies by timing and platform, so a negative test is not absolute; and local epidemiology, variant circulation, and resource capacity should drive policy, with transparent communication about trade-offs to sustain adherence [^113myzqT] [^116CVrXZ] [^111ZrYwA] [^1128f36d].

Quarantine for COVID-19 is the separation of people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to prevent onward transmission [^117MwmEK], with the standard duration of **14 days** based on the upper bound of the incubation period [^115ePcwN]. Shorter quarantines (7–10 days) with testing can be used when resources are limited, but they carry a small risk of post-quarantine transmission [^116DJujH] [^114Mco1v]. Quarantine is most effective when combined with testing, contact tracing, and isolation of confirmed cases [^113myzqT] [^116CVrXZ] [^112H4oFn]. Adherence and support measures are critical to effectiveness and to minimize psychological and economic harms [^1128f36d] [^112qBKcY].

---

## Definition and purpose of quarantine

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent transmission [^117MwmEK]; it differs from isolation, which separates those with confirmed infection [^113ymuxZ]. The **purpose** is to reduce transmission by containing potentially infectious individuals before symptoms or a positive test [^1146CWca].

---

## Recommended duration of quarantine

The **standard duration** is 14 days, reflecting the upper bound of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period [^115ePcwN]. Shorter quarantines (7–10 days) with testing can be used when resources are constrained, but they carry a small risk of post-quarantine transmission [^116DJujH] [^114Mco1v].

| **Quarantine duration** | **Testing requirement** | **Residual risk** |
|-|-|-|
| 14 days | None | Lowest |
| 10 days | No test | ~1% post-quarantine transmission |
| 7 days | Negative test on day 5–7 | ~5% post-quarantine transmission |

---

## Effectiveness of quarantine measures

Quarantine reduces transmission by ~59% versus symptom monitoring alone [^114Mco1v]. Combining quarantine with testing and isolation further reduces transmission and mortality [^113myzqT] [^116CVrXZ]. Effectiveness depends on **adherence** and timely implementation [^114Mco1v].

---

## Psychological and social impacts of quarantine

Quarantine is associated with **psychological distress**, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD, especially with longer durations [^112qBKcY] [^113Td3sS]. Social and economic impacts include isolation, financial hardship, and reduced adherence [^114Mco1v] [^113YD2bC].

---

## Factors influencing adherence to quarantine guidelines

Adherence is shaped by **socioeconomic factors** — income, employment, housing, and access to essentials — and by **psychological factors** — mental health, stress, and perceived risk. Clear communication and support services improve adherence [^114LTiA1] [^114vpJmx].

---

## Comparison of quarantine with other public health measures

Quarantine is more effective than symptom monitoring alone but less effective than isolation of confirmed cases [^114Mco1v]. Combining quarantine with testing, contact tracing, and isolation yields the greatest reduction in transmission [^113myzqT] [^116CVrXZ] [^114Mco1v].

---

## Special considerations for vulnerable populations

Vulnerable groups — older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and those with chronic conditions — have higher risk of severe outcomes and may need **longer quarantine** or additional precautions [^112g2ReN]. Support services are essential to maintain adherence and reduce harm [^1128f36d].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

WHO recommends **14-day quarantine** for exposed individuals, with adjustments based on local context and resources [^113ymuxZ]. CDC allows shorter quarantines (7–10 days) with testing when resources are limited, acknowledging a small residual risk [^116DJujH] [^117NUZxz].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Quarantine is a **key tool** for reducing COVID-19 transmission, especially when combined with testing, tracing, and isolation [^113YD2bC] [^116CVrXZ]. Shorter quarantines with testing can be used when necessary, but adherence and support are critical to minimize psychological and social harms [^114Mco1v] [^112qBKcY].

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease that has been classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.

Objectives

We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use.

Main Results

We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions. This review was commissioned by WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^115TfJYF]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For COVID-19, it is vital to understand if quarantines shorter than 14 days can be equally effective with judiciously deployed testing. Here, we develop a mathematical model that quantifies the probability of post-quarantine transmission incorporating testing into travel quarantine, quarantine of traced contacts with an unknown time of infection, and quarantine of cases with a known time of exposure. We find that testing on exit (or entry and exit) can reduce the duration of a 14-day quarantine by 50%, while testing on entry shortens quarantine by at most one day. In a real-world test of our theory applied to offshore oil rig employees, 47 positives were obtained with testing on entry and exit to quarantine, of which 16 had tested negative at entry; preventing an expected nine offshore transmission events that each could have led to outbreaks. We show that appropriately timed testing can make shorter quarantines effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

Cohort studies, case-control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate. Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full-text publications. One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS-I for non-randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-randomised, non-controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs.

Main Results

We included 51 studies; 4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID-19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis. We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI. We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non-controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5. We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies. Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 case in comparison to no quarantine Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS, low-certainty evidence). Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS). Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID-19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID-19 outbreak compared to no quarantine Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID-19 (2 observational studies on COVID-19 and 2 observational studies on SARS).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID-19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact of the measures implemented. This review was originally commissioned by the WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems. The update was self-initiated by the review authors.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^116DJujH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused an unprecedented global public health crisis. Isolating infected individuals and identifying and quarantining their close contacts remain key strategies used to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Quarantine is used to separate individuals who might have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to minimize their risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to other people. Most of the world remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and quarantine is still being used even in countries with relatively high vaccination rates.

Quarantine length is a balance: a short quarantine brings increased risk of transmission from individuals who are infectious after release, while a long one may increase transmission risk by reducing compliance, stretching public health systems, and imposing additional economic and psychological hardship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially recommended a 14-day quarantine period based on estimates of the upper bound of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. While the CDC still recommends 14-day quarantine as the preferred option, in November 2020, to account for the costs of long quarantine, the organization identified 2 shorter quarantine options as acceptable alternatives for asymptomatic individuals based on local circumstances and resources. The first was a 10-day quarantine period without testing. The second was a 7-day quarantine if results of a test done on day 5, 6, or 7 were negative. Similarly, France instituted a 7-day quarantine and Belgium, Germany, and Spain adopted a 10-day period; and, on the longer end, Chinese cities Beijing and Dalian adopted a 21-day quarantine period.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^113TpZL5]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Optimal day of testing for a known time of exposure

When a specific date of exposure can be identified for a traced contact, the optimal test timing differs from that calculated by integrating over all possible exposure times. With a 14-day quarantine starting 1 day post-infection, we estimated that testing on day six of quarantine is optimal; with quarantine starting later, the optimal day of testing then decreased linearly. For shorter quarantines, we found testing on exit to be optimal for individuals entering early in the disease time course. For an individual entering quarantine seven or more days post-infection, the optimal test date is the test on entry (Fig. 4).

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^112m7Njt]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has engendered unprecedented efforts to quell ongoing outbreaks and manage healthcare capacity, including strict travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders. These efforts have disrupted workplaces, leading to significant and pervasive socioeconomic costs. In turn, these economic pressures have led many governments and corporations to lift restrictions. Safely reopening in the absence of a vaccine relies on reducing the likelihood of an infectious individual entering a workplace, school, or other social gathering. Current strategies to ensure safety often include a 14-day quarantine — either as a consequence of travel or following exposure to an infected person, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). These quarantines are sometimes combined with entry and/or exit testing, in which a positive test prompts isolation until recovery.

Quarantine imposes myriad challenges for institutions of government, militaries, businesses, universities, and other entities. At the individual level, the recommended 14-day quarantine causes strain on mental health. This burden is coupled with the associated economic toll and potential impacts on operational integrity. For example, the typical 14-day on-and-off cycle for offshore oil and gas employees is substantially disrupted when quarantine measures are required. These quarantines result in prolonged time periods that crew members are away from their homes. Given the impact of long quarantines on mental health, we evaluated the potential that a shorter quarantine combined with testing optimization could achieve reduced transmission of COVID-19 within close-quarter environments where there is a potentially high risk for rapid spread.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^114Bp9yM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Evidence suggests that isolation of cases upon symptom onset is insufficient to contain an outbreak of COVID-19. The probability of transmission can be reduced substantially through quarantine and testing. Previous work has focused on the impact of quarantine and testing on population-level COVID-19 incidence and deaths –, shortened quarantines upon negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at entry from contact tracing or 7 days after exposureand testing measures that are most appropriate for disease surveillance within a high-risk population (e.g. health-care workers) by examining various testing frequencies and their reduction of secondary infections. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal duration of quarantine or timing of testing that minimizes the probability of post-quarantine transmission (PQT), defined as one or more infections observed after the quarantine period. Many institutions are relying on testing at entry into quarantine combined with other measures such as symptom screenings, hand sanitizers, and face masks to reduce the risk of an outbreak. However, the majority of COVID-19 transmission is attributable to presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, making screening for symptoms alone inadequate to prevent or interrupt a COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, testing too early post-infection is likely to produce a false-negative result. Thus, symptom-based screening and one-time testing could still entail a significant probability of PQT.

Entry into quarantine when the time of exposure is unknown

For settings where there is no administrative knowledge of the time of exposure such as travel quarantine, we computed the expected PQT (Supplementary Fig. 2) and the probability of PQT after a range of quarantine durations without testing (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 3A). Assuming individuals self-isolate immediately upon symptom onset, the probability of PQT declines as the duration of quarantine increases (Fig. 1A). This probability is less than 0.25 with a quarantine duration of at least 3 days and falls below 0.05 for quarantines of eight days or longer.

Discussion

Here, we derived theory to calculate the probability of PQT of COVID-19 for a wide range of durations of quarantine, supplemented by testing on entry to quarantine, on exit from quarantine, or both. For quarantines with durations of up to 7 days, we found that testing on exit provided the greatest marginal benefit in terms of reducing the probability of PQT. Testing on entry provided modest benefits in combination with quarantine or with testing on exit. For a quarantine with a duration longer than 7 days, the optimal testing time is on day five or six. Optimal testing times were fairly consistent between travel quarantines and quarantines of traced contacts, differing at most by a day. The benefits of testing later in quarantine were demonstrated by test results of oil crewmembers heading offshore that identified 16 cases testing negative on entry and positive on exit that could easily have resulted in costly and logistically difficult-to-handle offshore outbreaks. When the time of exposure is known, the optimal day for a test for quarantines of a week or more starts at day six of the quarantine, decreasing linearly to day-of-entry for individuals who have been infected for seven or more days. It may seem counter-intuitive that the optimal test for so many identified timings of exposure is on entry, yet testing on entry has so much less impact than testing on exit when the date of exposure is unknown. Indeed, for individuals that are tested after the incubation period (e.g. later than symptom onset), the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-PCR test has started to decline. However, for individuals late in the disease, there is also far less infectivity left in their disease course. The high remaining infectivity of individuals early in the disease course markedly outweighs the low infectivity of individuals late in the disease course in influencing the optimal day of testing to prevent PQT.

### Assessment of day-7 postexposure testing of asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients to evaluate early release from quarantine-Vermont, may-November 2020 [^11671E6c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

On May 8, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) issued a Health Update* recommending shortening the duration of quarantine for persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Exposed persons who were in quarantine could be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on or after quarantine day 7. Those who had remained asymptomatic throughout quarantine and who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on or after day 7 could end quarantine. This policy was based on a report suggesting that symptom onset occurs within this time frame in approximately three quarters of COVID-19 cases (1) and on consultation of the Vermont Health Commissioner with the U.S. Surgeon General. VDH implemented this policy to minimize restrictions on state residents, recognizing that some reduction could occur in the prevention benefit of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. State-run SARS-CoV-2 testing sites were made available to increase access to no-cost testing and facilitate implementation of this policy. During August 1-December 1, among persons seeking testing at a VDH SARS-CoV-2 testing site, 36% stated that their reason for seeking testing was to end quarantine early (VDH, unpublished data, December 7, 2020), indicating that persons were aware of and following the policy and using the testing services provided. To assess the effectiveness of this policy, VDH analyzed testing data for contacts of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis. During May 8-November 16, VDH identified 8,798 exposed contacts of COVID-19 patients; 3,983 (45%) had sought testing within 14 days of their exposure, with day 0 defined as the date of last exposure noted in the case investigation record. Among these persons, 2,200 (55%) who received testing on days 7–10 were included in this analysis; 977 (44.9%) of these contacts had a specimen collected for testing on day 7. Among these, 34 (3%) had test results that were positive, 940 (96%) had results that were negative, and three (< 1%) had results that were indeterminate (Table). Among the 34 contacts who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on day 7 after exposure, 12 (35%) were asymptomatic. The remaining 22 contacts with positive test results were symptomatic at the time of testing; approximately one half had developed symptoms on days 4–7 after exposure. Among the 940 contacts who received negative test results on specimens collected on day 7 after exposure, 154 (16%) had a subsequent test within the next 7 days (i.e., days 8–14); among these, 152 (99%) had tests that remained negative, and two (1%) had results that were indeterminate.

Background

Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation measures must be implemented.

Methods

To estimate the comparative efficacy of individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts to control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit a model to the incubation period distribution (mean 5·2 days) and to two estimates of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4·8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7·5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we considered two feasibility settings: a high-feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and a low-feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a 2-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation.

Findings

Model fitting by sequential Monte Carlo resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset before symptom onset of 0·77 days (95% CI -1·98 to 0·29) for the shorter serial interval, and for the longer serial interval it resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset after symptom onset of 0·51 days (95% CI -0·77 to 1·50). Individual quarantine in high-feasibility settings, where at least 75% of infected contacts are individually quarantined, contains an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with a short serial interval (4·8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where the outbreak continues to grow (eg, low-feasibility settings), so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine, particularly uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms). When resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1·25, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number < 1).

Interpretation

Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts. To the extent that these interventions can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

### Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study [^114Mco1v]. The Lancet: Public Health (2021). High credibility.

Background

In most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts.

Methods

We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy.

Findings

Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12–56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28–79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31–81; risk ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% UI 0·62–1·24) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28–77; RR 0·88, 0·66–1·11) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23–81; RR 0·88, 0·60–1·43) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster.

Interpretation

Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^111yw3qG]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our results provide evidence of the risk of transmission from people released from test-based quarantine. Individuals in strict quarantine tested positive at a lower rate than those in nonstrict quarantine. This study shows the importance of empirical validation of quarantine guidelines and offers an approach for such validation. As future variants emerge, similar analyses should be conducted to ensure the guidance remains relevant.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^115yt5Tj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from individuals leaving test-based quarantines of various durations?

Findings

In this cohort study of 301 quarantined university students and staff who tested positive for COVID-19, 40 (13.3%) tested negative and were asymptomatic on day 7, implying an approximate 13% postquarantine transmission risk for 7-day test-based quarantine.

Meaning

To maintain the 5% transmission risk used as the basis for the 7-day guideline, our data suggest that quantitative polymerase chain reaction test–based, nonstrict quarantine should be 10 days.

### Comparative analyses of eighteen rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR for COVID-19 quarantine and surveillance-based isolation [^111ZrYwA]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Because all results presented here relate to transmission, a higher probability that a RA test produces a false-negative result (compared with RT-PCR), in the late stages of disease — when the individual may no longer be infectious — matters far less than their higher probability of producing a false-positive result during early stages of the disease. RA tests exhibit distinct PPA trajectories, especially late in disease; however, the estimated quarantine durations and frequencies of serial testing were relatively robust among the 18 RA tests (differentiating at most a day). Therefore, we expect little to no change in these estimates as additional information about the diagnostic sensitivity over the disease course for each RA test emerges.

The frequency of serial testing to maintain R E < 1 was robust under alternative infectivity curves and incubation periods for the majority of the RA tests, with reductions in R E being consistent with previous studies. However, the combined change in the infectivity profile and incubation period influenced the utility of RA tests in quarantine. When there is a low probability of identifying a case in the incubation period and more transmission after the incubation period, an RT-PCR on exit from quarantine reduces PQT more than a RA test on both entry and exit for quarantines of six days or longer duration. With the emergence of Omicron, the US CDC has shortened the recommended 7-day quarantine to a 5-day quarantine after exposure, followed by five days of strict mask use. Omicron is estimated to have an incubation period of about three days, roughly two and a half days shorter than the estimated incubation period of the original pandemic virus (i.e. our alternative scenario). The infectivity profile of Omicron has not yet been determined. Preliminary evidence indicates that the viral load peaks between three to six days after diagnosis or symptom onset when infected with the Omicron variant. This later peak in viral load relative to prior variants could indicate a shift toward a greater proportion of transmission occurring after symptom onset. Under these conditions, we would hypothesize that RA tests will be less effective at identifying cases during a 5-day quarantine compared to RT-PCR. Diagnostic sensitivity of the RA tests has remained fairly stable as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved –, but could, in principle, change with new emerging variants. Our scenario analyses suggests that epidemiological characteristics of the disease (e.g. incubation period, infectivity profile, proportion of asymptomatic transmission) impact testing strategies more than moderate changes in diagnostic sensitivity.

### Estimating the latent period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^114mBuKM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Using detailed exposure information on COVID-19 cases, we estimated the mean latent period to be 5.5 (95% CI: 5.1–5.9) days, shorter than the mean incubation period (6.9 days). Laboratory testing may allow shorter quarantines since 95% of COVID-19 cases shed virus within 10.6 (95% CI: 9.6–11.6) days of infection.

### A rapid review of measures to support people in isolation or quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of such measures [^1128f36d]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19) outbreak a global pandemic. As of 16 March 2021, there have been almost 120 million cases and over 2.5 million deaths from laboratory‐confirmed cases of Covid‐19 worldwide. In the context of the overall public health response to Covid‐19, effective management of cases and their contacts is key to reducing the spread of Covid‐19. In regard to cases, that is, those with confirmed or suspected Covid‐19 infection, isolation is the term used to describe their separation from those who are not infected. Quarantine is the term used to describe separation of those exposed or potentially exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) from others, as a precautionary measure because they may have the disease. Measures to support individuals in isolation and quarantine should be considered to improve compliance with the recommendations. As such, the aim of this rapid review was to (1) identify the measures being taken internationally to support compliance with isolation and quarantine recommendations during the Covid‐19 pandemic (a review of international guidance) and (2) to determine the effectiveness of such measures during pandemics or epidemics involving respiratory pathogens (a review of primary research studies) on compliance and reduction in spread of infection.

### Assessment of day-7 postexposure testing of asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients to evaluate early release from quarantine-Vermont, may-November 2020 [^113DD2Lb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

On May 8, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) issued a Health Update * recommending shortening the duration of quarantine for persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Exposed persons who were in quarantine could be tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on or after quarantine day 7. Those who had remained asymptomatic throughout quarantine and who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on or after day 7 could end quarantine. This policy was based on a report suggesting that symptom onset occurs within this time frame in approximately three quarters of COVID-19 cases and on consultation of the Vermont Health Commissioner with the U.S. Surgeon General. VDH implemented this policy to minimize restrictions on state residents, recognizing that some reduction could occur in the prevention benefit of quarantine to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. State-run SARS-CoV-2 testing sites were made available to increase access to no-cost testing and facilitate implementation of this policy. During August 1–December 1, among persons seeking testing at a VDH SARS-CoV-2 testing site, 36% stated that their reason for seeking testing was to end quarantine early (VDH, unpublished data, December 7, 2020), indicating that persons were aware of and following the policy and using the testing services provided. To assess the effectiveness of this policy, VDH analyzed testing data for contacts of persons with a COVID-19 diagnosis. During May 8–November 16, VDH identified 8,798 exposed contacts of COVID-19 patients; 3,983 (45%) had sought testing within 14 days of their exposure, with day 0 defined as the date of last exposure noted in the case investigation record. Among these persons, 2,200 (55%) who received testing on days 7–10 were included in this analysis; 977 (44.9%) of these contacts had a specimen collected for testing on day 7. Among these, 34 (3%) had test results that were positive, 940 (96%) had results that were negative, and three (< 1%) had results that were indeterminate (Table). Among the 34 contacts who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result on day 7 after exposure, 12 (35%) were asymptomatic. The remaining 22 contacts with positive test results were symptomatic at the time of testing; approximately one half had developed symptoms on days 4–7 after exposure. Among the 940 contacts who received negative test results on specimens collected on day 7 after exposure, 154 (16%) had a subsequent test within the next 7 days (i.e. days 8–14); among these, 152 (99%) had tests that remained negative, and two (1%) had results that were indeterminate.

### Implications of shortened quarantine among household contacts of index patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection-Tennessee and Wisconsin, April-September 2020 [^11582451]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Quarantine can stop onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2; however, adherence to a 14-day quarantine can be challenging. Analysis of data from an ongoing study of SARS-CoV-2 detection after exposure to an infected household member found an 81% chance that a household contact who had negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and was asymptomatic for 7 days after the index patient's illness onset date would remain asymptomatic and continue to receive negative RT-PCR test results through 14 days. Conversely, one in five household contacts would become symptomatic or receive positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results between day 7 and 14, suggesting that, compared with no quarantine, reducing quarantine to < 14 days might decrease but not eliminate the risk for spreading SARS-CoV-2.

With consistent adherence, quarantine prevents transmission from persons who were exposed to the virus and who might become infectious, but who do not have symptoms or signs of infection (i.e. who are presymptomatic or who will remain asymptomatic). The length of quarantine is typically based on the known incubation period, or the interval between exposure to an infectious pathogen and the development of symptoms or signs of infection, which for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2 to 14 days. §§ However, quarantine efforts will not effectively reduce transmission if adherence is low. Evidence suggests that adherence to recommended quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic varies and might be low in some settings. France, Belgium, and now some jurisdictions in the United States have shortened the quarantine period for persons exposed to someone with COVID-19 from 14 days to 10 or 7 days, but there is ongoing concern that shortening quarantine for all exposed persons could increase community transmission. Modeling studies suggest that combining a shorter quarantine with a timely diagnostic test at the end, to detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections, might carry some residual risk for transmission but could be an alternative to a 14-day quarantine period if the shorter quarantine length enhances compliance., *

### Implications of shortened quarantine among household contacts of index patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection-Tennessee and Wisconsin, April-September 2020 [^111cRfqE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

A 14-day quarantine of all close contacts who are exposed to a person with COVID-19, such as in the household, is the most effective strategy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Although persons might be more adherent to a shorter quarantine period, such a policy is not without risk for further spread. Timely access to a sufficiently sensitive test at the end of a shorter quarantine period will help identify household contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infection and might enable an effective shorter quarantine period for household contacts who remain asymptomatic and have negative test results, who pose lower risk for further spread of COVID-19.

### Implications of shortened quarantine among household contacts of index patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection-Tennessee and Wisconsin, April-September 2020 [^1133SMDd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

To prevent further transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), CDC currently recommends that persons who have been in close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection should quarantine (stay away from other persons) for 14 days after the last known contact. * However, quarantine might be difficult to maintain for a prolonged period. A shorter quarantine might improve compliance, and CDC recommends two options to reduce the duration of quarantine for close contacts without symptoms, based on local circumstances and availability of testing: 1) quarantine can end on day 10 without a test or 2) quarantine can end on day 7 after receiving a negative test result. † However, shorter quarantine might permit ongoing disease transmission from persons who develop symptoms or become infectious near the end of the recommended 14-day period. Interim data from an ongoing study of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand the proportion of household contacts that had detectable virus after a shortened quarantine period. Persons who were household contacts of index patients completed a daily symptom diary and self-collected respiratory specimens for 14 days. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Among 185 household contacts enrolled, 109 (59%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 at any time; 76% (83/109) of test results were positive within 7 days, and 86% (94 of 109) were positive within 10 days after the index patient's illness onset date. Among household contacts who received negative SARS-CoV-2 test results and were asymptomatic through day 7, there was an 81% chance (95% confidence interval [CI] = 67%–90%) of remaining asymptomatic and receiving negative RT-PCR test results through day 14; this increased to 93% (95% CI = 78%–98%) for household members who were asymptomatic with negative RT-PCR test results through day 10. Although SARS-CoV-2 quarantine periods shorter than 14 days might be easier to adhere to, there is a potential for onward transmission from household contacts released before day 14.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^116J9eNS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Stricter quarantine was associated with shorter conversion times. In strict quarantine, 6 (7.1%; 95% CI, 3.0%-15.0%), 2 (2.9%; 95% CI, 0.2%-8.7%), and 0 (0%; 95% CI, 0%-5.3%) individuals who converted did so after days 7, 10, and 14, respectively, compared with 34 (16.0%; 95% CI, 12.0%-21.0%), 12 (5.8%; 95% CI, 3.2%-9.6%), and 4 (2.0%; 95% CI, 0.6%-4.9%) in nonstrict quarantine. In 5 of the post–day 10 individuals in nonstrict quarantine who converted, additional questioning by contact tracers revealed that, in all 5 cases, the individual was reexposed to a person with COVID-19 during their quarantine. This suggests that a higher rate of repeated exposures during quarantine may explain the longer conversion times seen in nonstrict quarantine; thus, strict quarantine data are more likely to provide accurate estimates of conversion times in quarantine.

Of 1319 exposed individuals in strict quarantine, 132 (10%) converted; of 2322 exposed individuals in nonstrict quarantine, 286 (12%) converted. Thus, stricter quarantine was associated with a lower chance of getting a positive test result (10% vs 12%; p = 0.04 in 2-sided proportion test) suggesting that nonstrict quarantine could contain individuals who were reexposed during quarantine. This result, along with shorter conversion times in stricter quarantine, suggests that stricter quarantine is associated with reduced transmission.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^111PhvaL]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

An outbreak can be triggered or sustained within an environment that is monitored only for symptoms of COVID-19. Quarantining individuals before returning to work or school has been a common strategy among many businesses, the military, and universities to prevent potential outbreaks. An offshore or military setting is one of the numerous close-quarters environments in modern society where an outbreak can seriously impact operational integrity, leading to compromised safety and adverse economic consequences. Hence, minimizing outbreak risk while maintaining staffing is critical. Testing may allow for the quarantine duration to be reduced without increasing the risk of PQT. For example, many universities have implemented plans for quarantining and frequent testing of students and employees, where resources allow. For businesses and close-quarters environments, the impact of false negatives is a substantially greater issue for operational integrity than false positives. Consistent with the results from our analytic model (Fig. 1A and Fig. 3A), simulations from a recent agent-based model suggest that testing on exit — or entry and exit — of a 7-day quarantine can avert similar transmission as a 14-day quarantine with no transmission. Our results show that testing upon entry to quarantine carries such a risk of false negatives, as infected individuals who enter quarantine very early in the incubation period of the disease may not be detected due to low viral loads.

Our estimates for the probability of PQT for the various strategies were estimated assuming a basic reproductive number of 2.5 throughout the disease course, and unchanged post-quarantine. In the offshore environment, individuals are living in very confined quarters which could lead to higher PQT and a larger number of secondary infections. In some community settings, the number of secondary infections can be reduced through mask-wearing, social distancing, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. These changes in the number of secondary infections post-quarantine can markedly influence the probability of PQT. However, they would not affect the relative benefit of testing on exit compared to entry. Therefore, our qualitative finding of the optimality of testing later in quarantine than on entry are robust to settings with extensive PQT.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^112PeGRo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

These 301 individuals included in this study had a median (IQR) age of 22.0 (20.0–25.0) years; 131 individuals (43.5%) identified as female; and 20 individuals (6.6%) were staff. Of the 287 individuals who reported race and ethnicity, 21 individuals (7.3%) were African American or Black, 60 (20.9%) Asian, 17 (5.9%) Hispanic or Latinx, 174 (60.6%) White, and 15 (5.2%) other (including multiracial and/or multiethnic). We analyzed conversion times for these 301 individuals (Figure 1), as measured from the last exposure date to the dates of the last negative and first positive test results. These are aggregated into a graph of conversion time by day (Figure 2).

We estimated the risk of conversion after release from quarantine by aggregating conversion time (Figure 3). In strict and nonstrict quarantine combined, 40 of 301 individuals with positive test results (13.3%; 95% CI, 9.9%-17.6%) were asymptomatic and had not yet converted on day 7. Under the 7-day guideline, these 40 would have been released on day 7 and converted afterwards, reflecting postquarantine conversion and therefore transmission risk. Similarly, of 301 individuals who converted, 15 (4.9%; 95% CI 3.0%-8.1%) and 4 (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.4%-3.5%) had negative test results and were asymptomatic on days 10 and 14, respectively.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — despite evidence quality described as moderate to very low, the panel recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 and states that testing is suggested for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions; evidence supporting rapid testing and use of upper respiratory specimens other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs is sufficient to warrant conditional recommendations in favor of these approaches.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^115phoP8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance.

Objective

The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space.

Methods

IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations.

Conclusions

Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.

### Suspected cases of COVID-19: study protocol for reporting characteristics and the outcomes [^115kMani]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

At the start, WHO advised screen and triage, all suspected cases who had mild symptoms had a COVID-19 PCR test. Patients with positive results were advised quarantine in either home or quarantine facilities dependant on local guidance. Later with the strain on resources, guidance was updated. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and many countries updated guidance to advise home isolation with no testing for suspected cases with mild symptoms. Testing for COVID-19 virus is now reserved for severe presentation or high-risk population dependant on the local guidelines.

CDC provided prioritisation criteria for testing. The priority-1 population included patient requiring hospitalisation. Priority-2 population include patients older than 65 years of age, with comorbid conditions, in long-term facilities and first responders with symptoms. Suspected and probable cases with mild symptoms and that are not deemed as a priority case for testing will be advised to home isolate for 14 days with remote follow-up and safety netting. CDC guidance advises clinician to use clinical judgement to decide whether a patient should be tested for COVID-19 or not. The new guidance created a new cohort of patients with diagnosis based on the risk of exposure and symptoms but no laboratory confirmation. To our knowledge, there is little reporting on outcomes in this cohort of patients.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^112csw5Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a rapidly emerging disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support the WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.

Objectives

To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID‐19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission.

Search methods

An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020.

Selection criteria

Cohort studies, case‐control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID‐19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate. Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full‐text publications. One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS‐I for non‐randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non‐randomised, non‐controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs.

Main results

We included 51 studies; 4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID‐19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta‐analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis. We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI. We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non‐controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5. We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies.

Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID‐19 case in comparison to no quarantine

Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID‐19, 1 on SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID‐19, 1 on SARS, low‐certainty evidence). Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID‐19, low‐certainty evidence). Very low‐certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS).

Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID‐19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures

When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID‐19; onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID‐19; mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID‐19, low‐certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID‐19.

Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID‐19 outbreak compared to no quarantine

Very low‐certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID‐19 (2 observational studies on COVID‐19 and 2 observational studies on SARS).

Authors' conclusions

The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID‐19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID‐19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact of the measures implemented.

This review was originally commissioned by the WHO and supported by Danube‐University‐Krems. The update was self‐initiated by the review authors.

### The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application [^115ePcwN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities.

Objective

To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications.

Design

Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020.

Setting

News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

Participants

Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China.

Measurements

Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization.

Results

There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.

Limitation

Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases.

Conclusion

This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

### Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS? [^113gH5Tz]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths. SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine. By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated. By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths. Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19. COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread. Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths. Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.

### When should asymptomatic persons Be tested for COVID-19? [^117BobBx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

On 24 August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its website to highlight that asymptomatic individuals, even those with exposure to a COVID-19-positive contact, do not necessarily need to be tested unless they have medical conditions associated with increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The CDC subsequently updated its guidance on 19 September 2020 to support testing of asymptomatic persons, including close contacts of persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this editorial, the American Society for Microbiology Clinical and Public Health Microbiology Committee's Subcommittee on Laboratory Practices comments on testing of asymptomatic individuals relative to current medical knowledge of the virus and mitigation measures. Specific points are provided concerning such testing when undertaking contact tracing and routine surveillance. Limitations to consider when testing asymptomatic persons are covered, including the need to prioritize testing of contacts of positive COVID-19 cases. We urge the CDC to consult with primary stakeholders of COVID-19 testing when making such impactful changes in testing guidance.

### COVID-19 pandemic: the effects of quarantine on cardiovascular risk [^113ib69v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. 2019 guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease indicate that "Adults should engage in at least 150minute per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75minute per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk". During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to follow a healthy diet should be implemented. Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to good lifestyle.

### Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2: a modelling study [^1146CWca]. The Lancet: Public Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

To break transmission chains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of COVID-19, testing of cases and tracing and quarantine of their contacts has been used as a key non-pharmaceutical intervention in many countries. This measure aims to prevent onward transmission from secondary infections (individuals infected by an index case), and has been used successfully to prevent new outbreaks in countries such as South Korea, without the need for lockdown-style measures. As of November, 2020, guidance in the UK was that contact-traced individuals must quarantine from the moment they are traced until 14 days have elapsed from their exposure to the index case. 14 days is the upper bound for the incubation period of the virus, when more than 95% of eventually symptomatic individuals will have developed symptoms and should subsequently enter a further period of self-isolation (10 days in the UK). However, there is growing evidence that many contacts of cases are unable to effectively quarantine for the entirety of this period, particularly those unable to work from home, or those caring for vulnerable people. The increasing availability of testing, particularly rapid, low-cost lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests, opens up the possibility of shorter periods of quarantine when combined with a negative test on exit (a test and release strategy), or even the avoidance of quarantine entirely if it is replaced with daily testing. If effective, both these strategies have the potential to substantially reduce the burden of quarantine on uninfected contacts, which could simultaneously improve quarantine adherence and reduce the economic, personal, financial, and social costs of the current policy.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a standard 14-day quarantine period from the day a contact was exposed to an index case has been required in the UK and elsewhere. This approach aims to avert onward transmission during infected contacts' presymptomatic period. This strategy, although a crucial part of the global pandemic response to interrupt transmission chains, places considerable social, financial, and economic pressure on quarantining individuals and society. A search of the literature on Dec 3, 2020, using the terms "quarantine AND test* AND (COVID* OR SARS*) AND effect* AND contact tracing" returned 59 results on PubMed and 1934 results on medRxiv; however, no study had investigated the effect of heterogeneity in viral load or the effectiveness of daily testing without quarantine.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^116sNPmf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Knowing more about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection can improve assessments of quarantine duration guidelines. If we know that most people convert by reverse transcriptase–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test before a certain day postexposure, individuals with negative test results on that day are unlikely to be SARS-CoV-2–positive afterwards. A previous study measured SARS-CoV-2 positivity at different times in quarantined students in kindergarten through 12th grade; however, it was difficult to draw strong conclusions from this study as positive test results were few and students were tested infrequently, and rarely before day 7 following exposure.

Here we report the conversion times — the times between exposure and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 — for 301 unvaccinated university students and staff who were identified as close contacts with individuals with COVID-19 infection, quarantined, and later tested positive between September 2020 and February 2021. Transmission from test-based quarantine, where people are released from quarantine based on negative RT-qPCR results, occurs when individuals first test positive after release. These individuals spend their full qPCR-positive period and most of their infectious period outside quarantine. Thus we can estimate transmission and set quarantine duration based on these conversion times (for non–test-based quarantine, metrics like latent period are more useful).

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing conclusions — based on moderate certainty evidence, the IDSA panel recommends NAAT for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19, suggests testing a specimen from the nasopharynx or alternative upper respiratory tract once rather than repeat testing, suggests testing selected asymptomatic individuals when results will significantly impact isolation/quarantine/usage of PPE, suggests against routine NAAT of asymptomatic individuals before hospitalization or a medical/surgical procedure with specified contextual exceptions, and suggests against repeat NAAT to guide removal of isolation in patients with COVID-19.

### Long-term psychological effects of COVID-19-related quarantine: an observational study of three cohorts in Norway and Iceland [^112qBKcY]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Leveraging data from three large longitudinal cohorts from Iceland and Norway, we found an elevated prevalence of probable depression and anxiety among individuals exposed to quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The association was dose-dependent with duration of quarantine, with the most pronounced prevalence increase noted among individuals quarantined for 4 weeks or more, especially confirmed by longitudinal analysis with up to 24 months follow-up. This association between psychological health and quarantine was greater among females, middle-aged individuals, and those without a COVID-19 infection, and was both noted among individuals with and without a previous diagnosis of mental disorder. The increase in the prevalence of probable depression and anxiety remained significant over 4 weeks after being released from quarantine. Our findings shed further light on the psychological burden associated with quarantine which should be considered in future planning and organization of containment measures. Tailored and targeted prevention and intervention strategies for specifically vulnerable subgroups should also be considered.

### Mask effectiveness for preventing secondary cases of COVID-19, Johnson county, Iowa, USA [^114K84Tg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

On September 29, 2020, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) issued new guidance for persons who had been in contact with someone infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (hereafter called case-patients). This guidance recommended that when both the case-patient and the contact were correctly and consistently masked during an exposure, the contact should perform symptom monitoring for 14 days instead of quarantining at home. This guidance deviated substantially from that provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which still recommended at-home quarantine after exposure to someone with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), regardless of mask use. Johnson County Public Health (JCPH) staff decided to follow IDPH guidance but also supported any persons or organizations who chose to continue to follow the CDC recommendation.

Although the IDPH change in guidance provided an opportunity to lessen the burden of the pandemic on Johnson County, we were concerned about a potential increase in transmission rates. Because data supporting this change in guidance were lacking, we designed a prospective cohort study to evaluate the potential risk for increased virus transmission by measuring the secondary attack rates (SARs) of COVID-19 between persons exposed when both parties were masked and those exposed when > 1 person was unmasked.

The purpose of this study was to examine how effective masks are at reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, whether the new IDPH recommendation for symptom monitoring was appropriate. However, mask use is only 1 of many factors that affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While examining the available data, we identified several additional risk factors of interest, including symptom status, exposure setting, and exposure duration. This information enabled us to examine additional guidance relating to COVID-19, such as early release from quarantine and the potential for airborne transmission, to ensure that our recommendations did not increase the risk for transmission in the community.

After reviewing relevant literature, we hypothesized that mask use consistent with CDC guidance would reduce the SAR for COVID-19 in nonhousehold contacts from 10% to 5%. The study proposal was evaluated according to internal ethics review protocols, met the criteria for public health practice, and was not required to undergo institutional review board review.

### Assessment of day-7 postexposure testing of asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients to evaluate early release from quarantine-Vermont, may-November 2020 [^116LraiF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, this analysis was conducted on a convenience sample that included only positive test results received electronically or by fax and negative test results received electronically. Negative test results that were received by fax were not entered into the surveillance system and so are not included in this analysis. Second, the limited demographic data on contacts of patients could hamper the matching of a contact with a laboratory result; thus, the number of contacts tested might be underreported. Although persons who were retested remained negative (1% indeterminate), they represented only 16% of the total number of persons who discontinued quarantine. Finally, asymptomatic status during quarantine until the time of testing for persons testing negative could not be verified.

These results indicate that among the persons in quarantine who tested negative at day 7 after exposure, none who were retested between day 8 and 14 were positive. Allowing asymptomatic persons to shorten quarantine with a negative test at day 7 or later has not been demonstrated to result in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the policy has been effective. These results also indicate that 3.9% of contacts tested on days 7–10 after exposure were infected with SARS-CoV-2. In addition to reducing the duration of quarantine for exposed contacts, Vermont's policy might have provided additional benefits to the state's pandemic response by identifying some asymptomatic patients earlier in the course of their illness through enhancing statewide surveillance testing of an exposed group. This assessment supports Vermont's policy as being effective and offers data to support recommendations to shorten quarantine with testing such as those provided in CDC's updated quarantine guidance. †

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^111nCArt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and for identifying asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The number of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests continues to increase as does the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss nuances of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing. IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations. Access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention, and the public health response to COVID-19 infection. Information on the clinical performance of available tests continues to grow, but the quality of evidence of the current literature to support this updated molecular diagnostic guideline remains moderate to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is suggested for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions. Evidence in support of rapid testing and testing of upper respiratory specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs, which offer logistical advantages, is sufficient to warrant conditional recommendations in favor of these approaches.

### Summary of guidance for public health strategies to address high levels of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related deaths, December 2020 [^113YD2bC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Prompt case investigation and contact tracing to identify, quarantine, and test close contacts. Case investigation is the process of obtaining comprehensive information about persons with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and is followed by contact tracing, which includes identifying and communicating with persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. close contacts *) to inform them of their exposure, educate them about risks for and symptoms of COVID-19, and encourage them to quarantine, seek testing, and monitor themselves for signs or symptoms of illness. ††† Quarantine is used to keep a person who was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 away from others. §§§ Contact tracing is most feasible when the incidence of COVID-19 in the community or workplace is low or declining, when testing and reporting of results can occur quickly, and when most contacts can be reached and quarantined. When one or more of these conditions is not met or when local capacity is overwhelmed, health departments should narrow the scope of contact tracing activities and emphasize community mitigation measures. Investigations should prioritize persons who most recently received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, as well as identify and quarantine household contacts and persons exposed in a congregate living facility, high-density workplace, or other setting (or event) with potential extensive transmission. Because the risk for household transmission is high and occurs rapidly in the absence of face masks or other protective behaviors, household members of persons with diagnosed COVID-19 should be quarantined, and, in the event that they experience symptoms or receive a positive test result, they should be isolated. Eliciting and reaching contacts in a timely manner is challenging, and quarantine can impose economic and financial burdens; adherence to quarantine might require provision of appropriate support services. Persons who receive positive SARS-COV-2 test results should also be encouraged to serve as their own contact tracers by informing close contacts that they have been exposed and encouraging those persons to quarantine, monitor for symptoms, and seek testing.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^112g2ReN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — Recommendation 6 states that for individuals who have clinical or epidemiologic reasons that might make testing desirable, the IDSA panel suggests SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in asymptomatic individuals who are either known or suspected to have been exposed to COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remarks note limited evidence and no EUA-approved therapy for asymptomatic COVID-19 but allow that individual clinical scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment, and individuals with high-risk conditions or in close contact with immunocompromised individuals may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days the exposed individual should get tested immediately. Known exposures are defined as close contact for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period with someone with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, while suspected exposures may include working or residing in congregate settings experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. The decision to test asymptomatic persons should depend on availability of testing resources, knowledge of infection can inform appropriate isolation, risk varies by exposure conditions with household contacts especially high-risk, and the recommendation assumes the exposed individual was not wearing appropriate PPE.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). High credibility.

Testing and return to work for health care workers — Transmission of COVID-19 to exposed health care workers (HCWs) has been documented, and since a negative test does not preclude subsequent infection, even soon after testing, periodic viral testing for asymptomatic HCWs is not currently a standard approach, but enhanced surveillance for HCWs for even mild symptoms, fever, or a history of exposure and universal masking has generally been adopted. Quarantine of HCWs with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and return-to-work criteria should follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines or local policy. Active viral shedding remains a possibility for asymptomatic individuals with positive IgM and/or IgG serology; when available, viral testing should be performed to help determine whether the HCW is in true convalescence without active viral shedding, and whether antibodies confer immunity to recurrent infection is unproven. Postoperative or postprocedure COVID-19 testing may need to be considered in patients who develop symptoms after the procedure, and operational guidelines for testing and management of results should be determined.

### Safely returning America to work: part I: general guidance for employers [^111mCCeT]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 return-to-work and exposure management — essential service workers and close contacts: Viral shedding may begin as early as 2 to 3 days before symptom onset. For essential service workers, CDC recommends return to work 10 or more days after onset of symptoms, with the absence of fever for 72 hours after being off any fever-reducing medications, and it is recommended that interviews with workers be repeated every 2 days by OEM professionals. For exposed workers with possible false-negative tests (test sensitivity of only 70% to 75%), those exposed to a positive or presumed case should have the choice of quarantine for 14 days or work with a mask for 14 days with temperature checks twice daily and discontinuation of work if any symptoms develop. In health care settings after COVID-19 illness, modifications required face mask for source control at all times and avoidance of immunosuppressed patients until 14 days after illness onset.

### A rapid review of measures to support people in isolation or quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of such measures [^114LTiA1]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

This rapid review aimed to identify measures available to support those in isolation or quarantine during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, and determine their effectiveness in improving adherence to these recommendations and or reducing transmission. The rapid review consisted of two elements, the first was a review of guidance published by national and international agencies relating to measures to support those in isolation (due to case status) or quarantine (due to close contact status) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Five categories of support measures were identified in the international guidance, they were: Psychological, addiction and safety supports, Essential supplies, Financial aid, Information provision and Enforcement. The second element was a rapid literature review of the effectiveness of measures used to support individuals in isolation or quarantine during any pandemic or epidemic setting, due to respiratory pathogens. A systematic search of published peer-reviewed articles and nonpeer-reviewed pre-prints was undertaken from 1 January 2000 to 26 January 2021. Two Australian publications met the inclusion criteria, both based on data from a survey undertaken during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The first reported that 55% of households were fully compliant with quarantine recommendations, and that there was increased compliance reported in households that understood what they were meant to do compared with those who reported that they did not (odds ratio [OR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35–3.80). The second reported that access to paid sick and or carer's leave did not predict compliance with quarantine recommendations (OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 0.82–5.23). Neither reported on reduction in transmission.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^113ymuxZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID‐19. For this reason, non‐pharmacological public health measures such as isolation, physical distancing, and quarantine are the only effective ways to respond to the outbreak. Isolation refers to the separation of COVID‐19 cases whereas quarantine is the restriction of asymptomatic healthy people who have had contact with confirmed or suspected cases. Quarantine can be implemented on a voluntary basis or can be legally enforced by authorities and may be applied at an individual, group, or community level (community containment (Cetron 2005)). A recent rapid review reported that quarantine can have negative psychological effects such as post‐traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger, which can lead to adverse long‐term psychological effects (Brooks 2020). The WHO and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend 14 days of quarantine for individuals who were in close contact with a confirmed case, based on the estimated incubation period of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Jernigan 2020b; WHO 2020e).

According to the International Health Regulations 2005 (WHO 2005), that govern the management of disease outbreaks in 196 countries, any public health measures must be based on scientific evidence and recommendations from the WHO (Habibi 2020). At the beginning of February 2020, the WHO requested the review authors to conduct a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during serious coronavirus outbreaks to support recommendations on quarantine. We updated the rapid review in March 2020 and published it in April 2020 (Nussbaumer‐Streit 2020). Because the body of evidence on COVID‐19 is growing very quickly, we self‐initiated an update of the rapid review in June 2020.

The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting therapy for asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatment approved through EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, and notes that high-risk individuals (e.g., those who have pulmonary conditions or are immunocompromised or those in close contact with immunocompromised individuals) may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days, the exposed individual should get tested immediately.

Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for ending isolation — potential benefits, harms, and considerations: Potential benefits of NAAT to remove a patient from isolation might be definitive proof that a patient is not infectious, but such proof does not exist; potential harms include unnecessary prolongation of isolation with attendant consequences and unnecessary financial costs that should be considered. The decision to remove an individual from isolation involves assessing the person's contagiousness; viral culture is less sensitive for diagnosis than NAAT and methods are not standardized, and NAAT testing remains positive for days to weeks longer than viral culture. Many additional factors can affect transmission risk, including immune status and vaccination history, mask type, exposure duration, and ventilation of the exposure space.

### A rapid review of measures to support people in isolation or quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of such measures [^114vpJmx]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Overview of evidence summary on the effectiveness of measures to support isolation or quarantine on compliance and reduction in spread of infection.

The second element of this rapid review was a review of literature on the effectiveness of measures to support those in isolation or quarantine, that is, increased compliance with recommendations and reduced spread of infection. The lack of evidence identified in this review was echoed in a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published in July 2020. It included a mixed‐methods review of implementing quarantine (including isolation and or quarantine) to reduce or stop the spread of a contagious disease. The authors used quantitative evidence from research studies to determine the effectiveness of strategies to improve compliance with quarantine recommendations. The evidence predated the Covid‐19 pandemic, and included other infectious diseases, such as SARS‐CoV, MERS, Ebola, smallpox and measles and concluded that compliance with quarantine recommendations can vary by culture, disease and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, identified evidence provided low certainty evidence that such strategies (e.g. risk communication and messaging and access to employment leave) improve compliance with quarantine recommendations.

Methods

Our research protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine, and we have data use agreements with Boston University, Duke University, and Northeastern University. Written consent was obtained by each university as part of their university testing program. The written consent allowed for broad use of the deidentified and aggregated data for public health and research purposes. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for reporting study design, follow-up duration, participant recruitment methods, and other observational study details.

Four universities (Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts; Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts; and Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts) reported data from 418 students and staff who were quarantined because of potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure and subsequently tested positive between September 2020 and February 2021. Of 418 individuals with positive test results, 301 had complete data on presence of symptoms, date of last exposure, last negative test result during quarantine, first positive test result during quarantine, and date of symptom onset if symptoms occurred. These 301 individuals were included in our study. These data enable us to place the conversion time in the interval between the last negative test result and first positive test result. A total of 117 individuals with a first RT-PCR positive test by day 2 following exposure were excluded from the study, as it was assumed that these individuals were infected at an earlier date. We set the last negative date at 2 days postexposure if the recorded last negative date was before then, given that individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection have not typically been observed to receive positive test results until at least 2 days postexposure. Conversion times are reported in terms of days after exposure. The universities' frequent testing enabled us to pinpoint conversion time to within at most a 4-day interval in 84% of cases (254 of 301 individuals) (Figure 1).

### Time from start of quarantine to SARS-CoV-2 positive test among quarantined college and university athletes-17 States, June-October 2020 [^117NUZxz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

To safely resume sports, college and university athletic programs and regional athletic conferences created plans to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Mitigation measures included physical distancing, universal masking, and maximizing outdoor activity during training; routine testing; 10-day isolation of persons with COVID-19; and 14-day quarantine of athletes identified as close contacts * of persons with confirmed COVID-19. Regional athletic conferences created testing and quarantine policies based on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidance; testing policies varied by conference, school, and sport. To improve compliance with quarantine and reduce the personal and economic burden of quarantine adherence, the quarantine period has been reduced in several countries from 14 days to as few as 5 days with testing or 10 days without testing. Data on quarantined athletes participating in NCAA sports were used to characterize COVID-19 exposures and assess the amount of time between quarantine start and first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Despite the potential risk for transmission from frequent, close contact associated with athletic activities, more athletes reported exposure to COVID-19 at social gatherings (40.7%) and from roommates (31.7%) than they did from exposures associated with athletic activities (12.7%). Among 1,830 quarantined athletes, 458 (25%) received positive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results during the 14-day quarantine, with a mean of 3.8 days from quarantine start (range = 0–14 days) until the positive test result. Among athletes who had not received a positive test result by quarantine day 5, the probability of having a positive test result decreased from 27% after day 5 to < 5% after day 10. These findings support new guidance from CDC in which different options are provided to shorten quarantine for persons such as collegiate athletes, especially if doing so will increase compliance, balancing the reduced duration of quarantine against a small but nonzero risk for postquarantine transmission. Improved adherence to mitigation measures (e.g. universal masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene) at all times could further reduce exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and disruptions to athletic activities because of infections and quarantine.

### A rapid review of measures to support people in isolation or quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of such measures [^11655qYB]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

This review has a number of limitations. First, although official national and international agency and or government websites were reviewed to identify measures to support those in isolation or quarantine, there is a possibility that some measures may be in place, but are not documented on the websites reviewed. Second, this review did not evaluate if there was a relationship between the range and or intensity of measures offered and the burden of disease experienced in that country. Third, this review is limited by the type of review conducted for the effectiveness element of the question (i.e. a 'rapid literature review'). This was limited by the time constraints associated with the review, and the biases considered likely to be present in the primary research studies included.

### Prolonged incubation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a patient on rituximab therapy [^116eDFqY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan, China, and has since become a global pandemic through person-to-person spread. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits presymptomatic transmission during the incubation period, where an individual is contagious prior to symptom onset. Defining the incubation period, therefore, has infection control and public health implications because a longer incubation necessitates a longer quarantine duration after an exposure.

Mean incubation periods range from 5.0 to 7.2 days, and a median incubation period of 5.1 days has been reported. – In 2 studies, the 95th percentiles of the distribution were reported as 12.5 days and 13 days, and another 3 studies reported the 99th percentile as 11.9 days, 14 days, and 14.9 days, respectively. –, In the vast majority of cases, the incubation period is far less than 14 days, which has helped to inform the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for a 14-day quarantine period after a known coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure. However, these cases represent the general population and do not provide detailed information on subpopulations in whom the incubation period may differ. Herein, we present a case with objectively confirmed COVID-19 with a prolonged incubation period proven through viral culture.

### Effectiveness of different border control strategies for reducing mpox importation risk: a modelling study [^116ygxPv]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of quarantine was projected to increase linearly with duration. While a 7-day quarantine provided only modest benefits in reducing importation risk, extending the period to 28 days lowered the risk by over 90%. This is primarily due to the long incubation and infectious periods of mpox, often requiring over three weeks from exposure to full recovery. Decreasing viral shedding over the infectious period suggests a potential reduction in infectivity and thereby a further decline in the risk of local disease spread after quarantine ends. Beyond containment, the quarantine-only strategies offer several advantages, including minimal demand for PCR testing and associated costs. Existing infrastructure, such as hotels and hostels, can be repurposed to accommodate the incoming travellers, while household-based quarantine coupled with symptom screening at the border emerges as another practical optiondespite its carrying an increased risk of leakage due to non-compliance (Supplementary Fig. S3). As mpox is primarily transmitted through physical contact or sexual contact, the management of these options is more feasible relative to COVID-19, which was airborne. Nonetheless, the adverse impact of quarantine on individuals' mental health is of concern. In addition, adopting long quarantining periods could economically harm many countries that rely on tourism as a major source of national revenue. These downsides may collectively make long-duration quarantine unsustainable in the long run.

### Mask effectiveness for preventing secondary cases of COVID-19, Johnson county, Iowa, USA [^117Hwccw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

In September of 2020, the Iowa Department of Public Health released guidance stating that persons exposed to someone with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) need not quarantine if the case-patient and the contact wore face masks at the time of exposure. This guidance differed from that issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To determine the best action, we matched exposure information from COVID-19 case investigations with reported test results and calculated the secondary attack rates (SARs) after masked and unmasked exposures. Mask use by both parties reduced the SAR by half, from 25.6% to 12.5%. Longer exposure duration significantly increased SARs. Masks significantly reduced virus transmission when worn by both the case-patient and the contact, but SARs for each group were higher than anticipated. This finding suggests that quarantine after COVID-19 exposure is beneficial even if parties wore masks.

### Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a primer for emergency physicians [^111xYkdf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic.

Objective

This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19.

Discussion

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine.

Conclusion

This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel controls to identify MPXV-infected travelers: a simulation study [^115dqq3D]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To delay (and/or potentially avoid) an epidemic being seeded by international travelers, health screenings and viral tests are often paired with quarantine periods for travelers. Quarantine measures vary widely depending on the pathogen's severity and transmissibility and the political milieu. The implementation can range from quarantine in dedicated facilities, as seen in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and other countries with effective pandemic control, to self-quarantine at home, or simply monitoring symptoms and practicing precautionary behavior. Typically, the duration of quarantine is determined by the incubation period of the virus (e.g. the 95th/99th percentile). For instance, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially recommended a 14-day quarantine for individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2, based on epidemiological evidence suggesting that the 99th percentile of the incubation period was 14 days. However, for travelers from disease-prevalent regions, such long quarantine periods may be overly conservative and suboptimal. For example, while the mean incubation period of H1N1–2009 was 2.1 days, the mean time from departure to symptom onset for (infected) Japanese travelers returning from Hawaii was only 0.7 days.

For mpox, several questions remain regarding international travel controls (ITCs) and quarantine measures. First, it is uncertain whether viral testing bundled together with health screening at immigration is sufficient to prevent the introduction of pre-symptomatic MPXV-infected travelers. Second, with multiple sampling sites available, including saliva and rectum (details provided in the next section), it is unclear which sample type should be prioritized for viral testing. Third, if viral testing proves insufficient, the appropriate quarantine duration for travelers from mpox-affected countries who may have been exposed remains to be determined. To address these questions, we developed mathematical models informed by viral load data and epidemiological insights.

### A rapid review of measures to support people in isolation or quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of such measures [^112cU2So]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

A detailed summary of the methods used in this rapid review is provided in the protocol, which is in accordance with Cochrane rapid review methodology guidance.

In short, official national and international agency websites from a predefined list were searched for measures implemented to support those in isolation or quarantine during the Covid‐19 pandemic. Supports identified were then categorised by theme. Following a scoping exercise, it was evident that there was a lack of evidence relating to the effectiveness of measures implemented to support those in isolation or quarantine during the Covid‐19 pandemic. Therefore, evidence of the effectiveness of measures implemented to support those in isolation or quarantine relating to other respiratory pathogens (e.g. SARS‐CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]) from an epidemic or pandemic situation from 2000 to 2021 were included. A systematic search of published peer‐reviewed articles and nonpeer‐reviewed preprints was undertaken from 1 January 2000 up to 26 January 2021; no language restrictions were applied. All potentially eligible papers were exported to Covidence and titles/abstracts and full texts were single screened for relevance based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined in the protocol. Data extraction and quality appraisal of included studies was completed by a single reviewer and checked by a second reviewer; the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for analytical cross sectional studies was used for quality appraisal of included studies.

### A rapid review of measures to support people in isolation or quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of such measures [^114Sf7Bb]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

​Summary

This rapid review aimed to identify measures available to support those in isolation or quarantine during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19) pandemic, and determine their effectiveness in improving adherence to these recommendations and or reducing transmission. The rapid review consisted of two elements, the first was a review of guidance published by national and international agencies relating to measures to support those in isolation (due to case status) or quarantine (due to close contact status) during the Covid‐19 pandemic. Five categories of support measures were identified in the international guidance, they were: Psychological, addiction and safety supports, Essential supplies, Financial aid, Information provision and Enforcement. The second element was a rapid literature review of the effectiveness of measures used to support individuals in isolation or quarantine during any pandemic or epidemic setting, due to respiratory pathogens. A systematic search of published peer‐reviewed articles and nonpeer‐reviewed pre‐prints was undertaken from 1 January 2000 to 26 January 2021. Two Australian publications met the inclusion criteria, both based on data from a survey undertaken during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The first reported that 55% of households were fully compliant with quarantine recommendations, and that there was increased compliance reported in households that understood what they were meant to do compared with those who reported that they did not (odds ratio [OR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35–3.80). The second reported that access to paid sick and or carer's leave did not predict compliance with quarantine recommendations (OR: 2.07, 95% CI: 0.82–5.23). Neither reported on reduction in transmission.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — false positives and confirmatory testing: Given the high specificity of EUA rapid Ag tests, routine confirmation of positive test results is not usually necessary; positive results can be used immediately to help guide treatment, isolation, and quarantine decisions. Even when the pretest probability or prevalence is low (ie, 1%), the expected number of false-positive Ag results is very small, on the order of 0–10 false-positive results per 1000 individuals tested, and confirmation of positive Ag test results may be considered rarely on a case-by-case basis when the pretest probability or prevalence of infection is very low (ie, < 1%) and/or if the impact of a potential false-positive result is deemed to be significant and detrimental. Concerns about false-positive Ag results were not borne out in the medical literature.

### Safely returning America to work: part I: general guidance for employers [^112rLwWf]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 return-to-work employer policies — Employers should avoid requiring a positive COVID-19 test result or a health care provider's note from sick employees to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or return to work, and caution is given to relying on employee self-reporting, which can be problematic without validation. Policies for return to work after recovering from COVID-19 infection or exposure to an infected person must be established, and employers must put procedures in place to follow if an employee develops COVID-19 infection or tests positive for the virus, which should include working with their OEM professional; important considerations include quarantine and contact tracing. High-risk employees should be given special accommodations, should minimize face-to-face contact, maintain physical distance from others, and do telework when possible. While the emphasis should be on separating those with expected viral shedding from others, it is important to keep in mind that asymptomatic individuals may still pass the virus to others who may then develop symptoms. OEM professionals can help facilitate return to work in such instances.

### A test-to-stay modified quarantine program for COVID-19 in schools [^117FgxpX]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Mandatory quarantine upon exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) results in a substantial number of lost days of school. We hypothesized that implementation of a state-wide test-to-stay (TTS) program would allow more students to participate in in-person learning, and not cause additional clusters of COVID-19 cases due to in-school transmission.

Methods

For the 2020–2021 academic year, Massachusetts implemented an opt-in TTS program, in which students exposed to COVID-19 in school are tested each school day with a rapid antigen test. If negative, students may participate in school-related activities that day. Testing occurs daily for a duration of 7 calendar days after exposure. Here, we report the results from the first 13 weeks of the program.

Results

A total of 2298 schools signed up for TTS, and 504167 individuals out of a total population of 860457 consented. During the first 13 weeks with complete data, 1959 schools activated the program at least once for 102373 individual, exposed students. Out of 328271 tests performed, 2943 positive cases were identified (per person positivity rate, 2.9%, 95% confidence interval, 2.8–3.0). A minimum of 325328 and a maximum of 497150 days of in-person school were saved through participation in the program.

Conclusions

Daily, rapid on-site antigen testing is a safe and feasible alternative to mandatory quarantine and can be used to maximize safe in-person learning time during the pandemic.

### Assessing changes in incubation period, serial interval, and generation time of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117VsLpb]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The current study provides scientific evidence that the incubation period of COVID-19 has shortened as the virus has evolved, which has important implications for the formulation of effective epidemic control strategies such as isolation and quarantine. Vaccination has been shown to lead to reduced viral loads and duration of shedding of SARS-CoV-2, which varies with waning immunity. Virus replication and shedding abilities are variant specific, which impact the duration of the incubation period. At the individual level, vaccination or infection status can affect the immune response to the virus, which would impact the estimates of the incubation period across different viral lineages. Furthermore, vaccination coverage and vaccine products vary between countries, which may impact the estimates of the incubation period for different study sites for the same viral lineage. More research is needed to quantify the extent to which immunity affects the incubation period over time with consideration for individual-level heterogeneities as well as the effects of country-level heterogeneities of immunity on the incubation period for each VOC.

### Summary of guidance for public health strategies to address high levels of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related deaths, December 2020 [^1132XzU6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Postponing travel. Travel increases the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection and could translocate infection between communities. Postponing travel is the best way to reduce this risk. Any traveler who is symptomatic, has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 and has not met criteria for release from quarantine, or has a positive or pending SARS-CoV-2 test result should not travel. *For those contemplating international travel, CDC recommends getting tested with a viral test for SARS-CoV-2 1–3 days before departure and getting retested 3–5 days after arrival. ††††††† Domestic travelers should also consider testing. Testing does not eliminate all risk and should be combined with other recommended public health strategies. Both domestic and international travelers should stay home or reduce nonessential activities before travel, and for 7 days after travel if tested, even if test results are negative. If not tested, this period should be extended to 10 days. Travelers should be diligent about mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and symptom monitoring. For 14 days after arrival, travelers should avoid close contact with persons at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes and wear masks in household spaces shared with those who did not travel.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^1149J41U]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Assessment of quarantine and testing strategies implemented for offshore facilities

We applied our results in the context of employees of an off-shore oil company who were working a cycle of 26 days on, then 16 days off, a schedule that had been modified to make efficient use of a mandatory quarantine that was implemented during the pandemic. During the early stages of the epidemic, when prevalence was low, a 3-day quarantine had been implemented by the company in a secured facility, with testing on entry. Our risk-reduction models indicated substantial marginal benefit for increasing quarantine to 5–7 days with a test on exit. Testing on entry was retained for operational purposes, and testing 96 h later was initiated, accompanied by expansion to a 7-day quarantine for Region A and a 5-day quarantine for Region B.

To assess the practical implications of our recommendations, 4040 RT-PCR tests were conducted in region A and region B (serviced by different laboratories) prior to travel to offshore rigs. Among these, 69 results were positive (1.7%). Of the 1712 RT-PCR tests conducted on entry when the initial 3-day quarantine was in effect, there were 22 positive results (1.3%). After advisement, Region A deployed a 7-day home quarantine for all cycles starting August 13, where testing was performed on entry and exit (96 h after the first test); 50.0% (1/2) of the positive tests occurred on exit, following a negative test on entry (Fig. 2A). Starting June 25, Region B expanded to a 5-day hotel quarantine with testing on both entry and 96 h after the first test. For the period in which this strategy was implemented, 33.3% (15/45) of the positive tests were obtained upon the exit test, following a negative entry test (Fig. 2B). Further validation of the entry and exit testing protocol was provided through an additional 155 RT-PCR tests performed post-quarantine (11 days after the initial test) in Region B, all of which were negative.

### Effects of prolonged incubation period and centralized quarantine on the COVID-19 outbreak in shijiazhuang, China: a modeling study [^112upNcp]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Shijiazhuang estimated that the mean incubation period was 11.6 days. This suggests it is necessary to prolong the isolation/quarantine period currently so that all potentially infected individuals can be followed. Importantly, a long incubation period may lead to significant transmission of the virus before identification of initial cases. The serial interval (6.6 days) was substantial shorter than the incubation period, suggesting that a significant amount of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. Although resource intensive, the use of comprehensive quarantine measures and mass nucleic acid testing were effective to reduce the disease transmission quickly.

Confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have increased in the United States following the relaxation of strong lockdown measures. Contact tracing, which entails identifying and monitoring people who have been in close contact with individuals with confirmed diagnoses and encouraging them to self-isolate and quarantine, is recommended as a key component of COVID-19 control strategies. We used a mathematical model to examine the potential for contact tracing to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the context of relaxed physical distancing, under different assumptions for case detection, tracing, and quarantine efficacy.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — benefits and harms of testing asymptomatic exposed individuals explain that testing asymptomatic individuals who have been exposed, or suspected to have been exposed, to SARS-CoV-2 allows for isolation of those who are positive; isolation in institutional clusters or wider community outbreaks has the potential to help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission; a positive result will reinforce the importance of isolation as well as inform contact tracing, cohorting, or other mitigation strategies; and there is potential harm in a false negative NAAT result collected from an exposed individual.

### Long-term psychological effects of COVID-19-related quarantine: an observational study of three cohorts in Norway and Iceland [^112MFAW9]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While quarantine exposure has been associated with adverse mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, less was known about how the duration of quarantine affects symptoms of depression and anxiety, and whether these symptoms attenuate over time after quarantine exposure. In our study, we found that the length of quarantine exposure was significantly associated with increased prevalence of probable depression and anxiety in a dose-dependent manner, with longer periods in quarantine (i.e. 4 weeks or more) yielding the most pronounced prevalence increase. In line with our results, findings by Hawryluck et al. from the SARS pandemic indicated that individuals quarantined for more than 10 days experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms compared to those quarantined for less than 10 days. Although the prevalence among individuals with different durations of quarantine was elevated compared to those without quarantine in three cohorts, the magnitude of this association was higher among participants from the MoBa cohort, than MAP-19 and C-19 Resilience cohorts. This difference may be attributed to that MoBa specifically recruited parents who may have experienced greater family burden and responsibilities when quarantined. The increase in psychological distress with extended duration of quarantine may have several explanations. A recent study hypothesized that immobility is one possible pathway through which quarantine may be related to depression and anxiety. Longer periods of immobility due to longer quarantine periods may lead to reduced physical activity, which is a known risk factor of depression and anxious symptomatology; and in another points that it could lead to more time to ruminate, a key process in the development of depression. Additionally, longer periods of quarantine may be tied with increased social disconnection and loneliness, both of which have been associated with mental health adversities including increasing depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Optimizing benefits of testing key workers for infection with SARS-CoV-2: a mathematical modeling analysis [^112XV9UE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Internationally, key workers such as healthcare staff are advised to stay at home if they or household members experience coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-like symptoms. This potentially isolates/quarantines many staff without SARS-CoV-2, while not preventing transmission from staff with asymptomatic infection. We explored the impact of testing staff on absence durations from work and transmission risks to others.

Methods

We used a decision-analytic model for 1000 key workers to compare the baseline strategy of (S0) no RT-PCR testing of workers to testing workers (S1) with COVID-19-like symptoms in isolation, (S2) without COVID-19-like symptoms but in household quarantine, and (S3) all staff. We explored confirmatory re-testing scenarios of repeating all initial tests, initially positive tests, initially negative tests, or no re-testing. We varied all parameters, including the infection rate (0.1–20%), proportion asymptomatic (10–80%), sensitivity (60–95%), and specificity (90–100%).

Results

Testing all staff (S3) changes the risk of workplace transmission by -56.9 to +1.0 workers/1000 tests (with reductions throughout at RT-PCR sensitivity ≥ 65%), and absences by -0.5 to +3.6 days/test but at heightened testing needs of 989.6–1995.9 tests/1000 workers. Testing workers in household quarantine (S2) reduces absences the most by 3.0–6.9 days/test (at 47.0–210.4 tests/1000 workers), while increasing risk of workplace transmission by 0.02–49.5 infected workers/1000 tests (which can be minimized when re-testing initially negative tests).

Conclusions

Based on optimizing absence durations or transmission risk, our modeling suggests testing staff in household quarantine or all staff, depending on infection levels and testing capacities.

### Role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections in COVID-19 pandemic [^1157s2ZN]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Considering the proportion of cases and transmission risk associated with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections, asymptomatic cases of covid-19 are important sources of disease spread throughout the community setting. Active testing is therefore a key tool for control. Strategies for controlling covid-19 transmission should be tailored to the specific epidemiological situations, testing capacity, and values of individuals living in different countries. However, our scientific understanding of the role of asymptomatic infection in disease transmission and our experience using viral control strategies in China show that measures including active testing, the reporting and isolation of asymptomatic infections, and contact tracing followed by testing and quarantine are vitally important for controlling covid-19. Pursuing these measures was important for preventing extensive community transmission in China.

Many countries continue to face widespread community transmission of covid-19, and asymptomatic infection control in this situation is unlikely to be a priority. However, community transmission will eventually slow, and asymptomatic infections will continue to threaten the elimination of community transmission. We believe that China's approach will be valuable for countries with both high and low levels of covid-19 transmission. The country's experience also serves as a valuable example for effectively and rapidly responding to emerging infectious diseases with low infection rates in the future.

Key messages

Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections are important sources of covid-19 transmission
Mass testing and isolation of asymptomatic cases in China has stopped re-emergence of widespread community transmission
China's approach to managing asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infection has considerable value in preventing outbreaks in unexposed communities
China's experience can also be used to guide response to future emerging infectious diseases with low infection rates

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^114d43vw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The only observational study looking at quarantine in combination with other measures reported that as of 31 March 2020, 715 cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were confirmed in Hong Kong, of which 621 infections were symptomatic and 94 asymptomatic. The combination of public health measures (isolation of cases and quarantine of their contacts, quarantine of travellers, population behaviour changes, such as physical distancing, personal protective measures and travel restrictions) was associated with reduced spread of COVID‐19. However, the authors were not able to disentangle the specific effects of each measure (Cowling 2020).

Overall, the modelling studies conclude that quarantine in combination with other non‐pharmaceutical methods is more effective than no interventions and also than quarantine alone.

Tuite 2020 aimed to analyse how different non‐pharmaceutical control measures can contribute to control COVID‐19 and reduce burden on the healthcare system. They employed an age‐structured compartmental model of COVID‐19 transmission suited for the population in Ontario, Canada. In their base case scenario (limited testing, isolation, quarantine) 56% (95% credible interval 42% to 63%) of the Ontario population would be infected within two years. At the epidemic peak they estimate 107,000 cases in hospitals and 55,500 additional cases in intensive care units (ICUs). For fixed‐duration interventions, quarantine of exposed people, enhanced case detection and less aggressive physical distancing reduce the proportion of the infected population at two years. Implemented dynamically, 13 months of physical distancing, cycled on and off, reduced the median overall attack rate to 2%. The authors emphasize the important role of physical distancing and conclude that a dynamic approach that is turned on and off, depending on a threshold of current cases, could be sufficient to keep ICU resources from being overwhelmed compared to fixed‐duration interventions (Tuite 2020). Koo 2020 compared quarantine in combination with other control measures with quarantine alone using an agent‐based influenza epidemic simulation model for Singapore. While isolation of infected persons and quarantine of family members reduced the number of infected individuals compared with the baseline scenario by 95.8%*, quarantine plus school closure and workplace distancing reduced the median cumulative number of infections 96.4% and 98.57%*, respectively (*self‐calculated percentages by review authors). The combination of all interventions reduced the median cumulative infection count by 99.3%* from the baseline scenario (assuming R 0 1.5, at day 80) (Koo 2020). Pandey 2020 used an age‐structured SEIR model to simulate the outbreak situation for Nepal. They estimated the peak at 100 days without any interventions and the demand for ICU beds to exceed supply in Kathmandu by a factor of 25. A lockdown would delay the peak but not make any difference to the number of deaths or ICU beds needed. Control strategies that are focused on active case findings and isolating/quarantining (exposed and infectious) individuals for one year after one month of lockdown would reduce mortality by 27% and demand for health care by 50%. Physical distancing for one year after a one‐month lockdown that reduces contact rates by 35%, would reduce mortality by 33% and the need for ICU beds by 63%. The most efficient measure would be the combination of physical distancing and casefinding + isolation/quarantine after one month of lockdown, reducing the number of projected deaths by 99.6%, healthcare demand would drop similarly (Pandey 2020).

### Effects of quarantine on mental health of populations affected by COVID-19 [^113Td3sS]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To prevent the spread of the The novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), some classic public health measures are being taken, such as social distancing and quarantine METHOD: Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase.

Results

The prolonged confinement is evidently related to psychological damage, considering that individuals would be subjected to stressors for a longer period of time. In some cases, these psychic losses lasted for many months after the end of this confinement CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to develop and implement actions to minimize the population psychological distress in meeting the needs of the communities affected by COVID-19 Thus, as it occurred in China, it is necessary that the other affected nations promote the publication of regulations that guide the implementation of mental health services and the allocation of resources, in order to ensure that individuals are monitored by competent professionals, thus reducing the psychological damage that can be motivated by the social isolation period during the quarantine.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^116fdQLC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is an update of a recent rapid systematic evidence synthesis on the effectiveness of quarantine measures for COVID‐19. Within only two months, 22 additional studies on quarantine for COVID‐19 have been made publicly available (as journal papers or pre‐prints). Although the evidence base has doubled, it is still limited because most studies on COVID‐19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. None of the observational studies on COVID‐19 have a control group and the risk of bias for these studies is moderate to serious. The other 19 included studies are on SARS and MERS and contribute only indirect evidence.

Nevertheless, modelling studies on COVID‐19 consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed cases averted a high proportion of infections and deaths compared to no measures (low‐certainty evidence). Very low‐certainty of evidence indicated that the earlier that quarantine measures are implemented, the greater are the cost savings; however, this evidence is based on the SARS outbreak. Recent studies on quarantine of travellers showed that the proportion of travellers developing COVID‐19 while placed under quarantine was higher than in the SARS studies (Arima 2020; Hsieh 2005; Lytras 2020; Wang 2007). Considering that quarantine of travellers already showed a small positive effect during SARS, the higher prevalence of COVID‐19 among quarantined travellers from countries with a declared outbreak and high community transmission rates indicates that this strategy can be helpful in stopping the further spread of COVID‐19 in a country with low community transmission rates (very low‐certainty evidence). In general, the combination of quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as physical distancing, face masks and others had a greater effect on the reduction of transmissions, cases, and deaths than individual measures (low‐certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS are consistent with findings from the studies on COVID‐19.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^111nyfdC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic individuals — modeled outcomes and practical considerations: With a 10% prevalence of infection, 63 true positives (95% CI: 56–69) and 37 false negatives (95% CI: 31–44) were detected, and the number of false-positive results was estimated to be 0 with a true prevalence between 1% and 10%; routine confirmation of positive Ag test results does not appear to be necessary in most cases. Additional considerations include that there are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, the panel found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals reduces risk of transmission, postexposure monoclonal antibody prophylaxis may be an alternative to testing in high-risk asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 if and when EUA options exist, and education on interpretation of rapid Ag tests is important; the decision to pursue rapid Ag testing versus no testing should be individualized, and antigen testing may be useful in guiding mitigation efforts during an outbreak.

### Staffing with disease-based epidemiologic indices may reduce shortage of intensive care unit staff during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113yw5Q8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study uses publicly available epidemiologic data about COVID-19 and does not involve any clinical or patient derived data. No waiver from an institutional review board or research ethical committee was required.

Table 1.
Staffing Scenarios in Routine and Pandemic Times

To study the dynamics of staff dropouts over time for different scheduling strategies, we defined 2 theoretical scenarios (Table 1), of which one is typical routine staffing according to a theoretical labor law (scenario A) as applicable in this or similar form in most Western health care systems, and the other following the characteristics of a pandemic virus including both its incubation period and different quarantine times (scenario B). While the recommended quarantine time of 14 days would require extensive additional qualified workforce, which is likely not readily available in most hospitals, an abbreviated quarantine of 7 days covers the median incubation time of 3 days (range 0–24 days) and mean of 5 days, allowing for testing before starting into a new cycle of shifts.

Workforce

We assumed an exemplary workforce of 84 HCWs per scenario, all of whom are working on a full-time basis (40 h/wk). Assuming a 40-bed ICU and a patient-to-staff ratio of 2:1, we require 20 staff members to be present at all times (7 × 24 h). With this starting position, we define 2 potential scenarios of in-hospital infection, including a COVID-19 infection probability of 10%, 25%, or 40% per week, over a period of 120 days. The reported duration of COVID-19 infection ranges from 15 to 21 days. Based on reported mortality rates of a range of 1%–15% for infected individuals, we assume that 99% of affected HCWs will be able to return to work 14–21 days after diagnosis, whereas 3%–10% will not return.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^113bmijq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Antigen testing versus no testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals — IDSA recommendation and key remarks: For asymptomatic individuals with known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) panel suggests using a single (ie, one-time) antigen (Ag) test over no testing in specific situations (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Testing in the absence of COVID-19–like symptoms should be individualized, and one-time Ag testing may be considered if the test result will impact an individual's subsequent actions. A negative Ag test result reduces the likelihood of infection, but the longer the time since testing, the more this likelihood reduction wanes; in contrast, a positive test result is associated with a high positive-predictive value. The panel recognizes the lack of evidence supporting therapy in asymptomatic persons and the absence of treatments approved through EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19 but acknowledges that individual clinical scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment.

### Respiratory virus guidance update frequently asked questions… [^116Xo92F]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- New evidence has led to updated Respiratory Virus Guidance focused on COVID-19, flu, and RSV.
- CDC changed the "isolation" period for COVID-19; the updated recommendations end the "stay home" period based on symptoms and not testing.
- Schools should align their respiratory illness policies with the updated Respiratory Virus Guidance.
- The updated guidance continues to focus on those who are at higher risk for severe illness.
- Fewer complications
- Complications like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children are now also less common, and prevalence of Long COVID is also going down.
3. Why has CDC changed the "isolation" period for COVID-19. Prior Guidance: The previous COVID-19 guidance recommended a minimum isolation period of 5 days plus a period of post-isolation precautions.

It was created during the public health emergency, at a time when we had lower population immunity, fewer tools to combat respiratory viruses, and higher rates of severe illness, including hospitalizations and deaths. Updated Guidance: The updated Respiratory Virus Guidance recommends that people stay home and away from others until at least 24 hours after both their symptoms are getting better overall, and they have not had a fever. Note that depending on the length of symptoms, this period could be shorter, the same, or longer than the previous guidance for COVID-19. It is important to note that the guidance doesn't end with staying home and away from others when sick. The guidance encourages added precaution over the next five days after time at home, away from others, is over. Since some people remain contagious beyond the "stay-at-home" period, a period of added precaution using prevention strategies, such as:
4.

Why are the updated recommendations about ending the "stay home" period based on symptoms and not testing. The updated Respiratory Virus Guidance recommends that people stay home and away from others until at least 24 hours after both their symptoms are getting better overall, and they have not had a fever.
- The total number of days of precautions when sick, that is, a period of staying home and away from others plus 5 days of additional actions, covers the period during which most people are still infectious.
- Most people do not know what virus is causing their infection, and at-home tests are only widely available for COVID-19.

### Infection control guidance: SARS-CoV-2 | COVID-19… [^11663VNG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- Patients should be managed as described in Section 2.
- Visitors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or compatible symptoms should defer non-urgent in-person visitation until they have met the healthcare criteria to end isolation; this time period is longer than what is recommended in the community. For visitors who have had close contact with someone with SARS-CoV-2 infection or were in another situation that put them at higher risk for transmission, it is safest to defer non-urgent in-person visitation until 10 days after their close contact if they meet any of the criteria described in Section 2.
- Visitors should be instructed to only visit the patient room. They should minimize their time spent in other locations in the facility. Duration of Transmission-Based Precautions for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection.

In general, patients who are hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be maintained in Transmission-Based Precautions for the time period described for patients with severe to critical illness. In general, patients should continue to wear source control until symptoms resolve or, for those who never developed symptoms, until they meet the criteria to end isolation below. Then they should revert to usual facility source control policies for patients. Patients with mild to moderate illness who are not moderately to severely immunocompromised:

- At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and
- At least 24 hours have passed since last feverwithout the use of fever-reducing medications and.
- Symptoms have improved Patients who were asymptomatic throughout their infection and are not moderately to severely immunocompromised:

- At least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral test. Patients with severe to critical illness and who are not. moderately to severely immunocompromised:

- At least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and
- At least 24 hours have passed since last feverwithout the use of fever-reducing medications and
- Symptoms have improved
- The test-based strategy as described for moderately to severely immunocompromised patients below can be used to inform the duration of isolation.

### CDC updates and shortens recommended isolation and… [^111VGRAJ]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

CDC Updates and Shortens Recommended Isolation and Quarantine Period for General Population Media Statement For Immediate Release: Monday, December 27, 2021 Contact: Media Relations 639–3286. Given what we currently know about COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, CDC is shortening the recommended time for isolation for the public. People with COVID-19 should isolate for 5 days and if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving, follow that by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others to minimize the risk of infecting people they encounter. The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1–2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2–3 days after. Additionally, CDC is updating the recommended quarantine period for anyone in the general public who is exposed to COVID-19.

For people who are unvaccinated or are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose and not yet boosted, CDC now recommends quarantine for 5 days followed by strict mask use for an additional 5 days. Isolation relates to behavior after a confirmed infection. Isolation for 5 days followed by wearing a well-fitting mask will minimize the risk of spreading the virus to others. Quarantine refers to the time following exposure to the virus or close contact with someone known to have COVID-19. Both updates come as the Omicron variant continues to spread throughout the U. S. and reflects the current science on when and for how long a person is maximally infectious. These recommendations do not supersede state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, nor do they apply to healthcare workers for whom CDC has updated guidance. If you develop symptoms get a test and stay home.

If you: Completed the primary series of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine over 6 months ago and are not boosted OR Completed the primary series of J&J over 2 months ago and are not boosted OR Are unvaccinated
- Stay home for 5 days. After that continue to wear a mask around others for 5 additional days.
- If you can't quarantine you must wear a mask for 10 days.
- Test on day 5 if possible. If you develop symptoms get a test and stay home.
