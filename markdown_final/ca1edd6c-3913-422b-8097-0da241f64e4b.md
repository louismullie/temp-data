## Question

Which calculator is used to calculate risk of CAD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which calculator should be used to estimate the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about terminology and whether calculators estimate CAD specifically or broader ASCVD/CVD outcomes. Then, I should review guideline-endorsed tools by region (US, Europe, UK) and by setting (primary prevention versus perioperative). Next, I will verify age ranges, inclusion criteria, and special populations where standard tools fail. After that, I need to consider calibration and recalibration issues across populations. Finally, I will synthesize pragmatic recommendations and flag common pitfalls, making sure to double-check any updates in recent guidelines, especially the 2025 AHA/ACC risk statements [^111MREMC].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us. Most widely used tools estimate composite cardiovascular risk (ASCVD/CVD) that includes coronary events rather than isolated "CAD-only" risk, meaning they inherently capture CHD/MIs as a dominant component of the outcome set, with examples including the US Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE, "ASCVD Risk") and Europe's SCORE2, each designed for primary prevention decision-making in their regions [^113v5WT4] [^116Mric3] [^113UuVKy].

> Next, I should review the principal calculators commonly referenced. In routine primary prevention, the US relies on the ASCVD Risk Score (PCE), Europe uses SCORE2, many historical or research settings still cite Framingham equations, and perioperative assessments lean on Gupta MICA for MI/cardiac arrest risk; I need to ensure I'm mapping each tool to its intended population, endpoints, and age ranges before making recommendations [^113v5WT4] [^116Mric3] [^113ifULP] [^1153zk7a].

> Hold on, let me verify the US guidance carefully because this is easy to overgeneralize. Initially, I thought both the 2017 and 2025 AHA/ACC blood pressure guidance endorsed the Pooled Cohort Equations for 10-year risk, but wait, I need to check the 2025 update: the 2017 guideline used PCE for risk-based BP therapy, whereas the 2025 AHA/ACC statement updates the recommended risk model to PREVENT for decisions around antihypertensive therapy, even as PCE remains widely used in US primary prevention workflows more broadly, so I should not conflate these contexts [^1144eGrW] [^113v5WT4].

> For European practice, I should confirm the switch to SCORE2. The ESC now recommends SCORE2 to estimate 10-year fatal and nonfatal CVD risk in people aged 40–69 without existing CVD or diabetes, replacing the older SCORE system; this is the appropriate default for primary prevention risk estimation in Europe, acknowledging distinct regional calibration strata and competing-risk methodology in the derivation [^116Mric3] [^113UuVKy].

> Let me consider the UK context next, since clinicians often ask about QRISK. NICE moved away from exclusive reliance on Framingham, and QRISK2/QRISK3 have been extensively validated in UK populations; external evaluations note better tailoring for UK epidemiology, with NICE previously withdrawing a singular Framingham endorsement and leaving score selection to clinical judgment in context, which I should remember when advising on UK-based assessments [^114A6ALK].

> I will now examine special settings where the "usual" primary prevention calculators are the wrong tool. In the perioperative arena for noncardiac surgery, Gupta MICA specifically estimates MI or cardiac arrest risk and generally outperforms generic primary prevention tools for surgical decision-making; I need to be clear that this predicts perioperative MI risk rather than long-term ASCVD risk, so substituting ASCVD or SCORE2 here would be inappropriate [^1153zk7a] [^114eTSxS].

> But wait, what about high-risk genetic or inflammatory conditions where standard tools can misclassify risk. For familial hypercholesterolemia, expert guidance explicitly advises not using standard population calculators such as Framingham, PCE, or SCORE because they underestimate risk, prompting management based on condition-specific principles rather than global-risk thresholds; similarly, RA-specific scores have not consistently outperformed general calculators, and even EULAR multipliers may not fully resolve underestimation in high-inflammatory states, so I should caution against over-reliance on generic 10-year scores in these cohorts [^113dGowF] [^114D8zj5] [^113d8njx].

> Let me review the historical standards to ensure completeness. Framingham-based scores remain foundational and are still used for general CVD or CHD risk estimation in some settings, but they have been superseded by region-optimized tools in many guidelines; they provide reasonable discrimination yet can miscalibrate without recalibration to contemporary populations, reinforcing that historical familiarity should not trump current regional guidance and calibration evidence [^113ifULP] [^114oSDQM] [^112VzvuL].

> I should double-check calibration and agreement issues across calculators before final recommendations. Head-to-head comparisons show substantial variation in absolute risk estimates and risk categorization across calculators for the same patient profiles, with improved convergence after systematic recalibration to local incidence and endpoints; hence, choosing a regionally derived or recalibrated tool is as important as choosing the "brand" of the calculator, and local recalibration materially improves guideline-concordant treatment yields and NNTs [^11265koY] [^112VzvuL] [^111wgh3v] [^113DtBeN] [^111MREMC].

> Next, I should review risk-refinement strategies because clinicians often ask how to handle intermediate risk. Incorporation of coronary artery calcium within contemporary models can meaningfully reclassify risk, with CAC generally exerting larger shifts than CIMT or hsCRP across tested scenarios, and MESA-CHD based tools and "coronary age" transformations show strong discrimination that can aid shared decision-making when base-model risk is borderline; this should be used judiciously and in alignment with guideline pathways [^113tcfdW] [^116K7uTX] [^11685oL2].

> Let me synthesize a practical, context-specific answer, but I will pause to ensure the details align with the earlier checks. For standard primary prevention in the US, the ASCVD Risk Score (PCE) remains the widely used, guideline-aligned estimator of 10-year ASCVD risk in adults 40–79 for lipid and general ASCVD decisions, whereas the 2025 AHA/ACC blood pressure guidance specifically recommends PREVENT for risk-based antihypertensive therapy decisions, so clinicians should be precise about which decision pathway they are informing when they pick the model [^113v5WT4] [^1144eGrW].

> For European primary prevention, use SCORE2 in adults 40–69 without existing CVD or diabetes, attending to the appropriate regional risk strata; for UK practice, QRISK2/QRISK3 are commonly used and better tailored to the UK epidemiology per external validations and NICE's departure from a single Framingham-based approach; for perioperative decision-making in noncardiac surgery, use Gupta MICA for MI/cardiac arrest risk rather than primary prevention calculators; and in FH (and some inflammatory conditions), avoid standard population calculators and default to condition-specific management principles or validated specialty pathways to avoid underestimation [^116Mric3] [^113UuVKy] [^114A6ALK] [^1153zk7a] [^113dGowF].

> Finally, I should emphasize one last check on scope and calibration. There is no single universal "CAD-only" calculator for general use; most tools estimate composite CVD/ASCVD risk with coronary events embedded, and selection must consider age range, derivation population, endpoints, and local calibration or recalibration to avoid systematic over- or underestimation, especially when translating across regions or time periods [^111MREMC] [^113DtBeN].

The primary calculators for estimating CAD risk are the **Framingham Risk Score (FRS)** for 10-year CHD risk in the US [^113ifULP], the **Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE)** for 10-year ASCVD risk in US adults [^113v5WT4], and **SCORE2** for 10-year fatal and nonfatal CVD risk in Europe. QRISK3 is used in the UK [^114A6ALK] [^116XNS68], and the **MESA** calculator incorporates coronary artery calcium to refine risk estimates [^116K7uTX] [^115AvqnK]. Selection depends on **region, population, and clinical context** [^111MREMC].

---

## Framingham risk score (FRS)

The Framingham Risk Score estimates **10-year CHD risk** (MI or CHD death) in adults aged 30–79 years [^113ifULP]. Inputs include age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic BP, antihypertensive treatment, smoking, and diabetes [^113ifULP] [^114efwWb]. It is widely used in the US for primary prevention and to guide therapy [^113ifULP] [^114FGNZj].

---

## Pooled cohort equations (PCE)

- **Purpose**: Estimates 10-year ASCVD risk (MI, CHD death, stroke) in US adults 40–79 years [^113v5WT4].
- **Inputs**: Age, sex, race, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic BP, antihypertensive treatment, smoking, diabetes [^113v5WT4] [^111Qvkmw].
- **Use**: Recommended by ACC/AHA for primary prevention and statin decisions [^113v5WT4] [^114DYnhx].

---

## SCORE2 (systematic coronary risk evaluation 2)

- **Purpose**: Estimates 10-year fatal and nonfatal CVD risk in European adults 40–69 years without prior CVD or diabetes.
- **Inputs**: Age, sex, smoking, systolic BP, total cholesterol [^116Mric3].
- **Use**: Recommended by ESC for primary prevention in Europe [^113UuVKy].

---

## QRISK3

- **Purpose**: Estimates 10-year CVD risk in UK adults 25–84 years [^114A6ALK].
- **Inputs**: Age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking, diabetes, BP, cholesterol, BMI, family history, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, and other factors [^116XNS68].
- **Use**: Recommended by NICE for primary prevention in the UK.

---

## MESA (multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis) risk calculator

The MESA risk calculator estimates 10-year CHD risk and incorporates **coronary artery calcium (CAC)** to refine risk assessment [^116K7uTX]. Inputs include age, sex, race/ethnicity, cholesterol, BP, smoking, diabetes, and the CAC score [^116K7uTX]. It is particularly useful for intermediate-risk patients in whom CAC can reclassify risk [^115AvqnK] [^113tcfdW].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Performance is best in populations similar to the derivation cohorts, and recalibration may be needed in other settings [^111MREMC] [^112VzvuL]. Some tools overestimate or underestimate risk in certain groups [^113DtBeN] [^112VzvuL]. Use calculators alongside **clinical judgment and patient preferences** [^115XmtJV].

---

The main calculators for CAD risk are **FRS, PCE, SCORE2, QRISK3, and MESA**; **selection should be guided by region, population, and clinical context** [^111MREMC].

### 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines [^113v5WT4]. Circulation (2014). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk (ASCVD) risk score" is instrumental for evaluating risks related to dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and tobacco use. The ASCVD calculator is specifically designed to estimate the 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke in adults aged 40–79, based on critical factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes status, and smoking habits, in alignment with ACC/AHA guidelines. This facilitates informed decision-making regarding preventive measures, including statin use.

The calculator considers a broad spectrum of personal health inputs, including:

- **Age in years**: Critical baseline measurement.
- **Gender**: Classified as Male or Female, to account for gender-specific risk factors.
- **Race**: Identified as either African American or Other, acknowledging racial demographic differences in cardiovascular risk.
- **Total cholesterol**: Measured in mg/dL or mmol/L.
- **HDL cholesterol**: Measured in mg/dL or mmol/L.
- **Systolic blood pressure**: Assessed in mmHg or kPa.
- **Smoking status**: Indicated as Yes or No.
- **Diabetes status**: Indicated as Yes or No.
- **Blood pressure treatment status**: Indicated as Yes or No.

Here's an outline of the ASCVD calculation process:

1. **Unit conversion**:
	- If cholesterol levels are provided in mmol/L, they are multiplied by 38.67 to convert to mg/dL.
	- If systolic blood pressure is documented in kPa, it is converted to mmHg by multiplying by 7.50062.

2. **Selection of coefficients**:
	- Coefficients are specifically chosen based on individual demographic and clinical data inputs, facilitating accurate risk assessment.

This method ensures a robust assessment process that aligns with established standards for cardiovascular risk management.

### Prediction of coronary heart disease using risk factor categories [^113ifULP]. Circulation (1998). High credibility.

The clinical calculator, the "Framingham Risk Score", assesses cardiovascular risk, particularly focusing on tobacco use, dyslipidemia, hypertension, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease. This score calculates the 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk based on demographic and clinical factors, including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status, and antihypertensive treatment.

To estimate an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease over a 10-year period using the Framingham Risk Score, gather specific health information:

- **Age**: Between 30 and 79 years
- **Gender**: Either Male or Female
- **Smoking status**: Yes or No
- **Total cholesterol level**: Can be measured in mg/dL (100 to 400) or mmol/L (2.59 to 10.34)
- **HDL cholesterol level**: Can be measured in mg/dL (20 to 100) or mmol/L (0.52 to 2.59)
- **Systolic blood pressure**: Measured in mmHg (90 to 200)
- **On hypertension treatment**: Yes or No

The computation of the Framingham Risk Score involves the following steps:

- Convert the values of age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure to their natural logarithms (ln).
- Calculate a linear predictor, L, using gender-specific equations that apply coefficients to these logarithmic values. For males, the equation is:

	* L = (Coef for lnAge × ln(Age)) + (Coef for lnTotalCholesterol × ln(Total Cholesterol)) + (Coef for lnHDL × ln(HDL Cholesterol)) + (Coef for lnSystolicBP × ln(Systolic Blood Pressure))

	* Add the treatedBP Coefficient if on hypertension treatment.
	* Include smoking status in the calculations appropriately.

### Score2: A new updated algorithm to predict cardiovascular disease risk in Europe [^113UuVKy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). High credibility.

The recently published guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, presented in August 2021 at the virtual European Society of Cardiology congress, recommend the use of the SCORE2 risk index instead of the classic SCORE risk index to calculate cardiovascular risk (specifically, ten-year fatal and nonfatal risk) in a healthy population under the age of 70 years, with a level of evidence IB. This new risk index was developed with the collaboration of about 200 investigators, including 45 cohorts in 13 countries with 700,000 participants, and covers the known risk factors for heart and circulatory diseases such as age, sex, lipid levels, blood pressure, and smoking. Additionally, it divides the countries into four groups of risk and uses a competing risk model, adjusting the risk for the probability of having another event. This model enables a better estimation of the risk of fatal and nonfatal events in a younger population (40–69 years).

### Use of risk assessment to guide decision-making for blood pressure management in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology [^1144eGrW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment plays a central role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline incorporated quantitative risk assessment for the first time to guide the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy and recommended calculation of the 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with the Pooled Cohort Equations. Although the 2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline reaffirmed this overarching paradigm for risk-based initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, it updated the recommended risk model to the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events equations, which estimate 10-year risk of total cardiovascular disease (including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure), and defined a new risk threshold for initiation of antihypertensive therapy in patients with stage 1 hypertension.

This American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology scientific statement summarizes the rationale to recommend the use of the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events equations, the evidence base for the new threshold of 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of ≥ 7.5%, and the population-level implications of these revised recommendations. This scientific statement also offers practical advice for implementing risk assessment as the first step in the comprehensive approach to hypertension management with shared decision-making between patients and clinicians.

Remaining gaps in awareness and treatment of hypertension underscore the need for innovative strategies to improve implementation of an integrated approach to cardiovascular risk management.

### Differences in absolute risk of cardiovascular events using risk-refinement tests: A systematic analysis of four cardiovascular risk equations [^113tcfdW]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular risk assessment guidelines incorporate the judicious use of C-reactive protein (CRP), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in selected populations. They describe threshold levels for higher and lower cardiovascular risk for each of the three risk refinement tests. However, the effect of these suggested thresholds of relative risk on absolute global risk remains uncertain.

- **Methods**: Systematic permutation of risk factors provided 10-year risk estimates using the Framingham risk score, equations derived from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, and the Reynolds risk score. Low-, high-, and very-high-risk values of CAC, CIMT, and hsCRP were defined as: 0, 100, 400 Agatston units; 25th percentile without plaque, 75th percentile without plaque, 75th percentile with plaque; and 1.0, 3.0, 7.0 mg/L.

- **Results**: Incorporation of low-, high-, and very-high-risk CAC values using the MESA risk score resulted in greater changes in absolute risk from the Framingham risk score than the addition of either CIMT or hsCRP values using the ARIC or Reynolds risk scores.

- **Conclusions**: Although certain values of CAC, CIMT, and hsCRP have been similarly designated as low, high, or very-high risk, incorporation of these thresholds into validated risk equations yielded substantially different levels of absolute cardiovascular risk. Use of available risk equations may be advisable to calculate absolute risk rather than relying on risk-marker thresholds derived from relative risk assessments.

### New cardiovascular risk assessment techniques for primary prevention: JACC review topic of the week [^115AvqnK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Risk factor-based models fail to accurately estimate risk in select populations, particularly younger individuals. A sizable number of people are also classified as being at intermediate risk, for whom the optimal preventive strategy could be more precise. Several personalized risk prediction tools, including coronary artery calcium scoring, polygenic risk scores, and metabolic risk scores, may improve risk assessment, pending supportive outcome data from clinical trials. Other tools may emerge in the near future. A multidimensional approach to risk prediction holds the promise of precise risk prediction. This could allow for targeted prevention, minimizing unnecessary costs and risks while maximizing benefits. High-risk individuals could also be identified early in life, creating opportunities to arrest the development of nascent coronary atherosclerosis and prevent future clinical events.

### General cardiovascular risk profile for use in primary care: The Framingham Heart Study [^114oSDQM]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Separate multivariable risk algorithms are commonly used to assess the risk of specific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, i.e. coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure. This report presents a single multivariable risk function that predicts the risk of developing all CVD and its constituents.

- **Methods and results**: We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the risk of developing a first CVD event in 8,491 Framingham study participants (mean age 49 years; 4,522 women) who attended a routine examination between 30 and 74 years of age and were free of CVD. Sex-specific multivariable risk functions ("general CVD" algorithms) were derived that incorporated age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, smoking, and diabetes status. We assessed the performance of the general CVD algorithms for predicting individual CVD events (coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or heart failure). Over 12 years of follow-up, 1,174 participants (456 women) developed a first CVD event. All traditional risk factors evaluated predicted CVD risk (multivariable-adjusted P < 0.0001). The general CVD algorithm demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.763 [men] and 0.793 [women]) and calibration. Simple adjustments to the general CVD risk algorithms allowed estimation of the risks of each CVD component. Two simple risk scores are presented, one based on all traditional risk factors and the other based on non-laboratory-based factors.

### Risk estimation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Considerations for appropriate risk prediction model selection [^115zxET1]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases remain the number one cause of death globally. Cardiovascular disease risk scores are an integral tool in primary prevention, being used to identify individuals at the highest risk and guide the assignment of preventive interventions. Available risk scores differ substantially in terms of the population sample data sources used for their derivation and, consequently, in the absolute risks they assign to individuals.

Differences in cardiovascular disease epidemiology between the populations contributing to the development of risk scores and the target populations in which they are applied can result in overestimation or underestimation of cardiovascular disease risks for individuals and poorly informed clinical decisions. Given the wide plethora of cardiovascular disease risk scores available, identification of an appropriate risk score for a target population can be challenging.

This review provides an up-to-date overview of guideline-recommended cardiovascular disease risk scores from global, regional, and national contexts, evaluates their comparative characteristics and qualities, and provides guidance on the selection of an appropriate risk score.

### Coronary risk assessment by point-based vs. equation-based Framingham models: Significant implications for clinical care [^113jmErF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The next generation of cholesterol guidelines (ATP IV) is expected to be released in the near future, and it is likely that these new guidelines will predict risk using a new model of global cardiovascular risk prediction that incorporates a broader range of cardiovascular outcomes. Nonetheless, score-sheet versions of this model have already been developed and, if applied to guidelines, may result in problems similar to those that we observed. Thus, when simplifying future models of cardiovascular or other forms of risk, it will be essential to account for the practical effects of simplification on algorithm-based management decisions and to disseminate these analyses in peer-reviewed publications to maximize transparency.

There are several limitations to our study. Our estimates of how many subjects would be recommended for changes in lipid-lowering therapy based on misclassification are approximate due to limited sample sizes, absence of data on potential lifestyle interventions, and potential inaccuracies in self-reported use of lipid-lowering medications. In addition, we did not evaluate users of lipid-lowering drugs, so we do not know what the impact of using different Framingham models would have been prior to their initiating drug treatment. Finally, our study did not have access to actual cardiovascular outcomes, so we are unable to determine the accuracy of these models for predicting cardiovascular events. Nonetheless, the original Framingham model is the de facto gold standard for ATP III-based risk prediction, and mathematically, it is very unlikely that a point-based approach will be able to duplicate its precision.

### Rheumatoid arthritis-specific cardiovascular risk scores are not superior to general risk scores: A validation analysis of patients from seven countries [^114D8zj5]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk calculators developed for the general population do not accurately predict CVD events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study sought to externally validate risk calculators recommended for use in patients with RA, including the EULAR 1.5 multiplier, the Expanded Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Score for RA (ERS-RA), and QRISK2.

Seven RA cohorts from the UK, Norway, Netherlands, USA, South Africa, Canada, and Mexico were combined. Data on baseline CVD risk factors, RA characteristics, and CVD outcomes (including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death) were collected using standardized definitions. The performance of QRISK2, EULAR multiplier, and ERS-RA was compared with other risk calculators, including the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Framingham Adult Treatment Panel III Framingham risk score-Adult Treatment Panel (FRS-ATP), and Reynolds Risk Score, using c-statistics and the net reclassification index.

Among 1,796 RA patients without prior CVD with a mean age of 54.0 years (standard deviation 14.0 years) and 74% female, 100 developed CVD events during a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (12,430 person-years). The estimated CVD risk by ERS-RA, with a mean of 8.8% (standard deviation 9.8%), was comparable to FRS-ATP with a mean of 9.1% (standard deviation 8.3%) and Reynolds Risk Score with a mean of 9.2% (standard deviation 12.2%), but lower than ACC/AHA with a mean of 9.8% (standard deviation 12.1%). QRISK2 substantially overestimated risk with a mean of 15.5% (standard deviation 13.9%). Discrimination was not improved for ERS-RA (c-statistic = 0.69), QRISK2, or the EULAR multiplier applied to ACC/AHA when compared with ACC/AHA alone.

### Framingham-based tools to calculate the global risk of coronary heart disease: A systematic review of tools for clinicians [^114efwWb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

To examine the features of available Framingham-based risk calculation tools and review their accuracy and feasibility in clinical practice, we conducted a systematic review.

- **Data sources**: The data was sourced from Medline (1966-April 2003) and the Google search engine.

- **Tool and study selection**: We included risk calculation tools that used the Framingham risk equations to generate a global coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. To determine tool accuracy, we reviewed all articles comparing the performance of various Framingham-based risk tools to that of the continuous Framingham risk equations. We also reviewed articles on the availability of the risk factor information required for risk calculation, subjective preference for one risk calculator over another, or subjective ease of use to determine the feasibility of tool use in clinical practice.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently reviewed the results of the literature search, examined all websites, and abstracted all articles for relevant information.

- **Data synthesis**: Multiple CHD risk calculation tools are available, including risk charts and computerized calculators for personal digital assistants, personal computers, and web-based use. Most are easy to use and available without cost. They require information on age, smoking status, blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, and the presence or absence of diabetes. Compared to the full Framingham equations, accuracy for identifying patients at increased risk was generally quite high. However, data on the feasibility of tool use was limited.

In conclusion, several easy-to-use tools are available for estimating patient risk, though data on practical application is sparse.

### Systematic examination of the updated Framingham heart study general cardiovascular risk profile [^113Xmamp]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

An updated Framingham risk prediction tool was recently published. It features an expanded endpoint of general cardiovascular disease and a "vascular age" risk communication analogy.

- **Methods and results**: We systematically examined the tool to determine which risk factor combinations allow risk thresholds to be reached and how different risk factor burdens translate into vascular age. We varied risk factor levels in isolation and combination and observed risk output patterns, with high risk defined as ≥ 20% 10-year predicted risk. As expected, we found that age is the major determinant of 10-year predicted risk for both men and women. Younger individuals tend not to exceed 20% 10-year risk even with multiple risk factors, although with marked risk factor burden, including both smoking and diabetes mellitus, men as young as 35 years of age and women as young as 40 years of age can be classified as high risk. For the risk factor levels we entered, predicted risk ranges from 3.1% to 46.8% for a 45-year-old man and 2.4% to 42.7% for a 55-year-old woman. Likewise, vascular age ranges from 37 to > 80 years for a 45-year-old man and 39 to > 80 years for a 55-year-old woman.

- **Conclusions**: The inclusion of noncoronary endpoints in this tool expands the range of predicted risks for men and women at all ages studied. Nevertheless, many younger individuals with high risk factor burden have low 10-year predicted risk. Wide ranges of "vascular age" are available for most chronological ages to assist with risk communication.

### Development and validation of a risk calculator for prediction of cardiac risk after surgery [^1153zk7a]. Circulation (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest" is utilized for assessing cardiac arrest, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery.

The Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA) estimates the likelihood of cardiac complications in patients undergoing surgery. It calculates risk as a percentage based on variables including age, functional status, ASA class, serum creatinine levels, and the type of procedure. Each factor is assigned a specific value, contributing to a logistic regression equation that provides a percentage risk score. The model is widely used to stratify risk and guide perioperative management.

The Gupta Perioperative Risk calculator is designed to estimate the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest around the time of surgery. It considers five key patient-specific inputs and computes a percentage risk that helps clinicians assess the likelihood of these cardiac events during or after surgery.

To conduct this assessment, the calculator requires the following inputs:

- **Age**: The calculator uses the patient's age, calculated as age multiplied by a coefficient, contributing incrementally to the risk.

- **Functional status**: Here you can select from three levels, each impacting risk differently:
	- **Independent**: No additional risk
	- **Partially dependent**: +0.65 to risk
	- **Totally dependent**: +1.03 to risk

### Cardiovascular risk scores do not account for the effect of treatment: A review [^114Ms1Qu]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Guidelines advocate the use of cardiovascular risk scores to calculate global risk instead of focusing on single risk modification. Healthcare providers in the UK are expected to select a cardiovascular risk score appropriate for their requirements from the many existing risk assessment tools with the recent change in the NICE guidelines.

- **What this study adds**: The existing risk scores vary widely in terms of study characteristics, predictors, and outcomes. These cohort studies have not taken into account the effect of treatment on the study population and will therefore underestimate cardiovascular risk.

### Cardiovascular risk scores do not account for the effect of treatment: a review [^116VeDEi]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

For many years, the Framingham cardiovascular risk equation has been the preferred method of cardiovascular risk assessment. However, in February 2010, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) announced that the Framingham equation should be considered as just one of several acceptable methods. The same guideline included a systematic review, which found 110 different cardiovascular risk-scoring methods. Clinicians are now able and expected to select, from these 110 cardiovascular risk scores, one that is appropriate for their patients. How should they decide which one is appropriate?

Despite guidelines advocating the use of cardiovascular risk scores to calculate global risk instead of focusing on single risk modification, adoption of cardiovascular risk scores has been slow. One survey in three countries showed that only 48% of physicians regularly use cardiovascular risk scores. In another survey in six European countries, 85% of respondents recognized the importance of global risk assessment; yet, the majority (62%) used a subjective assessment of cardiovascular risk, rather than specific risk calculators in practice. Subjective risk assessment often disagrees with assessment by cardiovascular risk scores. Doctors who use cardiovascular risk scores can rate individual risk factors more accurately and are more likely to correctly prescribe treatment in given scenarios than non-users.

Why don't doctors use cardiovascular risk scores in practice? Many physicians do not trust the validity of the risk scores and believe their own estimation to be more accurate.

### Derivation, validation, and evaluation of a new QRISK model to estimate lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease: Cohort study using QResearch database [^112h31nV]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death and a major cause of disability in the UK. National policies now support targeting interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease among high-risk patients. Validated risk prediction algorithms, such as QRISK2, are used in such programs to identify patients for intervention when they are at high risk — defined by a 10-year cardiovascular disease threshold of ≥ 20%.

Applying this 20% risk threshold for intervention may not identify younger patients who, because of their age, have a low absolute 10-year risk but a high relative risk compared with their peers. This is because age has such a dominant effect in calculating absolute cardiovascular risk. Some argue that younger patients with an adverse risk profile may have more to gain during their lifetime if interventions are started at a younger age rather than waiting until they cross the 20% threshold. Lifetime risks, which measure the cumulative risk of developing a disease during the remainder of an individual's life, would reflect this relatively high risk. Given that lifetime risk estimates provide assessment over the full life course, they may offer a more appropriate assessment of future risks than estimates limited to 10 years, particularly at younger ages.

There are currently no published algorithms that estimate the lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease derived from contemporaneous UK data, and none that incorporates social deprivation or ethnicity. We therefore developed, validated, and evaluated a new QRISK model to estimate…

### Cardiovascular risk assessment — from individual risk prediction to estimation of global risk and change in risk in the population [^112A38vm]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Sometimes, therapeutic interventions may have unintended consequences on other diseases, such as the increased mortality rates observed in diabetes with intensive insulin regimens. The intent of such interventions is to improve cardiovascular risk factors, which may not translate into a reduction in clinical events. In addition, other interventions, such as sodium restriction, have larger effects on cardiovascular disease than their impact on blood pressure alone. Modest effects yield greater than expected changes, which extend beyond such clinical markers. This may limit the use of such prediction rules in forecasting trends in cardiovascular events using information related to changes in cardiovascular risk factors. Future scores should acknowledge and address these limitations.

Further research is needed to apply these risk prediction tools, intended for individualized patients, to translate into larger population-based health interventions. As the degree of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality changes, the necessity of recalibrating existing risk equations becomes evident. For instance, the Framingham equation was based on a population of patients decades ago whose characteristics differ significantly from those of patients today. With the development of new biomarkers and enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, future formulae will likely incorporate measures representing different mechanistic pathways beyond the approach that addresses traditional risk factors only. Hence, clinicians and public health officials need to be prepared for these advancements.

### Performance of the expanded cardiovascular risk prediction score for rheumatoid arthritis is not superior to the ACC/AHA risk calculator [^113d8njx]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) risk estimation calculators for the general population do not perform well in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An RA-specific risk calculator has been developed, but it did not perform better than a risk calculator for the general population when validated in a heterogeneous multinational cohort.

- **Methods**: In a cohort of 665 patients with new-onset RA from northern Sweden, the risk of CV disease was estimated by the Expanded Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Score for Rheumatoid Arthritis (ERS-RA) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association algorithm (ACC/AHA). The ACC/AHA estimation was analyzed both as crude data and when adjusted according to the European League Against Rheumatism recommendations (ACC/AHA × 1.5). ERS-RA was calculated using two variants: one from patient and physician reports of hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia [ERS-RA (reported)] and one from assessments of blood pressure (BP) and blood lipids [ERS-RA (measured)]. These estimations were compared with observed CV events.

- **Results**: All variants of risk calculators underestimated the CV risk. Discrimination was good for all risk calculators studied. Performance of all risk calculators was poorer in patients with a high grade of inflammation, whereas ACC/AHA × 1.5 performed best in the high-inflammatory patients. In patients with an estimated risk of 5–15%, no risk calculator performed well.

- **Conclusion**: ERS-RA underestimated the risk of a CV event in our cohort of patients, especially when risk estimations were based on patient or physician reports.

### Polygenic risk score adds to a clinical risk score in the prediction of cardiovascular disease in a clinical setting [^116EDE3M]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Screening for CVD risk with clinical risk scores is now well-established in many health systems and plays an important role in reducing the burden of CVD. However, it is recognized that such scores are by no means perfect at identifying those at increased risk. Although adding PRSs for CAD or CVD has been shown to improve traditional metrics for risk prediction, such as model discrimination, calibration, and net reclassification, most studies have reported modest overall improvements in these metrics, raising questions about their clinical utility.

Here, we have taken a different approach to assessing the value of adding a CVD-PRS. First, following previous work, we have combined the CVD-PRS with a clinical risk score to create an IRT. The IRT has the advantage that it returns an updated risk on the same scale, and thus the same actionable risk threshold, as the clinical risk score. This obviates the need to define a separate high-risk threshold for the CVD-PRS outside of guidelines, therefore making it simpler for clinicians to interpret and apply findings in clinical practice.

Then, in a real-world setting of a middle-aged, multi-ethnic population specifically undergoing CVD risk assessment, we have evaluated, for the first time, the clinically relevant question of whether placing an IRT alongside a clinical risk score would have identified more people who went on to have a CVD event as being at high risk at the time of their risk assessment. This would make them more visible for preventative measures compared to a clinical risk score alone.

### Risk factors: New risk-assessment guidelines — more or less personalized [^114DYnhx]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The new ACC/AHA cardiovascular-risk guidelines feature updated equations for women and distinct equations for African American individuals, including stroke prediction. However, the equations rely on the same traditional risk factors as previous versions, are driven predominantly by age, and curtail the intermediate-risk group in which personalized risk assessment is recommended.

### Derivation of a coronary age calculator using traditional risk factors and coronary artery calcium: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^11685oL2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The methodological approaches used to develop these tools have differed across studies. D'Agostino et al. translated the Framingham Risk Score into an equivalent "heart age", whereas McClelland and colleagues used only CAC data from MESA to derive a simple "arterial age". In contrast, we used the full MESA CHD Risk Score to estimate each participant's "coronary age". This approach takes advantage of the already-validated MESA CHD Risk Score developed using more contemporary data compared with algorithms such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations.

The MESA CHD Risk Score is more comprehensive and, unlike most clinical scores, which are based on only the traditional Framingham cardiovascular risk factors, this score also includes family history of CHD, race/ethnicity categories, and CAC. Our strategy also allowed us to take advantage of the improved predictive accuracy that the MESA Risk Score has demonstrated over other risk scores such as Framingham's, particularly when CAC information is used.

Finally, by using not only CAC data but the whole set of predictors included in the MESA CHD Risk equation, we were able to conduct a more comprehensive biological age calculation compared with prior tools developed in MESA.

### Score2 risk prediction algorithms: New models to estimate 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in Europe [^116Mric3]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2)" is used for assessing coronary artery disease, hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy.

The Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) is a risk stratification tool specifically designed for the European population. It is utilized to estimate the 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals aged 40–69 years who do not have pre-existing CVD or diabetes. The SCORE2 model incorporates several risk factors, including age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels.

The primary clinical utility of SCORE2 is to guide primary prevention strategies by identifying individuals at high risk of fatal CVD events. It aids clinicians in making informed decisions about the initiation and intensity of preventive interventions, such as lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy.

SCORE2 is not applicable to individuals with pre-existing CVD, those outside the age range of 40–69 years, or those with conditions that significantly alter cardiovascular risk such as diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, it may not accurately predict CVD risk in populations outside Europe due to differences in risk factor prevalence and CVD mortality rates.

### Use and customization of risk scores for predicting cardiovascular events using electronic health record data [^116SwqaR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The original scores reflect routine use of cardiovascular risk scores in primary care settings, where individual risk estimates are calculated using published model parameters. The refitted scores are customized to this specific population, and both model coefficients and baseline risk are reestimated using available data from that population. To isolate the effect of using "local" data to recalculate risk scores, our refitting procedure leaves the risk factors and model structure unchanged.

### Comprehensive review of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery: Prevention, intervention, and long-term management strategies [^114eTSxS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The ACS-NSQIP risk assessment calculator was derived from extensive data collected from more than one million surgical cases and is considered an evidence-based risk prediction. The calculator assesses over 135 variables for preoperative patients undergoing surgical procedures and provides the medical provider with a customized risk assessment. Healthcare facilities use the data acquired by the ACS-NSQIP tool to benchmark performance against national standards, thereby providing the framework to initiate improved initiatives and preoperative risk assessment optimization. It has been indicated that participating institutions can reduce postoperative complications by 45% and postoperative mortality by 27%. While this assessment tool has specificity to the surgical population and extensive validation, the ACS-NSQIP risk calculator may have surgical population bias, generalizability issues, and limited predictive power due to the complexity of real-life clinical scenarios.

The Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA) has proven valuable in clinical practice for accurately predicting MINS risk and providing a comprehensive assessment of preoperative variables, comorbidities, and other surgical factors. MICA formulates a risk factor score by incorporating age, functional status, ASA class, renal function, and type of surgical procedure. The MICA score has higher discriminatory power and predictive accuracy compared to the RCRI score; therefore, MICA may be more effective at identifying high-risk patient populations.

### Predicting the 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease in the United Kingdom: Independent and external validation of an updated version of QRISK2 [^114A6ALK]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is an important health concern, accounting for nearly one-third of deaths worldwide in 2008. In the United Kingdom, almost 200,000 deaths annually are attributed to diseases of the heart and circulatory system, with more than one in three deaths associated with cardiovascular disease. Targeting interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients are now key components in national policies. Risk prediction models, including the Framingham risk score, the Reynolds risk score, and QRISK, are tools used to identify people who are at high risk (≥ 20%) of developing 10-year cardiovascular disease and could benefit from intervention.

In February 2010, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence withdrew its recommendation that the Framingham risk equation be used to predict the risk of someone developing cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years. This decision was made in light of the emergence of a new cardiovascular risk prediction tool called QRISK, which was shown to have greater predictive ability than the Framingham risk equation. Despite increasing evidence suggesting that the Framingham equation is not well suited to the United Kingdom and that QRISK may be more suitably tailored, no firm recommendation exists on what model to use. Instead, NICE no longer recommends any single risk score, leaving healthcare professionals free to choose the model they consider the most appropriate.

### Derivation of a coronary age calculator using traditional risk factors and coronary artery calcium: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^116K7uTX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The optimal method for communicating coronary heart disease (CHD) risk to individual patients is not yet clear. Recent research supports the concept of "coronary age" for more effective risk communication. We defined an individual's coronary age as the age at which an average healthy individual would have an equivalent estimated CHD risk as that calculated for the index individual, building on our previously validated MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) 10-year CHD Risk Score equations with and without coronary artery calcium (CAC).

- **Methods and results**: We derived a coronary age by (1) calculating the MESA 10-year CHD risk; (2) mathematically setting this equal to an equation describing risk of an average healthy MESA participant, as a function of age; and (3) solving for age. The risk discrimination of the resultant coronary age was compared with that of chronological age, the MESA CHD Risk Score, and CAC alone. Approximately 95% of coronary age values ranged from 30 years less to 30 years higher than chronological age. Although the mean chronological age of individuals experiencing CHD events compared with those free of events was 67.4 versus 61.8 years, the difference in coronary age including CAC was larger (80.6 versus 62.8 years). Coronary age with CAC had identical predictive ability to that of MESA CHD Risk Score and outperformed chronological age and CAC alone.

- **Conclusions**: The newly derived coronary age is a convenient transformation of MESA CHD Risk, retaining very good risk discrimination. This easy-to-communicate tool will be available for wider use.

### Cardiovascular risk scores do not account for the effect of treatment: a review [^115jCRQm]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Risk predictors and their definitions

The final number of risk predictors ranged from five in PROCAM stroke to 15 in QRISK 2. Selection of predictors was mostly by significance testing. All scores included age, gender, blood pressure, and smoking, and most included lipids and diabetes. Lipid levels were not used in the non-laboratory model of the 2008 Framingham risk score, the PROCAM 2007 risk equation for stroke, or the NHEFS risk score. Diabetes, glucose intolerance, or HbA1c level was a predictor for all except the European SCORE. Other risk predictors included by some scores were left ventricular hypertrophy, antihypertensive medication use, body mass index, ethnicity, family history, socioeconomic status, medical diseases, biomarkers (hsCRP and albuminuria), and physical activity.

- **Predictors**: Definitions for risk predictors differed from score to score. In the original Framingham cohort, diabetes was defined as a random blood glucose measurement ≥ 150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/l) or treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemics. In the Framingham Offspring cohort, this definition was broadened to a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 140 mg/dl (7.7 mmol/l) or treatment requirement. This in turn differs from the definition used by the World Health Organization (WHO) of fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l). Hence, patients with fasting plasma glucose between 126 and 150 mg/dl (7–8.3 mmol/l) would be classified as non-diabetics by the first Framingham score. Systolic blood pressure measurement methods included averages taken from two readings.

### Current and future directions of cardiovascular risk prediction [^111AksSQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention has moved beyond the secondary prevention of CAD events to the early identification and treatment of individuals thought to be at risk. Risk categories may be linked to the presence of other diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or non-coronary atherosclerotic disease, or to the finding of multiple risk factors on global risk assessment.

Global risk assessment is now recommended as standard practice in cardiovascular disease prevention, and therapeutic strategies range from individuals at high risk (aggressive risk factor management) to those at low risk (periodic monitoring). Further risk stratification appears to carry its greatest benefit for the large segment of the population comprising individuals who are asymptomatic and have "intermediate" risk based on global risk measures. Noninvasive techniques for assessing vascular wall status or cardiovascular function are useful in some of these individuals because they will enable a more accurate assessment of risk and thereby result in the risk status of the patient being raised to "high".

### Derivation, validation, and evaluation of a new QRISK model to estimate lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease: Cohort study using QResearch database [^1147UqpC]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

The QRISK lifetime model could be used at the individual level to communicate cardiovascular risk to patients, especially younger patients with family histories of cardiovascular disease, for whom early lifestyle changes or pharmacological intervention could lead to significant gains over their lifetime. A web-based calculator could be used to display to both patient and clinician the risk trajectory alongside the risk for the same patient with better control of modifiable risk factors such as smoking, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio. Although our study did not assess the potential benefits of interventions, our first clinical examples suggest marked differences in lifetime risk for patients with good control of risk factors, especially those at younger ages, compared with those with more adverse profiles. This is consistent with other studies, which have shown that individuals with a high 30-year risk may not be identified using a 10-year risk prediction.

While there is good evidence for lifestyle modification at all ages, it is not clear whether individual treatment decisions should be based on lifetime risk instead of 10-year risk. If interventions were focused on patients above the 90th percentile of lifetime risk, then a person at high lifetime risk might receive treatment at an early age (such as the 31-year-old woman in clinical example 2) even though cumulative absolute risk would remain well below 20% for the next 30 years.

### The Framingham Heart Study's impact on global risk assessment [^114FGNZj]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010).

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality, responsible for about 30% of deaths worldwide. Globally, 80% of total CVD deaths occur in developing countries. In recent years, age-adjusted CVD death rates have been cut in half in developed countries. Much of this decline is due to reductions in risk factors that the Framingham Heart Study helped to identify. The study also aided in classifying those at highest risk by creating multivariate risk scores, prompting the development of various risk prediction scores by investigators in other countries. These scores have become foundational for guidelines and prevention strategies in developed countries. However, most scores that require blood tests may be difficult to implement in developing countries where limited resources for screening exist. New studies and risk scores inspired by the Framingham Heart Study need to simplify risk scoring in developing countries so that affordable prevention strategies can be implemented.

### Equalization of four cardiovascular risk algorithms after systematic recalibration: Individual-participant meta-analysis of 86 prospective studies [^111wgh3v]. European Heart Journal (2019). Low credibility.

A key strategy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the use of risk prediction algorithms to target preventive interventions on people who should benefit from them most. There is, however, debate about the optimum algorithm for CVD risk estimation. The 2013 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) have recommended the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE). By contrast, the 2016 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology have recommended the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) algorithm. The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and the Reynolds Risk Score (RRS) have been recommended by other North American guidelines. Additional algorithms have been recommended by further guidelines.

Such contrasting recommendations may create confusion among practitioners, potentially reflecting uncertainty about the performance of different algorithms under different circumstances. For example, because CVD event rates and average risk factor levels vary over time and place, algorithms developed in one population may not predict the correct risk in the target population being screened (i.e. they may not be well 'calibrated'). Furthermore, although most CVD risk algorithms include information on a common set of risk factors, algorithms can differ owing to differences in the exact set of risk factors included, mathematical formulations used, and definitions of CVD outcomes employed. Hence, use of different algorithms as currently recommended could lead to varying clinical performance and uneven efficiency.

### Risk estimation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Considerations for appropriate risk prediction model selection [^116XNS68]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 19.8 million deaths in 2022, most of which occurred in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). The underlying disease processes contributing to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease typically commence years before acute cardiovascular disease events and clinical diagnosis. Identifying individuals at high risk and intervening to reduce risk before a cardiovascular disease event occurs underpins the majority of national and international primary prevention guidelines. Clinical guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention commonly recommend using risk scores or prediction models, which assess the combined influence of multiple measured risk factors to estimate future disease risk and identify people most likely to benefit from preventive interventions.

Risk scores based on a combination of risk factors are more accurate at predicting cardiovascular disease risk than those that assess risk based on individual risk factors alone. A plethora of cardiovascular disease risk scores have been developed and updated over the past five decades (e.g. Framingham, Pooled Cohort Equations [PCE], Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE], SCORE2, WHO cardiovascular disease risk, PREDICT, QRISK3, and Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events [PREVENT]). Different cardiovascular disease guidelines (e.g. guidelines of the American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and WHO) recommend various approaches.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment: A systematic review of guidelines [^117Q3Ucq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Many guidelines exist for screening and risk assessment for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in apparently healthy persons.

- **Purpose**: To systematically review primary prevention guidelines on adult cardiovascular risk assessment and highlight the similarities and differences to aid clinician decision making.

- **Data sources**: Publications in MEDLINE and CINAHL between 3 May 2009 and 30 June 2016 were identified. On 30 June 2016, the Guidelines International Network International Guideline Library, National Guideline Clearinghouse, National Library for Health Guidelines Finder, Canadian Medical Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Infobase, and websites of organizations responsible for guideline development were searched.

- **Study selection**: Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts to identify guidelines from Western countries containing recommendations for cardiovascular risk assessment for healthy adults.

- **Data extraction**: Two reviewers independently assessed the rigor of guideline development using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument, and one extracted the recommendations.

- **Data synthesis**: Of the 21 guidelines, 17 showed considerable rigor of development. These recommendations address assessment of total cardiovascular risk (5 guidelines), dysglycemia (7 guidelines), dyslipidemia (2 guidelines), and hypertension (3 guidelines). All but one recommendation advocates for screening, and most include prediction models integrating several relatively simple risk factors for either deciding on further screening or guidance.

### Global risk of coronary heart disease: Assessment and application [^113UajDx]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death in the United States. The conventional risk factor approach to primary prevention excludes many patients who could benefit from preventive therapies. A global risk approach allows more accurate estimates of risk to guide clinical primary prevention efforts. Global risk of coronary heart disease is a calculation of the absolute risk of having a coronary heart disease event (e.g. death, myocardial infarction) over a specified period. It is based on an empiric equation that combines major risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

When physicians know a patient's global risk of coronary heart disease, they are more likely to prescribe risk-reducing therapies such as antihypertensives, statins, and aspirin. In addition, patients who know their risk level are more likely to initiate risk-reducing therapies. Many tools are available to estimate global risk, including several web-based calculators. In the United States, tools based on the Framingham Heart Study are recommended.

### The challenge of asymptomatic coronary artery disease in aircrew; detecting plaque before the accident [^115o64pi]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Initial screening tools to assess cardiovascular risk include standardized risk estimation calculators and the standard 12-lead ECG. Risk estimate calculators provide a good first approach to assessing cardiovascular risk in those without a previous cardiovascular history. They aid in risk stratification, identifying individuals most likely to benefit from primary prevention, and, for aeromedical purposes, identifying those at potential excess risk for an ACS in whom further enhanced screening or investigation may be appropriate. Although the routine 12-lead ECG is not a good discriminator of significant CAD in isolation, it may reveal abnormal conduction patterns such as left bundle branch block that may raise the possibility of occult CAD. Additionally, it may identify inherited diseases such as long QT and Brugada syndromes, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and other conditions that could increase the risk of sudden death in aircrew.

Various risk equations are available and easily accessible online. They include, to name a few, the Framingham Risk Score, PROspective CArdiovascular Münster study (PROCAM), ArbeitsGruppe Lipide und Atherosklerose (AGLA), QRISK, Reynold's Risk Score (RRS), and SCORE. Most have been constructed with data from populations in North America and Europe, are generally population-specific, and may not be well calibrated for other populations. Additional limitations of risk calculators for the risk assessment of many aircrew include the higher subject age range, such as the Framingham Risk Score, which has a minimum age range.

### Risk scoring for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^115XmtJV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The paradigm for cardiovascular disease (CVD) emphasizes absolute risk assessment to guide treatment decisions in primary prevention. Although the derivation and validation of multivariable risk assessment tools, or CVD risk scores, have attracted considerable attention, their effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of evaluating and providing CVD risk scores in adults without prevalent CVD on cardiovascular outcomes, risk factor levels, preventive medication prescribing, and health behaviors.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 1, 2016), Embase (embase.com) (1974 to 15 March 2016), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to 15 March 2016). We imposed no language restrictions and searched clinical trial registers in March 2016, hand-searching reference lists of primary studies to identify additional reports.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing the systematic provision of CVD risk scores by a clinician, healthcare professional, or healthcare system with usual care (i.e. no systematic provision of CVD risk scores) in adults without CVD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and evaluated study quality. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study limitations. The primary outcomes were CVD events and changes in CVD risk factor levels.

### Risk estimation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Considerations for appropriate risk prediction model selection [^111MREMC]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, there are various national, regional, and global risk scores available for cardiovascular disease risk estimation, but they differ in derivation methodology, included risk predictors, endpoints predicted, and derivation and target populations. To identify an appropriate cardiovascular disease risk score with good predictive ability, including discrimination and calibration, health professionals and policymakers need to compare and select risk scores based on the needs of cardiovascular disease prevention as well as the practicality of use in their local population. In the vast majority of cases, regular recalibration of the risk score is needed to ensure that the estimated risks reflect those in the target population, and this can be completed using aggregate-level data. The use of a cardiovascular disease risk score that includes recalibration as an integral process is advantageous.

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: To inform this review, we searched PubMed, Embase, Google, and Google Scholar to identify existing risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease in the context of primary prevention recommended by global, regional, and subregional guidelines published in English, from database inceptions to January 2024, using relevant terms such as "cardiovascular disease", "risk score", "risk equation", "risk algorithm", and "risk prediction". The intention was not to provide an exhaustive review of all published cardiovascular disease risk scores but to give a contemporary description of several selected scores recommended by prominent sources.

### Improving patient risk communication: Translating cardiovascular risk into standardized risk percentiles [^111Qvkmw]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Cholesterol guidelines recommend using the 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) to guide informed decisions regarding statin therapy, yet patients may have difficulty conceptualizing absolute risk estimates. Peer comparisons may provide an improved tool for patient risk comprehension.

- **Methods**: Using data from the 2009–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we estimated standardized risk percentiles for various age-, sex-, and race-specific subgroups based on their 10-year ASCVD risks using the Pooled Cohort Equations.

- **Results**: We examined 9160 adults in NHANES who were free of cardiovascular disease and had complete clinical data. Among specific age, sex, and race groups, we estimated the distribution of 10-year risk, calculating the 10-year risk corresponding to each percentile in order to generate standardized cardiovascular risk percentiles.

	- Estimated 10-year ASCVD absolute risk varied markedly by age, sex, and race subgroups. For example, a 10-year risk of 7.0% would place a 55-year-old black male in the 20th percentile relative to his peers (i.e. at lower risk than 80% of his peers), whereas the same 10-year risk of 7.0% would place a 55-year-old white female in the 95th percentile (i.e. only 5% of her peers would have higher risk). Standardized cardiovascular risk percentiles by age, race, and sex are available online at populationrelativerisk.dcri.org.

- **Conclusion**: Cardiovascular risk varies substantially by age, sex, and race. These data allow for 10-year absolute risks of ASCVD to be translated into standardized cardio…

### Prediction models for cardiovascular disease risk in the general population: Systematic review [^1127aeHS]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

The literature is overwhelmed with models for predicting the risk of cardiovascular outcomes in the general population. Most, however, have not been externally validated or directly compared on their relative predictive performance, making them currently of yet unknown value for practitioners, policymakers, and guideline developers. Moreover, most developed prediction models are insufficiently reported to allow external validation by others, let alone to become implemented in clinical guidelines or be used in practice.

We believe it is time to stop developing yet another similar CVD risk prediction model for the general population. Rather than developing such new CVD risk prediction models, in this era of large and combined datasets, we should focus on externally validating and comparing head-to-head the promising existing CVD risk models. We should tailor these models to local settings, investigate whether they may be extended with new predictors, and finally, quantify the clinical impact of the most promising models.

### Agreement among cardiovascular disease risk calculators [^11265koY]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Use of cardiovascular disease risk calculators is often recommended by guidelines, yet research on the consistency in risk assessment among these calculators remains limited.

- **Method and results**: A search of PubMed and Google was performed. Five clinicians independently reviewed and selected 25 risk calculators. Hypothetical patients were created using seven dichotomized risk factors (age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus), resulting in 128 total virtual patients. These patients were assessed by each calculator by two clinicians. Risk estimates, along with assigned risk categories, were compared among calculators. The selected calculators represented eight countries, utilized five- or ten-year predictions, and estimated risks for either cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease. Using three risk categories (low, medium, and high), the 25 calculators categorized each patient into an average of 2.2 different categories. Notably, 41% of unique patients were assigned across all three risk categories. Agreement on risk category between pairs of calculators was 67%. This did not improve when analysis was restricted to the ten-year cardiovascular disease calculators. For nondiabetic individuals, the highest calculated risk estimate from a calculator averaged 4.9 times higher (range: 1.9–13.3) than the lowest calculated risk estimate for the same patient. This variance did not change significantly for diabetics or when analysis was limited to the ten-year cardiovascular disease calculators.

- **Conclusions**: The decision regarding which calculator to use for risk estimation is complex given the variability among calculators and should be deliberated with careful consideration of the specific patient context.

### Derivation of a coronary age calculator using traditional risk factors and coronary artery calcium: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [^112zBqWF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

A beta version of a combined MESA CHD risk score and coronary age application has been developed to facilitate easy access to the coronary age method by patients, clinicians, and researchers. There will be an online version and a downloadable app for mobile phones in both "patient" and "clinician" versions. The patient version will provide a simple display of the 10-year CHD risk score alongside their coronary age. The clinician version will additionally present the results without including the CAC score, demonstrating the effect of considering CAC.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for familial hypercholesterolemia, particularly concerning cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) 2018 guidelines recommend not using risk calculators — such as the Framingham Risk Score, Pooled Cohort Equation, or European SCORE — to determine cardiovascular risk in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Novel self-report tool for cardiovascular risk assessment [^115ZD9Wr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The currently used atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk calculator relies on several measured variables and does not incorporate some well-established risk factors such as family history of premature myocardial infarction and other nontraditional risk factors. Our study aimed to develop and validate a simple risk score to predict the 10-year risk of incident cardiovascular events using patient-reported information.

- **Methods and results**: Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort, we identified adults with no previous history of cardiovascular disease and randomly divided the cohort into "development" (70%) and "validation" (30%) subgroups. Adjusted Cox regression modeling was used to develop a prediction model. The predictive performance of the new risk score was compared with the score derived from the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk calculator. A total of 9,285 individuals met the inclusion criteria. During follow-up (median 8.93 years), a total of 694 (7.47%) incident cardiovascular events occurred. The following six factors were included: male sex, age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and family history of premature myocardial infarction. The C-statistic was 0.72 in the validation cohort with good calibration. The area under the curve for the simple risk score was comparable to the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score.

- **Conclusions**: The novel simple risk score is an easy-to-use tool to predict cardiovascular events in adults from self-reported information without the need for laboratory or physical examination.

### Novel self-report tool for cardiovascular risk assessment [^114xYFz4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In order to develop a simple and utilizable risk calculation of the CVD incidence in the clinical setting, hazard ratios (HRs) were arbitrarily categorized and assigned to whole number risk points using a previously described method. For example, HRs between 1.00 and 1.19 were categorized as "0 points", HRs between 1.20 and 1.49 were categorized as "1 point", and HRs between 1.50 and 2.49 were categorized as "2 points", etc. Since the purpose of our new risk score is to identify "high risk" patients in a generalizable, nationally representative population, we have performed additional analyses using the most recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2015–2016). We compared the prevalence of the low-risk population versus the high-risk population as determined by the simple risk score (EZ-CVD) and the predicted ASCVD risk scores (n = 2667, weighted n = 11.8 M). We used a cut-off of ≥ 20% versus < 20% to define the high- versus low-risk groups based on the predicted ASCVD risk. The cut-off point for high versus low risk in the EZ-CVD risk score was determined based on the prevalence that best represents the ASCVD risk group in the respective category.

In a secondary model, we assessed the value of adding race to the final risk prediction model by computing and comparing the C-statistics of the final prediction model with and without the addition of race. All analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).

### Risk estimation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Considerations for appropriate risk prediction model selection [^113DtBeN]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). High credibility.

When using a risk score in practice, the estimated risk depends not only on the individual's measured risk factor values, but also on two additional risk model-specific features: the population average risk (incidence or mortality) and the relative risks (or associations) that confer the change in risk with differing levels of each measured risk factor. For example, a relative risk of 1.2 for a lipid measurement in a prediction model would confer a 1.2-fold increase in estimated risk per unit increase in the individual's measured value of that risk factor.

As the relative effect of risk factors on cardiovascular disease has been shown to be similar across different populations (i.e. the association is similar across studies, countries, and time periods), different cardiovascular disease risk scores often result in a similar ranking of individuals based on their estimated risk. However, population average risks might differ for several reasons, yet are often built into risk scores at development, leading to variation in risk estimates obtained across different risk scores for a given set of measured risk factor values. Such variation might reflect the number of endpoints included in the cardiovascular disease definition, as well as the overall underlying risk of the population (data source) used to derive the risk prediction model. Many scores (in their original form) might not be appropriately calibrated to predict the correct level of absolute risk in the broader target population in which they are applied, resulting in overprediction or underprediction of cardiovascular disease risk.

### Using administrative databases to calculate Framingham scores within a large health care organization [^114Dtveg]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Framingham calculators are typically implemented in one-on-one settings to determine if a patient is at high risk for the development of cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years. Because health care administrative datasets are including more clinical information, we explored how well administrative data-derived Framingham scores could identify persons who would develop stroke in the next year.

- **Methods**: Using a nested case-control design, we compared all 313 persons who had a first-time stroke at five Veterans Administration Medical Centers with a random sample of 25,361 persons who did not have a first-time stroke in 2008. We compared Framingham scores and risk using administrative data available at the end of 2007.

- **Results**: Stroke patients had higher risk profiles than controls, including older age, higher systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol. They were more likely to have diabetes, cardiovascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and to use treatment for blood pressure (P < 0.05). The mean Framingham generalized cardiovascular disease score (18.0 versus 14.5) as well as the mean Framingham stroke-specific score (13.2 versus 10.2) was higher for stroke cases than controls (both P < 0.0001). The c-statistic for the generalized cardiovascular disease score was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65–0.70) and for the stroke score was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.62–0.67).

- **Conclusions**: Persons who developed a stroke in the next year had a worse Framingham risk profile, as determined by administrative data. Future studies should examine how to improve the stroke predictive tools and…

### Evaluating algorithmic fairness in the presence of clinical guidelines: the case of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation [^112c869k]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association guidelines on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) recommend using 10-year ASCVD risk estimation models to initiate statin treatment. For guideline-concordant decision-making, risk estimates need to be calibrated. However, existing models are often miscalibrated for race, ethnicity, and sex-based subgroups. This study evaluates two algorithmic fairness approaches to adjust the risk estimators (group recalibration and equalized odds) for their compatibility with the assumptions underpinning the guidelines' decision rules.

- **Methods**: Using an updated pooled cohorts data set, we derive unconstrained, group-recalibrated, and equalized odds-constrained versions of the 10-year ASCVD risk estimators and compare their calibration at guideline-concordant decision thresholds.

- **Results**: We find that, compared with the unconstrained model, group-recalibration improves calibration at one of the relevant thresholds for each group but exacerbates differences in false positive and false negative rates between groups. An equalized odds constraint, meant to equalize error rates across groups, does so by miscalibrating the model overall and at relevant decision thresholds.

- **Discussion**: Hence, because of induced miscalibration, decisions guided by risk estimators learned with an equalized odds fairness constraint are not concordant with existing guidelines. Conversely, recalibrating the model separately for each group can increase guideline compatibility while increasing intergroup differences.

### Derivation of a coronary age calculator using traditional risk factors and coronary artery calcium: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^112w3D54]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The results of our analysis suggest that the ability of this new tool, "coronary age", to accurately separate patients who develop CHD events from those who do not is as good as that of the MESA CHD Risk Score. These observations are consistent with the better performance of the MESA CHD Risk Score with CAC compared to the same score without CAC information. Our results suggest that improved risk communication with coronary age can occur without losing any predictive information compared with MESA CHD Risk Score estimates.

The present findings have important clinical implications. The mode of predicting and communicating CHD risk in probability terms may prevent patients from fully appreciating their risk, as probabilities are generally difficult to understand. This is in spite of the ability to accurately predict CHD risk by some available risk prediction equations, such as the MESA CHD Risk Score. Based on our study, clinicians using the latter to inform risk discussions with patients and shared decision-making may consider also introducing coronary age to further enhance these conversations.

A beta version of the coronary age calculator is available, built on the existing MESA CHD Risk Score app (see Apple/iTunes and Android app stores). Web-based apps are currently being developed to facilitate communication. Further research on how this approach affects patient risk understanding and implementation of preventive measures is warranted.

- **Study limitations**: Estimated coronary ages are modestly sensitive to the average risk factors of the health.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment: A global perspective [^114zYn6r]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

An important strategy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is the early identification of high-risk individuals. Effective implementation of a strategy to identify these individuals in a clinical setting relies on the availability of appropriate CVD risk-assessment models and guideline recommendations. Several well-known models for CVD risk assessment have been developed and utilized in the United States and Europe, but they might not be suitable for use in other regions or countries. Very few reports have discussed the development of risk-assessment models and recommendations from a global perspective.

In this review, we discuss why risk-assessment methods developed from studies in one geographical region or ethnic population might not be suitable for other regions or populations, and examine the availability and characteristics of predictive models in areas beyond the United States or Europe. In addition, we compare the differences in risk-assessment recommendations outlined in CVD clinical guidelines from developed and developing countries and consider their potential effect on clinical practice. This overview of cardiovascular risk assessment from a global perspective can potentially guide low-to-middle-income countries in the development or validation of their own CVD risk-assessment models and the formulation of recommendations in their own clinical guidelines according to local requirements.

### Performance of the Framingham risk models and pooled cohort equations for predicting 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11276BXM]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major health burden, accounting for 17.5 million deaths worldwide in 2012. To effectively and efficiently implement preventive measures such as lifestyle advice and lipid-lowering drugs, early identification of high-risk individuals for targeted intervention using so-called CVD risk prediction models or risk scores is widely advocated. Evidently, it is crucial that predictions of CVD risk provided by these models are sufficiently accurate. Inappropriate risk-based management may lead to overtreatment or undertreatment.

Clinical guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (AHA) advise using the Framingham Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III model or the pooled cohort equations (PCE) to predict 10-year risk of CVD for all individuals 40 years or older. Most clinical research focuses on studying the Framingham Wilson model.

All three models have been externally validated numerous times across different settings and populations. Most studies show that their predicted risks are too high, indicating poor calibration. However, other reports found adequate calibration for these same models. Previous reviews have summarized existing models for cardiovascular risk prediction without undertaking any formal comparison or quantitative synthesis or focused solely on the performance of the PCE. Systematic reviews, followed by a quantitative synthesis, have become a vital tool in the evaluation of a prediction model's performance across diverse populations.

### World Health Organization (WHO) and International Society of Hypertension (ISH) risk prediction charts: Assessment of cardiovascular risk for prevention and control of cardiovascular disease in low and middle-income countries [^116LKyN1]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of the growing global disease burden due to non-communicable diseases. For successful prevention and control of CVD, strategies that focus on individuals need to complement population-wide strategies. Strategies that focus on individuals are cost-effective only when targeted at high-risk groups. Risk prediction tools that easily and accurately predict an individual's absolute risk of CVD are key to targeting limited resources at high-risk individuals who are likely to benefit the most.

Health systems in low-income countries do not have the basic infrastructure facilities to support resource-intensive risk prediction tools, particularly in primary healthcare. The WHO/ISH charts presented here enable the prediction of future risk of heart attacks and strokes in people living in low and middle-income countries for the first time. Furthermore, since the charts use simple variables, they can be applied even in low-resource settings. Thus, the WHO/ISH risk prediction charts and the accompanying guideline will improve the effectiveness of cardiovascular risk management, even in settings which do not have sophisticated technology.

### Equalization of four cardiovascular risk algorithms after systematic recalibration: Individual-participant meta-analysis of 86 prospective studies [^112VzvuL]. European Heart Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The optimum algorithm for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation has been debated extensively. To address this, we conducted head-to-head comparisons of four algorithms recommended by primary prevention guidelines, both before and after recalibration. Recalibration is a method that adapts risk algorithms to account for differences in the risk characteristics of the studied populations.

Using individual-participant data from 360,737 participants without CVD at baseline, across 86 prospective studies from 22 countries, we evaluated the Framingham risk score (FRS), systematic coronary risk evaluation (SCORE), pooled cohort equations (PCE), and Reynolds risk score (RRS). We calculated measures of risk discrimination and calibration, and modeled clinical implications of initiating statin therapy in individuals judged to be at 'high' 10-year CVD risk. The original risk algorithms were recalibrated using the risk factor profile and CVD incidence of target populations.

The four algorithms demonstrated similar risk discrimination. Initially, FRS, SCORE, and PCE over-predicted CVD risk on average by 10%, 52%, and 41%, respectively, while RRS under-predicted by 10%. Original algorithm versions classified 29–39% of individuals aged ≥ 40 years as high risk. In contrast, recalibration reduced this proportion to 22–24% for each algorithm. To prevent one CVD event, initiating statin therapy would be necessary for 44–51 individuals using original algorithms, compared to 37–39 individuals with recalibrated algorithms.
