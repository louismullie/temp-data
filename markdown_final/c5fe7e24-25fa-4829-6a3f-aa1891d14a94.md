## Question

How does kidney function affect creatinine levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how kidney function affects creatinine levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology of creatinine generation and renal handling. Then, I should verify the inverse relationship between GFR and serum creatinine in steady state. Next, I will examine why creatinine is an imperfect marker, including non-GFR determinants and tubular secretion. After that, I need to consider the lag in acute kidney injury and the concept of renal reserve. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications, including dosing, risk stratification, and when to use confirmatory markers or measured GFR, while double-checking guideline-based recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the basic physiology. Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle creatine metabolism generated at a relatively constant rate, filtered freely at the glomerulus, and cleared by the kidneys through filtration plus a smaller amount of tubular secretion; importantly, it is not reabsorbed, so serum levels reflect both production and elimination, with elimination tightly linked to GFR in steady state [^0e5baaa4] [^5e6c0050].

> Wait, let me verify the core relationship before moving on. In steady-state conditions, there is an inverse, non-linear relationship between GFR and serum creatinine: as GFR falls, serum creatinine rises, and because of this non-linearity, early GFR losses produce relatively large proportional increases in creatinine, whereas at low GFR, further decrements yield smaller proportional creatinine rises; this is why small creatinine increases can signal substantial GFR declines early on [^dbf97c46] [^10ecf4e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about creatinine being a perfect GFR marker. I need to check the non-GFR determinants that can confound interpretation: muscle mass, age, sex, diet, and assay interference all influence serum creatinine independent of filtration; additionally, tubular secretion of creatinine increases as GFR declines, which can blunt the magnitude of creatinine rise relative to the true GFR fall, and in acute settings, fluid overload can dilute creatinine and mask AKI, while non-steady-state kinetics delay creatinine changes by 24–48 hours despite significant GFR reductions [^f119dcfe] [^5e6c0050] [^fa823747] [^10ecf4e3].

> I should double-check the clinical implications of these limitations. Because of delayed equilibration and confounding, creatinine-based AKI definitions can miss early injury and misclassify severity; this is why even small, persistent creatinine increases carry prognostic weight, and why guidelines and studies emphasize confirming suspected CKD or drug-induced changes with cystatin C or measured GFR when accuracy matters for diagnosis, staging, or dosing decisions [^c93d3729] [^02fbc0e4] [^def572c6].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In older adults, lower muscle mass leads to lower creatinine at a given GFR, so creatinine-based eGFR can overestimate true function; conversely, in people with high muscle mass or after creatine supplementation, creatinine may be higher without reduced GFR, so I should confirm with cystatin C or measured GFR when the clinical picture and creatinine disagree [^229ec631] [^24e00a07] [^02fbc0e4].

> Next, I should review the acute setting more carefully. After a sudden GFR drop, creatinine rises slowly due to distribution and generation kinetics; a 50% GFR reduction may take 24–48 hours to manifest as a clinically detectable creatinine increase, meaning early AKI is often "subclinical" by creatinine, and recovery trajectories matter: delayed return of creatinine to baseline after AKI tracks with higher risks of CKD progression and mortality, reinforcing the need for close follow-up even when creatinine "normalizes" [^10ecf4e3] [^31b6d671] [^22da3ada].

> I will now examine chronic kidney disease progression. In CKD, declining GFR is accompanied by rising creatinine, but the relationship is complicated by increased tubular secretion and changing body composition; nonetheless, validated creatinine-based eGFR equations remain first-line for diagnosis and staging, with cystatin C or measured GFR reserved for confirmation or when creatinine is unreliable, and longitudinal changes in eGFR correlate with hard outcomes like ESRD and mortality, supporting the use of eGFR trajectories in risk stratification [^f119dcfe] [^02fbc0e4] [^167bdcf0].

> But wait, what if a medication is causing a creatinine rise without true GFR loss. I should confirm whether transporter-mediated effects or hemodynamic changes are implicated; for example, RAAS inhibitors and some antibiotics can acutely increase creatinine via reduced intraglomerular pressure or inhibition of tubular secretion, and while modest, early creatinine rises after ACEi/ARB initiation can track with worse cardiorenal outcomes, so I need to monitor trends, assess volume status, and decide continuation case-by-case rather than reflexively stopping therapy [^021d4b95] [^70fa455e] [^d63a8bcf].

> Let me reconsider the practical approach. For most patients, I should start with serum creatinine and a validated eGFR equation, interpret results in clinical context, and escalate to cystatin C–based eGFR or measured GFR when accuracy is paramount, when creatinine is likely confounded, or when drug dosing has narrow margins; in AKI, I should avoid steady-state equations, consider kinetic eGFR if needed, and remember that urine output complements creatinine for detection and risk stratification [^02fbc0e4] [^ebfc56c8] [^c93d3729].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: kidney function determines creatinine levels primarily through GFR, but creatinine is an imperfect surrogate with lag, non-GFR determinants, and tubular secretion effects; therefore, I should interpret creatinine alongside clinical context, consider confirmatory markers when decisions hinge on accuracy, and recognize that even small, persistent changes can signal clinically meaningful kidney dysfunction and worse outcomes [^0e5baaa4] [^f119dcfe] [^167bdcf0].

Kidney function determines serum creatinine levels through **glomerular filtration** and **tubular secretion**. As GFR declines, creatinine clearance falls and serum creatinine rises, but the relationship is **nonlinear** [^dbf97c46] and confounded by muscle mass, age, sex, diet, and drugs [^f119dcfe]. Creatinine is insensitive to early kidney injury [^b69e8a83] and can lag 24–48 hours behind true GFR changes [^10ecf4e3], so small or early declines in kidney function may be missed [^c93d3729]. For more accurate assessment, **use eGFR equations** [^f119dcfe] and consider cystatin C or measured GFR when results are uncertain or decisions are high-stakes [^02fbc0e4].

---

## Physiological relationship between kidney function and creatinine

- **Glomerular filtration**: Creatinine is freely filtered at the glomerulus; as GFR falls, serum creatinine rises inversely [^0e5baaa4].

- **Tubular secretion**: A small fraction of creatinine is secreted by renal tubules; as GFR declines, secretion increases, partially offsetting the rise in serum creatinine and blunting the apparent GFR drop [^5e6c0050].

- **Nonlinear relationship**: Early GFR loss produces relatively large creatinine increases, whereas advanced GFR loss yields smaller creatinine rises, limiting sensitivity at low GFR [^dbf97c46].

---

## Factors influencing serum creatinine levels independent of kidney function

Several factors confound creatinine as a GFR marker:

| **Factor** | **Effect on serum creatinine** |
|-|-|
| Muscle mass | Higher muscle mass increases creatinine production and serum levels [^0e6cad9e] |
| Age and sex | Older age and female sex associate with lower creatinine at a given GFR [^229ec631] |
| Diet | High meat intake increases creatinine; vegetarian diets lower it [^notfound] |
| Hydration status | Dehydration concentrates creatinine; overhydration dilutes it [^fa823747] |
| Medications | ACE inhibitors, ARBs, trimethoprim, and cimetidine can raise creatinine without reducing GFR [^021d4b95] [^d63a8bcf] |

## Limitations of serum creatinine as a marker of kidney function

- **Insensitivity**: Creatinine rises only after substantial nephron loss, missing early kidney injury [^3c6ae661].

- **Lag time**: Creatinine changes lag 24–48 hours behind true GFR changes, delaying AKI recognition [^10ecf4e3].

- **Variability**: Non-GFR determinants (muscle mass, diet, drugs) limit accuracy and reproducibility [^f119dcfe].

---

## Clinical implications and alternative markers

Given these limitations, **clinical practice relies on**:

- **Estimated GFR (eGFR)**: Calculated from creatinine using validated equations (CKD-EPI, MDRD) that adjust for age, sex, and race [^f119dcfe].

- **Cystatin C**: Less affected by muscle mass and diet; combining creatinine and cystatin C improves accuracy [^05822db6].

- **Measured GFR**: Gold standard using exogenous markers (iohexol, iothalamate) when precise GFR is needed [^1707f4c4].

---

## Clinical scenarios illustrating the relationship

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Rapid GFR drops cause creatinine to rise over 24–48 hours; small creatinine increases can reflect large GFR losses early on [^10ecf4e3].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Progressive GFR decline drives sustained creatinine rises, but the curve flattens at low GFR, masking further deterioration [^notfound].

- **Drug-induced changes**: ACE inhibitors/ARBs can raise creatinine 20–30% without structural injury; interpret in context and monitor trends [^021d4b95].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Inverse relationship**: Lower GFR increases serum creatinine, but the relationship is nonlinear and confounded [^dbf97c46].

- **Limited sensitivity**: Creatinine misses early kidney injury and lags behind real-time GFR changes [^b69e8a83] [^10ecf4e3].

- **Context matters**: Interpret creatinine alongside muscle mass, diet, hydration, and medications [^f119dcfe].

- **Use eGFR and confirm**: Employ eGFR equations and confirm with cystatin C or measured GFR when accuracy is critical [^02fbc0e4].

---

Kidney function shapes creatinine through filtration and secretion, but creatinine is an imperfect GFR proxy; **interpret it with clinical context and confirm with eGFR or measured GFR when decisions depend on precision** [^0e5baaa4].

### Evaluation of short-term changes in serum creatinine level as a meaningful end point in randomized clinical trials [^ef3aae26]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown that acute change in kidney function (specifically, AKI) is a strong risk factor for poor outcomes. Thus, the outcome of acute change in serum creatinine level, regardless of underlying biology or etiology, is frequently used in clinical trials as both efficacy and safety end points. We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to quantify the relationship between positive or negative short-term effects of interventions on change in serum creatinine level and more meaningful clinical outcomes. After a thorough literature search, we included 14 randomized trials of interventions that altered risk for an acute increase in serum creatinine level and had reported between-group differences in CKD and/or mortality rate ≥ 3 months after randomization. Seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, increased risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.89), and seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, reduced risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.74). However, pooled risks for CKD and mortality associated with interventions did not differ from those with placebo in either group. In conclusion, several interventions that affect risk of acute, mild to moderate, often temporary elevation in serum creatinine level in placebo-controlled randomized trials showed no appreciable effect on CKD or mortality months later, raising questions about the value of using small to moderate changes in serum creatinine level as end points in clinical trials.

### Defining acute kidney injury: what is the most appropriate metric? [^e799f7ae]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely accepted measure of kidney function. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a reduction in GFR. GFR is, however, rarely measured in clinical practice; instead, serum markers (primarily creatinine) are used to define AKI. Because serum creatinine level is not linearly related to GFR, the performance of this marker is associated with ascertainment bias and poor sensitivity. In this article we discuss the limitations and pitfalls of using serum markers to define AKI, and offer some suggestions for the future.

2 Although blood urea nitrogen varies inversely with kidney function, it is a less useful indicator than serum creatinine or eGFR because. BUN can change independently of kidney function. The two main reasons are: the rate of urea production is not constant; and filtered. urea is passively reabsorbed by the kidney, leading to a rise in BUN that is disproportionate to the change in kidney function in some clinical situations. It is therefore not recommended that changes in BUN be used to detect changes in kidney function or kidney injury.

### Acute kidney injury in critical care: time for a paradigm shift? [^9c906068]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute alterations in renal function are commonly encountered in various settings with varied clinical manifestations ranging from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure. Our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been fairly stagnant, until recently largely limited by a lack of concerted efforts in the field. This review summarizes the recent advances and provides an overview of emerging trends in this field.

Recent Findings

One of the limitations in our knowledge of human acute kidney injury has been the lack of a standardized definition and staging criteria for this disorder. New information on the epidemiology and outcomes of acute kidney injury has emerged providing an opportunity to reappraise our approach to this disease. Also, there has been new work on the relationship of alterations of renal function to short and long-term outcomes, particularly mortality.

Summary

To translate advances from basic research to clinical application a multidisciplinary approach is required. New research in the field of biomarkers combined with clinical markers will lead to therapies that can be introduced earlier in the course of the disease and, hopefully, lead to a decrease in mortality from this potentially reversible condition.

### The prognostic importance of a small acute decrement in kidney function in hospitalized patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7999c304]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, acute kidney injury defined by small changes in serum creatinine levels was associated with worse short-term outcomes; however, the precision and variability of this association was not fully explored.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting & Participants

Hospitalized patients.

Selection Criteria For Studies

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for observational cohort studies and randomized controlled trials published from 1990 through February 2007 that provided information for small changes in serum creatinine levels.

Predictor

Small acute changes in serum creatinine levels by absolute and percentage of changes in serum creatinine levels (lower threshold for increase in serum creatinine < 0.5 mg/dL or < 25%).

Outcome

Short-term mortality (≤ 30 days).

Results

Compared with controls, patients with a 10% to 24% increase in creatinine levels had a relative risk (RR) of death of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 2.5). By comparison, subjects with a 25% to 49% acute change in creatinine levels had an RR of death of 3.0 (95% CI, 1.6 to 5.8), and those with the largest change (≥ 50%) had the greatest RR of death (RR, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.0 to 24.5). Results were similar when absolute changes in creatinine levels were considered and when pooled estimates of adjusted RR were used.

Limitations

Individual patient data were unavailable; thus, only group-level data were pooled for meta-analysis. Results showed a significant degree of statistical heterogeneity that was only partially ameliorated by separating studies into subsets based on clinical setting.

Conclusions

Short-term mortality and acute decreases in renal function are associated through a graded relationship such that even mild changes in serum creatinine levels portend worse outcome in a variety of clinical settings and patient-types.

### How to use… serum creatinine, cystatin C and GFR [^dbf97c46]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best overall measure of kidney function. The GFR is relatively low at birth but increases through infancy and early childhood to reach adult levels of approximately 120mL/min/1.73m 2 by age 2. While GFR can be measured most accurately by the urinary clearance of an exogenous ideal filtration marker such as inulin, it is more clinically useful to estimate GFR using a single serum measurement of an endogenous biomarker such as creatinine or cystatin C. When in steady state, there is an inverse relationship between creatinine/cystatin C and GFR, allowing GFR to be estimated from either using simple equations. Because of the non-linear relationship between creatinine/cystatin C and GFR, relatively small initial increases in these markers represent significant decreases in GFR. While cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells, creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism and is therefore influenced by diet and muscle mass/body habitus. Decreased GFR is used to diagnose and stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes system. A diagnosis of CKD requires GFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2 for more than 3months; higher GFR also represents CKD if evidence of kidney damage (such as albuminuria or abnormal imaging) is present. Changes in serum creatinine and urine output are used to diagnose acute kidney injury. It is possible to calculate a kinetic GFR when the creatinine is changing rapidly, though more complex calculations are required.

### Fluctuations in serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^6db3f6e5]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Creatinine level–based eGFR may not accurately reflect the severity of the kidney injury in the acute setting, as creatinine levels are often not increased until several days after AKI has occurred. Despite this shortcoming, the use of creatinine level–based eGFR has distinct advantages compared with current risk stratification strategies, which focus on the presence of AKI and an increase in serum creatinine levels over time. First, reliance on the definition of AKI may fail to recognize clinical outcomes of patients with smaller serum creatinine increases or variable creatinine level fluctuations. Second, these approaches still require information on baseline serum creatinine levels, which is not always available. In addition, efforts to estimate baseline creatinine levels from in-hospital creatinine tests or by using other patient-based equations were inaccurate and resulted in misclassifications of AKI.

A possible explanation for our findings is that an observed decrease in kidney function during hospitalization might reveal an existing decreased kidney reserve, unmasked by the stress of acute illness. Even though kidney function may seem to be recovered at discharge, the persistent reduction in kidney reserve could have long-term implications. Setting the threshold for normal kidney function at an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 revealed no associations with 1-year mortality, implying that more substantial kidney damage may be required to influence long-term outcomes.

### Fluctuations in serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^38ac1660]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the long-term outcomes for hospitalized patients with reduced kidney function on admission who are discharged with apparently normal kidney function?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 40 558 adults, patients with reduced kidney function on admission who were discharged with apparently normal kidney function experienced 18% increased mortality in the year following the hospitalization. The risk of end-stage kidney disease increased by 267% in the 10 years following the hospitalization.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that reversible reduction in kidney function among hospitalized patients is associated with an increased long-term risk for end-stage kidney disease and mortality.

### Are small changes in serum creatinine an important risk factor? [^64ba1f3e]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Serum creatinine levels are strongly associated with longitudinal risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Recent studies addressed whether worsening renal function - defined by small increases in creatinine - is independently associated with adverse outcomes. This review evaluates the recent literature on worsened renal function as an independent risk factor.

Recent Findings

Studies have evaluated worsening renal function as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in three settings: cardiac surgery patients, hospitalized heart failure patients, and ambulatory coronary artery disease patients. Small creatinine changes following cardiac surgery were strongly associated with mortality risk. One study found a J-shaped association between 48 h post surgery creatinine change and 30-day mortality risk. Compared with patients with creatinine decreases of 0–0.3 mg/dl, patients with creatinine increases less than 0.5 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted mortality risk and those with creatinine increases of at least 0.5 mg/dl had a nearly sixfold mortality risk; surprisingly those with decreases over 0.3 mg/dl had a twofold adjusted risk. Worsening renal function was also a strong predictor of mortality for hospitalized heart failure patients independent of baseline creatinine; the magnitude of creatinine rise appeared to be linearly associated with mortality risk. However, one study found no independent association between worsening renal function and cardiovascular or mortality risk over longer follow-up.

Summary

Acute elevations in serum creatinine had a linear association with increased risk for adverse outcomes among patients hospitalized for cardiac surgery or heart failure. Future studies should determine interventions to prevent and treat in-hospital worsening renal function to reduce the risk for adverse outcomes.

### Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^24e00a07]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that creatine supplementation is associated with a modest increase in serum creatinine levels but does not adversely affect glomerular filtration rate. These results indicate that creatine is likely safe for kidney function in healthy individuals and various clinical populations when used within standard dosing protocols. However, researchers and clinicians should interpret elevated serum creatinine levels in the context of supplementation with caution and consider more specific renal function markers for accurate assessment.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^f119dcfe]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Initial assessment with serum creatinine (SCr) — the guideline practice point states: "Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for the initial assessment of GFR". Evidence context notes that "There are no RCTs to quantify the impact for the use of less accurate methods versus more accurate methods of assessment of GFR", yet "For most clinical circumstances, estimating GFR from SCr is appropriate for diagnosis, staging and monitoring the progression of CKD", and that "professional societies throughout the world have recommended that GFR estimates should be used in association with SCr reporting". The page cautions that "Sources of error in GFR estimation from SCr concentration include non–steady-state conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinine assays", and that "GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levels than at lower levels".

### Molecular nephrology: types of acute tubular injury [^b69e8a83]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

The acute loss of kidney function has been diagnosed for many decades using the serum concentration of creatinine - a muscle metabolite that is an insensitive and non-specific marker of kidney function, but is now used for the very definition of acute kidney injury (AKI). Fortunately, myriad new tools have now been developed to better understand the relationship between acute tubular injury and elevation in serum creatinine (SCr). These tools include unbiased gene and protein expression analyses in kidney, urine and blood, the localization of specific gene transcripts in pathological biopsy samples by rapid in-situ RNA technology and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses. However, this molecular approach to AKI has produced a series of unexpected problems, because the expression of specific kidney-derived molecules that are indicative of injury often do not correlate with SCr levels. This discrepancy between kidney injury markers and SCr level can be reconciled by the recognition that many separate subtypes of AKI exist, each with distinct patterning of molecular markers of tubular injury and SCr data. In this Review, we describe the weaknesses of isolated SCr-based diagnoses, the clinical and molecular subtyping of acute tubular injury, and the role of non-invasive biomarkers in clinical phenotyping. We propose a conceptual model that synthesizes molecular and physiological data along a time course spanning from acute cellular injury to organ failure.

### Prognosis and serum creatinine levels in acute renal failure at the time of nephrology consultation: an observational cohort study [^ee828a4c]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute renal failure (ARF) is a life threatening illness with a high mortality despite advances in supportive care. Although there is a strong and direct relation between multiorgan failure and in-hospital mortality, severity of illness does not explain the variation in outcomes among patients with acute renal failure. There is an increased cost in terms of patient prognosis, financial and clinical management. In a study, 30% of patients did not recover completely their renal function and, in other studies, progression to chronic renal failure in many patients is suggested. In regard to these concerns, prompt recognition and early consultation with a nephrologist have been postulated to improve the outcome of patients with acute renal failure. Nevertheless, the published evidence is scarce.

The absence of a consensus definition of ARF has made research about ARF difficult. Recently, the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) published a uniformed definition called the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End Stage) criteria. The RIFLE criteria has been adopted by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN).

Diagnosis of ARF based upon changes in serum creatinine may be delayed due to the fact that, in the non-steady-state conditions of ARF, as GFR falls creatinine secretion is increased. Large changes in GFR are initially manifested as small quantitative changes in serum creatinine in the first 24–48 hours after renal injury. After these one or two days, the degree of serum creatinine changes will reflect the change in GFR. Finally, the serum creatinine is stabilized, and that takes about 7 days. Therefore, it is almost impossible to exactly determine the onset of the ARF; and also calculating the exact time lapsed until the nephrology consultation. However, measuring serum creatinine level is a practical approach for discovering short-term alteration in renal function, despite its limitations, because it is readily used in clinical practice and it is specific for renal function. In patients with stable renal function, those levels are constant, with a daily variability of 8%, so increasing levels might suggest the first stage of ARF.

We conducted this study to identify and quantify a correlation between acute serum creatinine changes in ARF, measuring them at the time of nephrology consultation, and mortality and recovery of renal function. We hypothesized that, at the same levels of severity of renal and comorbid illnesses, the higher the acute serum creatinine reached with respect to its baseline, before the nephrologist first began to treat the patient, the worse the outcome will be.

### GFR estimating equations: getting closer to the truth? [^13e443dd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The application of serum creatinine and cystatin C in patients with CKD has been limited to using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Criteria for choosing the best GFR estimating equation are 1) accuracy in estimating measured GFR, 2) optimal discrimination of clinical outcomes, and 3) association with CKD risk factors and outcomes similar to that of measured GFR. Notably, these criteria are often not in agreement; and while the last criterion is the most important, it has been widely overlooked. The primary problem with eGFR is that the non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine and cystatin C, as well as their surrogates (age, sex, and race), associate with CKD risk factors and outcomes. This leads to a distorted understanding of CKD, though eGFR based on serum creatinine appears to be less biased than eGFR based on cystatin C. Because of this problem, the use of eGFR should be limited to settings where knowing actual GFR is relevant and eGFR is more informative about GFR than serum creatinine or cystatin C alone. Such settings include staging CKD severity by GFR and dosing medications cleared by glomerular filtration. Alternatively, the diagnosis of CKD, the longitudinal progression of CKD, and prognostic models for CKD are settings where serum creatinine and cystatin C can be better applied and interpreted without eGFR.

### Screening for kidney diseases: older measures versus novel biomarkers [^3c6ae661]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been used to screen for kidney disease since creatinine was recognized to be correlated with renal function. The measurement of serum creatinine as a screening test for kidney disease falls short, however, because serum creatinine is not particularly sensitive for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Creatinine reflects renal filtering capacity, which has a lot of reserve and is therefore not sensitive to acute or chronic kidney injury unless the injury is substantial enough to compromise the filtering ability. The sensitivity of serum creatinine is further diminished in certain patient populations that are prone to kidney disease because of the physiology of creatinine. Therefore, researchers are seeking new biomarkers that can aid in the diagnosis of both acute and chronic kidney diseases. The limitations of creatinine in screening for kidney diseases in specific patient populations as well as new potential biomarkers that are actively being researched are discussed in this review.

### Serum creatinine and serum cystatin C as an index of muscle mass in adults [^0e6cad9e]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Serum creatinine reflects both muscle mass and kidney function. Serum cystatin C has recently been recommended as an additional marker for estimating kidney function, and use of both markers together may provide an index of muscle mass. This review aims to describe the biological basis for and recent research examining the relationship of these markers to muscle mass in a range of adult populations and settings.

Recent Findings

This review identified 67 studies, 50 of which had direct measures of muscle mass, and almost all found relationships between serum creatinine and cystatin C and muscle mass and related outcomes. Most studies have been performed in older adults, but similar associations were found in general populations as well as in subgroups with cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other morbid conditions. Creatinine to cystatin C ratio was the measure examined the most often, but other measures showed similar associations across studies.

Summary

Measures of serum creatinine and cystatin C together can be an index of muscle mass. They are simple and reliable measures that can be used in clinical practice and research. Further study is needed to determine actionable threshold values for each measure and clinical utility of testing and intervention.

### Effects of non-severe acute kidney injury on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [^d8239c15]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1
Relationship between urine output and serum creatinine criteria and clinical outcomes

Another limitation to the KDIGO staging system is that duration of AKI is not considered. Although even short episodes of AKI are associated with adverse outcomes, persistent AKI is clearly worse. AKI may also appear less severe because serum creatinine is affected by disease severity. Creatinine is formed from non-enzymatic dehydration of creatine in the liver, and 98% of the creatine pool is in muscle. Thus, conditions which increase muscle breakdown may increase creatinine generation whereas conditions that reduce muscle mass, muscle perfusion, and liver function may decrease creatinine generation. Fluid overload may result in artificial lowering of the serum creatinine level and misclassification of AKI staging. Finally, we should not forget that in patients with normal baseline renal function a clinical AKI event already represents substantial loss of kidney function. This is because the kidney has significant renal functional reserve such that more than 50% of renal functional capacity must be lost before serum creatinine increases. AKI biomarkers may be useful in closing this diagnostic gap. Some markers appear to be sensitive to "subclinical AKI", whereas other markers appear to predict long-term outcomes, such as death or dialysis, only when patients develop clinical AKI.

For example, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) have been associated with 9-month incidence of a composite end point of all-cause mortality or the need for RRT in critically ill adults. In univariate analysis, [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] of more than 2.0 was associated with increased risk of the composite end point (hazard ratio (HR) 2.11, 95% CI 1.37–3.23; P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis adjusted for the clinical model, [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] of more than 0.3 was associated with death or RRT only in subjects who developed AKI (compared with levels of not more than 0.3: HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.00–2.06 for levels of more than 0.3 to 2.0, P = 0.05; and HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.32–3.53 for levels of more than 2.0, P = 0.002).

### Age-adapted eGFR thresholds underestimate the risks beyond kidney failure associated with CKD in older populations [^229ec631]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Serum creatinine alone overestimatesand underestimates risk in older adults

The most important determinants of serum creatinine at normal GFR are muscle mass and physical activity. Muscle mass and function both decline at older age, even in healthy individuals.eGFRcr equations includes an adjustment for age and sex, but incompletely account for differences in "average" loss of muscle mass with age: the populations in which the most popular equations were developed primarily included male participants in middle age. Due to lower muscle mass and function with increasing age, serum creatinine therefore tends to overestimate GFR (and underestimate CKD)in older people.

Given the challenges of using serum creatinine alone in equations to estimate kidney function in older adults, international guidelines suggest additional, confirmatory testing for CKD using cystatin C. Cystatin C is the most widely studied alternative to serum creatinine for estimating kidney function, but is not currently widely used, primarily due to differences in cost and availability. Cystatin C is more expensive than serum creatinine: £2.50 (US $3) compared to £0.25 (US $0.30). However, with calls for wider implementation of cystatin C testing, costs may fall due to economies of scale and it may become more practical for smaller laboratories to offer this test routinely. Cystatin C has also been criticized as a marker of kidney function: serum levels may also be influenced by inflammation, obesity, diabetes, smoking and thyroid disease, and eGFRcys may also capture aspects of cardiometabolic risk not directly related to kidney function. However, eGFR based on cystatin C offers a more accurate estimate of GFR than serum creatinine around the threshold for CKD diagnosis (60 ml/min/1.73 m 2). In older populations specifically, both eGFRcr‐cys and eGFRcys have been shown to be superior to eGFRcr for GFR estimation, and they improve classification of CKD across a threshold of 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2.

### Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5b5c5a13]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis included 5 studies (comprising 8 outcome measures) with a total of 220 participants to evaluate serum creatinine levels, and 3 studies involving 136 participants to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The present systematic review and meta-analysis included a larger body of evidence, incorporating 21 studies in total of which 12 (comprising 14 outcome measures) were eligible for quantitative synthesis of serum creatinine outcomes and 5 for GFR. This expanded dataset provides more comprehensive insights into the renal safety of creatine supplementation across diverse populations, supplementation protocols, and durations. GFR is considered the best overall indicator of renal function in both healthy individuals and patients with kidney disease. Current clinical guidelines highlight that GFR reflects the integrated function of all nephrons and is therefore a more reliable index of renal health than isolated blood or urine markers. Stable GFR values are clinically more important than transient elevations in serum creatinine or other biomarkers, which may be influenced by extrarenal factors such as muscle mass, diet, or supplementation.

### Creatinine and cystatin C: what are the values? [^c092bbdd]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies indicate that serum cystatin C is a better marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality than serum creatinine. Before cystatin C can gain wide acceptance, information about factors that affect generation, elimination, and analysis is needed. Stevens et al. analyze non-GFR-related factors associated with cystatin C and creatinine levels. The results will be useful in interpreting cystatin C levels in research and clinical practice.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^71a88ff0]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine — The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is widely accepted as the best overall index of kidney function, yet GFR is difficult to measure and is commonly estimated from serum creatinine (SCr). In observational data, an increase of SCr of > 0.3 mg/dl (> 26.5 μmol/l) was independently associated with mortality, and in a cardiac surgery cohort either an increase of SCr of > 0.5 mg/dl (> 44.2 μmol/l) or a decrease > 0.3 mg/dl (> 26.5 μmol/l) was associated with worse survival. These findings support the consistent conclusion that decreased kidney function is independently associated with outcome, and that more severe reductions in kidney function tend to be associated with even worse outcomes as compared to milder reductions.

### Creatinine kinetics and the definition of acute kidney injury [^10ecf4e3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and devastating medical condition, but no widely accepted definition exists. A recent classification system by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (RIFLE) defines AKI largely by percentage increases in serum creatinine (SCr) over baseline. The Acute Kidney Injury Network defines the first stage by either an absolute or a percentage increase in SCr. To examine the implications of various definitions, we solved differential equations on the basis of mass balance principles. We simulated creatinine kinetics after AKI in the setting of normal baseline kidney function and stages 2, 3, and 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). The percentage changes in SCr after severe AKI are highly dependent on baseline kidney function. Twenty-four hours after a 90% reduction in creatinine clearance, the rise in SCr was 246% with normal baseline kidney function, 174% in stage 2 CKD, 92% in stage 3 CKD, and only 47% in stage 4 CKD. By contrast, the absolute increase was nearly identical (1.8 to 2.0 mg/dl) across the spectrum of baseline kidney function. Time to reach a 50% increase in SCr was directly related to baseline kidney function: From 4 h (normal baseline) up to 27 h for stage 4 CKD. By contrast, the time to reach a 0.5-mg/dl increase in SCr was virtually identical after moderate to severe AKI (> 50% reduction in creatinine clearance). We propose an alternative definition of AKI that incorporates absolute changes in SCr over a 24- to 48-h time period.

### Non-linear relationship between urinary creatinine and diabetic kidney disease: implications for clinical practice [^9e1fa458]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

DKD remains one of the most common and concerning complications of T2DM, posing significant challenges to patient management and quality of life. The findings of this study highlight the potential importance of UCr as an early biomarker for the detection and assessment of DKD risk. Our results demonstrate a significant association between UCr levels and the occurrence and severity of DKD, emphasizing its clinical relevance in routine diabetes care.

We observed a non-linear relationship between UCr levels and DKD, suggesting that UCr may serve as an early alert signal for renal dysfunction in patients with T2DM. Specifically, the likelihood of developing DKD seems to decrease when UCr levels are below the threshold of 17,421 µmol/L, indicating that UCr may reflect the compensatory function of the kidneys. However, when UCr levels exceed this threshold, there is a positive correlation with DKD progression, suggesting that increased creatinine excretion may indicate potential tubular dysfunction and renal stress. This finding is particularly important, as early intervention is crucial for slowing the progression of kidney damage and improving patient outcomes.

### The validity of drug effects on proteinuria, albuminuria, serum creatinine, and estimated GFR as surrogate end points for ESKD: a systematic review [^e6a7554c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Proteinuria, albuminuria, and serum creatinine level are widely used as surrogate end point measures of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We evaluated the correlation between antihypertensive drug effects on surrogate renal end points and ESKD.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Setting & Participants

Randomized controlled trials of blood pressure-lowering therapy.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Trials of pharmacological blood pressure-lowering strategies reporting drug effects on albuminuria, proteinuria, or serum creatinine level and ESKD through March 26, 2018.

Analytical Approach

Bayesian bivariate meta-analysis to calculate correlations between drug effects on surrogate end points and drug effects on ESKD. Risks of bias were adjudicated using the Cochrane tool.

Results

22 randomized controlled trials involving 69,642 participants were eligible. Risks of bias in the included trials were frequently unclear due to incomplete reporting. Relative risk for ESKD was statistically significant in 1 of 29 (3.4%) treatment comparisons. There appeared to be little or no correlation between antihypertensive drug effects on serum creatinine level, albuminuria, proteinuria, and the corresponding effects on ESKD. All correlations had wide 95% credible intervals that included the null effect.

Limitations

Low power due to infrequent outcomes of ESKD and incomplete data reporting in primary trials.

Conclusions

The association between antihypertensive drug effects on doubling of serum creatinine level and albuminuria or proteinuria with ESKD in treatment trials is not sufficiently certain to enable the confident use of these markers to guide clinical or regulatory decision making.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^18733109]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting an estimated 37 million adults in the United States, presents a significant global health challenge. CKD is typically assessed using estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which incorporates serum levels of biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C. However, these biomarkers do not directly measure kidney function; their elevation in CKD results from diminished glomerular filtration. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on eGFR formulas using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) have identified distinct non-overlapping loci, raising questions about whether these loci govern kidney function or biomarker metabolism. In this study, we show that GWAS on creatinine and cystatin C levels in healthy individuals reveal both nonoverlapping genetic loci impacting their metabolism as well as overlapping genetic loci associated with kidney function; whereas GWAS on elevated levels of these biomarkers uncover novel loci primarily associated with kidney function in CKD patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^85045b73]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) definition — small changes in serum creatinine: The AKIN definition was based on evidence that minor fluctuations in serum creatinine concentration were strongly associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized individuals, with the association remaining, albeit attenuated, after multivariate adjustment. Subsequent studies have identified small changes in serum creatinine to be prognostically important, and even a 0.1-mg/dL increase appears to be associated with increased risk compared to no change. However, whether these small changes reflect clinically meaningful kidney function fluctuations or are merely markers of underlying conditions remains unresolved, and an implicit assumption is that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in an individual is constant over time and not subject to physiologic fluctuation.

### Albuminuria, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate as predictors of cardio-renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and kidney disease: a systematic literature review [^703e734d]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Several publications identified in this review demonstrated that patients with T2DM may present with low eGFR yet be normo-albuminuric. In this context, normo-albuminuric low eGFR has been reported to be more prevalent among older women, with these patients often exhibiting a more diverse set of clinical characteristics compared with those who present with low eGFR and higher concentrations of albuminuria. Additionally, renal biomarkers are known to be influenced by clinical features such as age, gender, and genetic disparities, as well as modifiable factors. To this end, distinct sets of risk factors have been confirmed on the background of low eGFR, and separately for increased albuminuria, making it challenging to disentangle whether changes in these biomarkers are complementary of other underlying pathophysiological conditions not linked to kidney disease, or whether they truly reflect important markers of kidney disease development and progression in T2DM. Moving forward, other avenues of research appear warranted that will focus on assessing the predictive value of albuminuria, eGFR and other renal markers for kidney disease end points according to relevant subsets of conventional risk factors (i.e. age, race, or sex-specific disparities) in people with T2DM.

The findings from this SLR illustrated that the risk of kidney function decline and related outcomes tended to vary depending on which biomarker was studied. The available findings demonstrated that the risk as well as the onset of kidney function decline appeared to occur sooner in patients with T2DM who demonstrated an increase in albuminuria, or in the presence of a diminished eGFR over time, and that use of the two biomarkers combined had better predictive ability over time than either alone; although data were sparse. For this reason, studies incorporating these biomarkers in tandem, and their relationship with cardio-renal outcomes, would likely enrich our understanding of the numerous pathways involved in provoking renal impairment, especially given the high individual variability that often accompanies these biomarkers. To further improve prediction based on these studied biomarkers, standardized measures are also needed, as well as more reliable reporting of baseline kidney function and outcomes, particularly for kidney disease progression. Such standardizations will facilitate understanding of the clinical utility of albuminuria and serum creatinine as predictive biomarkers for kidney disease progression as well as related renal and CV outcomes and mortality risk among patients with T2DM, with the risk perhaps differing among select subgroups.

### Predictive performance of renal function equations for patients with chronic kidney disease and normal serum creatinine levels [^404e5fb8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Accurate renal function measurements are important for the diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease, proper medication dosing, interpretation of possible uremic symptoms, and decision-making regarding when to initiate renal replacement therapy. Because the use of highly accurate filtration markers to measure renal function has traditionally been limited by cumbersome and costly techniques and the involvement of radioactivity (among other factors), renal function is typically estimated by using specially derived prediction equations. These formulae usually use serum creatinine levels, i.e., a marker of filtration that is insensitive to mild/moderate decreases in GFR. Although attempts have been made to validate certain renal function prediction equations among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with abnormal serum creatinine levels, this is the first study to specifically evaluate the predictive performance of these equations for patients with CKD and serum creatinine levels in the normal range. The results of eight prediction equations for 109 patients with CKD and serum creatinine levels of ≤ 1.5 mg/dl were compared with standard iohexol GFR values. The most accurate results were obtained with the Cockroft-Gault and Bjornsson equations. The most precise formulae were the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equations, although they were highly biased. Even the most accurate results exhibited levels of error that made them suboptimal for clinical treatment of these patients. These results suggest that measurement of GFR with endogenous or exogenous filtration markers might be the most prudent strategy for the assessment of renal function in the CKD population with normal serum creatinine levels. Further studies are needed to confirm the generalizability of these findings for this patient subgroup.

### How best to estimate glomerular filtration rate? Novel filtration markers and their application [^b28217d0]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease is an increasing health burden. Estimating equations using serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C facilitate the assessment of kidney function as reflected in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Reduced eGFR is associated with increased risk for numerous adverse outcomes and is an important aspect in many clinical situations. However, current equations are suboptimal in some clinical settings. The review focuses on approaches to improve the estimation of GFR and aims to familiarize the reader with the underlying methodological hypotheses how new markers could contribute to improve the overall performance of estimating equations.

Recent Findings

Low molecular weight proteins such as β-trace-protein and β-2-microglobulin, as well as newly discovered metabolites, show promise as new filtration markers, as they might be beneficial in populations in which creatinine or cystatin C are inaccurate. We propose that the combination of multiple novel markers, alone or in combination with creatinine, cystatin C or demographics, can potentially improve GFR estimation. For special populations such as dialysis patients, separate equations have been developed to estimate residual kidney function.

Summary

Current GFR estimating equations are an essential part of routine clinical practice but have limitations. The use of multiple markers combined in a single equation appears to be the most promising approach. Future research is required to validate proposed equations in diverse populations.

### Impact of the estimation equation for GFR on population-based prevalence estimates of kidney dysfunction [^6204bee4]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined by morphological and functional damage to the kidney. Clinical assessment of kidney function is central to the routine clinical practice and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best overall index-indicator of excretory kidney function in health and disease. In the epidemiological setting, decreased kidney function may be defined by a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2. As directly measuring GFR is often cumbersome in routine clinical practice, researchers have developed and validated several GFR estimating equations that include demographic and clinical variables as surrogates for muscle mass and unmeasured factors that affect serum creatinine level, such as age, sex and race. Some of these equations are meanwhile recommended by clinical guidelines as the preferred method for assessment of GFR in the routine clinical care.

### Kidney function estimating equations: where do we stand? [^b82eac89]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the diagnosis, evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. This review summarizes recent data on the performance of equations using serum creatinine to estimate the GFR, particularly the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation.

Recent Findings

During 2005 GFR estimation has received substantial attention with a focus on comparing the MDRD Study equation with the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Several large studies (n > 500) have appeared. Most studies discuss creatinine calibration but few were able to standardize measurements. Studies that did calibrate the creatinine had improved performance. Overall, the MDRD Study equation performed well in populations with a low range of GFR and often outperformed the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Both equations have lower precision in high GFR populations, and the MDRD equation under-estimated the GFR in a number of studies. Efforts are underway to develop improved prediction equations by pooling data across many study populations.

Summary

Equations for estimating the GFR from serum creatinine are useful for systematic staging of chronic kidney disease. The MDRD Study equation and systematic creatinine assay calibration improve the level of precision and accuracy in many settings. GFR estimates are less useful in the normal range of GFR, however, and are sensitive to the population under study.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate and renal function [^5ccdac3b]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is an important clinical indicator of kidney function. It can be used as an independent predictor of long-term survival after cardiac surgery. Definition, methods of measurement, and corrected value by body surface area are briefly introduced in this paper. Details of the calculation of estimated GFR (eGFR) by Levey's formula with serum creatinine, age, gender, and race are offered. The relationship between estimated GFR and the four factors is shown graphically and discussed. An eGFR/creatinine conversion table for individual patients derived from the eGFR equation with clinically significant cutpoints is given, which can be used by physicians as a pragmatic reference.

Objective

The objective of this article is to review and evaluate the various parameters used in determining renal status.

Conclusion

The physiologic determination of renal status is the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR). Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and estimated GFR (eGFR), based on serum creatinine have failed to replace mGFR. All physicians should be aware of limitations of substituted mGFR.

### GFR decline and subsequent risk of established kidney outcomes: a meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials [^62f3d00b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The currently established end points for clinical trials of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine level, which approximates a 57% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). There is increased interest in using alternative end points in clinical trials to shorten trial duration and reduce sample size. As part of an evaluation of using lesser declines in GFR as alternative end points, we examined the associations of various levels of eGFR decline with the subsequent development of established end points and assess the consistency of alternate levels of eGFR decline across varying clinical manifestations of kidney disease and interventions.

Study Design

Observational analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Setting & Participants

9,488 participants in 37 randomized controlled trials in CKD.

Predictor

Alternative end points, defined as 30% and 40% declines in eGFR from baseline to month 12. Effect modification by baseline eGFR, proteinuria, cause of disease, and interventions.

Outcomes

Established end point, defined as end-stage renal disease, eGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m(2), or doubling of serum creatinine level.

Results

From baseline to 12 months, 16.1% and 7.8% of participants had eGFR declines of ≥ 30% or ≥ 40%, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 2.0 (IQR, 1.2–3.1) years after the 12-month baseline period, 2,661 established end points were observed. A strong linear association was observed between eGFR decline and subsequent established end points. HRs for the established end point for 30% and 40% decreases in eGFR compared to a 0% decline were 9.6 (95% CI, 7.3–12.6) and 20.3 (95% CI, 14.1–29.3), respectively. The associations were consistent regardless of baseline eGFR, proteinuria, causes of disease, and interventions.

Limitations

Observational study subject to residual confounding.

Conclusions

The strong associations between lesser declines in eGFR and the subsequent development of established end points were consistent across different clinical characteristics of kidney disease and interventions and support implementation of alternative end points in clinical trials of CKD progression.

### Serum creatinine levels are significantly influenced by renal size in the normal pediatric population [^92780cad]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Clinical and experimental data have shown that differences in nephron endowment result in differences in renal mass and predisposition to chronic renal failure, hypertension, and proteinuria. We hypothesized that a significant proportion of the variance in GFR, as estimated by serum creatinine, is attributable to differences in renal size in normal children.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A total of 1748 normal renal ultrasounds that were performed in children older than 6 months were reviewed. For each ultrasound, serum creatinine, serum blood urea nitrogen, and systolic and diastolic office BP were recorded. Renal size was evaluated as a function of renal length and thickness. All data were normalized for height, weight, age, and gender.

Results

When expressed as SD scores, a significant correlation was found between kidney size and serum creatinine (P < 0.0001) and between kidney size and serum blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.002). When dividing kidney size data per quintiles, a difference of 0.51 SD score in serum creatinine was observed between the lowest and highest quintile. No significant correlation was found with office BP measurements.

Conclusions

These data show that, even in the normal pediatric population, differences in renal function are significantly explained by differences in renal mass. Methodologic limitations of this study are likely to underestimate this relationship.

### Albuminuria, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate as predictors of cardio-renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and kidney disease: a systematic literature review [^75f77ed6]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Albuminuria, elevated serum creatinine and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are pivotal indicators of kidney decline. Yet, it is uncertain if these and emerging biomarkers such as uric acid represent independent predictors of kidney disease progression or subsequent outcomes among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study systematically examined the available literature documenting the role of albuminuria, serum creatinine, eGFR, and uric acid in predicting kidney disease progression and cardio-renal outcomes in persons with T2DM.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Trials Register and Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for relevant studies from January 2000 through May 2016. PubMed was searched from 2013 until May 2016 to retrieve studies not yet indexed in the other databases. Observational cohort or non-randomized longitudinal studies relevant to albuminuria, serum creatinine, eGFR, uric acid and their association with kidney disease progression, non-fatal cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality as outcomes in persons with T2DM, were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers screened citations to ensure studies met inclusion criteria.

Results

From 2249 citations screened, 81 studies were retained, of which 39 were omitted during the extraction phase (cross-sectional [n = 16]; no outcome/measure of interest [n = 13]; not T2DM specific [n = 7]; review article [n = 1]; editorial [n = 1]; not in English language [n = 1]). Of the remaining 42 longitudinal study publications, biomarker measurements were diverse, with seven different measures for eGFR and five different measures for albuminuria documented. Kidney disease progression differed substantially across 31 publications, with GFR loss (n = 9 [29.0%]) and doubling of serum creatinine (n = 5 [16.1%]) the most frequently reported outcome measures. Numerous publications presented risk estimates for albuminuria (n = 18), serum creatinine/eGFR (n = 13), or both combined (n = 6), with only one study reporting for uric acid. Most often, these biomarkers were associated with a greater risk of experiencing clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Despite the utility of albuminuria, serum creatinine, and eGFR as predictors of kidney disease progression, further efforts to harmonize biomarker measurements are needed given the disparate methodologies observed in this review. Such efforts would help better establish the clinical significance of these and other biomarkers of renal function and cardio-renal outcomes in persons with T2DM.

### Effect of N-acetylcysteine on serum creatinine and kidney function: results of a randomized controlled trial [^2d37046a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence for a protective effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on acute and chronic kidney disease is equivocal, and controversy persists about whether NAC affects creatinine level independently of actual kidney function. Study objectives are to investigate whether NAC affects serum creatinine level independently of alterations in other measures of kidney function.

Study Design

Double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (n = 60), Canada, 2007–2008.

Intervention

Participants were randomly allocated to receive 4 doses of oral NAC (each 1,200 mg) or placebo, administered at 12-hour intervals.

Outcome

The primary outcome was change in serum creatinine level between baseline and 4 hours after the last treatment dose. In addition, changes in other parameters of kidney function were measured between baseline and 4, 24, or 48 hours after the last treatment dose.

Measurements

Serum creatinine, cystatin C, 24-hour urine protein and creatinine excretion, and creatinine clearance.

Results

60 patients, mean age of 70 years, 75% men, 50% had diabetes, with mean creatinine clearance of 43.7 ± 18.8 (SD) mL/min were enrolled. Between baseline and 4 hours posttreatment, serum creatinine level decreased by 0.044 ± 0.15 mg/dL in the NAC group and 0.040 ± 0.18 mg/dL in the placebo group (95% CI for difference, -0.09 to 0.08; P = 0.9). No significant differences between groups were observed for change in serum creatinine, cystatin C, urine protein, urine creatinine, or creatinine clearance values at any time.

Limitations

Blinding patients to orally administered liquid NAC is difficult and it is possible that patients receiving NAC were not sufficiently blinded. Effects of NAC beyond 48 hours of treatment were not evaluated.

Conclusions

In this randomized controlled trial, NAC had no short-term effect on creatinine level and did not decrease urine protein excretion within 48 hours of treatment.

### Determinants of the creatinine clearance to glomerular filtration rate ratio in patients with chronic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^f3575ed1]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical practice and research studies, kidney function is most often estimated using concentration of serum creatinine, an endogenous filtration marker. This is based on the assumption that creatinine clearance (CrCl) approximates GFR. In considering the limitations of serum creatinine-based estimates of glomerula filtration rate (GFR), much attention has been given to problems stemming from variations in creatinine production which may be reduced as a result of factors such as malnutrition, advanced age or liver disease. Less attention has been given to the fact that creatinine is cleared by the kidneys not only by filtration but also by tubular secretion. So variations in creatinine secretion may introduce another source of error when using serum creatinine concentration to estimate kidney function.

Prior research has shown or suggested that several factors influence the rate of tubular secretion of creatinine which can be quantified as the CrCl/GFR ratio. CrCl/GFR ratio increases as GFR decreases (i.e. tubular secretion plays an increasing important role in renal excretion of creatinine as GFR falls). Other studies have reported that patients with high levels of proteinuria may have high CrCl/GFR ratio. For example, one study reported that patients with nephrotic range proteinuria and low serum albumin had higher tubular secretion of creatinine of 36 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (vs. 24 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for those with less severe nephrotic syndrome). Finally, some studies have suggested that African-American patients may have lower CrCl/GFR ratio than non-African Americans.

However, these prior studies of the relation between CrCl and GFR have been limited by small sample sizes and inclusion of only a limited spectrum of kidney disease (such as only patients with glomerular disease), and lack of calibration of serum creatinine measurements which render results harder to interpret as systemic errors in serum creatinine measurements may lead to higher or lower CrCl values. In addition, some studies quantified urine protein via excretion of total protein rather than albumin. Measurement of total urine protein is not possible to standardize and is increasingly considered a suboptimal meter of renal dysfunction compared with measurement of albuminuria.

To address these knowledge gaps, we explored factors which influence CrCl/GFR ratio in a large diverse cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who had calibrated serum creatinine measurements and quantification of 24-hour urine albumin. We a priori wanted to examine whether greater degree of albuminuria was associated with higher and being non-Hispanic black with lower CrCl/GFR ratio.

KDOQI 2020 — Serum creatinine/creatinine kinetics and body composition in CKD and dialysis summarizes that seven studies examined these relationships across maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and CKD without dialysis; in MHD, one study showed creatinine kinetics correlated with creatinine levels and traditional muscle mass measures, and another three studies found that predialysis, interdialytic change, and weekly creatinine clearances predicted mortality. In PD, creatinine kinetics correlated with other body composition measures in one study, but another found significant differences between creatinine levels and anthropometry for lean body mass/fat-free mass or fat. Evidence in CKD not receiving dialysis was limited to one study, which reported that creatine kinase level correlated with DXA-derived BF percent and fat-free mass (r = 0.47 and r = 0.57, respectively).

### Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^57dbe425]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pooled results of the present meta-analysis revealed a small but statistically significant increase in serum creatinine levels following creatine supplementation. Subgroup analysis by duration of supplementation suggested that short-term (< 1 week) and long-term (> 12 weeks) interventions significantly affected serum creatinine levels. However, supplementation lasting between 1 and 12 weeks was associated with a non-significant increase.

This pattern indicates that intramuscular creatine and its metabolic byproduct, Crn, may rise quickly during the short-term phase (less than one week) of creatine supplementation. Instead of being a sign of renal failure, this early rise is usually pharmacokinetic in nature, a predictable and quantifiable biochemical reaction. This short time frame mostly records the first rise in creatinine levels prior to the onset of physiological adaptation.

The mid-term interval (1–12 weeks) indicates a transitional phase during which the body begins to adjust to increasing creatine intake. Creatine levels start to stabilize, but the system has not yet fully adapted, leading to potential fluctuations in creatinine production. Muscle creatine stores become saturated, creatine metabolism stabilizes, and renal clearance mechanisms may adjust to manage the sustained creatine load. As a result, a small but consistent elevation in serum creatinine may persist and become statistically detectable in longer-duration studies, particularly those with larger sample sizes and lower variability. Importantly, this increase appears to be statistically significant but physiologically benign, reflecting sustained creatine turnover rather than impaired kidney function. Since serum Crn is a metabolite of creatine, its elevation is a predictable physiological response rather than a sign of kidney damage. Therefore, relying solely on serum Crn as a marker of renal function in creatine supplementation studies may be misleading. Supporting this interpretation, the pooled analysis of GFR data from five studies demonstrated no significant changes in either estimated or directly measured GFR following creatine supplementation. This further supports the idea that reported increases in serum creatinine are not symptomatic of diminished renal function.

Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in kidney transplant recipients: serum creatinine measurement remains the most commonly used index of renal allograft function and is reliable for detecting acute changes in kidney function; serum creatinine level at year 1 after transplant is a risk factor for subsequent outcomes and may help manage the frequency of visits; it is less reliable for detecting long-term changes in kidney function in the kidney transplant recipient; formulas to estimate GFR using serum creatinine have been tested in KTRs, but no formula consistently has been shown to be superior to another; in 2005 the definition of CKD was amended to include all KTRs regardless of markers of kidney damage or GFR, and although CKD staging in KTRs is useful progression is much slower in KTRs; renal ultrasound is the preferred imaging study in KTRs.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, choice of test, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize the value and limitations of both estimated and measured GFR, as well as the variability and factors influencing serum creatinine and cystatin C measurements. Take into consideration dietary intake when interpreting serum creatinine levels.

### Non-linear relationship between urinary creatinine and diabetic kidney disease: implications for clinical practice [^461d43a7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Butt et al. emphasized the importance of elevated creatinine levels as a marker of kidney disease progression in diabetic patients, as well as its association with other kidney function markers such as blood urea nitrogen and glomerular filtration rate. Their research supports the significance of urinary creatinine levels as a critical indicator for diagnosing and monitoring DKD, aligning with the necessity for comprehensive metabolic assessments in the management of diabetic patients. Additionally, Zhou et al. explored the application of the urine C-peptide creatinine ratio in assessing β-cell function in T2DM patients under varying kidney function conditions. Although this study did not specifically target DKD, it underscored the role of urinary creatinine in evaluating diabetes-related complications, highlighting the broader relevance of UCr levels in diabetes management.

Furthermore, the statistical association between UCr and DKD underscores its potential value as a screening tool. Given that UCr measurement is relatively simple and non-invasive, regular UCr assessments could enable healthcare providers to identify high-risk patients earlier. Early identification of patients who may benefit from interventions, such as diabetes control, lifestyle modifications, or pharmacotherapy, could mitigate or delay the onset of severe renal complications. While UACR and eGFR are established biomarkers for DKD, our findings highlight the potential complementary role of UCr in clinical practice. UACR primarily reflects glomerular filtration, while eGFR estimates overall kidney function. In contrast, our data suggest that UCr provides additional information, particularly reflecting tubular function, revealing a non-linear relationship with DKD incidence and progression not fully captured by UACR or eGFR alone. The identification of UCr inflection points may enhance early detection of DKD, enabling more timely interventions. A combined approach, using UCr in conjunction with UACR and eGFR, might lead to a more accurate risk stratification and more tailored management strategies. Future studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of incorporating UCr into routine DKD monitoring.

### Renal function assessment in the era of chronic kidney disease: renewed emphasis on renal function centered patient care [^0c0453b8]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic kidney disease is more common than previously appreciated and it is now established as a major independent contributor to mortality. Serum creatinine is known to be an inaccurate reflection of the presence or development of chronic kidney disease. Since urologists frequently treat patients with coexistent chronic kidney disease, we reviewed the merits and limitations of the current methods to estimate renal function, and recent data indicating the importance of optimizing renal function during treatment.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed to evaluate the laboratory, computational and imaging techniques for renal function estimation.

Results

Approximately 30% of elderly patients with normal serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dl or less) have chronic kidney disease based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2). The National Kidney Foundation currently recommends using a creatinine based estimate of glomerular filtration rate (eg Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) and has advocated a standardized classification for chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease has been independently related to morbid cardiac events and all cause mortality in a dose dependent fashion, even after controlling for a variety of potentially confounding factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Many urological interventions can precipitate or exacerbate chronic kidney disease, most notably radical nephrectomy which is greatly overused.

Conclusions

Practicing urologists should be cognizant of current methodologies to diagnose chronic kidney disease and its profound implications. Estimation of renal function is better using a serum creatinine based formula than individual serum creatinine values. Treatment goals should not be limited to avoidance of dialysis, but should also include greater efforts to optimize renal function in all patients and early referral for nephrological consultation.

### Prediction equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate: an update [^481f12de]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The level of glomerular filtration rate can be estimated from the serum creatinine concentration and other easily measured patient variables from prediction equations developed using multivariable regression techniques. Recently, a new equation has been developed from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, which is more accurate than other equations and more accurate than measurement of creatinine clearance. The authors recommend using prediction equations in clinical practice to estimate the level of glomerular filtration rate.

### Urinary kidney injury biomarkers and urine creatinine normalization: a false premise or not? [^676551b5]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Substantial research has focused on the discovery of urinary biomarkers to detect acute kidney injury (AKI) before a rise in serum creatinine. As in chronic kidney diseases, the concentrations of urinary AKI biomarkers have been normalized to urine creatinine concentration to account for creatinine clearance and urine flow. Waikar et al. challenge the assumption that normalization to creatinine clearance in a chronic disease state can be extrapolated to an acute state, in which creatinine clearance is, by definition, changing acutely.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^70fa455e]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications

In routine primary care, most patients starting treatment with an ACEI/ARB have only minor changes in renal function. However, increases in creatinine concentrations of more than 10% after starting ACEI/ARB treatment affect more than 15% of patients and have important implications. We have shown that creatinine increases after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment were associated with cardiorenal risks in a "dose-response" relation, with no distinct cut-off at 30%, as previously suggested. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether ACEI/ARB associated changes in renal function unmask underlying pathophysiology or lead directly to adverse outcomes by causing permanent renal impairment in some patients. In addition, a better understanding of the overall risk-benefit ratio of continuing treatment after loss of kidney function for different prescribing indications is needed. Most importantly, patients with substantial increases in creatinine after starting ACEI/ARB treatment should be recognised as a very high risk group needing close ongoing monitoring. Review is needed of the risks and potential benefits of continuation of drug treatment for the specific prescribing indication for each patient.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to baseline renal function testing, ERBP 2012 guidelines recommend to use the first documented serum creatinine value of the episode as 'baseline' rather than historical creatinine values or a calculated value based on a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min.

### Renal protection in diabetes: lessons from ONTARGET [^029de406]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Assessing the magnitude of renal impairment

Serum creatinine, a commonly used indicator of renal impairment, shows substantial inter-individual variability due to non-renal factors - mainly due to differences in muscle mass. To quantify accurately the degree of dysfunction, measured levels must be adjusted for the effects of age and gender; for example, to provide an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The equation developed for use in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study is now widely used to measure renal function, although it is only valid for an estimated GFR < 60 mL/min (the conventional threshold for chronic kidney disease). To address the limitations of the MDRD equation, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation has been developed that performs better at higher GFRs. Cystatin C levels provide a more accurate measure of early stages of renal impairment, but this approach is currently not widely adopted.

The simplest and most widespread tool for identifying early changes in renal function is the dipstick test for albumin in early morning urine. Normo-albuminuria is conventionally defined as levels < 30 mg/24 hours, microalbuminuria as 30–299 mg/24 hours, and macroalbuminuria as ≥ 300 mg/24 hours. Alternatively, albuminuria may be expressed as a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), macroalbuminuria being ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine. A new definition of total proteinuria and albuminuria has been agreed upon and demonstrated effective (Table 1). This addresses the fallacies associated with the use of the terms "microalbuminuria" and "macroalbuminuria" as being distinct entities. In reality, there is a continuous relationship between albuminuria and cardiovascular and renal outcome, and even low-level albuminuria is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although albuminuria is extensively used to identify renal impairment in patients with diabetes, it is possible to have a low estimated GFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) despite normoalbuminuria. Such individuals, who are typically older, female, hypertensive and have cardiovascular disease, are as likely to experience a cardiovascular event as people with microalbuminuria and an estimated GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Both parameters should be employed to identify accurately all patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Validation of eGFR for detecting associations between serum protein biomarkers and subsequent GFR decline [^6bd26d15]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

eGFR from creatinine, cystatin C, or both has been primarily used in search of biomarkers for GFR decline. Whether the relationships between biomarkers and eGFR decline are similar to associations with measured GFR (mGFR) decline has not been investigated. This study revealed that some biomarkers showed statistically significant different associations with eGFR decline compared with mGFR decline, particularly for eGFR from cystatin C. The findings indicate that non-GFR-related factors, such as age, sex, and body mass index, influence the relationship between biomarkers and eGFR decline. Therefore, the results of biomarker studies using eGFR, particularly eGFRcys, should be interpreted with caution and perhaps validated with mGFR.

Background

Several serum protein biomarkers have been proposed as risk factors for GFR decline using eGFR from creatinine or cystatin C. We investigated whether eGFR can be used as a surrogate end point for measured GFR (mGFR) when searching for biomarkers associated with GFR decline.

Methods

In the Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey, GFR was measured with plasma iohexol clearance in 1627 individuals without diabetes, kidney, or cardiovascular disease at baseline. After 11 years of follow-up, 1409 participants had one or more follow-up GFR measurements. Using logistic regression and interval-censored Cox regression, we analyzed the association between baseline levels of 12 serum protein biomarkers with the risk of accelerated GFR decline and incident CKD for both mGFR and eGFR.

Results

Several biomarkers exhibited different associations with eGFR decline compared with their association with mGFR decline. More biomarkers showed different associations with eGFRcys decline than with eGFRcre decline. Most of the different associations of eGFR decline versus mGFR decline remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, but several were attenuated and not significant after adjusting for the corresponding baseline mGFR or eGFR.

Conclusions

In studies of some serum protein biomarkers, eGFR decline may not be an appropriate surrogate outcome for mGFR decline. Although the differences from mGFR decline are attenuated by adjustment for confounding factors in most cases, some persist. Therefore, proposed biomarkers from studies using eGFR should preferably be validated with mGFR.

### Factors influencing serum cystatin C levels other than renal function and the impact on renal function measurement [^341786c1]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

It is well known that serum creatinine may be used as a marker of renal function only if taking into account factors that influence creatinine production, such as age, gender, and weight. Serum cystatin C has been proposed as a potentially superior marker than serum creatinine, because serum cystatin C level is believed to be produced at a constant rate and not to be affected by such factors. However, there are limited data on factors that may influence serum cystatin C levels, and there are limited data comparing cystatin C-based estimates of renal function with creatinine-based estimates that adjust for such factors, especially in individuals with normal, or mildly reduced, renal function.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of 8058 inhabitants of the city of Groningen, The Netherlands, 28 to 75 years of age. Serum cystatin C and serum creatinine levels were measured, and creatinine clearance was determined from the average of two separate 24-hour urine collections. We performed multivariate analyses to identify factors independently associated with serum cystatin C levels after adjusting for creatinine clearance. Then, partial Spearman correlations were obtained after adjusting for factors that may influence serum cystatin C and creatinine levels. We also compared the goodness-of-fit (R(2)) of different multivariate linear regression models including serum cystatin C level and serum creatinine level for the outcome of creatinine clearance.

Results

Older age, male gender, greater weight, greater height, current cigarette smoking, and higher serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were independently associated with higher serum cystatin C levels after adjusting for creatinine clearance. After adjusting for age, weight, and gender, the partial Spearman correlations between creatinine and, respectively, serum cystatin C level and serum creatinine level were -0.29 (P < 0.001) and -0.42 (P < 0.001), respectively. The R(2) values for serum cystatin C level and serum creatinine level adjusted for age, weight, and gender were 0.38 and 0.42, respectively. The addition of cigarette smoking and serum CRP levels did not improve the R(2) value for the multivariate serum cystatin C-based model.

Conclusion

Serum cystatin C appears to be influenced by factors other than renal function alone. In addition, we found no evidence that multivariate serum cystatin C-based estimates of renal function are superior to multivariate serum creatinine-based estimates.

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^fa823747]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine is measured as a concentration and is therefore affected by variations in volume status. As a result, the diagnosis of AKI may be delayed or missed in patients with significant fluid shifts or fluid overload. This was highlighted in a post-hoc analysis of the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial. It revealed that AKI was unmasked or classified differently in up to 18% of patients after serum creatinine levels were adjusted for net fluid balance and estimated total body water. Affected patients had mortality rates similar to those with AKI that was present before adjustment.

Another important limitation of all creatinine-based definitions of AKI is that they require a reference value to describe "baseline" renal function. Ideally, this value should reflect the patient's steady-state kidney function just before the episode of AKI. However, information on pre-hospital kidney function is not always available so that various surrogate estimates are frequently used. These may include inpatient results or the imputation of values such as back-calculating a baseline creatinine and using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in patients with missing data. Unfortunately, these methods can inflate as well as reduce the true incidence of AKI. At present, there is no standard approach to determining baseline renal function.

Creatinine-based criteria for AKI often do not take into account underlying renal reserve. In patients with normal kidney function, a rise in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl may indeed be due to an important reduction in GFR. In contrast, in patients with underlying CKD, absolute rises in serum creatinine represent variable changes in GFR, and a rise by 0.3 mg/dl may be within the acceptable daily variation and simply reflect an inconsequential change in GFR. This is particularly relevant when diagnosing KDIGO AKI stage 3 which is defined by a rise in serum creatinine to > 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 353.6 μmol/l). A patient with a baseline serum creatinine of 3.9 mg/dl (345 μmol/l) who experiences a creatinine rise by 0.3 mg/dl in 48 h would be classified as having KDIGO AKI stage 3, whereas such a rise would be defined as AKI stage 1 in a patient with normal baseline renal function.

### Measurement and estimation of GFR for use in clinical practice: core curriculum 2021 [^0e5baaa4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is fundamental to clinical practice, public health, and research. The kidney has several critical functions; GFR is used as an overall assessment of these kidney functions. GFR is used to diagnose, stage, and manage chronic kidney disease (CKD); ascertain the prognosis for chronic kidney disease-related events and mortality; and determine drug dosages. GFR is the rate at which the glomerulus filters plasma to produce an ultrafiltrate and can be assessed from clearance or serum levels of filtration markers. Clearance measurements using exogenous filtration markers are difficult to perform in routine clinical practice, so GFR is more commonly estimated through equations based on serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers, most commonly creatinine. These GFR estimates are reasonably accurate, but optimal care for patients may require a confirmatory test for a more accurate GFR assessment. Confirmatory tests currently available include cystatin C-based equations, urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers, or urinary clearance of creatinine. Appreciation of the concept of GFR and methods for optimal assessment in routine practice or special circumstances, and their strengths and limitations, are critical in making judicious use of the available tools.

### How unmeasured muscle mass affects estimated GFR and diagnostic inaccuracy [^d54981d6]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We conclude that serum creatinine and eGFR are flawed estimates of true renal function. Systemic error from unmeasured muscle mass, tubular secretion, and proportional bias are added to imprecision at the extremes of function and muscle mass. The suboptimal ability of creatinine to predict clearance in well-functioning kidneys improved with renal dysfunction, where CKD detection is clinically important. Inaccuracies of CKD-EPI eGFR are inextricably linked to the biology of muscular creatinine generation and its relationship to renal clearance. This cannot be easily solved by mathematical re-expression of another similar formula (without weight). Future advances require a fresh approach to eGFR and more research. Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous filtration marker produced by nucleated cells which is independent of muscle mass, diet sex, and age. Combined creatinine–cystatinC eGFR equations perform better than either marker alone. Panels of multiple markers (e.g. low-molecular-weight proteins or metabolites) or novel non-renal serum markers of muscularity may help. Until then, clinicians should carefully interpret eGFR results with observed muscularity, reserve accurate mGFR or 24-hour creatinine clearance for selected divergent cases, and use old-fashioned clinical judgment for pateints at the extremes of body habitus.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^d355b433]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

In the past, a myriad of definitions for acute renal failure and AKI existed in parallel, making comparison of results difficult. In the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI, definition and staging of AKI is based on a combination of the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Both criteria rely on GFR, and its proxy serum creatinine, and urinary output as the most useful overall indices of acute changes of kidney function. Changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output are used as surrogates for acute changes in kidney function. The recommended diagnostic criteria establish a solid ground for standardized AKI assessment and classification in everyday clinical practice as well as in research conditions. As such, ERBP considers them as a good starting point towards a more standardized approach to AKI definition and particularly for the assessment of the predictive power of AKI with respect to overall and renal outcome (staging of severity). However, ERBP wants to update and fine-tune the classification by specifically underscoring and more extensively clarifying (i) the need to use the first available (admission) serum creatinine in that episode as baseline creatinine; and (ii) draw attention to the fact that urinary volume should be expressed using ideal body weight rather than real body weight when calculating the urinary output in mL/min/kg. ERBP also felt that it was necessary to explicitly state that both criteria should be applied to classify patients. Indeed, after publication of the RIFLE criteria, it became rapidly apparent that different interpretations were still given to 'baseline creatinine', and that the urinary output criterion was either omitted, or calculated on 24-h urine output. For baseline creatinine, some authors suggested using an estimation of serum creatinine, by backward calculation from a presumed 'standard GFR' of 75 mL/min/1.73 m²; others suggested using the last known value. This concept of a 'universal baseline' clashes with the current epidemiology of AKI, where an important subpopulation do not start from 'normal renal function', but do already have underlying CKD. Siew et al. demonstrated that the use of the value at admission in the episode under consideration was best associated with risk. Also in the AKIN criteria, the intention is to use the evolution of serum creatinine relative to the first observed value in that episode. It was demonstrated that using admission creatinine rather than estimated creatinine from a presumed GFR of 75 mL/min improved the prediction of need for renal replacement therapy and mortality, and decreased misclassification. ERBP wants to stress that the use of estimated GFR (eGFR), using whatever formula, is obsolete in patients with AKI, as all these formulae presume that kidney function is stable, and markers of GFR are in steady state, which is of course contradictory with the fact that patients have AKI.

Initial assessment recommendation and caveats — Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR. For most clinical circumstances, estimating GFR from SCr is appropriate; equations are available that estimate GFR using SCr and adjusting for sex and age, and professional societies have recommended that GFR estimates should be used in association with SCr reporting; key sources of error include non–steady-state conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with creatinine assays, and GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levels, so healthcare providers should remain aware of caveats that may influence accuracy in an individual person.

### Cardiovascular disease and subsequent kidney disease… [^285ddafb]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Study outcomes included kidney function decline, defined by an increase in serum creatinine level of at least 0. 4 mg/dL, and development of kidney disease, defined by an increase in serum creatinine level of at least
0. 4 mg/dL in which the baseline serum creatinine level was less than 1. 4 mg/dL in men and less than

1. 2 mg/dL in women and the final serum creatinine levels exceeded these levels. In serum creatinine level–based models, 520 individuals experienced kidney function decline, and 314 individuals developed kidney disease during a mean ± SD of 9. 3 ±
0. 9 years of follow-up. The study outcomes of kidney function decline and development of kidney disease were investigated using a serum creatinine level–based definition and an eGFR-based definition.

In serum creatinine level–based models, kidney function decline was defined by a serum creatinine level increase between the first and last visits of at least 0. 4 mg/dL, as this value was above that which could be explained by chance and was above that used previously in the CHS18 to define a decline in kidney function. Our study demonstrates that CVD is associated with subsequent kidney function decline and development of kidney disease. This association persisted after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics and remained robust in multiple analyses using serum creatinine level and eGFR to assess kidney function. Although several studies9, 12, 16 have evaluated epidemiological risk factors for progression of kidney disease, to our knowledge, this is the first community-based study that has demonstrated that CVD is independently associated with kidney function decline and with development of kidney disease.

In summary, the present study demonstrates that CVD is independently associated with kidney function decline and with development of kidney disease. Further studies using other markers for kidney damage, such as proteinuria level, will be needed to confirm this association. This study identifies a population that may benefit from increased CVD risk factor surveillance and intervention, heightened awareness of the risk factors associated with kidney disease, and greater attention to and treatment for sequelae of kidney disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^8a94b1f7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

### A clinician's guide to monitoring kidney function in lithium-treated patients [^9c124d81]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar disorder treatment guidelines recommend kidney-function monitoring at regular intervals for patients taking lithium, but they tend not to provide specifics with regard to what to measure and how to ensure that the results most accurately reflect true kidney function. This overview clarifies those practical aspects of monitoring that are often overlooked or misunderstood.

Data Sources

Utilized English language materials were obtained by PubMed searches (1970–2009), from the Lithium Information Center database, and from books. Search terms included lithium, kidney function, creatinine, creatinine clearance, GFR, GFR prediction equations, albuminuria, and urine concentration.

Data Synthesis

Urine osmolality most accurately reflects urine concentrating ability, although specific gravity is usually adequate for clinical purposes. Serum creatinine concentration can be influenced by extrarenal factors, but even when these are controlled, it remains a less than ideal measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Prediction equations are used commonly to estimate GFR and are an advance over serum creatinine alone, but even they are not as useful when GFR is only mildly impaired. Urine albumin measurement is important, but it requires greater standardization and sensitivity to maximize its potential.

Conclusions

The safe and effective use of lithium requires regular monitoring of kidney function. Doing so effectively requires knowledge of what to measure, how to ensure accurate results, and how to properly interpret them.

### Cystatin C versus creatinine in determining risk based on kidney function [^05822db6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Adding the measurement of cystatin C to that of serum creatinine to determine the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) improves accuracy, but the effect on detection, staging, and risk classification of chronic kidney disease across diverse populations has not been determined.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of 11 general-population studies (with 90,750 participants) and 5 studies of cohorts with chronic kidney disease (2960 participants) for whom standardized measurements of serum creatinine and cystatin C were available. We compared the association of the eGFR, as calculated by the measurement of creatinine or cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine, with the rates of death (13,202 deaths in 15 cohorts), death from cardiovascular causes (3471 in 12 cohorts), and end-stage renal disease (1654 cases in 7 cohorts) and assessed improvement in reclassification with the use of cystatin C.

Results

In the general-population cohorts, the prevalence of an eGFR of less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area was higher with the cystatin C-based eGFR than with the creatinine-based eGFR (13.7% vs. 9.7%). Across all eGFR categories, the reclassification of the eGFR to a higher value with the measurement of cystatin C, as compared with creatinine, was associated with a reduced risk of all three study outcomes, and reclassification to a lower eGFR was associated with an increased risk. The net reclassification improvement with the measurement of cystatin C, as compared with creatinine, was 0.23 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.28) for death and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.21) for end-stage renal disease. Results were generally similar for the five cohorts with chronic kidney disease and when both creatinine and cystatin C were used to calculate the eGFR.

Conclusions

The use of cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine strengthens the association between the eGFR and the risks of death and end-stage renal disease across diverse populations. (Funded by the National Kidney Foundation and others.).

### Serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term outcomes… [^73098c6e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures All-cause mortality in the year following the index hospitalization and end-stage kidney disease in the 10 years following the index hospitalization. Results. The highest risk was noted in patients who presented to the hospital with an eGFR of 0 to 45 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study suggest that patients who present with decreased kidney function and are discharged without clinically evident residual kidney disease may be at increased long-term risk for ESKD and mortality. Indeed, worsening kidney function was also noted to be a predictor of increased mortality, even when not meeting the definition of AKI. 12–15 Givertz et al14 examined data from 1962 patients with acute heart failure and kidney dysfunction from the PROTECT study. In this analysis, an increase of more than 0.

1 mg/dL per day in serum creatinine levels increased mortality risk, whereas stable or decreasing creatinine levels were associated with reduced risk. To ensure sufficient kidney function changes, we still required at least a 15% improvement in creatinine levels for the low-to-normal group. The study population was described in terms of sociodemographic variables, physical measurements, and background medical conditions. Appropriate statistical tests were selected for each variable. Crude survival curves for each outcome were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, stratified by the exposure, and compared using the log-rank test. This increased risk persisted after adjusting for confounders; stratifying by age groups, sex, background disease, and treatment with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers; and when allowing a different baseline HR across age groups.

It was not altered by adjusting for discharge eGFR, and we did not observe temporal trends. These results suggest that patients who present with decreased kidney function and are discharged without clinically evident residual kidney disease are at increased long-term risk of ESKD. A possible explanation for our findings is that an observed decrease in kidney function during hospitalization might reveal an existing decreased kidney reserve, unmasked by the stress of acute illness. 29 Even though kidney function may seem to be recovered at discharge, the persistent reduction in kidney reserve could have long-term implications. Setting the threshold for normal kidney function at an eGFR of 90 mL/min/1. 73 m2 revealed no associations with 1-year mortality, implying that more substantial kidney damage may be required to influence long-term outcomes.

### Non-linear relationship between urinary creatinine and diabetic kidney disease: implications for clinical practice [^4a1a259b]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

While this study provides important insights, further research is needed to validate the predictive value of UCr across different populations and stages of DKD. Longitudinal studies could offer greater understanding of the fluctuations in UCr levels as renal function changes, potentially revealing patterns that could enhance predictive capabilities. Additionally, exploring the biochemical mechanisms associated with UCr and DKD may provide valuable information for developing targeted therapies. We acknowledge the limitations inherent in a retrospective study design. The potential for unmeasured confounders and the possibility of selection bias are limitations that could affect the generalizability of our findings. To mitigate these limitations and strengthen the conclusions, we plan to conduct a prospective cohort study to validate our findings in an independent population. This prospective study will allow for more rigorous control of confounding variables and provide more robust evidence for the clinical utility of UCr in early DKD detection.

In conclusion, this study reinforces the position of UCr as a promising biomarker for the early detection and management of DKD in T2DM patients. As the medical community continues to seek more effective monitoring strategies and interventions to improve renal outcomes, UCr may play a pivotal role in clinical practice, enhancing the quality of patient care and health outcomes in the diabetic population. By prioritizing UCr assessment, clinicians may increase opportunities to preserve renal function and improve the quality of life for patients at risk for DKD.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^3f4c7d53]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis initiation — kidney function estimation in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) should not rely on a specific estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level; serum creatinine–based equations are influenced by muscle mass and cohorts link higher eGFR at dialysis start with higher mortality without a similar signal using measured clearances. The Work Group elected not to recommend a specific GFR estimating equation for advanced CKD and favored not recommending routine 24-hour urine collections, while recognizing possible utility when uremic symptoms are discordant with measured kidney function.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^bfc530ae]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (evaluation), ACP 2016 guidelines recommend to use estimating equations correcting for differences in creatinine generation rather than plain serum creatinine measurements to assess kidney function in older patients.

### Is all chronic kidney disease created equal? [^1d35bc8c]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has generally been characterized functionally as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60ml/min/1.73m², without accounting for cause, signs of structural damage, or relative risk of sequelae. Recently released guidelines define CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than 3 months. We review the recent literature about CKD and its implications for renal surgery.

Recent Findings

Most estimates of GFR are based on serum creatinine, after adjusting for age, race, sex, and/or body mass. Recent research indicates that many individuals have GFR values less than 60ml/min/1.73m² without other manifestations of CKD. Nephron loss due to normal aging or renal surgery (CKD-S) may have lower likelihood of CKD progression, and may infer better survival, compared to individuals with the same degree of CKD due to medical causes. Patients with mild and moderate CKD due to surgical nephron loss may benefit from an alternative measurement method of renal function such as cystatin-C-derived or directly measured GFR.

Summary

CKD includes a diverse group of individuals with reduced GFR from a variety of causes. Classification of CKD according to GFR, albuminuria, and cause, may improve the management of patients with reduced GFR, as some causes (e.g., nephrectomy and aging) appear to be associated with a relatively low risk of progression.

### Integrating kidney function assessment into the clinical interpretation of plasma Alzheimer's disease biomarkers [^66ed7e3e]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Impaired kidney function, whether measured using the gold standard iohexol clearanceor estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum or plasma creatinine and/or cystatin C measurements, has been shown to affect absolute plasma concentrations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, including phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species, neurofilament light (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). – Since impaired kidney function can disrupt the equilibrium of substances in the bloodstream, it may also affect the levels of other routinely measured proteins, such as β2-microglobulin and free immunoglobulin light chains, whose concentrations can change when renal clearance is reduced. While early studies primarily examined the relationship between serum creatinine and AD biomarkers, more recent investigations have increasingly relied on eGFR, with only a limited number employing iohexol clearance to validate that these biomarkers are elevated in the presence of renal dysfunction. As variations in kidney function can alter biomarker concentrations, they may also influence diagnostic performance — often leading to reduced sensitivity and increased specificity when adjustments for renal function are applied. These effects are particularly important to consider in clinical contexts, where accurate interpretation of biomarker levels at the individual level must account for both central nervous system pathology and peripheral factors, such as renal clearance, that can influence blood biomarker concentrations.

### Creatinine assessment in non-steady-state conditions: a critical review [^ebfc56c8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To discuss methods for the assessment of creatinine clearance (Cl cr) when serum creatinine (SCr) is not at steady state in order to estimate kidney function and apply the estimate to kidney function staging for clinical assessment or drug dosing.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was conducted from 1976 to mid-January 2021 with other articles identified through review of bibliographies of retrieved articles and citations in Scopus.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles assessing Cl cr under non-steady-state conditions and studies evaluating predictive equations were selected.

Data Synthesis

When SCr is systematically changing (ie, trending up or down), kinetic methods to estimate Cl cr are appropriate. Estimates from kinetic methods should be individual based and not indexed to body surface area, and careful monitoring is required to confirm predictions as the situation evolves. Standard methods intended for steady-state conditions should not be used to estimate Cl cr in patients with unstable SCr.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Creatinine continues to be a monitoring parameter of choice and is an important variable in all the commonly used equations for estimating Cl cr and most important for estimating glomerular filtration rate. However, standard methods of estimating Cl cr for medication dosing are not accurate under non-steady-state conditions.

Conclusion

The methods for kinetic clearance estimation and standards methods for clearance estimation, such as the Cockcroft-Gault equation, are mutually exclusive. There are no benefits of using the kinetic method in patients with stable SCr concentrations, and standard equations are not appropriate with unstable SCr concentrations.

### Timing of recovery from moderate to severe AKI and the risk for future loss of kidney function [^31b6d671]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

The extent of recovery of kidney function following acute kidney injury (AKI) is known to be associated with future chronic kidney disease. Less is known about how the timing of recovery affects the rate of future loss of kidney function.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study examining the independent association between the timing of recovery from moderate to severe AKI and future loss of kidney function.

Setting & Participants

47,903 adult US veterans with stage 2 or 3 AKI who recovered to within 120% of baseline creatinine level within 90 days of peak injury.

Exposure

The timing of recovery of kidney function from peak inpatient serum creatinine level grouped into 1 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 30, and 31 to 90 days.

Outcome

A sustained 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate below that calculated from the last serum creatinine level available during the 90-day recovery period or kidney failure (2 outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rates < 15mL/min/1.73m 2, dialysis procedures > 90 days apart, kidney transplantation, or registry within the US Renal Data System).

Analytical Approach

Time to the primary outcome was examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Among 47,903 patients, 29,316 (61%), 10,360 (22%), 4,520 (9%), and 3,707 (8%) recovered within 1 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 30, and 31 to 90 days, respectively. With a median follow-up of 42 months, unadjusted incidence rates for the kidney outcome were 2.01, 3.55, 3.86, and 3.68 events/100 person-years, respectively. Compared with 1 to 4 days, recovery within 5 to 10, 11 to 30, and 31 to 90 days was associated with increased rates of the primary outcome: adjusted HRs were 1.33 (95% CI, 1.24–1.43), 1.41 (95% CI, 1.28–1.54), and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.43–1.75), respectively.

Limitations

Predominately male population, residual confounding, and inability to make causal inferences because of the retrospective observational study design.

Conclusions

The timing of recovery provides an added dimension to AKI phenotyping and prognostic information regarding the future occurrence of loss of kidney function. Studies to identify effective interventions on the timing of recovery from AKI are warranted.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^fbfdb3b6]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Relative and absolute risks associated with CKD — Very low serum creatinine (SCr) limits prognostic utility and results in reducing the risk associations for eGFRcr 45–60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and elevating risks for eGFRcr > 110 ml/min per 1.73 m2, whereas these limitations are not observed when risk is estimated using eGFRcr-cys or cystatin C–based eGFR (eGFRcys). When comparing GFR estimates using these 2 filtration markers, risk gradients are consistently stronger for most outcomes for eGFRcys in comparison with eGFRcr; therefore, for the purpose of evaluating the association of eGFR with outcomes (i.e., projecting prognosis for people with CKD), the eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys can be considered more accurate.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^ed77cad8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO kidney allograft biopsy — Increases in serum creatinine: Although serum creatinine has many limitations for estimating GFR, an unexplained rise in serum creatinine is generally indicative of a decline in GFR, and only a persistent increase that is outside normal variability is clinically relevant; a 25–50% increase over baseline is often arbitrarily used in studies, and at least one study suggested that a persistent 30% rise in serum creatinine was an excellent predictor of subsequent graft failure. Causes of acute, reversible declines in GFR should be ruled out, including dehydration, urinary obstruction and CNI toxicity (by demonstrating high blood levels), before a biopsy is performed; if there are no apparent causes of a decline in GFR, then an allograft biopsy is generally warranted to detect the nature of potentially treatable causes of kidney injury, including rejection, infections like BKV nephropathy, recurrent or de novo kidney disease or infiltration within posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease.

### Uric acid and incident kidney disease in the community [^29aba400]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Uric acid may mediate aspects of the relationship between hypertension and kidney disease via renal vasoconstriction and systemic hypertension. To investigate the relationship between uric acid and subsequent reduced kidney function, limited-access data of 13,338 participants with intact kidney function in two community-based cohorts, the Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities and the Cardiovascular Health Study, were pooled. Mean baseline serum uric acid was 5.9 ± 1.5 mg/dl, mean baseline serum creatinine was 0.9 ± 0.2 mg/dl, and mean baseline estimated GFR was 90.4 ± 19.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2). During 8.5 ± 0.9 yr of follow-up, 712 (5.6%) had incident kidney disease defined by GFR decrease (≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) with final GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), while 302 (2.3%) individuals had incident kidney disease defined by creatinine increase (≥ 0.4 mg/dl with final serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dl in men and 1.2 mg/dl in women). In GFR- and creatinine-based logistic regression models, baseline uric acid level was associated with increased risk for incident kidney disease (odds ratio 1.07 [95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.14] and 1.11 [95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.21] per 1-mg/dl increase in uric acid, respectively), after adjustment for age, gender, race, diabetes, systolic BP, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, smoking, alcohol use, education, lipids, albumin, hematocrit, baseline kidney function and cohort; therefore, elevated serum uric acid level is a modest, independent risk factor for incident kidney disease in the general population.

### The causal relationship between COVID-19 and estimated glomerular filtration rate: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study [^fcca6bce]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous Mendelian studies identified a causal relationship between renal function, as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and severe infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, much is still unknown because of the limited number of associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of COVID-19 and the lack of cystatin C testing. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to determine the genetic mechanisms responsible for the association between eGFR and COVID-19 in a European population.

Methods

We performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data; log-eGFR was calculated from the serum levels of creatinine or cystatin C by applying the Chronic Kidney Disease Genetics (CKDGen) Meta-analysis Dataset combined with the UK Biobank (N = 1,004,040) and on COVID-19 phenotypes (122,616 COVID-19 cases and 2,475,240 controls) from COVID19-hg GWAS meta-analyses round 7. The inverse-variance weighted method was used as the main method for estimation.

Results

Analyses showed that the genetically instrumented reduced log-eGFR, as calculated from the serum levels of creatinine, was associated with a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]: 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38–5.41, P < 0.05) and significantly related to COVID-19 hospitalization (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.39–4.00, P < 0.05) or infection (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01–1.53, P < 0.05). The significance of these associations remained when using log-eGFR based on the serum levels of cystatin C as genetically instrumented. However, genetically instrumented COVID-19, regardless of phenotype, was not related to log-eGFR, as calculated by either the serum levels of creatinine or cystatin C.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that genetical predisposition to reduced kidney function may represent a risk factor for COVID-19. However, a consistent and significant effect of COVID-19 on kidney function was not identified in this study.

### Discovery and prioritization of variants and genes for kidney function in > 1.2 million individuals [^1676b7c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and a major public health problem with the prevalence of > 10% in the adult population in developed countries. Although many underlying causes of CKD such as diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease or glomerulonephritis are known, CKD aetiology remains in most cases unclear. Moreover, knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms causing progressive loss of renal function is so far insufficient, resulting in a lack of therapeutic targets for drug development.

A defining parameter of CKD is decreased glomerular filtration rate, which can be estimated from the serum creatinine level. Estimated creatinine-based GFR (eGFRcrea) has a strong heritable component. Twin studies estimated a broad-sense heritability for eGFRcrea of 54%. Recently, a GWAS meta-analysis of eGFRcrea conducted by the CKD Genetics (CKDGen) Consortium identified 264 associated genetic loci. The lead variants at identified loci explained nearly 20% of eGFRcrea's genetic heritability. A substantial fraction of the missing heritability is expected to be attributed to low-frequency and rare variants, which require even larger GWAS sample sizes to be identified. While eGFRcrea is a useful marker of kidney function in clinical practice, the underlying serum creatinine is a metabolite from muscle metabolism, and thus may not only reflect kidney function. It is a major challenge in eGFRcrea GWAS to dissect mechanisms of biomarker metabolism from modulators of kidney function. Alternative kidney function biomarkers include blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which had supported 147 of the 264 eGFRcrea GWAS associations previously. GFR estimated by serum cystatin C (eGFRcys) may be a better marker of GFR, but can also be affected by factors other than GFR (e.g. inflammation, obesity, diabetes) and had a limited role in kidney function GWASdue to high costs and small data, so far.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^1a9ef893]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — assessment of kidney function emphasizes serum creatinine for acute changes, while measured GFR is most accurate but not recommended for routine practice, and alternative markers/formulas have limitations. Measurement of the serum creatinine concentration is described as a simple, inexpensive and widely available method for estimating GFR that is reliable for detecting acute changes; the level of serum creatinine at year 1 after transplantation is a risk factor for subsequent outcomes and may help guide care. Although measurement of GFR with inulin, iothalamate, iohexol or other suitable markers provides the most accurate measure of allograft function in KTRs, the Work Group did not recommend their use in routine clinical practice due to cost, low patient acceptance, and lack of availability outside of academic medical centers. Measurement of cystatin C has been used and is independent from body weight, but there is a paucity of validation studies for cystatin C estimates of GFR in KTRs. Formulas to estimate GFR have been tested in KTRs, but no formula has been consistently shown to be superior to any other formula.

### Transporters affecting biochemical test results: creatinine-drug interactions [^d63a8bcf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Creatinine is eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular filtration and active transport. Drug-induced increases in serum creatinine (SCr) and/or reduced creatinine renal clearance are used as a marker for acute kidney injury. However, inhibition of active transport of creatinine can result in reversible and, therefore, benign increases in SCr levels. Herein, the transporters involved in creatinine clearance are discussed, in addition to limitations of using creatinine as a biomarker for kidney damage.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^13edd4e6]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers correlated with each other and CKD

We next investigated the correlations between creatinine levels, cystatin C levels and CKD status in the 421 832 UKBB individuals. Creatinine and cystatin C levels demonstrated a positive significant correlation (r = 0.637, Fig. 1c). However, the correlation appeared to be primarily driven by individuals with high levels of both biomarkers. To investigate this further, we ranked individuals based on their creatinine levels because this measurement is routinely used to assess kidney function and hence widely available, and then examined how the correlation varied across different creatine percentiles. We observed no correlation in the bottom 98 percentiles (median = 0.0105, Fig. 1d), moderate correlation in the 99 th percentile (r = 0.145), and strong correlation in the 100 th percentile (r = 0.829). The correlation between creatinine and cystatin C levels at each percentile were strongly correlated with the fraction of UKBB individuals diagnosed with CKD (r = 0.847, Fig. 1e). As expected, the individuals with the highest creatinine level percentiles tend to be CKD patients: in the 100 th percentile, 59.7% individuals were diagnosed with CKD, 31.4% in the 99 th percentile and 22.7% in the 98 th percentile, and only the top eight percentiles had at least 10% individuals diagnosed with CKD (Table S1). Overall, individuals in the top 100th percentile (named 'top1' dataset hereafter, 59.7%) for creatinine levels were 13.4 times more likely to be diagnosed with CKD than individuals in the bottom 99 percentiles (bottom99, 4.48%, Table 1), indicating that, as expected, high creatinine levels correspond to increased risk for CKD. These observations also suggest that the strong correlation between creatinine and cystatin C levels only in the top1 dataset is due to both these metabolites not being correctly filtered by kidneys with impaired function.

### Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and subsequent risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality [^167bdcf0]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The established chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression end point of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a doubling of serum creatinine concentration (corresponding to a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of −57% or greater) is a late event.

Objective

To characterize the association of decline in estimated GFR with subsequent progression to ESRD with implications for using lesser declines in estimated GFR as potential alternative end points for CKD progression. Because most people with CKD die before reaching ESRD, mortality risk also was investigated.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Individual meta-analysis of 1.7 million participants with 12,344 ESRD events and 223,944 deaths from 35 cohorts in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with a repeated measure of serum creatinine concentration over 1 to 3 years and outcome data.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Transfer of individual participant data or standardized analysis of outputs for random-effects meta-analysis conducted between July 2012 and September 2013, with baseline estimated GFR values collected from 1975 through 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

End-stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis or transplantation) or all-cause mortality risk related to percentage change in estimated GFR over 2 years, adjusted for potential confounders and first estimated GFR.

Results

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of ESRD and mortality were higher with larger estimated GFR decline. Among participants with baseline estimated GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the adjusted HRs for ESRD were 32.1 (95% CI, 22.3–46.3) for changes of −57% in estimated GFR and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.5–6.4) for changes of −30%. However, changes of −30% or greater (6.9% [95% CI, 6.4%-7.4%] of the entire consortium) were more common than changes of −57% (0.79% [95% CI, 0.52%-1.06%]). This association was strong and consistent across the length of the baseline period (1 to 3 years), baseline estimated GFR, age, diabetes status, or albuminuria. Average adjusted 10-year risk of ESRD (in patients with a baseline estimated GFR of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 99% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for estimated GFR change of −57%, was 83% (95% CI, 71%-93%) for estimated GFR change of −40%, and was 64% (95% CI, 52%-77%) for estimated GFR change of −30% vs 18% (95% CI, 15%-22%) for estimated GFR change of 0%. Corresponding mortality risks were 77% (95% CI, 71%-82%), 60% (95% CI, 56%-63%), and 50% (95% CI, 47%-52%) vs 32% (95% CI, 31%-33%), showing a similar but weaker pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Declines in estimated GFR smaller than a doubling of serum creatinine concentration occurred more commonly and were strongly and consistently associated with the risk of ESRD and mortality, supporting consideration of lesser declines in estimated GFR (such as a 30% reduction over 2 years) as an alternative end point for CKD progression.

### Changes in creatinine and potassium levels in chronic kidney disease with RAASIs… [^021d4b95]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Creatinine level increases of at least 30% from baseline occurred in 158 of 2354 individuals on the first follow-up laboratory measurement in participants prescribed RAASIs. Preservation of baseline creatinine level was more frequent in less advanced CKD. Pooled results of RCTs from high-risk populations with CVD26 report an initial rise in serum creatinine levels of at least 30% within 2 weeks in 16%, which persist in only 7% at 3 months. Conversely, a quantitative review of 4 RCTs representative of a general-risk population27 reported worsening kidney function in only 0. 5% to
3. 0% of participants at 25 months. Thus, these individuals may have had better renal reserve with less susceptibility to changes in creatinine level from the hemodynamic stress of RAASI therapy compared with higher-risk populations studied.

26 This interpretation is consistent with our finding of an increased incidence of these events in those with advanced CKD. In addition, the medication dose was likely higher in RCTs because outpatient health care professionals may prescribe lower starting doses with the intention to titrate up if tolerated. In addition, only 1. 7% developed a rise in creatinine levels of at least 30% compared with
6. 7% in our cohort, suggesting that a higher proportion in that study had normal kidney function at baseline. In the United States, RAASIs were reported as the most frequent cardiovascular agent to be associated with ED visits for adverse drug events, 17 accounting for 3. 5% of the national total ED visits for adverse drug events from 2013 to
2014. The strengths of the study lie largely within its natural outgrowth of patient care to address questions pertinent to a wide audience of health care professionals.

Serum creatinine level was selected as the marker of kidney function, given its use in clinical practice, and a change of at least 30% was selected because this level has been advocated as a threshold for RAASI therapy discontinuation despite the limitations of creatinine level as an indicator of eGFR. 13–15 Primary care practices were selected rather than specialty clinics to minimize the likelihood of off-site laboratory follow-up.

### Tubular secretion of creatinine and kidney function: an observational study [^5e6c0050]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although it has been known for many years that creatinine is cleared via both filtration and secretion, basic gaps remain in our knowledge regarding the physiology and pathophysiology of tubular secretion of creatinine in various states of health and disease. For example, exactly what fraction of creatinine is cleared via secretion vs. filtration? Is it possible that measurement error alone could entirely account for the longstanding observation that CrCl/GFR ratio is larger at lower GFR among patients with CKD? These questions are pertinent in the context of renewed recent interest in renal tubular function. Better understanding of tubular secretion as an independent marker of kidney function may provide insight into kidney disease pathophysiology and improve prediction of adverse outcomes. Others have emphasized that many drugs are cleared by tubular secretion, and drug-dose modification in CKD should not assume that renal excretory processes always decline in parallel with GFR as CKD progresses.

In this study we showed the following. First, we are able to replicate the results of our original CRIC cross-sectional results in MDRD and AASK. Replicating our initial findings in two other large research cohorts underscores the idea that certain studies in the literature may have been biased by measurement error, which has been under-appreciated in the past. (In fact, measurement error has not been mentioned at all in the prior literature as far as we can tell.)

Second (and closely related conceptually), we demonstrate that measurement error likely played an under-appreciated role also in prior literature that describes longitudinal changes in the CrCl/GFR ratio. For example, in the much cited study by Shemesh et al. the authors concluded from their longitudinal analysis that "The opposite changes in fractional creatinine secretion and GFR as glomerular disease deteriorates or improves serve to blunt the magnitude of change when creatinine is used to monitor progression of the glomerular injury". Not considered by the authors is the fact that measurement error alone may explain much of this observation.

KDOQI commentary — pediatric/neonatal baseline creatinine and AKI identification: Most pediatric patients have not had previous serum creatinine measurements and baseline renal function is often assumed to be normal, which may be problematic; the neonatal population remains an enigma for renal function determination and immediately after birth serum creatinine reflects maternal levels. Accordingly, the recommendation of a 0.3-mg/dL increase in serum creatinine must be considered in the context of baseline renal function and neonatal baseline ranges.

### The relationship between the level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and renal function in patients without chronic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study [^672f8dd1]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Low level of vitamin D has been suggested as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, little is known about the effect of vitamin D on renal function in healthy subjects. Our aim was to investigate the question of whether vitamin D status is associated with renal function in subjects without CKD.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 1,648 subjects aged older than 20 years were recruited as study participants. Subjects diagnosed with either CKD or other conditions that could influence serum vitamin D were excluded. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from serum creatinine (sCr) was used for the determination of renal function. Vitamin D status was determined by the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels.

Results

In men, 25(OH)D showed significant positive correlation with age (r = 0.127, P < .001), skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.077, P = 0.017), sCr (r = 0.128, P < .001), and negative correlation with body fat (r = -0.065, P = 0.044), eGFR (r = -0.152, P < .001). In women, 25(OH)D showed negative correlation with eGFR (r = -0.085, P = 0.026), but not with age and body composition. In multiple linear regression analysis, 25(OH)D (β = 0.114, P < .001), total muscle mass (β = 0.202, P = 0.026), and age (β = 0.117, P = 0.003) were an independent determinant of sCr in men; in women, 25(OH)D (β = 0.086, P = 0.023), total muscle mass (β = 0.152, P < .001) were variables showing significant association with sCr.

Conclusions

Higher level of 25(OH)D is independently associated with sCr elevation. We suggest that a positive correlation between 25(OH)D and muscle mass could be attributed to sCr. It is thought to be another mechanism of serum 25(OH)D level in renal function in populations without CKD.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^a3ce4467]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising worldwide, driven by increasing rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, as well as an aging population. In the United States alone, CKD is estimated to affect 37 million adults. CKD is typically assessed and staged based on estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) values, which measure the kidney's efficiency in filtering waste from the blood. Serum creatinine and/or cystatin C levels, combined with factors such as race, age, and sex, are commonly used to calculate eGFR and evaluate kidney function. However, neither creatinine nor cystatin C are directly associated with kidney function, rather they serve as biomarkers whose levels are elevated in CKD due to reduced glomerular filtration. The lack of specific kidney function and CKD biomarkers has limited the development of drugs for CKD.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving over one million individuals have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with eGFR. Studies have shown that using different eGFR formulas based on creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) can result in the discovery of distinct genetic loci. For example, the CST3 locus, which encodes cystatin C, is identified only in eGFRcys GWAS, while the GATM locus, associated with creatinine levels and CKD, is identified only in eGFRcre GWAS. This discrepancy aligns with the distinct biological roles of these biomarkers. Creatinine is a waste product from the normal breakdown of creatinine phosphate in muscles, produced at a constant rate and filtered by the kidneys. While creatinine levels are primarily associated with muscle mass and metabolism, they are also linked to lung function, specifically forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Conversely, cystatin C regulates the activity of cysteine proteases to prevent excessive protein degradation and maintain cellular homeostasis. By controlling protease activity, cystatin C influences processes such as tissue remodeling, wound healing, and extracellular matrix turnover. Cystatin C levels are associated with various cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, cholesterol levels, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Given these differences, it is unclear what fraction of the genetic loci identified in eGFR GWAS are involved in kidney function and the development of CKD, or merely reflect the metabolism of the biomarkers used to measure eGFR.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^def572c6]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Dose adjustments by level of GFR emphasizes considering kidney function for medication dosing and identifies when higher accuracy methods are needed. Specifically, "Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medications cleared by the kidneys". The text explains that "Many medications and/or their active metabolites are excreted by the kidneys" and that "Failure to properly account for the effect of GFR when designing appropriate drug-dosing regimens can predispose a person to treatment failure or adverse events". For situations requiring greater precision, "Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFR estimates may be unreliable, use equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured GFR may be indicated". The guideline also notes regulatory recognition that "any contemporary, widely accepted, and clinically applicable estimating GFR equation is considered reasonable to assess GFR in pharmacokinetic studies".

### Renal recovery [^23c68533]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) research in the past decade has mostly focused upon development of a standard AKI definition, validation of early novel biomarkers to predict AKI prior to serum creatinine rise and predict AKI severity, and assessment of aspects of renal replacement therapies and their impact on survival. Given the independent association between AKI and mortality in the acute phase, such focus makes imminent sense. More recently, the recognition that AKI is associated with subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, with the attendant increase in mortality, has led to interest in the clinical epidemiology and the mechanistic understanding of renal recovery after an AKI episode in critically ill patients. We review the current knowledge surrounding renal recovery after an AKI episode, including renal replacement therapy initiation timing and modality impact, biomarker assessment and mechanistic targets to guide potential future clinical trials.

### Fluctuations in serum creatinine levels during hospitalization and long-term end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^22da3ada]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Acute kidney injury is associated with poor outcomes, but the clinical implication of reversible serum creatinine level fluctuations during hospitalization not necessarily defined as acute kidney injury is poorly understood.

Objective

To investigate the long-term outcomes of patients without previously diagnosed kidney disease who present with decreased kidney function and are subsequently discharged with apparently normal kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients hospitalized in a large tertiary hospital in Israel between September 1, 2007, and July 31, 2022. The study included patients admitted to an internal medicine ward. Patients had not undergone dialysis during the index hospitalization, had at least 3 creatinine tests performed during hospitalization, and had a discharge estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) exceeding 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease were excluded.

Exposure

Glomerular filtration rate was estimated from serum creatinine values using the updated 2022 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula, and eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was regarded as normal. Exposure was defined based on the association between the first and last values determined during hospitalization.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality in the year following the index hospitalization and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the 10 years following the index hospitalization.

Results

A total of 40 558 patients were included. Median age was 69 (IQR, 56–80) years, with 18 004 women (44%) and 22 554 men (56%). A total of 34 332 patients (85%) were admitted with a normal eGFR and 6226 (15%) with decreased eGFR. Patients with decreased eGFR on presentation had an 18% increased mortality in the year following hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11–1.24) and a 267% increased risk of ESKD in the 10 years following hospitalization (AHR, 3.67; 95% CI, 2.43–5.54), despite having been discharged with apparently normal kidney function. The highest risk was noted in patients who presented to the hospital with an eGFR of 0 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cohort study suggest that patients who present with decreased kidney function and are discharged without clinically evident residual kidney disease may be at increased long-term risk for ESKD and mortality.

Towards an improved AKI diagnosis?

Although the kidney has many functions, AKI is mostly defined as a decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The KDIGO workgroup proposed a consensus definition and staging system for clinical practice (the KDIGO definition) that relies on the increase of serum creatinine (Scr) within 7 days and/or the presence of oliguria (Fig. 1), both surrogate markers of GFR. This definition has enabled to streamline research in the field. However, both Scr and urine output may also be influenced by non-renal and non-GFR-related factors and are, therefore, imperfect markers of reduced GFR. Consequently, the diagnosis of AKI by KDIGO criteria should be interpreted in the clinical context. Controversy on how to determine baseline kidney function is another drawback of the consensus definition. Despite the concerns about oliguria as a marker of kidney function, there is evidence that oliguria identifies patients with worse outcomes. In addition, because of the long half-life of creatinine and the presence of renal functional reserve (renal reserve capacity that can be recruited before basal GFR starts to decline), Scr requires time to accurately reflect GFR resulting in delayed recognition of kidney dysfunction. Potential solutions for a more timely detection of a reduced GFR could be measurement of creatinine clearance over 2 or 4 h, kinetic eGFR calculated from two serial creatinine measurements, or utilizing the plasma disappearance of an injected compound like iohexol that is dependent on renal clearance. These methods have not been extensively investigated or used in the ICU setting. Bedside real-time GFR measurements using injection of a dye and fluorescent probes and enabling earlier diagnosis of kidney dysfunction are under investigation, but do not yet have regulatory approval. Cystatin-C, another marker of glomerular filtration, might be useful in settings of muscle wasting, but is also affected by comorbidity.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the slope of kidney function as measured by the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level. 2, 26 The reciprocal of the serum creatinine level has a linear relationship with the GFR, unlike the serum creatinine level, which has a curvilinear relationship. These values, expressed as (mg/dL) −1, approximate GFR values, with which most clinicians are familiar. In addition, equations from the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration that are adjusted for ethnic group were used to determine the estimated GFR and eGFR slopes over time. Finally, the proportion of patients who reached an eGFR decline of > 30% — a recently advocated surrogate for long‐term renal outcomes — was calculated. 4

Furthermore, the proportion of major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all‐cause mortality were assessed. A major cardiovascular event was defined as major coronary event (death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or resuscitation after cardiac arrest), fatal or nonfatal stroke, major cardiovascular event (stroke plus any major coronary event), acute coronary event (major coronary event or unstable angina), any coronary event (acute coronary event, unstable angina, or angina or ischemia requiring emergency hospitalization). Cardiovascular mortality was defined as death from coronary heart disease, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, or other cardiovascular death.

### Imperfect gold standards for kidney injury biomarker evaluation [^849c1dd6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Clinicians have used serum creatinine in diagnostic testing for acute kidney injury for decades, despite its imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Novel tubular injury biomarkers may revolutionize the diagnosis of acute kidney injury; however, even if a novel tubular injury biomarker is 100% sensitive and 100% specific, it may appear inaccurate when using serum creatinine as the gold standard. Acute kidney injury, as defined by serum creatinine, may not reflect tubular injury, and the absence of changes in serum creatinine does not assure the absence of tubular injury. In general, the apparent diagnostic performance of a biomarker depends not only on its ability to detect injury, but also on disease prevalence and the sensitivity and specificity of the imperfect gold standard. Assuming that, at a certain cutoff value, serum creatinine is 80% sensitive and 90% specific and disease prevalence is 10%, a new perfect biomarker with a true 100% sensitivity may seem to have only 47% sensitivity compared with serum creatinine as the gold standard. Minimizing misclassification by using more strict criteria to diagnose acute kidney injury will reduce the error when evaluating the performance of a biomarker under investigation. Apparent diagnostic errors using a new biomarker may be a reflection of errors in the imperfect gold standard itself, rather than poor performance of the biomarker. The results of this study suggest that small changes in serum creatinine alone should not be used to define acute kidney injury in biomarker or interventional studies.

### Cystatin C-and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate, vascular disease, and mortality in persons with diabetes in the U.S [^e6ee52a9]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

In the population with diabetes, both serum creatinine and cystatin C may have drawbacks. Serum creatinine may poorly estimate kidney function given the tendency of persons with diabetes to have a lower than average muscle mass. Cystatin C may be directly affected by both BMI and diabetes. In obese individuals, cystatin C levels are higher, and eGFR cys significantly underestimates true kidney function. Indeed, our study suggests that much of the association between diabetes and cystatin C is driven by differences in the distribution of age and BMI. Additional work is needed to determine whether an approach using cystatin C or both filtration markers (the latter of which better approximates measured GFR in the overall population) would improve kidney function estimates in the population with diabetes.

Conventional wisdom is that, among persons with diabetes, kidney function decline and vascular complications go hand in hand. Certainly, our results support the association of prevalent complications with very low eGFR whether estimated by creatinine or cystatin C. Interestingly, in the upper ranges of preserved kidney function, the association between eGFR cr and retinopathy reversed, with higher levels of eGFR cr conferring increased odds of retinopathy, although this was not statistically significant in adjusted analysis. A similar pattern was seen in the univariate association of eGFR cr and albuminuria. These observations are consistent with previous studies demonstrating weaker-than-expected correlation between eGFR cr, albuminuria, and retinopathy. Because of the more monotonic relationship seen between eGFR cys, albuminuria, and retinopathy, it is possible that kidney function based on cystatin C may prove a better predictor of diabetes complications than that based on creatinine. However, this may be more useful in defining a low-risk group than a high-risk group, given the larger differences in the upper ranges of eGFR. We also observed that the relationship between eGFR cys and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was stronger than the corresponding relationship with eGFR cr, similar to findings in the general population and previous studies of persons with diabetes. Additional prospective studies are needed to determine whether eGFR cys provides better risk stratification for subsequent diabetes complications.

### Renal impairment in new drug development… [^fcc857eb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Project Start Date: April 2014 Project End Date: July 2024. Regulatory Science Challenge The kidney plays a protective role in the body by removing drugs, waste, and toxic substances. Kidney disease affects the ability of the kidneys to eliminate drugs from the body. Therefore, in individuals with kidney disease the administration and dosage of certain drugs need to be reduced so that their kidneys can effectively eliminate the drugs. Methods to predict whether new drugs will have toxic effects in patients with renal impairment and to predict the dosages of the new drugs will help inform treatment decisions and avoid unwanted side effects. Project Description and Goals High levels of serum creatinine, a key marker to monitor kidney function, are interpreted as a decrease in renal health. In some cases, new drugs increase serum creatinine levels by inhibiting specific transporters in the kidneys.

This may be incorrectly interpreted by clinicians as renal toxicity. These "false positives" could lead to discontinuing the use or development of a promising new drug. In Phase I of this project, which concluded in September 2016, researchers studied the mechanisms involved in serum creatinine changes, identifying what transporters are involved in creatinine clearance and developing models to predict how changes in kidney function affect creatinine clearance. In addition, researchers continued to evaluate how other toxic molecules that result from kidney disease affect various metabolic and transport processes. This project's goals were to:

- Broaden understanding of the renal transporters involved in drug clearance and use serum creatinine levels or alternate markers to define the potential toxicity of a new drug and
- Improve the ability to predict potential systemic exposure changes of drugs in the presence of kidney disease.

Research Outcomes/Results The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted human subject research at study sites, greatly hindered study enrollment, and ultimately did not permit researchers to draw conclusions on the effect of metolazone on the clearance of secreted waste solutes. UCSF-Stanford CERSI optimized methods to measure metolazone and secreted solutes. Investigators hypothesize that the administration of drugs cleared by the kidney impairs the clearance of the body's waste products, and thereby has the potential to increase their plasma levels worsening symptoms of reduced kidney function.

### Reference intervals for serum creatinine for healthy adults in central Africa: a post-hoc analysis [^cd004b4d]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparing creatinine reference intervals across age groups, no influence of age was noted in males but a small influence of age was observed for females. These results must however be interpreted with caution as the number of subjects older than 50 years old in our study is limited.

In the presented study, serum creatinine (SCr) levels were associated with gender, an interaction between age and gender, weight, arm circumference, educational level, and weekly walking frequency. Gender emerged as the strongest predictor, with lower SCr levels observed in females compared to males, consistent with known physiological differences in muscle mass and creatinine metabolism. The interaction between age and gender suggests that the relationship between age and SCr differs by sex, with a slightly steeper increase in SCr with age among women. However, this interaction should be interpreted with caution because the number of older participants in the sample was relatively small. Weight and arm circumference were also positively associated with SCr, likely reflecting their role as proxies for muscle mass. Educational level showed a negative association with SCr for individuals with no formal education compared to those with university-level education. Although education itself is unlikely to directly influence creatinine levels, it may act as a proxy for socioeconomic status, which can affect diet quality, including intake of creatine-rich foods such as meat. Higher education levels are also often associated with better access to healthcare and healthier lifestyles, which may indirectly influence kidney function. However, the observed association in our sample may also reflect differences in body composition or other unmeasured factors, and should therefore be interpreted with caution.

The association between weekly walking frequency and SCr was inconsistent. While moderate physical activity such as walking is generally considered beneficial for kidney health. The observed pattern, where some walking categories had negative and others positive associations relative to the reference, lacks a clear biological explanation and may reflect residual confounding or measurement error. Finally, any association was observed between reported use of medicinal plants and SCr levels. However, the heterogeneity in the types, timing, and dosages of these products limits the interpretability of this finding.
