AMI management in ER

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about emergency department management of acute myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and ECG acquisition. Then, I should verify STEMI recognition and reperfusion pathways. Next, I will review NSTE-ACS evaluation with high-sensitivity troponin algorithms and risk stratification. After that, I need to check adjunctive medical therapy, disposition, and special populations. Finally, I will examine quality metrics, system-level pathways, and common pitfalls, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: activate the chest pain pathway immediately, obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival, and start continuous monitoring with IV access. If the patient is unstable, I need to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are addressed without delay, and I should review any prehospital ECG because prehospital acquisition expedites reperfusion decisions and can trigger early cath lab activation, which is a Class 1 recommendation in contemporary pathways and STEMI systems of care [^112bG2YX] [^114AtyXr] [^1112igCX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — STEMI must be identified rapidly and accurately. I should double-check for ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads using standard thresholds and look for STEMI equivalents such as new LBBB, posterior MI patterns, or diffuse ST depression with reciprocal ST elevation in aVR, while remembering that automated interpretations are supportive but not definitive and that serial ECGs are often necessary when the initial tracing is nondiagnostic, with up to 11% of STEMI patients initially having nondiagnostic ECGs that evolve within 90 minutes [^112bG2YX] [^117Ttx6D] [^1112igCX].

> I will now examine reperfusion strategy for confirmed STEMI: if the patient is at a PCI-capable hospital, the goal is primary PCI with first medical contact (FMC)-to-device within 90 minutes. If at a non–PCI-capable hospital, transfer for PCI is preferred when it can be achieved within 120 minutes of FMC, otherwise fibrinolysis with a door-to-needle target of 30 minutes is indicated, and I should confirm that systems allow direct transfer to the cath lab bypassing the ED when feasible to minimize delays [^114AtyXr] [^113kfn1N] [^11659J5T].

> Wait, let me verify adjunctive therapies that should not be delayed: aspirin 162–325 mg chewed immediately unless contraindicated, a P2Y12 inhibitor such as ticagrelor or clopidogrel early, anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin tailored to PCI versus fibrinolysis strategy, IV nitroglycerin for ongoing ischemia if not hypotensive, and morphine for persistent pain after nitrates. I should also remember that beta-blockers are beneficial unless there is risk of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, bradycardia, or hypotension, so I need to ensure hemodynamic stability before initiating beta-blockade [^112YTX1N] [^114uMZXu].

> Next, I should review NSTE-ACS when there is no ST elevation: I need to ensure serial high-sensitivity troponin testing using a validated 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithm, because these pathways can safely rule out MI in a large proportion of patients and shorten ED length of stay. If hs-cTn is not available, conventional troponin at 0 and 3–6 hours is acceptable, and I should confirm that dynamic rise or fall of troponin with clinical ischemia supports NSTEMI per the Fourth Universal Definition [^116zsNfE] [^115nJfz8] [^116oj6Tr].

> Let me consider risk stratification carefully: the HEART Pathway combines History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin and, when low risk with a nonischemic ECG and negative serial hs-cTn, supports early discharge with very low 30-day MACE. TIMI and GRACE scores can refine risk, but I should double-check that TIMI alone is insufficiently sensitive for ED decision-making and should be paired with ECG and troponin in accelerated diagnostic pathways to avoid misses [^112TF8cU] [^114wLrdV] [^112sX7z8].

> I need to ensure disposition is aligned with risk: low-risk patients with nonischemic ECGs and negative serial hs-cTn can often be discharged with close follow-up, whereas intermediate/high-risk patients or those with positive troponin warrant admission, antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, and consideration of early invasive evaluation. Importantly, routine stress testing or CCTA before discharge is not recommended for low-risk patients once MI is excluded, though arranging follow-up within 1–2 weeks is prudent [^114tvaFc] [^116f1Uy6].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest? I should confirm that early revascularization is the cornerstone and that triage to a PCI-capable center with mechanical circulatory support capability improves outcomes, with contemporary guidance emphasizing rapid transfer and advanced shock protocols. I need to check that norepinephrine is preferred for vasopressor support and that mechanical complications should be managed in centers with cardiac surgical expertise [^112G4T9V] [^116RtHsM] [^114rAgBi].

> Let me think about special populations and pitfalls: in older adults, I should balance bleeding risk with the benefits of antithrombotic therapy and early invasive care. In those with renal dysfunction, I must adjust anticoagulant dosing and consider contrast strategies. In pregnancy, radiation-sparing algorithms and cardiology consultation are essential. And I should double-check that COVID-19 does not negate standard ACS pathways, though isolation and resource adjustments may be needed [^114TDUbE].

> I should confirm system-level quality metrics: track FMC-to-device times, door-to-ECG within 10 minutes, door-to-balloon under 90 minutes for direct presenters and under 120 minutes for transfers, and door-to-needle under 30 minutes when fibrinolysis is used. Regional STEMI networks with prehospital ECG, cath lab activation, and direct-to-lab transfer reduce total ischemic time and improve outcomes, and I need to ensure continuous audit and feedback loops are in place [^114AtyXr] [^114a8DRL] [^11659J5T].

> Hold on, I should verify common diagnostic pitfalls: atypical presentations, nondiagnostic initial ECGs, and failure to obtain serial ECGs or posterior/right-sided leads can delay STEMI recognition. Relying on clinical gestalt alone risks missed MI, and overreliance on a single troponin without appropriate serial testing or risk stratification can be unsafe — so I need to ensure adherence to validated pathways and maintain a high index of suspicion when symptoms persist [^112rWYka] [^116QBpPg] [^117Ttx6D].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought the HEART Pathway alone achieves a 30-day MACE miss rate under 1% in low-risk patients, but I should double-check. Pooled data show the low-risk HEART cohort can approach 1.7–3.3% MACE, which is why the HEART Pathway adds a second hs-cTn at 3 hours and integrates ECG to safely achieve lower event rates, so I need to correct that overstatement and emphasize the serial testing component rather than HEART alone [^114wLrdV] [^112TF8cU].

> Let me reconsider the role of AI and emerging tools: while AI-enhanced ECG interpretation shows promise for rapid triage, prospective validation and workflow integration are still evolving, so I should treat these as adjuncts that support — but do not replace — expert clinician review and guideline-based care in the ED [^116q6vnT] [^1116YPyx].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, time-sensitive approach: obtain an ECG within 10 minutes, rapidly identify STEMI for immediate reperfusion, use hs-cTn algorithms for NSTE-ACS with validated risk scores, apply evidence-based adjunctive therapies, and leverage regional systems and quality metrics to minimize ischemic time and missed events. If any step seems uncertain, I should pause, verify against guidelines, and escalate early to cardiology to protect the patient from delays in definitive care [^112bG2YX] [^116f1Uy6] [^114AtyXr].

Emergency management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the ER centers on **rapid ECG within 10 minutes** [^112bG2YX] and **early reperfusion** to limit infarct size and mortality [^notfound]. For STEMI, activate the cath lab and aim for primary PCI within 90 minutes [^11659J5T]; if PCI is not available within 120 minutes, give fibrinolysis and transfer for PCI [^114AtyXr]. For NSTEMI, use high-sensitivity troponin with 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms [^116zsNfE] [^116Jcdkb], risk-stratify with HEART or GRACE [^112sX7z8], and pursue early invasive management for high-risk patients [^116f1Uy6]. Start aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, anticoagulation, beta-blocker, nitroglycerin, and statin [^113CjF7p]; avoid NSAIDs [^114uMZXu]; and monitor for arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock [^111kmU46] [^112G4T9V].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **Rapid ECG**: Obtain and interpret within 10 minutes of arrival [^112bG2YX]; repeat if initial is nondiagnostic [^117Ttx6D].

- **High-sensitivity troponin**: Use 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms for rapid rule-in/rule-out [^116zsNfE] [^116Jcdkb].

- **Risk stratification**: Use HEART, GRACE, or TIMI to guide disposition and management [^112sX7z8] [^113AnQkZ].

---

## Reperfusion strategies

### STEMI management

- **Primary PCI**: Preferred reperfusion method; aim for ≤ 90 minutes from first medical contact [^11659J5T].

- **Fibrinolysis**: If PCI not available within 120 minutes; administer within 30 minutes of arrival [^114AtyXr].

- **Transfer**: Arrange urgent transfer to PCI-capable center after fibrinolysis or if PCI is delayed [^114AtyXr].

---

### NSTEMI management

For NSTEMI, **early invasive strategy** is indicated for high-risk patients — those with elevated troponin, dynamic ST changes, or a GRACE score > 140 [^notfound]. Medical management includes dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, beta-blockers, nitrates, and statins [^113CjF7p] [^111d5Tt4].

---

## Pharmacological management

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Antiplatelet agents | STEMI, NSTEMI | - Aspirin <br/> - P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) [^notfound] |
| Anticoagulants | STEMI, NSTEMI | - Heparin <br/> - Enoxaparin <br/> - Fondaparinux [^notfound] |
| Beta-blockers | STEMI, NSTEMI | - Metoprolol <br/> - Carvedilol [^notfound] |
| Nitrates | Chest pain relief | Nitroglycerin [^112YTX1N] |
| Statins | Secondary prevention | - Atorvastatin <br/> - Rosuvastatin [^notfound] |

---

## Monitoring and complications

- **Continuous monitoring**: ECG, blood pressure, oxygen saturation [^1112igCX].

- **Arrhythmias**: Treat promptly; consider electrical cardioversion for unstable rhythms [^111kmU46].

- **Heart failure and cardiogenic shock**: Early recognition and management, including mechanical circulatory support if indicated [^112G4T9V].

---

## Disposition and follow-up

For disposition and follow-up, **admission** is appropriate for STEMI, high-risk NSTEMI, or ongoing symptoms, whereas **discharge** is reasonable for low-risk patients with negative troponins and non-ischemic ECGs, with close follow-up arranged [^111NfajK] [^112TF8cU]. Secondary prevention focuses on risk factor modification, medication adherence, and cardiac rehabilitation [^113CjF7p].

---

## Quality improvement and system considerations

Quality improvement emphasizes **door-to-balloon times** ≤ 90 minutes and **door-to-needle times** ≤ 30 minutes [^114AtyXr]. Regional networks should coordinate prehospital ECG, direct transfer to PCI-capable centers, and standardized protocols [^114a8DRL]. Ongoing education and protocol audits help maintain adherence and improve outcomes [^114a8DRL].

---

Effective AMI management in the ER requires **rapid diagnosis**, **early reperfusion**, and guideline-directed medical therapy, supported by robust monitoring and quality systems [^111NfajK].

### Key recommendations and evidence from the NICE guideline for the acute management of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^115VeY6i]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The acute management of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has seen significant changes in the past decade. Although the incidence has been declining in the UK, STEMI still gives rise to around 600 hospitalised episodes per million people each year, with many additional cases resulting in death before hospital admission. In-hospital mortality following acute coronary syndromes has fallen over the past 30 years from around 20% to nearer 5%, and this improved outcome has been attributed to various factors, including timely access to an expanding range of effective interventional and pharmacological treatments. A formal review of the acute management of STEMI is therefore appropriate. The recently published NICE clinical guideline (CG167: The acute management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation) provides evidence-based guidance on the acute management of STEMI, including the choice of reperfusion strategies, procedural aspects of the recommended interventions, the use of additional drugs before and longside reperfusion therapies, and the treatment of patients who are unconscious or in cardiogenic shock. The guideline development methods and detailed reviews of the evidence considered by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) can be found in the full version of the guideline (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG167), and the priority recommendations are summarised in box 1. Other related NICE clinical guidelines deal with the diagnosis of recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin http://www.nice.org.uk/CG95), the early management of unstable angina and non-STEMI (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG94), and secondary prevention after myocardial infarction (http://www.nice.org.uk/CG48, currently being updated with publication expected end of 2013).

American College of Cardiology emergency department chest pain pathway — applicability and exclusions are as follows: The content applies only to patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia undergoing evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and it does not apply to patients with stable angina or those evaluated in settings other than the ED. This pathway is not applicable to patients with hemodynamic instability, significant heart failure, or other conditions that would mandate hospital admission. The document is focused on the rapid evaluation and disposition of patients with possible ACS in the ED and does not address the evaluation and management of patients with definite ACS or serve as a guide for the diagnosis or management of myocardial infarction (MI).

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome [^115cynDQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complaints encountered in the emergency department is chest pain. In many evaluations, the leading diagnostic consideration is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary artery pathologies, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The distinction between subtypes of ACS guides acute diagnostic and management decisions. Failure to diagnose and manage ACS properly is a frequent cause of medico-legal litigation. In this article, we review the initial identification and critical management steps in patients presenting to the emergency department with ACS.

### Management of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction: a review [^116WhhnB]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

5 GENERAL APPROACH

The most effective therapeutic intervention in patients with AMI complicated by CS (AMI‐CS) is establishment of coronary reperfusion, at the earliest possible. However, in the interim, their hemodynamic instability should be managed ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, preservation of euvolemic state, and general critical care measures.

### ACC / AHA guideline update for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^114uMZXu]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have issued an update of the 2004 guideline for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Aspirin should be given to symptomatic patients. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in the acute setting because they may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock and death. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is indicated in patients who have had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A stepped care approach to analgesia for musculoskeletal pain in patients with coronary heart disease is provided. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase mortality risk and should be avoided. Primary prevention is important to reduce the burden of heart disease. Secondary prevention interventions are critically important to prevent recurrent events in patients who survive.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^113AnQkZ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) in adult emergency department (ED) patients — initial risk stratification recommendations state: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, the History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin (HEART) score can be used as a clinical prediction instrument for risk stratification, and a low score (≤ 3) predicts 30-day MACE miss rate within a range of 0% to 2%. Level C recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, other risk-stratification tools, such as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), can be used to predict rate of 30-day MACE. Potential Benefit of Implementing the Recommendations includes decreased use of limited resources, and Potential Harm of Implementing the Recommendations is the potential for missed cases of preventable MI or death.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1112igCX]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction — an electrocardiogram (ECG) "should be acquired and interpreted promptly (ie, target within 10 minutes) after first medical contact", and "prehospital ECGs reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment, and can facilitate the triage of STEMI patients… if within the recommended time interval (120 minutes from STEMI diagnosis)". For ongoing symptoms or a nondiagnostic tracing, "recording several standard ECGs… at 15–30 minute intervals for the initial 1–2 hours, or the use of continuous computer-assisted 12-lead ECG recording… is reasonable". Certain patterns carry prognostic/diagnostic implications: "ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm in 6 leads… is suggestive evidence of multivessel disease or left main disease", while a comparison tracing helps but "should not delay the decision for treatment". Early ischemic changes include "increased hyperacute T wave amplitude… in at least 2 contiguous leads", and infarction evolution is reflected as "the development of new Q waves" indicating necrosis that "starts minutes/hours after the myocardial insult", with "transient Q waves" sometimes seen during acute ischemia or "(rarely) during acute MI with successful reperfusion".

### Practical implementation of the guidelines for unstable angina / non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction in the emergency department [^117KypqM]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the United States each year, > 5.3 million patients present to emergency departments with chest discomfort and related symptoms. Ultimately, > 1.4 million individuals are hospitalized for unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. For emergency physicians and cardiologists alike, these patients represent an enormous challenge to accurately diagnose and appropriately treat. This update of the 2002 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Unstable Angina and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) provides an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these patients in the emergency department, in-hospital, and after hospital discharge. Despite publication of the guidelines several years ago, many patients with UA/NSTEMI still do not receive guidelines-indicated therapy.

2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP/NAEMSP/SCAI acute coronary syndromes guideline — scope and clinical focus states that the document primarily focuses on the management of type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It notes that it can be challenging to differentiate type 1 versus type 2 MI, and in cases of uncertainty and depending on the benefits/risks of a specific diagnostic or therapeutic intervention, it may be appropriate to err on the side of considering an event a type 1 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event until established to be otherwise.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department (GRACE): recurrent, low-risk chest pain in the emergency department [^113GaN1r]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Non-obstructive coronary artery disease (< 50% stenosis) after prior angiography — subsequent event risk and evidence certainty — involves 23 observational studies with overall certainty rated LOW; across these data, the incidence of all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) was 1.32/100 person-years (95% CI 1.02–1.62), the likelihood of non-fatal MI or all-cause mortality within 5 years is very low in patients with coronary stenosis between 1% and 49%, median follow-up was 5 years (interquartile range 3–7 years; range 1–10 years), and heterogeneity was high (I² = 91%).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112JPWow]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Modifications of TIMI score — among emergency department chest pain patients, an accelerated diagnostic pathway (ADP) using a modified TIMI of zero with ECG and troponin I at 0 and 2 hours resulted in greater early discharge with one missed MACE, and studies of repeat troponin testing and altered cutoffs showed variable sensitivity and specificity. A Class II trial randomized 542 patients to standard care versus ADP and the ADP enabled discharge within 6 hours more often (19% versus 11%) with one missed MACE in the ADP group (n = 270). In multicenter data with TIMI 0 to 2, sensitivity with conventional troponins at 0 and 2 hours was 83.9% (95% CI 66.3% to 94.5%), while adding a second troponin plus ECG at 2 hours yielded sensitivity 99.2% (95% CI 97.5% to 99.8%) for 30-day MACE. Modified TIMI cutoffs had mixed performance: at a cutoff of less than or equal to 3, sensitivity was 96.4% (95% CI 91.7% to 98.4%) with specificity 51%; at a cutoff of less than or equal to 2, sensitivity was 91% and specificity 54%; in a cohort of 1,758 emergency department patients, cutoffs of less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 2, or less than 3 missed greater than 10% of 30-day MACE. Authors concluded that neither the original nor modified TIMI score is sufficiently sensitive at any score above zero to safely risk-stratify patients even with a normal ECG and troponin, and most authors recommended not relying on TIMI score alone, instead advocating brief observation with repeated troponin testing.

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^116Qcj3X]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 Delays in Care

The guidelines explore the potential delays for patients presenting with STEMI. These include patient self‐presentation delay or emergency medical system (EMS) delay and systems of care delay within the receiving medical center, all adding to the total ischemic time. Analysis of these components may improve the delivery of care for patients with STEMI and will involve patient education for prompt presentation, the EMS system efficiency, the emergency room contact in the hospital, and transfer to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, ideally in under 90 min. The guidelines further detail the recommendations for patients presenting to a non‐PCI center, scheduling transfer to an appropriate more intensive level facility.

Cardiogenic shock in acute coronary syndromes — prevalence and preferred triage indicate that cardiogenic shock related to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is present in 7% to 10% of the acute coronary syndromes (ACS) population and carries a high mortality rate; early and rapid revascularization for cardiogenic shock related to AMI is associated with increased survival, and triage to a PCI-capable hospital and ideally to hospitals providing advanced therapies such as mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is preferred. The page also notes that several scales are available to determine shock severity, with observational data showing associations between severity and outcomes.

### National trends in emergency department care processes for acute myocardial infarction in the United States, 2005 to 2015 [^113DNFm1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar to prior epidemiologic studies, we found that the overall incidence of ED visits for AMI and STEMI have declined, while ED NSTEMI diagnoses have increased, albeit to a lesser degree. The observed decline in STEMI incidence in US EDs, especially, builds on prior studies reporting declining rates of STEMI hospitalizations in two different regions of the United States. 33, 34 A host of interrelated factors may be responsible for this continued decline, including improvements in preventive care and outpatient management of chronic coronary heart disease, 35 as well as successful system‐wide efforts to enhance regional STEMI care.

There are several possible explanations for the high initial proportion of ED AMI visits for STEMI that we observe. The NHAMCS captures ED diagnoses as opposed to hospital discharge diagnoses, which may inflate the observed STEMI proportion. As other authors have noted, nearly one‐third of patients who are admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome carry a different diagnosis at hospital discharge. 36 This, coupled with ambiguous clinical documentation in the ED and deficiencies in the coding system itself, may have contributed to an observed high proportion of patients with STEMI who, in reality, likely contained a mix of AMI scenarios. In 2005, the beginning of our study period, the ICD‐9 coding system was changed to recognize NSTEMI as a separate pathologic entity, distinct from STEMI. Before 2005, the ICD‐9 coding system, despite its widespread use in the evaluation of healthcare outcomes, did not draw this distinction. Previous work has demonstrated that even after the aforementioned change to the ICD‐9 coding schema, patients with NSTEMI are more likely to be misclassified as having STEMI than vice versa. 18

Electrocardiogram (ECG) — initial emergency department (ED) evaluation of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should include an ECG that is "performed and interpreted within 10 minutes of arrival at the ED", with review of any pre-hospital ECG; the initial ED ECG "should be examined for signs of ischemia… particularly for STEMI or a STEMI equivalent", which "identifies patients who should undergo immediate reperfusion therapy"; automated ECG algorithms may assist but accuracy "varies… with up to a 2-fold variation", and physician accuracy is also variable with "lower sensitivity for smaller degrees of ST-segment elevation"; if there is no ischemic ST-segment elevation, the ECG "should be examined for other changes… and, when present, these should prompt evaluation for emergent coronary angiography"; when new ST-segment or T-wave changes are suspected, "comparison with previous ECGs can be helpful", and "emergent consultation for expert over-read should be obtained" if criteria are unclear; "serial ECGs performed over short time intervals" and "ECGs performed later, even the next day", may reveal evolving ischemia; "a posterior ECG should be performed" when initial ECG is nondiagnostic but posterior MI is suspected; and "emergent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)… should be considered" when ECGs are concerning but not diagnostic of ischemia and infarction.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^115jNcN2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The widely recognized benefits of early diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have only emphasized the importance of emergency physician (EP) competence in electrocardiographic interpretation. As such, the EP must be an expert in the interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in the emergency department chest pain center patient. The ECG is a powerful clinical tool used in the evaluation of patients, assisting in making the diagnosis of AMI and other syndromes, selecting appropriate therapies (including thrombolysis and primary angioplasty), securing the location of an adequate inpatient disposition, and predicting the risk of cardiovascular complications and death. This article will discuss the appropriate uses of the ECG in the patient with possible or confirmed AMI and review the typical electrocardiographic findings of AMI, diagnostically confounding patterns, mimickers of infarction, and new techniques.

Single high-sensitivity troponin T — diagnostic performance in low-risk cohorts is quantified: In 1,138 patients, almost one third had a troponin level less than 5 ng/L with a sensitivity of 99% (0.3% risk of MACE), whereas using the 99th percentile cutoff of 14 ng/L identified two thirds as negative but sensitivity decreased to 92% (1.3% risk of MACE). A meta-analysis of single results below the limit of detection (< 5 ng/L) in patients with a nonischemic ECG reported across eleven studies and 2,825 patients a pooled sensitivity of MACE at 98%.

The publication of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for the management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association in September 2000 marked a sentinel event in the evolution of managing this challenging patient population. Many of the recommendations included in the guidelines have relevance to the emergency department care of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome and were summarized in Annals of Emergency Medicine in September 2001. New clinical data in this area continue to accumulate at a remarkably rapid rate, prompting the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association to publish an update of the 2000 guidelines in October 2002. Several of the modified and new recommendations again potentially affect ED management. These are presented and discussed here.

### Artificial intelligence applied to electrocardiogram to rule out acute myocardial infarction: the ROMIAE multicentre study [^116q6vnT]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) being a significant contributor. The conventional protocol for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with signs suggestive of AMI includes immediate acquisition of an electrocardiogram (ECG), with a target timeframe of within 10 min of arrival. The interpretation of these ECGs by a specialist is crucial for the early risk stratification of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). Nevertheless, the prompt and precise analysis of ECG findings is a complex task in practical settings. Although the presence of STEMI might be discernible on the initial ECG, discrepant interpretations can occur among even well-trained physicians. Additionally, ECGs can present as normal upon expert review in 17%–33% of patients who are ultimately diagnosed with NSTE-ACS. Examinations can be delayed by ED overcrowding or during pivotal healthcare challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Clinical decision support using artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been introduced into numerous medical fields, including emergency care. Despite advances, the translation of AI for practical clinical use remains limited, partly due to a dearth of rigorous clinical validation studies. Several AI algorithms for ECG interpretation have been proposed, including for AMI detection, but prospective studies are needed to validate the utility of such AI systems for AMI diagnosis in clinical settings. This prospective multicentre study aimed to externally validate the predictive performance of an AI-enhanced 12-lead ECG (AI-ECG) analytic model and compare its performance with existing AMI risk stratification models. We hypothesized that AI-ECG, a low-cost and easily-implementable model, would have superior discrimination in comparison with existing models, warranting larger-scale implementation and subsequent clinical efficacy studies. This study involved comparing initial AI-ECG interpretations upon ED admission with established risk stratification tools, namely the HEART and GRACE scores, and clinical assessments that consider the initial ECG manifestations and patient presentation.

### Acute coronary syndromes: initial evaluation and risk stratification [^115J6EpD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Chest pain, the second most frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED), often poses a challenge to the physicians dealing with these patients owing to the wide spectrum of presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). A majority of the patients presenting with chest pain are usually admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Despite the availability of modern-day tools for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), about 5% of patients with AMI are missed in the ED with subsequent associated morbidity and mortality and legal consequences. Several centers have adapted critical pathways derived from American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients presenting with ACS. We now have some evidence suggesting adherence to the critical pathways derived from ACC/AHA guidelines will optimize the quality of patient care and probably result in better patient outcomes. This article reviews initial evaluation and the importance of risk stratification of the patients presenting with chest pain using the currently available clinical and diagnostic tools. Critical pathways derived from the ACC/AHA guidelines for various presentations of ACS are also reviewed.

### Dysrhythmias and heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction: an emergency medicine review [^111kmU46]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may suffer several complications after the acute event, including dysrhythmias and heart failure (HF). These complications place patients at risk for morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates literature and guideline recommendations relevant to the acute emergency department (ED) management of AMI complicated by dysrhythmia or HF, with a focus on evidence-based considerations for ED interventions.

Discussion

Limited evidence exists for ED management of dysrhythmias in AMI due to relatively low prevalence and frequent exclusion of patients with active cardiac ischemia from clinical studies. Management decisions for bradycardia in the setting of AMI are determined by location of infarction, timing of the dysrhythmia, rhythm assessment, and hemodynamic status of the patient. Atrial fibrillation is common in the setting of AMI, and caution is warranted in acute rate control for rapid ventricular rate given the possibility of compensation for decreased ventricular function. Regular wide complex tachycardia in the setting of AMI should be managed as ventricular tachycardia with electrocardioversion in the majority of cases. Management directed towards HF from left ventricular dysfunction in AMI consists of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, nitroglycerin therapy, and early cardiac catheterization. Norepinephrine is the first line vasopressor for patients with cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion on clinical examination. Early involvement of a multi-disciplinary team is recommended when caring for patients in cardiogenic shock.

Conclusions

This review discusses considerations of ED management of dysrhythmias and HF associated with AMI.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: a companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^114JBdoX]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

This patient has a high likelihood for pneumonia and a low likelihood for NSTEMI. To answer the question whether he has concomitant NSTEMI, you need to know the exact value of hs-cTn at presentation as well as the dynamics after 1 h or 2 h. If the hs-cTn levels are only mildly elevated (e.g. according to the assay 18 ng/L if ULN is 14 ng/L), then the mild elevation in hs-cTn in this specific patient can be attributed to cardiac causes other than NSTEMI (e.g. pre-existing CAD/MI or hypertensive heart disease plus some degree of cardiomyocyte injury related to sepsis/pneumonia) and no specific treatment is needed. A rise or fall in hs-cTn is required for the diagnosis of NSTEMI, and most NSTEMIs have higher concentrations 7 h after the onset of acute chest pain.

Q16. You are the cardiology consultant responsible for the training of residents starting their rotation in the emergency department. When discussing patient pathways, a resident asks you whether the majority of patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department ultimately require hospitalization to reliably rule-out or rule-in acute MI (AMI).

No. Using either a hs-cTn T/I 0 h / 1 h-algorithm or a hs-cTn T/I 0h/2 h-algorithm, the majority of patients (75%) can be reliably ruled-out or ruled-in within the first hours in the emergency department (sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). Ultimately, the majority of patients (> 60%) can be discharged after rapid rule-out of AMI and managed as outpatients using these algorithms.

### Invasive management of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116RtHsM]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) remains the most common cause of mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The SHOCK trial (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) demonstrated a survival benefit with early revascularization in patients with CS complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMICS) 20 years ago. After an initial improvement in mortality related to revascularization, mortality rates have plateaued. A recent Society of Coronary Angiography and Interventions classification scheme was developed to address the wide range of CS presentations. In addition, a recent scientific statement from the American Heart Association recommended the development of CS centers using standardized protocols for diagnosis and management of CS, including mechanical circulatory support devices (MCS). A number of CS programs have implemented various protocols for treating patients with AMICS, including the use of MCS, and have published promising results using such protocols. Despite this, practice patterns in the cardiac catheterization laboratory vary across health systems, and there are inconsistencies in the use or timing of MCS for AMICS. Furthermore, mortality benefit from MCS devices in AMICS has yet to be established in randomized clinical trials. In this article, we outline the best practices for the contemporary interventional management of AMICS, including coronary revascularization, the use of MCS, and special considerations such as the treatment of patients with AMICS with cardiac arrest.

### Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in EDs [^112YTX1N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) physicians are critical in the accurate diagnosis, efficient management, and treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The initial reperfusion strategy involves the choice between mechanical reperfusion using primary percutaneous coronary intervention and pharmacologic treatment with fibrinolytics. The benefits of these approaches are time dependent, and practices vary according to institutional resources and local guidelines. Nevertheless, the need for early intervention and the use of certain therapies are well recognized. Therefore, ED physicians must be aware of all treatment options available, including the use of adjunctive therapies. Initial treatment should include beta-blockers, aspirin (or clopidogrel if aspirin is contraindicated), nitroglycerin, and analgesia, regardless of reperfusion strategy. Clopidogrel is now approved as an adjunctive therapy for patients undergoing fibrinolysis as their reperfusion therapy. Both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin are feasible adjunctives in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing reperfusion therapy. In addition, multiple new antithrombin agents are being investigated. The choice adjunctive treatments should be based on specific patient populations and on the initial reperfusion strategy.

Emergency department ECG assessment summary — The ECG is a critical component of the initial assessment and management of ED patients with possible ACS. The ECG should be rapidly assessed for evidence of acute infarction or ischemia, and if present, subsequent care should follow current guidelines for management of acute STEMI and NSTE-ACS. The ECG should also be examined for subtle changes that are also consistent with ACS as well as for other findings that could suggest a non-ACS cause for their symptoms, and patients who have a non-ischemic ECG (as defined previously) are eligible for entering a CDP, and further clinical evaluation should take place as outlined later.

TIMI score — emergency department chest pain risk stratification — A TIMI score of zero was 97.2% sensitive (95% CI 94.8% to 98.5%) for the study outcome, and in another nonconsecutive series of 1,666 patients with 219 (13%) having 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the sensitivity of either the original or modified TIMI score was 96% (95% CI 92% to 98%), not high enough in the authors' opinion to warrant widespread adoption. When combined with electrocardiogram (ECG) and normal point-of-care troponin testing on presentation, an initial TIMI score of zero was 99.6% sensitive (95% CI 97.4% to 100%) for subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) within 30 days, and a cutoff of zero with normal point-of-care troponin testing resulted in a MACE rate of 0.6%; limitations included lack of complete data for 80% and lack of firm follow-up for 28% of patients. With high-sensitivity troponins, reported sensitivities with a TIMI score of zero included 99.6% (95% CI 97.3% to 100%), 99.2% (95% CI 97.1% to 99.8%), and 99.4% (95% CI 96.5% to 100%); another series reported 100% (95% CI 94.3% to 100%) sensitivity for MI at 30 days. Despite these findings, a TIMI score of zero does not consistently reach the threshold of a 2% miss rate for 30-day MACE, and a TIMI score cutoff of greater than zero consistently performed better than 97% sensitivity in predicting 30-day MACE; however, the 95% CIs extended the lower bound to 90% in some studies.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI [^11659J5T]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1 — Reperfusion timeline in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) specifies time-to-treatment goals by presentation route: With emergency medical services (EMS) contact, EMS performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 10 minutes of arrival and PCI is performed within 90 minutes of EMS contact. For patients arriving directly to a PCI-capable hospital, ECG is performed within 10 minutes of patient arrival and PCI is performed within 90 minutes of arrival to the PCI hospital. For patients first presenting to a non-PCI hospital, ECG is performed within 10 minutes of arrival, the patient departs the non-PCI hospital within 45 minutes of arrival for transport to a PCI hospital, and PCI is performed within 120 minutes of arrival to the non-PCI hospital.

### Considerations for management of acute coronary syndromes during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic [^114TDUbE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Accumulating evidence suggests that influenza and influenza-like illnesses can act as a trigger for acute myocardial infarction. Despite these unprecedented times providers should not overlook acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines, but may choose to modify the recommended approach in situations with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease. In this document, we suggest recommendations as to how to triage patients diagnosed with ACSs and provide with algorithms of how to manage the patients and decide the appropriate treatment options in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. We also address the inpatient logistics and discharge to follow-up considerations for the function of already established ACS network during the pandemic.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^1131k1h6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome

The primary role for the troponin assay since its inception has been to diagnose patients with acute MI (AMI). While the improved sensitivity and specificity of troponin (over creatine kinase–MB) may have improved diagnostic accuracy for AMI in the emergency department and hospital, its shortcoming may be that, depending on the time between symptom onset and presentations, there is a delay of several hours in elevation of the biomarker. – This delay causes a delay in diagnosis and, thus, longer emergency department and observation stays both for patients with and those without AMI. New high‐sensitivity assays have overcome this weakness with their improved sensitivity, making the first low‐level elevations of troponin detectable within 90 to 180 minutes of the event. Two large prospective studies performed in the emergency department setting showed that the high‐sensitivity troponin assays are more accurate than previous assays in the successful diagnosis of AMI within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. – The increase in accuracy and speed could be beneficial in multiple ways. Patients are diagnosed more quickly and, as a result, may be treated more rapidly, including earlier invasive therapy. For the majority of patients, the improved assays will lead to a quicker rule‐out of MI. This may allow for more prompt subsequent evaluation and perhaps to earlier discharge of appropriate patients, decreasing further costs. However, there has not been adequate prospective evaluation of the use of these new assays in a diagnostic algorithm, and these assays may perform in a less‐specific manner in the general chest pain population outside of the strict criteria required to enter a randomized clinical trial. Also, the cost‐effectiveness of these new algorithms and strategies has not yet been established.

### Safely identifying emergency department patients with acute chest pain for early discharge [^112TF8cU]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The HEART Pathway (history, ECG, age, risk factors, and initial troponin) is an accelerated diagnostic protocol designed to identify low-risk emergency department patients with chest pain for early discharge without stress testing or angiography. The objective of this study was to determine whether implementation of the HEART Pathway is safe (30-day death and myocardial infarction rate < 1% in low-risk patients) and effective (reduces 30-day hospitalizations) in emergency department patients with possible acute coronary syndrome.

Methods

A prospective pre-post study was conducted at 3 US sites among 8474 adult emergency department patients with possible acute coronary syndrome. Patients included were ≥ 21 years old, investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome, and had no evidence of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction on ECG. Accrual occurred for 12 months before and after HEART Pathway implementation from November 2013 to January 2016. The HEART Pathway accelerated diagnostic protocol was integrated into the electronic health record at each site as an interactive clinical decision support tool. After accelerated diagnostic protocol integration, ED providers prospectively used the HEART Pathway to identify patients with possible acute coronary syndrome as low risk (appropriate for early discharge without stress testing or angiography) or non-low risk (appropriate for further in-hospital evaluation). The primary safety and effectiveness outcomes, death, and myocardial infarction (MI) and hospitalization rates at 30 days were determined from health records, insurance claims, and death index data.

Results

Preimplementation and postimplementation cohorts included 3713 and 4761 patients, respectively. The HEART Pathway identified 30.7% as low risk; 0.4% of these patients experienced death or MI within 30 days. Hospitalization at 30 days was reduced by 6% in the postimplementation versus preimplementation cohort (55.6% versus 61.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71–0.87). During the index visit, more MIs were detected in the postimplementation cohort (6.6% versus 5.7%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12–1.65). Rates of death or MI during follow-up were similar (1.1% versus 1.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58–1.33).

Conclusions

HEART Pathway implementation was associated with decreased hospitalizations, increased identification of index visit MIs, and a very low death and MI rate among low-risk patients. These findings support use of the HEART Pathway to identify low-risk patients who can be safely discharged without stress testing or angiography.

Initial assessment for suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) begins with ECG within 10 min (Class 1) and obtain cTn (Class 1). If ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is present, evaluate for reperfusion therapy (Section 5). If not STEMI, perform serial ECG to detect ischemia (Class 1) and serial cTn hs-cTn at 1–2 h or conventional cTn at 3–6 h (Class 1). A clinical decision pathway (CDP) is used to define risk, with categories including low risk, intermediate risk, and criteria met for NSTEMI or high risk; for the latter, initiate medical therapy (Section 4) and assess for invasive evaluation (Section 6.1).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^111EEK9W]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians addresses key issues in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes. A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can initial risk stratification be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (2) In adult patients with suspected acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can troponin testing within 3 hours of emergency department presentation be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (3) In adult patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in whom acute myocardial infarction has been excluded, does further diagnostic testing (eg, provocative, stress test, computed tomography angiography) for acute coronary syndrome prior to discharge reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (4) Should adult patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

HEART score and HEART Pathway — low-risk cohort MACE rates and serial testing are characterized as follows: In a cohort using a single conventional troponin applied to greater than 2,400 patients, among those with a low-risk HEART score (36.4% of the entire cohort) the 30-day MACE rate was 1.7% with the upper range of the CI greater than 2%. A systematic review pooled 9 studies (> 11,000 patients) and reported a low-risk cohort 3.3% rate of MACE; because the HEART score has not consistently achieved a MACE rate less than 1%, the HEART Pathway includes a second troponin test at 3 hours. In a TIMI-stratified cohort of 8,815 adults, only patients with a TIMI score of 0 and a HEART score of 0 had a MACE risk of less than 1%. Additionally, among patients with a nonischemic ECG result and an initial undetectable high-sensitivity troponin T level, a 30-day MACE rate of 0.17% was found.

### Fully automated diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction using electrocardiograms and multimodal deep learning [^1116YPyx]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study presents a novel multimodal model architecture capable of excluding AMI with a high negative predictive value. We are unaware of any other model able to exclude AMI with such high precision in an equally broad patient population with suspected acute coronary syndromes. The model performs consistently across an internal and an external data set, across sexes and other tested subgroups. Next, this model needs to be evaluated in a pragmatic randomized trial.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICES: The existing system for processing AMI patients involves delays due to factors such as slow identification and missed diagnoses on ECGs. To enhance efficiency, it is essential to streamline the process, enabling triage staff to promptly alert physicians about patients requiring urgent care. Implementing modern deep-learning systems can be instrumental in addressing these challenges.

TRANSLATIONAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinical implementation of this model necessitates several steps, including validation on prospective data and integration into existing or novel workflows. Evaluating these implementations will determine if they facilitate more rapid treatment through the utilization of such systems.

### Management of patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in Russian hospitals adheres to international guidelines [^116gkCKw]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Data and methods

The protocol for the 'Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Russia' (MAMIR) Study, part of the International Project on Cardiovascular Disease in Russia (IPCDR), has been published previously. In brief, MAMIR is a prospective observational study describing the current treatment of AMI in Russia. A random sample of 1128 patients, aged 35–75 years, with a confirmed AMI diagnosis, and surviving 24 hours after admission to the hospital, within 16 hospitals across 13 regions of Russia from 2015 to 2017, were recruited. Hospitals were selected using purposive sampling, to include all types of hospital, large and small, and be willing to commit to organising data collection over the entire study period and covering regions of different levels of economic development from a large part of the territory of Russia. Of the 16 hospitals included, all were able to perform medical reperfusion therapy and 12 were able to provide PCI. For all hospitals, 2015 data including number of patients with MI, mortality rates and PCI rates were collated from official statistics.

Data for individual-level analyses came from patient interviews and abstracted medical records regarding the patients' initial index admission. Core data include age, sex, STEMI status (from ECG), reperfusion treatments, admission characteristics including date and time of admission, pre-hospital delay to hospital (< 12 hours, 12–48 hours, > 48 hours), use of emergency medical services (EMS) and whether patients came directly to the hospital or via another health facility.

To capture actual practice, patients with STEMI were identified using an intention-to-treat approach, defined as having a STEMI if ST-elevation was found on their first ECG taken after the onset of MI symptoms (n = 777). Appropriate treatment was determined with reference to the 2014 ESC guidelines, which were the guidelines adopted in Russia when data collection began. We have updated our nomenclature to match the 2017 guideline terms, as the 2017 revisions have no material implications for classifying treatment strategies for patients in our study. Specifically, we have categorised patients with STEMI by time from symptom onset to first medical contact (early phase, evolved and recent STEMI), the treatment indicated for each stage is described in online supplementary web appendix, figure 1.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^1127fQxG]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) — evidence on the immediacy of nonaspirin antiplatelet administration is limited because few studies isolate a single agent and most included aspirin and heparin; although 3 Class I studies 99–101 were included, a recommendation higher than level C was not made because none directly addressed immediacy, and as for the 2 Class II studies,102,103 neither showed a benefit from early intervention. Drug selection and route often hinges on the need for urgent cardiac catheterization and the potential for emergency cardiac bypass; it is not always apparent whether a diagnosed NSTEMI patient will proceed to catheterization, and the decision about selection and timing should be made in collaboration with local cardiovascular specialists. Future research focusing on nonaspirin antiplatelet agents in highest-risk NSTEMI — patients with ongoing chest pain, significant ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or candidates for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — may help identify a subset in whom immediate administration in the emergency department (ED) improves patient-important outcomes. Disclosure notes state there were no relevant industry relationships disclosed by the subcommittee members for this topic.

### Outcome of applying the ESC 0 / 1-hour algorithm in patients with suspected myocardial infarction [^116Jcdkb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends the 0/1-h algorithm for rapid triage of patients with suspected non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). However, its impact on patient management and safety when routinely applied is unknown.

Objectives

This study sought to determine these important real-world outcome data.

Methods

In a prospective international study enrolling patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency department (ED), the authors assessed the real-world performance of the ESC 0/1-h algorithm using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T embedded in routine clinical care and its associated 30-day rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (the composite of cardiovascular death and MI).

Results

Among 2,296 patients, non-ST-segment elevation MI prevalence was 9.8%. In median, 1-h blood samples were collected 65 min after the 0-h blood draw. Overall, 94% of patients were managed without protocol violations, and 98% of patients triaged toward rule-out did not require additional cardiac investigations including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T measurements at later time points or coronary computed tomography angiography in the ED. Median ED stay was 2 h and 30 min. The ESC 0/1-h algorithm triaged 62% of patients toward rule-out, and 71% of all patients underwent outpatient management. Proportion of patients with 30-day MACE were 0.2% (95% confidence interval: 03% to 0.5%) in the rule-out group and 0.1% (95% confidence interval: 0% to 0.2%) in outpatients. Very low MACE rates were confirmed in multiple subgroups, including early presenters.

Conclusions

These real-world data document the excellent applicability, short time to ED discharge, and low rate of 30-day MACE associated with the routine clinical use of the ESC 0/1-h algorithm for the management of patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the ED.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes — translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels states that Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies); Level B recommendations may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies); and Level C recommendations are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, based on expert consensus, and when consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation. The recommendations and evidence synthesis were reviewed and revised by the Clinical Policies Committee, recommendations may be downgraded due to factors such as consistency of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude, and publication bias, and when possible clinically oriented statistics (eg, likelihood ratios [LRs], number needed to treat) are presented to help apply results to the individual patient.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

### 2000 ACC / AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a practical summary for emergency physicians [^117Xroes]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

There have been numerous significant clinical advances in both the diagnosis and therapy of acute coronary syndrome during the past several years. Even the term "acute coronary syndrome" is a recent creation meant to expand clinical attention in patients with chest pain of coronary origin beyond identification of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy and to include the evaluation and management of those patients with unstable angina (UA) or myocardial injury that does not cause ST-segment elevation. Many of these advances have been studied and first implemented outside the emergency department, leading some emergency physicians to be slow to embrace them, and leaving others without a viable practical option to use them outside of the cardiac catheterization laboratory or the coronary care unit. In September 2000, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued practice guidelines for the care of patients with UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The guidelines specifically address the diagnosis and management of UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the ED, suggesting evidence-based standards for risk stratification, for the use of biologic markers of myocardial damage and other adjunctive diagnostic tests, and for the appropriate use of antiplatelet and antithrombin therapeutic agents. This article provides an overview of the ED-pertinent analyses and recommendations from the 93-page document. A commentary on the implementation of these recommendations in the ED follows in a separate article.

### Serial electrocardiography [^114PrfS6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

During the past 15 years, medicine has witnessed several important advances in coronary artery reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and thrombolytic therapy have made significant advances in the early treatment of the AMI patient. Given both the shown benefit of these treatment modalities and the cardiac injury that they can prevent, it behooves the emergency physician (EP) to make a timely diagnosis of AMI to restore adequate perfusion and to salvage the maximum amount of myocardium. A correct diagnosis is dependent on EP expertise in the evaluation of the chest pain patient — in large part, the electrocardiogram.

Type 2 myocardial infarction — acute management and evaluation are described as follows: It appears advisable in the acute setting to treat the underlying ischemic imbalance of oxygen supply and demand, and treatment may include volume adjustment, blood pressure management, administration of blood products, heart-rate control, and respiratory support. Depending on the clinical situation, coronary evaluations may be indicated to assess the likelihood of CAD; if it is present, the MI Guidelines may be applied in accordance with the ECG findings of STEMI or NSTEMI, whereas if CAD is absent, the benefits of cardiovascular risk-reduction strategies with type 2 MI remain uncertain.

Emergency department non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) after exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (MI) — testing and disposition: Level B recommendations state, "Do not routinely use further diagnostic testing (coronary CT angiography, stress testing, myocardial perfusion imaging) prior to discharge in low-risk patients in whom acute MI has been ruled out to reduce 30-day MACE". Level C recommendations state, "Arrange follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks for low-risk patients in whom MI has been ruled out. If no follow-up is available, consider further testing or observation prior to discharge (Consensus recommendation)". Level A recommendations are "None specified". Context includes 2014 AHA/ACC guidance that "It is reasonable for patients with possible ACS who have normal serial ECGs and cardiac troponins to have a treadmill ECG… or stress echocardiography before discharge or within 72 hours after discharge", and a randomized trial in which "all patients underwent 6-hour serial cardiac troponin T ruleout testing", showing 30-day major adverse cardiac events of "0.4%" with stress myocardial perfusion imaging versus "0.8%" with standard management (relative risk "0.50; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.00") and that imaging "did not significantly reduce 30-day MACE".

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^112u5HJM]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Recognizing that acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) constitute a spectrum encompassing unstable angina, non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of ACSs addressed all three. This differs from the prior US guidelines that individually addressed unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. The 2023 ESCACS Guidelines thus encompass comprehensive patient management from admission to long‐term care, again including what in prior US guidelines would have been a secondary prevention guideline. In addition, the task force included a patient member who provided a patient perspective that is highlighted in the European publication.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) definitions — adult emergency department population: This policy refers only to adult (> 18 years) patients with possible cardiac ischemia and excludes acute STEMI defined by the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, which requires ST elevation as > 0.1 mV in 2 contiguous leads with specific cut points in V2 - V3 of > 0.2mV in men > 40 years, > 0.25 mV in men less than 40 years, and > 0.15 mV in women; without these electrocardiographic changes, the goal is to diagnose NSTE ACS, and NSTEMI is defined by a significant Δ increase in troponin level without ST-segment elevation in the appropriate clinical context suggestive of myocardial ischemia.

### Prehospital thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction [^1153wjqq]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Efficacy of reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is strictly time-dependent. Most benefit is achieved with initiation of therapy within the first 60–90 min after onset of symptoms. The majority of patients with AMIs are seen within this time window by emergency medical services. Moreover, average time gain of about 60 min is possible by prehospital thrombolysis. Randomized studies yielded a better outcome when a time gain of 90 min and more was achieved. Prehospital diagnosis of AMI is reliable. Moreover, out-of-hospital thrombolysis has no additional specific risks nor is it an obstacle for later percutaneous intervention. Consequently, patients seen within the first 60–90 min after onset of symptoms or for whom a time gain of 90 min or more can be expected should receive immediate prehospital thrombolysis.

### Practical considerations of β-blockade in the management of the post-myocardial infarction patient [^113agA6b]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States that affects an estimated total of 1.5 million men and women each year. Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.

Acute coronary syndromes — ECG acquisition and repeat strategy emphasize that timely acquisition of an ECG is imperative in patients with a goal to obtain and interpret an ECG by a trained clinician within 10 minutes of presentation. An initial nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG does not "rule out" or exclude ACS, and a nondiagnostic ECG should be compared to prior ECGs, and a repeat ECG should be obtained during the ED course to assess for evolving changes; right-sided leads should be obtained in patients with a concern for inferior STEMI to evaluate for right ventricular involvement. In NCDR ACTION, 11% of patients ultimately diagnosed with STEMI had an initial ECG that was nondiagnostic, and 72.4% of those patients had a follow-up ECG diagnostic of STEMI within 90 minutes of their initial ECG.

The accurate assessment and triage of patients with potential ACS is a complex decision-making process based on information that is not entirely reliable. The knowledgeable EP recognizes that assessment of patients with chest pain requires an understanding of the various clinical presentations of ACS and high-risk patient types, as well as careful use of the available modalities to diagnose these syndromes efficiently while incurring minimal risk to the patients safety. The busy EP is faced with sick patients with chest pain daily, so that it behoove anyone in emergency medicine to familiarize themselves with these diagnostic pitfalls.

Purposes

The objective of this study was to evaluate improvement opportunities in the emergency department for timely ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction management and evaluated the new process flow.

Basic Procedures

In a prospective study, we compared time from door to cath laboratory before and after implementation of a new ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) protocol. The new protocol included a blend of strategies to reduce door to cath laboratory time.

Main Findings

We included 55 patients. After implementing a new STEMI protocol, we included 54 patients. Time to cath laboratory was 21 (interquartile range, 9–40) minutes before and 10 (interquartile range 5–25) minutes after initiation of the new protocol (P = 0.02). A door to cath laboratory time less than 15 minutes was reached in 36% of our patients in phase 1 and in 61% in phase 2 (odds ratio; 0.36, 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.81; p = 0.01).

Principal Conclusion

Simple changes in organizational strategies resulted in a significantly faster care for patients with acute uncomplicated STEMI.

### Emergency department evaluation of the chest pain patient [^113BtLhw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician must have a high degree of suspicion for myocardial ischemia in patients presenting with no obvious for their chest pain. The role of the emergency physician is to determine a relative risk for each patient and to order the appropriate studies to minimize the risk of missed myocardial infarction as well as to recognize acute ischemia or infarction and manage it aggressively. It is not possible to rule out myocardial ischemia or infarction subjectively. It is the opinion of these authors that some form of further testing should be performed on patients in all categories, except those determined to be at very low risk.

High-sensitivity troponin algorithms — stepwise and 0/1-hour protocols and performance are detailed: A stepwise algorithm using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I enabled one third of patients to be ruled in or ruled out with the initial value and another one third ruled out with a 2-hour test, totaling 54.6% ruled out for acute MI within 2 hours with an NPV of 99.4% and sensitivity of 97.7% using a high-sensitivity troponin T test. A separate 0- and 1-hour algorithm with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T used rule-out thresholds of an initial level less than 12 ng/L and a 1-hour Δ less than 3 ng/L and rule-in thresholds of an initial level greater than 52 ng/L or a 1-hour Δ greater than 5 ng/L, achieving an NPV of 99.1% but sensitivity of 96.7%, meaning more than 3 patients of every 100 would have false-negative results.

### Highlights from the 2013 ACCF / AHA guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and beyond [^116h6b5j]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a cardiology emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment aimed at successful and early reperfusion to ensure optimal outcomes. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction since 1990. These guidelines are based on clinical research exploring reperfusion modalities and adjunctive therapies. They are further supported by expert opinion where randomized trial evidence is lacking. In January 2013, the ACCF/AHA released the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. This review focuses on the newest and most important recommendations taken from the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of STEMI and highlight important new studies that have emerged over the past year.

### Combined abciximab REteplase stent study in acute myocardial infarction (CARESS in AMI) [^111p1Rih]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are admitted to hospitals without percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) facilities or are initially managed in a prehospital mobile unit. Thrombolysis remains the most readily available reperfusion treatment in those settings, but the optimal subsequent strategy in those patients is unclear. If a mechanical recanalization is likely to be performed in an emergency, it is probably desirable that the patient receives abciximab, the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist with the strongest evidence of benefit for angioplasty in AMI.

Objective

The aim of this trial is to compare the effects on clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness of 2 strategies after immediate treatment with abciximab and half-dose reteplase for ST-elevation AMI: to manage the patients conservatively (referring them for rescue PTCA only if needed) or to immediately send all patients for emergency coronary angioplasty.

Methods

The Combined Abciximab RE-teplase Stent Study in Acute Myocardial Infarction (CARESS in AMI) is an open, prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial conducted in patients with high-risk ST-segment elevation AMI treated within 12 hours from symptom onset in hospitals without PTCA facilities or in a prehospital mobile intensive care unit. Apart from contraindications to thrombolysis, the main exclusion criteria are age ≥ 75 years and a past history of CABG surgery or a percutaneous coronary intervention procedure involving the infarct-related artery. Enrollment will be performed in hospitals without PTCA facilities or directly in the ambulance if a dedicated system is in place for prehospital diagnosis and treatment of AMI. Patients will receive half-dose reteplase and full-dose abciximab and will subsequently be randomized to conventional medical therapy (with referral for emergency rescue PTCA allowed in selected cases) or emergency angioplasty. The primary end point is the 30-day combined incidence of mortality, reinfarction, and refractory ischemia. In order to obtain a 95% power (2-sided) to detect a 42% reduction in the primary end point, 900 patients are required in each arm of the study. Secondary end points include the 1-year composite end point of mortality, reinfarction, refractory ischemia, and hospital readmission because of heart failure; resource use at 30 days and 1 year; and the incidence of inhospital stroke and bleeding complications in the 2 groups.

Results

Seventy-four patients have been randomized (as of March 10, 2004); results are expected in June 2005.

Conclusion

This study will establish whether angioplasty must be started as soon as possible in all patients who receive combined pharmacologic reperfusion with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor abciximab and half-dose thrombolysis or whether it can be postponed or skipped in patients with signs of successful reperfusion, with obvious organizational advantages.

### Critical pathways in the emergency department improve treatment modalities for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction in a European hospital [^115e5FyF]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The use of protocols for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) is growing, but no definite conclusion regarding the value of critical pathways in Europe has been drawn.

Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of critical pathway on processes of care and outcome for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) of a large urban European hospital because of possible ST-elevation MI.

Methods

Critical pathways for management of acute chest pain at our ED were developed in 1998 and have been revised every year. Accordingly, the records of all patients referred in 1997 to the ED because of chest pain (before pathway implementation) and in 2001 (after last pathway revision) were reviewed. An ST-elevation MI was diagnosed at ED in 520 of 5,066 (10.3%) patients with chest pain in 1997, and in 452 of 4,843 (9.3%) patients with chest pain in 2001. Patients were managed according to the ED cardiologists' decisions in 1997, whereas they entered the pathways for ST-elevation MI in 2001, with predefined criteria for diagnosis, thrombolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention, and admission to the coronary care unit.

Results

Comparison of treatment modalities disclosed that more patients were given thrombolysis in 1997 (49 vs. 16%, p < 0.05), whereas in 2001 more patients were sent to primary angioplasty (63 vs. 11%, p < 0.05). Also in 2001, patients more often received aspirin (90 vs. 61%, p < 0.05) and intravenous beta blockers (60 vs. 35%, p < 0.05) soon after arrival at the ED. Comparison between 1997 and 2001 revealed that admission rates to the coronary care unit (69 vs. 78%, NS) and cardiac wards were similar (19 vs. 10%, NS). Conversely, compared with 1997, patients hospitalized in 2001 had a shorter length of stay (12 ± 5 vs. 18 ± 6 days, p < 0.05), as well as fewer major adverse coronary events (21 vs. 30%, p < 0.05) and lower all-cause in-hospital mortality (12 vs. 20%, p < 0.05). The quality of care indicators improved with time, as door-to-electrocardiogram interval (10 ± 6 vs. 19 ± 9 min, p < 0.05), door-to-needle time (25 ± 10 vs. 35 ± 10 min, p < 0.05), and door-to-balloon interval (70 ± 15 vs. 99 ± 20 min, p < 0.05) were shorter in 2001 than in 1997.

Conclusions

A critical pathway for ST-elevation MI at the ED increases the use of evidence-based treatment strategies and improves outcome and quality of care of patients presenting to a European hospital because of acute chest pain.

Regarding quality improvement for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to healthcare system and hospital requirements, pre-hospital settings, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to ensure that:

- pre-hospital management of patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI is based on regional networks designed to deliver reperfusion therapy expeditiously and effectively, with efforts made to make primary PCI available to as many patients as possible

- patients transferred for primary PCI bypassing the emergency department and coronary care unit/ICU and are transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory

Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) guideline application — scope and potential harm is clarified: If these guidelines are erroneously applied to patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS), there is the potential for increased mortality, and clinicians should recognize that this recommendation applies only to those patients with a diagnosis of NSTEMI.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116oj6Tr]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Clinical presentations of myocardial infarction — onset of myocardial ischemia is the initial step in MI and can be identified from the patient's history and the electrocardiogram (ECG); symptoms may include chest, upper extremity, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort, dyspnea, or fatigue, but they are not specific and MI may be atypical or silent. Very brief ischemia can cause cardiac troponin release and elevations, and the involved myocytes can subsequently die due to apoptosis. If myocardial ischemia is present clinically or detected by ECG changes together with myocardial injury manifested by a rising and/or falling cTn pattern, a diagnosis of acute MI is appropriate; if ischemia is not present clinically, elevated cTn may indicate acute myocardial injury (with rising and/or falling values) or more chronic ongoing injury (if unchanging). In suspected acute coronary syndrome ruled out for MI with normal cardiac biomarkers (≤ 99th percentile URL), unstable angina or an alternative diagnosis may be present, and these patients should be evaluated and treated accordingly.

This large observational study of patients hospitalized with AMI suggests that over the last 10 years there has been a relatively stable rate of AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock, but there has been a decline in the associated in-hospital mortality rate for hospitals with revascularization capability. Based on the SHOCK trial findings, the ACC and AHA revised guidelines elevated early mechanical revascularization for the management of AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock as a class I recommendation for patients younger than 75 years. Despite considerable investment in the development and dissemination of national guidelines for the management of AMI, several recent studies reported. and demonstrate decreasing mortality in elderly patients in association with increasing PCI use in hospitals with revascularization capability.

Regarding quality improvement for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to healthcare system and hospital requirements (pre-hospital settings), ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to ensure that:

- pre-hospital management of patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI is based on regional networks designed to deliver reperfusion therapy expeditiously and effectively, with efforts made to make primary PCI available to as many patients as possible

- patients transferred for primary PCI bypassing the emergency department and coronary care unit/ICU and are transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory

Timely reperfusion is the primary treatment goal for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines utilize time since symptom onset, anticipated time to treatment, patient risk factors, and center volume and experience to determine the optimal reperfusion strategy. There continues to be a considerable number of patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy and treatment delays are still too long. Institution-specific protocols which reflect current guidelines may increase the number of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who receive timely reperfusion.

### Characteristics and outcomes of early recurrent myocardial infarction after acute myocardial infarction [^114xXHNs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Early RMI after an AMI is a life‐threatening condition with poor outcomes. The majority of these reinfarctions occur within the initial 2 weeks after discharge indicating that preventive efforts should be initiated during hospitalization and continued upon discharge. Aggressive risk factor management, medication compliance, and effective transition of care may serve as the vital processes in improving the care of patients with MI.

### State-of-the-art evaluation of emergency department patients presenting with potential acute coronary syndromes [^116QBpPg]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

It is well established that clinicians cannot use clinical judgment alone to determine whether an individual patient who presents to the emergency department has an acute coronary syndrome. The history and physical examination do not distinguish sufficiently between the many conditions that can cause acute chest pain syndromes. Cardiac risk factors do not have sufficient discriminatory ability in symptomatic patients presenting to the emergency department. Most patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction do not present with electrocardiographic evidence of active ischemia. The improvement in cardiac troponin assays, especially in conjunction with well-validated clinical decision algorithms, now enables the clinician to rapidly exclude myocardial infarction. In patients in whom unstable angina remains a concern or there is a desire to evaluate for underlying coronary artery disease, coronary computed tomography angiography can be used in the emergency department. Once a process that took ≥ 24 hours, computed tomography angiography now can rapidly exclude myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in patients in the emergency department.

### MISSION! optimization of acute and chronic care for patients with acute myocardial infarction [^117DUAfb]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guideline implementation programs for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) enhance adherence to evidence-based medicine (EBM) and improve clinical outcome. Although undertreatment of patients with AMI is well recognized in both acute and chronic phases of care, most implementation programs focus on acute and secondary prevention strategies during the index hospitalization phase only.

Hypothesis

Implementation of an all-phase integrated AMI care program maximizes EBM in daily practice and improves the care for patients with AMI.

Aim

The objective of this study is to assess the effects of the MISSION! program on adherence to EBM for patients with AMI by the use of performance indicators.

Design

The MISSION! protocol is based on the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for patients with AMI. It contains a prehospital, inhospital, and outpatient clinical framework for decision making and treatment, up to 1 year after the index event. MISSION! concentrates on rapid AMI diagnosis and early reperfusion, followed by active lifestyle improvement and structured medical therapy. Because MISSION! covers both acute and chronic AMI phase, this design implies an intensive multidisciplinary collaboration among all regional health care providers.

Conclusion

Continuum of care for patients with AMI is warranted to take full advantage of EBM in day-to-day practice. This manuscript describes the rationale, design, and preliminary results of MISSION!, an all-phase integrated AMI care program.

### Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: part I. initial evaluation and management, and hospital care [^111d5Tt4]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Each year, more than 1 million patients are admitted to U.S. hospitals because of unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI). To help standardize the assessment and treatment of these patients, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association convened a task force to formulate a management guideline. This guideline, which was published in 2000 and updated in 2002, highlights recent medical advances and is a practical tool to help physicians provide medical care for patients with UA/NSTEMI. Management of suspected UA/NSTEMI has four components: initial evaluation and management; hospital care; coronary revascularization; and hospital discharge and post-hospital care. Part I of this two-part article discusses the first two components of management. During the initial evaluation, the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and cardiac biomarkers are used to determine the likelihood that the patient has UA/NSTEMI and to aid in risk assessment when the diagnosis is established. Hospital care consists of appropriate initial triage and monitoring. Medical treatment includes anti-ischemic therapy (oxygen, nitroglycerin, beta blocker), antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor), and antithrombotic therapy (heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin).

### Myocardial infarction: contemporary management strategies [^117TefNj]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common clinical diagnosis, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, not only in the short term, but also years following the index event. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of MI has ushered the era of multipronged treatment approach, with a combination of goal-directed revascularization, a broad adjunctive pharmacological therapy and aggressive secondary prevention measures. The goals of this article are to review the basic pathophysiological processes, which lead up to a clinical diagnosis of MI, to highlight the essential elements of clinical presentation and to summarize the evidence for comprehensive therapy. Emphasis has been placed on the choice of primary reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation MI, on risk-stratification of patients with non-ST elevation MI, and on rationale behind the selection of anti-ischaemic and antithrombotic therapy. Finally, evidence-based approach to secondary prevention is outlined.

Introduction — cardiogenic shock (CS) is described as a complex, heterogenous, multifactorial syndrome in which a cardiac disorder results in insufficient cardiac output culminating in end-organ hypoperfusion. CS is one of the most common causes of admission to contemporary cardiac intensive care units and remains a highly morbid and lethal complication, with short-term mortality ranging from 30% to 40% and 1-year mortality approaching or exceeding 50%. CS due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI-CS) has been the most extensively studied form of CS in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have updated their guidelines for the management of non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome for the first time since 2002. In the interim, several important studies affecting choices of therapy potentially begun in the emergency department have been completed, and care patterns have changed and matured significantly. In this review, we present the new recommendations that are pertinent to emergency medicine practice and comment on their potential implementation into an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation and management of this challenging patient population.

### Initial therapy for acute myocardial infarction: socioeconomic implications and limitations [^111wkx5q]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal therapeutic approach for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still evolving; however, many would consider one of two basic options: "medical"-only thrombolysis or reperfusion, or an early (invasive), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The decision about which is most appropriate depends (perhaps unfortunately) on more than just medical factors. That is, the choice for some patients is also limited by payor source and the technical capabilities at the site of the initial treatment. Practically speaking, a significant portion of the US population simply does not have the option of (at least, initial) PCI.

Methods and Results

Kino Community Hospital in Tucson, AZ, serves primarily an indigent population in southern Arizona, near the border with Mexico. This facility does not have in-house capability for PCI. Therefore, shortly after the publication of the original Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 14 study (June 1999), we implemented their combination reperfusion protocol for the initial therapy of eligible patients admitted to the hospital with AMI. This report documents our experience with this medical reperfusion regimen in 42 patients over a span of almost 3 years. A retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate outcome in 42 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction given the TIMI-14 reperfusion regimen. Resolution of ST-segment changes occurred in 30 patients (71.4%) [complete resolution in 25 patients (59.5%) and incomplete resolution in 5 patients (1.9%)], with major bleeding complicating the therapy of only 1 patient (2.38%). After stabilization in our facility, 28 patients (66.6%) needed PCI.

Conclusion

This report summarizes the experience of a small county hospital where medical thrombolysis is the only immediate therapy available.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) — ED troponin testing within 3 hours: Level C recommendations indicate that in adult patients with suspected acute NSTE ACS, conventional troponin testing at 0 and 3 hours among low-risk patients (HEART score 0 to 3) can predict an acceptable low rate of 30-day MACE; a single high-sensitivity troponin below the level of detection on ED arrival, or negative serial high-sensitivity troponin at 0 and 2 hours, is predictive of a low rate of MACE; and in low-risk patients based on validated accelerated diagnostic pathways that include a nonischemic ECG and negative serial high-sensitivity troponins at presentation and at 2 hours, testing can predict a low rate of 30-day MACE allowing for an accelerated discharge pathway from the ED. Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified.

### Critical decision making in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction and other acute coronary syndromes [^116UF3pX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The decision-making process for emergency physicians in managing patients with signs or symptoms of AMI or unstable angina is quite different than that used by other specialists who might evaluate such patients in a less critical setting (e.g., a cardiologist seeing a private patient in an office or outpatient clinic environment). The emergency physician's evaluation must be highly focused and follow established principles of emergency medicine (Fig. 2). Although the evaluation and treatment of all patients must be individualized to some degree, increasing experience at high-volume centers nationally indicates that well-constructed institutional strategies, protocols, and critical pathways can help emergency physicians to provide consistent, cost-effective management of such patients.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department (GRACE): recurrent, low-risk chest pain in the emergency department [^111GHSkQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recurrent low-risk chest pain — single troponin testing: In adult patients with recurrent, low-risk chest pain, insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against a single conventional troponin measurement, while high-sensitivity assays are characterized by cTn measurement within the normal range in at least 50% of healthy individuals with high precision, defined as a coefficient of variance (CV) ≤ 10% at the 99th percentile. Among nine studies with indirect evidence, 72 out of 15,715 patients (0.5%) with low-risk chest pain had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 30 days, and the pooled incidence after a single, normal high sensitivity troponin was 3.4 per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–4.8 per 1000). The main proposed benefit of a single troponin is shorter emergency department (ED) length of stay, with additional potential benefits that patients are spared venipuncture and phlebotomy and hospitals may have lower health-care costs, though these benefits were not addressed by the included studies; the principal harms are missed AMI and MACE that might have been identified with serial testing. Professional guidance differs, with the American Heart Association (AHA) recommending serial troponins and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) providing an option for a single troponin to exclude AMI.

### A framework for exception from informed consent in trials enrolling patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock [^116aZPjQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC WINDOW BASED ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

The current standard of care for patients with AMI is that PCI is initiated within 90 minutes of first medical contact, including emergency medical services providers, so as to reduce infarct size, and improve subsequent prognosis. In the United States, the median door‐to‐balloon time (measured as the elapsed time from patient arrival to the emergency department to the time that a balloon is inflated in a culprit artery) in patients undergoing PCI for acute STEMI is 64 minutes. During this time window, physicians may need to administer adjunctive pharmacologic therapy, manage cardiac arrhythmias, and provide ventilatory support as needed, or initiate insertion of an MCS device as well as initiate PCI. Because consent for studies of PCI and MCS must be sought before initiation of these procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, we propose that the therapeutic window within which enrollment in a trial of MCS before PCI should begin is 30 minutes from emergency department arrival or clinician recognition of the presence of CS. Trials of different interventions or enrolling patients with other acute conditions may involve a different therapeutic window.

There is no need for a second troponin assessment. The diagnosis of NSTEMI is made and appropriate treatment should be initiated. The positive predictive value for NSTEMI in patients with typical symptoms and a substantial (> 20 times the 99th percentile) elevation in cTn is > 90% (section 3.3.3). If the institution uses the ESC hs-cTn T 0h/1 h-algorithm, an initial hs-cTn T concentration above 52 ng/L allows triage of patients towards rule-in.

The next four scenarii highlight how to use the available different types of hs-cTn.

Q8. A 60-year-old patient without prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) presents to the emergency department with recurrent right-sided thoracic chest pain. The last chest pain episode started 5 h prior to hospital admission and is still ongoing. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is normal. The 12-lead ECG is also normal. The initial hs-cTn T level is normal at 4 ng/L (ULN < 14 ng/L). The intern in the emergency department asks you as a cardiology consultant if this single very low hs-cTn T concentration allows the rule-out of NSTEMI.
