## Question

cellcept and mental fogginess?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) commonly causes "mental fogginess" and how to interpret or manage such symptoms if they occur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "mental fogginess" means clinically. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and safety data say about central nervous system adverse effects. Next, I will review disease-specific evidence on cognition with MMF, compare to other immunosuppressants with known neurocognitive toxicity, consider mechanistic and confounding factors such as systemic inflammation and infections like PML, and finally synthesize frequency and provide a practical clinical approach.

> Let me first confirm the construct I am evaluating: "mental fogginess" or "brain fog" generally refers to subjective cognitive complaints such as problems with attention, processing speed, memory, and cognitive effort, and it is often intertwined with fatigue and mood symptoms, so I need to keep those potential confounders in mind while I assess causality and frequency [^11188vgn] [^116C5Jed].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling for MMF regarding central nervous system effects before drawing any conclusions; the prescribing information advises patients that MMF can impair the ability to drive or operate machinery and specifically flags somnolence and confusion among symptoms that warrant caution, which confirms acknowledged but nonspecific CNS effects even if these are not listed among the most common adverse reactions [^112zAjLJ] [^1138ra8g] [^112zAjLJ].

> Hold on, I should check how common the relevant neurological adverse events actually are; in pooled labeling tables, very common adverse reactions include headache and insomnia, whereas confusion and somnolence are highlighted in warnings/precautions without clear incidence estimates, suggesting they are uncommon or of unknown frequency rather than characteristic or frequent, which tempers concern for typical "brain fog" as a common MMF toxicity [^111G1c12] [^112zAjLJ] [^111tA1jk].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence on MMF and cognition in autoimmune disease; a prospective study in SLE using the ACR neuropsychological battery found that MMF use was not associated with cognitive dysfunction over 12 months, which argues against a consistent detrimental cognitive signal from MMF itself in that population [^114ixs4B].

> Let me consider data from neuroimmunology where cognition can be affected by disease activity; in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, adjunctive long-term MMF reduced relapses and was associated with less fatigue and cognitive impairment versus controls, implying potential indirect cognitive benefit via disease control rather than harm, and although I initially thought NMOSD data might be equally definitive, I need to correct myself because the NMOSD evidence is largely retrospective and lower quality regarding cognitive outcomes and does not demonstrate cognitive worsening with MMF [^116Ktoq7] [^116QYtTo].

> I should double-check comparative data with immunosuppressants known for neurocognitive toxicity; calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors have clearer mechanistic and clinical links to cognitive impairment, whereas MMF is generally not implicated in those IL-2–mediated or neurotransmitter-disruptive pathways, positioning MMF as comparatively lower risk for cognitive adverse effects in transplant cohorts, though confounding is common in those studies [^1179TgBZ] [^112iv8YT].

> Let me think about pathophysiology that could confound attribution; chronic systemic inflammation in rheumatic disease contributes to cognitive impairment, and there is emerging evidence that immunomodulatory therapy may reduce dementia risk, so effective disease control with MMF could plausibly improve subjective cognitive function in some patients rather than worsen it, which I need to weigh against rare idiosyncratic CNS side effects [^117WTdG6].

> But wait, what if there is a rare paradoxical reaction; the FDA also describes an acute inflammatory syndrome with MMF presenting with systemic inflammatory features that could theoretically worsen cognition indirectly through cytokine surge and illness behavior, so I should keep this rare entity in mind if "brain fog" accompanies fever, arthralgia, and elevated inflammatory markers soon after initiation or dose escalation, with rapid improvement expected after discontinuation [^113jUvit] [^112FPc3N].

> I need to ensure I am not missing opportunistic infections with cognitive manifestations; immunosuppressed patients on MMF are at risk for infections including JC virus–associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which can present with confusion and cognitive deficits, so new or progressive "brain fog" should prompt evaluation for infectious etiologies in addition to drug effects, with dose reduction or discontinuation considered if infection is identified [^112bZzBQ] [^112tWcqY].

> Let me synthesize frequency and clinical significance now; overall, MMF is not commonly associated with "mental fogginess" per se, with headache and insomnia being the typical neurological complaints, confusion and somnolence listed as uncommon warnings without quantified incidence, neutral effects on cognition shown in SLE, and potential cognitive benefit via disease control observed in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, making true MMF-induced brain fog appear rare and a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes are ruled out [^111G1c12] [^114ixs4B] [^116Ktoq7].

> I will now translate this into a practical approach; if a patient reports new-onset "brain fog" after starting MMF, I should first review disease activity, sleep and fatigue, mood, and pain, then I should review concomitant drugs with known neurocognitive effects such as high-dose corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, screen for metabolic contributors like anemia, uremia, and electrolyte disturbances, and maintain high vigilance for infections including PML; if no alternative cause is found and the temporal relationship is compelling, a cautious dose reduction or supervised discontinuation trial may be reasonable, while counseling that routine cognitive monitoring is not standard for MMF and that prompt reporting of neurologic changes is advised [^112bZzBQ] [^117WLDQr] [^112iv8YT].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that MMF is not commonly linked to mental fogginess, with regulatory labeling acknowledging rare confusion and somnolence, controlled data in SLE showing no association with cognitive dysfunction, and neuroimmunology data suggesting potential indirect cognitive improvement via reduced neuroinflammation, so persistent "brain fog" on MMF warrants a systematic evaluation for alternative etiologies before attributing causality to the drug itself [^112zAjLJ] [^114ixs4B] [^116Ktoq7].

CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) is not directly linked to "mental fogginess" in clinical trials, but **confusion and somnolence** [^112zAjLJ] are reported and can impair alertness [^1138ra8g]. Cognitive symptoms may also reflect **underlying disease** [^117WTdG6] or other medications [^113jcfEG]. If mental fog occurs, assess for infections [^112bZzBQ], metabolic issues [^117WLDQr], or drug interactions [^1147hRdt], and consider dose adjustment or switching therapy if symptoms persist [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence of cognitive side effects

- **Clinical trials and post-marketing data**: Confusion and somnolence [^112zAjLJ] are reported and can impair alertness [^1138ra8g] and cognitive function [^111tA1jk].

- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)**: Rare but serious JC virus–associated PML [^112bZzBQ] can present with cognitive deficits, confusion, and mental status changes [^116cexX7].

- **Mood changes**: Rare mood disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety) have been reported [^115skQL3], potentially contributing to cognitive complaints.

---

## Mechanisms potentially underlying cognitive symptoms

- **Immunosuppression-related infections**: Increased risk of CNS infections (e.g. JC virus) [^112bZzBQ] can cause cognitive impairment [^112tWcqY].

- **Metabolic disturbances**: Electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia) [^117WLDQr] and anemia may contribute to cognitive symptoms [^111G1c12].

- **Drug interactions**: Concomitant medications (e.g. antacids, PPIs, calcium-free phosphate binders) can alter mycophenolic acid exposure [^1147hRdt], potentially affecting cognitive function [^11261wva].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Elderly patients may be at **increased risk** due to age-related pharmacokinetic changes and comorbidities. Patients with **pre-existing cognitive impairment** may be more susceptible to further cognitive decline [^1125cdbr], and **those with renal impairment** may have altered drug clearance that increases the risk of cognitive side effects from CellCept. These factors may heighten susceptibility to cognitive side effects.

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Evaluate for infections [^112bZzBQ], metabolic disturbances [^117WLDQr], and drug interactions [^1147hRdt].

- **Dose adjustment**: Consider reducing the dose or temporarily discontinuing CellCept if cognitive symptoms persist.

- **Alternative immunosuppressive therapy**: If symptoms persist despite dose adjustment, consider switching to an alternative immunosuppressive agent [^115Zs1Ex].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential cognitive side effects and advise them to report any cognitive changes promptly [^1138ra8g].

---

## Conclusion

CellCept is **not directly associated with mental fogginess**, but confusion and somnolence [^112zAjLJ] are reported and can impair alertness [^1138ra8g]. Cognitive symptoms may also reflect the underlying disease [^117WTdG6] or other medications [^113jcfEG]. If mental fog occurs, assess for infections [^112bZzBQ], metabolic disturbances [^117WLDQr], or drug interactions [^1147hRdt], then consider dose adjustment or switching therapy if symptoms persist [^115Zs1Ex].

### Cognitive impairment in individuals with rheumatic diseases: The role of systemic inflammation, immunomodulatory medications, and comorbidities [^117WTdG6]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammation is an important risk factor, a potential therapeutic target for cognitive decline and dementia, and an inherent feature of autoimmune and immune-mediated rheumatic diseases. The risk of cognitive impairment and dementia is increased in individuals with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, particularly in those with cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease. Immunomodulatory medications have been associated with a reduced risk of dementia, but whether this effect is mediated through their anti-inflammatory immunomodulating properties or other mechanisms, such as cardiovascular risk reduction, is unclear.

A better understanding of the role of chronic inflammation as a modifiable risk factor for cognitive performance in rheumatic diseases will help inform opportunities for the management of cognitive impairment in people with rheumatic diseases and other chronic inflammatory diseases. In this series paper, we discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, and evidence on the role of immunomodulatory medications in cognitive impairment and dementia in people with rheumatic diseases.

### Mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [^116QYtTo]. JAMA Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. Recently, various immunosuppressant medications have been introduced as therapeutic options for preventing relapse of NMOSD. However, our understanding of the effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in treating patients with NMOSD is based on only a small number of studies.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of MMF treatment, a 3-center retrospective review was conducted, examining results from 59 patients with NMOSD (24 with neuromyelitis optica and 35 with a limited form of the disease) who were treated with MMF (1000–2000 mg/d).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Patients' annualized relapse rate, disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, and experience of adverse effects due to MMF were assessed.

Of the 59 patients, 1 with NMOSD had to discontinue MMF use in the first month due to a rash and was excluded. The remaining 58 patients were included in the drug-efficacy analysis. The median post-MMF annualized relapse rate was significantly lower than the pre-MMF annualized relapse rate (0.0 vs. 1.5; P < 0.001). The Expanded Disability Status Scale scores also significantly decreased after MMF treatment (3.0 vs. 2.5; p = 0.005). Thirty-five patients (60%) were relapse-free, and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores were stabilized or improved in 53 patients (91%). Fourteen patients discontinued MMF treatment owing to ongoing relapse (10 patients) or rash.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: Relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^11153Mcu]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The term "brain fog" is used to describe a frequent and disabling symptom that can occur following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, the clinical characteristics and the interplay between brain fog, objective cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety remain unclear. This study aims to examine the characteristics of brain fog and explore the influence of fatigue, cognitive performance, and neuropsychiatric symptoms on subjective cognitive complaints.

A total of 170 patients with cognitive complaints related to post-COVID syndrome were evaluated using a comprehensive neuropsychological protocol. The FLEI scale was utilized to characterize subjective cognitive complaints, and correlation analysis, machine learning algorithms, and mediation analysis were employed in the study.

- **Results**: Cognitive complaints mainly involved attention and episodic memory symptoms, with executive function issues (particularly planning) being less frequently reported. The FLEI scale, a mental ability questionnaire, showed strong correlations with a fatigue scale and moderate correlations with the Stroop test, as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms. Random forest algorithms revealed an R² value of 0.409 for predicting FLEI scores, with cognitive tests, fatigue, and depression serving as the most significant predictive variables. Mediation analysis indicated that fatigue was the primary mediator between objective and subjective cognition, while the effect of depression was indirect and influenced through fatigue.

### Brain fog in hypothyroidism: What is it, how is it measured, and what can be done about it [^111TVLJu]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Some levothyroxine (LT4)-treated hypothyroid patients report a constellation of persistent and distressing cognitive symptoms that has been termed brain fog. This narrative review focuses on attempts to define and measure hypothyroid-associated brain fog, summarize possible etiologies and contributing factors, present treatment options, and propose avenues for future research.

Published literature was reviewed to summarize available information on patient-reported symptoms associated with brain fog in hypothyroidism, as well as objective evidence of impairment based on neurocognitive testing and functional imaging studies. Given the limited information specific to hypothyroid-associated brain fog, relevant data from other medical conditions associated with brain fog were also reviewed and incorporated into recommendations for clinical care and future research areas.

Hypothyroid-associated brain fog has not been well defined or quantitated, and the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Symptoms vary among patients but commonly include fatigue, depressed mood, and cognitive difficulties in the areas of memory and executive function. Symptoms often predate the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and the magnitude of cognitive impairment can range from mild to severe. Regardless of severity, these symptoms are associated with impaired quality of life and cause dissatisfaction with treatment, often leading to requests for alternate therapies. Disease-specific and psychological factors impact the experience of brain fog in complex ways, including potential interactions.

### Mycophenolate mofetil [^117XeRnm]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a relatively new systemic immunosuppressive agent whose use is rapidly increasing within the field of dermatology. Originally used in the 1970s for the treatment of psoriasis, MMF has demonstrated efficacy in multiple types of inflammatory skin diseases. Although safety data within the dermatologic literature is sparse, MMF's extensive use within organ transplantation has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. MMF's lack of hepatic or renal toxicity is a significant advantage over immunosuppressive medications currently used in dermatology and makes MMF an attractive candidate for multidrug regimens. In this review, the authors discuss the pharmacology, mechanisms of action, side effects, and uses of MMF reported within the dermatologic literature. The authors also provide practical information regarding the use of MMF, culled from the literature as well as their own clinical experience with the medication.

### Progressive neurological disease induced by tacrolimus in a renal transplant recipient: Case presentation [^113jcfEG]. BMC Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Severe calcineurin inhibitor-induced CNS toxicity is associated with leucoencephalopathy. Neuro-radiological abnormalities are most commonly observed in the parietal-occipital region, appearing as multifocal low attenuation of white matter on CT scans, with corresponding hyper-intense lesions on MRI (T2-weighted). These changes can be very subtle. It has been suggested that less frequent grey matter pathology can be visualized better using MRI with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). However, these changes are not specific. Sixteen patients with cyclosporine neurotoxicity investigated with MRI scans had findings identical to those reported in hypertensive encephalopathy, and in 14 of 16, the symptoms improved after blood pressure normalization.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in calcineurin inhibitor-induced CNS toxicity is usually normal or may show a slight elevation of protein concentration, as in our case. Electroencephalogram (EEG) may be non-specifically encephalopathic with diffuse slowing or may show frank epileptic discharges, as in the present case.

Cases generally occur early when blood levels of tacrolimus or cyclosporine are high, but can also occur with normal levels. A review of 50 reported cases found a median time to onset of 28 days, with 82% occurring within 90 days. Typically, symptoms improved promptly when the dose was reduced or the drug stopped, but recovery can be incomplete. The onset can be late, severe, and irreversible.

From the review of 50 cases by Singh and colleagues, the most frequently presenting symptoms were seizures (74%), altered mental status (50%), and visual abnormalities (28%).

### Mycophenolate mofetil [^113jUvit]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Acute inflammatory syndrome associated with mycophenolate products**: Acute inflammatory syndrome (AIS) has been reported with the use of MMF and mycophenolate products, and some cases have resulted in hospitalization. AIS is a paradoxical pro-inflammatory reaction characterized by fever, arthralgias, arthritis, muscle pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, without evidence of infection or underlying disease recurrence. Symptoms occur within weeks to months of initiation of treatment or a dose increase. After discontinuation, improvement of symptoms and inflammatory markers are usually observed within 24 to 48 hours. Monitor patients for symptoms and laboratory parameters of AIS when starting treatment with mycophenolate products or when increasing the dosage. Discontinue treatment and consider other treatment alternatives based on the risk and benefit for the patient.

- **Immunizations**: During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (e.g. intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines), and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with their physician before seeking any immunizations.

- **Local reactions with rapid intravenous administration**: Mycophenolate mofetil for injection solution must not be administered by rapid or bolus intravenous injection as rapid infusion increases the risk of local adverse reactions such as phlebitis.

### Cellcept [^111zzhW9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to mycophenolate during pregnancy and those becoming pregnant within six weeks of discontinuing CellCept treatment.
- **Risk summary**: Use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of multiple congenital malformations in multiple organ systems [see Human Data]. Oral administration of mycophenolate to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced congenital malformations and pregnancy loss at doses less than the recommended clinical dose (0.01 to 0.05 times the recommended clinical doses in kidney and heart transplant patients) [see Animal Data]. Consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity. Risks and benefits of CellCept should be discussed with the pregnant woman.

The estimated background risk of pregnancy loss and congenital malformations in organ transplant populations is not clear. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: Relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^113WEFuo]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

We conducted a cross-sectional study including 170 patients reporting cognitive complaints in the context of post-COVID syndrome (PCS). The patients met the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for PCS. The following inclusion criteria were considered: (i) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and (ii) diagnosis of PCS according to the WHO criteria (symptoms lasting two months and an interval of at least three months since the acute infection with no other potential causes).

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) any cognitive complaint before COVID-19; (ii) history of neurological or psychiatric disorders potentially associated with PCS symptoms; (iii) history of abuse of alcohol or other drugs; (iv) uncontrolled medical conditions associated with cognitive dysfunction at the moment of the assessment; and (v) sensory disorders potentially impacting cognitive assessments. The mean age of the sample was 49.37 ± 10.96 years, and 73.10% were women. The mean time since acute COVID-19 was 14.50 ± 6.91 months.

- **Sample description and associations**: The patients' clinical and demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1.

We used the FLEI questionnaire to assess brain fog. FLEI is a questionnaire designed to assess subjective cognitive complaints. The test is self-administered by the patient, who must respond to 35 statements using a five-point rating scale (never; rarely; sometimes; often; very often).

### What is brain fog [^11188vgn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

The term 'brain fog' is increasingly used colloquially to describe difficulties in the cognitive realm. But what is brain fog? What sort of experiences do people talk about when they talk about brain fog? And, in turn, what might this tell us about potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms? This study examined first-person descriptions in order to better understand the phenomenology of brain fog.

- **Methods**: Posts containing 'brain fog' were scraped from the social media platform Reddit using Python, over a week in October 2021. We examined descriptions of brain fog, themes of containing subreddits (topic-specific discussion forums), and causal attributions.

- **Results**: A total of 1663 posts containing 'brain fog' were identified, with 717 meeting the inclusion criteria. There were 141 first-person phenomenological descriptions depicting forgetfulness (51 mentions), difficulty concentrating (43), dissociative phenomena (34), cognitive 'slowness' and excessive effort (26), communication difficulties (22), 'fuzziness' or pressure (10) and fatigue (9). Fifty percent (363 out of 717) of the posts were in subreddits concerned with illness and disease, including COVID-19 (87 mentions), psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, autoimmune, and functional disorders. Additionally, 134 posts were in subreddits about drug use or discontinuation, and 44 were in subreddits about abstention from masturbation. Out of 570 posts that included the author's causal attribution, the most frequent attribution was long COVID, mentioned in 60 out of 570 posts (10%).

- **Conclusions**: 'Brain fog' is used on Reddit to describe heterogeneous experiences, including dissociation, fatigue, forgetfulness, and excessive cognitive effort.

### Mycophenolate mofetil for myasthenia gravis: an open-label pilot study [^1177oBma]. Neurology (2001).

In an open-label study, 12 patients with refractory myasthenia gravis (MG) or who were taking only corticosteroids and required additional immunosuppression received mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily for 6 months. Efficacy was defined as a reduction of three points in a quantified MG score and two points in a manual muscle test, or a reduction of 50% in corticosteroid dose. Eight patients improved, beginning after 2 weeks to 2 months. No major side effects were observed.

### Association of mycophenolate and azathioprine use with cognitive function in systemic lupus [^114ixs4B]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction (CD) is a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can have detrimental consequences for those affected. At the time of writing, no treatments have been approved for SLE-associated cognitive dysfunction (SLE-CD). This study aims to assess the association of azathioprine (AZA) and mycophenolate (MMF) use with SLE-CD, given that these medications have demonstrated neuroprotective qualities in prior studies.

- **Methods**: Consecutive adult SLE patients presenting to a single healthcare center were considered for participation. The ACR neuropsychological battery for SLE was administered to consenting patients at 0, 6, and 12 months. Scores were compared with age- and sex-matched controls. The primary outcome was CD, defined as a z-score ≤ -1.5 in two or more cognitive domains. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the odds of CD with respect to AZA and MMF use.

- **Results**: A total of 300 participants, representing 676 patient visits, completed the study. A total of 114 participants (38%) met the criteria for CD at baseline. The cumulative AZA dose (g/kg) was associated with reduced odds of CD [odds ratio (OR) 0.76 (95% CI 0.58, 0.98), P = 0.04]. Years of AZA treatment were also associated with reduced odds of CD [OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.54, 0.97), P = 0.03]. MMF use was not associated with CD.

- **Conclusion**: AZA use was associated with significantly lower odds of SLE-CD, while MMF use was not. Additional studies are warranted to further investigate the relationship of AZA and SLE-CD.

### Unusual risk factors for cognitive decline [^115StcbK]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

The evaluation and management of patients with cognitive decline pose many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While most cognitive disorders require standard screening for common reversible causes, the diagnosis of unusual causes is often delayed or missed. Awareness of these clinical scenarios is important, especially since many are reversible. Coexisting metabolic, nutritional, endocrinal, toxic, and infectious causes can mask subtle and progressive cognitive changes. These changes often become apparent with stress or in the postoperative period, usually after major surgery. Many more factors, including autoimmune, cerebrovascular, genetic, infectious, and hemorheological, are now emerging as unusual causes. This review addresses the recognition and evaluation of these unusual causes of cognitive decline.

### Brain fog in hypothyroidism: Understanding the patient's perspective [^1146Bg1d]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Patient-centered studies have shown that several patients on thyroid hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism exhibit persistent symptoms, including "brain fog". Here, we aimed to determine which of these specific symptoms are associated with brain fog, identify patient-reported factors that modify these symptoms, and identify patient concerns related to brain fog not included in thyroid-specific questionnaires.

- **Methods**: A survey on brain fog symptoms adapted from thyroid-specific patient-reported outcomes was distributed online. Textual data analysis was performed to identify common areas of concern from open-ended survey responses.

- **Results**: A total of 5170 participants reporting brain fog while being treated for hypothyroidism were included in the analysis. Of these, 2409 (46.6%) participants reported symptom onset prior to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and 4096 (79.2%) participants experienced brain fog symptoms frequently. Of the symptoms listed, participants associated fatigue and forgetfulness most frequently with brain fog. More rest was the most common factor provided for improving symptoms. The textual data analysis identified areas of concern that are not often included in thyroid-specific quality of life questionnaires, including a focus on the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, the types and doses of medications, and the patient-doctor relationship.

Conclusion: Brain fog in patients treated for hypothyroidism was associated most frequently with fatigue and cognitive symptoms. Several additional areas of patient concern were found to be associated.

### Mycophenolate mofetil [^114iCpxn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the early post-transplant period (less than 40 days post-transplant), kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 20% to 41% lower and mean Cmax approximately 32% to 44% lower compared to the late transplant period (i.e. 3 to 6 months post-transplant) (non-stationarity in MPA pharmacokinetics).

Mean MPA AUC values following administration of 1 g twice daily mycophenolate mofetil for injection over 2 hours to kidney transplant patients for 5 days were about 24% higher than those observed after oral administration of a similar dose in the immediate post-transplant phase.

In liver transplant patients, administration of 1 g twice daily mycophenolate mofetil for injection followed by 1.5 g twice daily oral mycophenolate mofetil resulted in mean MPA AUC estimates similar to those found in kidney transplant patients administered 1 g mycophenolate mofetil twice daily.

- **Effect of food**: Food (27 g fat, 650 calories) had no effect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of MMF when administered at doses of 1.5 g twice daily to kidney transplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence of food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Mycophenolate mofetil and mood changes in children with skin disorders [^115skQL3]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has intensified the counseling associated with prescribing mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) due to its teratogenicity. This brief report describes two children who were prescribed MMF and, within weeks, developed psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms resolved rapidly after discontinuing the medication and did not recur over 4 years of follow-up. Mood disorders are a rare but possible side effect that should be mentioned when discussing MMF with patients and families. Prompt discontinuation of the drug should lead to a reversal of symptoms when the drug is implicated.

### Cognitive impairment in kidney transplanted patients [^112iv8YT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

- **Immunosuppressive therapy**: As previously described, post-kidney transplant immunosuppression can cause numerous and frequent neurological complications, which may contribute to cognitive impairment (CI). Calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. tacrolimus), cyclosporine, and corticosteroids are the immunosuppressants most commonly associated with neurological complications. Tacrolimus has been demonstrated to impair patients' performance on multidomain cognitive tasks. In addition to negative effects on several cognitive domains, such as selective attention and visual processing, corticosteroids may also lead to psychiatric disorders such as mood changes, insomnia, anxiety, mania, psychosis, or decreased concentration.

- **Pattern of cognitive impairment in kidney transplant recipients**: CI remains highly prevalent in kidney transplant recipients, with prevalence rates ranging from 22.3% to 58%. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cognitive decline, with the prevalence of CI increasing with the CKD stage. Several mechanisms, such as the vascular and neurodegenerative hypotheses or disease-related factors, play an important role in the development of CI in patients with kidney disease. As a result, the clinical picture of CI may vary considerably from one patient to another. Since the majority of transplant recipients are on peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis months or years before the transplant, they are likely to have a similar CI pattern. The impact of immunosuppression must also be considered, as it is typical for more than one cognitive domain (attention, memory, executive functions) to be affected.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: Relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^116C5Jed]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

These findings have important practical implications. According to our findings, "brain fog" may be interpreted as the result of two main processes: objective cognitive impairment and fatigue. Regarding the other factors, only depression showed an influence mediated by fatigue. This underscores the importance of comprehensive assessments of cognitive abilities, especially attention, processing speed, and episodic memory, along with fatigue assessments in patients reporting subjective cognitive complaints.

Thus, a report of brain fog in the context of a neuropsychological assessment within normal limits should suggest a greater role of cognitive fatigue and vice versa. In this regard, the combination of cognitive testing, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms is necessary when evaluating patients reporting cognitive complaints. Cognitive testing should focus on attention and processing speed tests (e.g. Stroop, SDMT); however, other tests should also be performed to evaluate the state of other cognitive domains and for differential diagnosis.

Furthermore, mediation analysis suggests that future studies to alleviate brain fog in these patients should focus on improving cognitive functioning and fatigue. In this regard, some clinical trials on cognitive training and/or non-invasive brain stimulation have shown positive results. Further studies examining the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms in PCS patients and the relationship between fatigue and depression are also necessary. Due to the weak effect of depressive symptoms, antidepressant therapies may not have a direct role in addressing brain fog.

### Cellcept [^112FPc3N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Acute inflammatory syndrome (AIS) has been reported with the use of MMF and mycophenolate products, and some cases have resulted in hospitalization. AIS is a paradoxical pro-inflammatory reaction characterized by fever, arthralgias, arthritis, muscle pain, and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, without evidence of infection or underlying disease recurrence. Symptoms occur within weeks to months of initiation of treatment or a dose increase. After discontinuation, improvement of symptoms and inflammatory markers are usually observed within 24 to 48 hours.

Monitor patients for symptoms and laboratory parameters of AIS when starting treatment with mycophenolate products or when increasing the dosage. Discontinue treatment and consider other treatment alternatives based on the risk and benefit for the patient.

- **Immunizations**: During treatment with CellCept, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (e.g. intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines). Patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with their physician before seeking any immunizations.

- **Local reactions with rapid intravenous administration**: CellCept intravenous solution must not be administered by rapid or bolus intravenous injection, as rapid infusion increases the risk of local adverse reactions such as phlebitis and thrombosis.

### Mycophenolate mofetil for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis [^112rMxBY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system and a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive agent that has been used for the prevention of allograft rejection after renal, cardiac, or liver transplant and in patients with autoimmune diseases such as active relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and progressive MS.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of MMF for preventing disease activity in patients with RRMS.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (January 14, 2013), three Chinese databases (January 2013), and checked reference lists of identified trials. We contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to ask for additional information and applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials with a follow-up of at least 12 months that compared MMF as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments versus placebo, another drug, or the same co-intervention as the treated group.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: One included study involved 26 participants with new-onset RRMS, investigating the efficacy and safety of MMF (13 participants) versus placebo in interferon β-1a-treated participants. It was assessed to be at high risk of bias and included a small number of participants.

### Mycophenolate mofetil-based immunosuppressive minimization and withdrawal strategies in renal transplantation: Possible risks and benefits [^1144yQxZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The toxicity of standard triple-therapy immunosuppressive regimens has been identified as a possible factor in the failure to extend long-term renal allograft survival, despite a continued decline in acute rejection rates. As a result, there has been an increasing focus on the use of mycophenolate mofetil-based, low-toxicity immunosuppressive regimens, which have demonstrated potential in randomized studies to improve long-term graft survival. This clinical update discusses the likely risks and benefits of switching the immunosuppressive regimen in clinical practice.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: Relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^1154ibmU]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

"Brain fog" is a frequent and disabling symptom that can occur after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. However, its clinical characteristics, as well as the relationships among brain fog, objective cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms (such as depression and anxiety), remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the characteristics of brain fog and to understand how fatigue, cognitive performance, and neuropsychiatric symptoms influence subjective cognitive complaints.

A total of 170 patients with cognitive complaints in the context of post‐COVID syndrome were evaluated using a comprehensive neuropsychological protocol. The FLEI scale was used to characterize subjective cognitive complaints. A correlation analysis, regression machine-learning algorithms, and mediation analysis were calculated.

Cognitive complaints primarily involved attention and episodic memory symptoms, while issues with executive functions, such as planning, were less often reported. The FLEI scale, a mental ability questionnaire, showed high correlations with a fatigue scale and moderate correlations with the Stroop test, as well as with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Random forest algorithms indicated an R² value of 0.409 for the prediction of the FLEI score, with several cognitive tests, fatigue, and depression serving as the best variables for prediction. Mediation analysis revealed that fatigue was the main mediator between objective and subjective cognition, whereas the effect of depression was indirect and mediated through fatigue.

### Mycophenolate mofetil in paediatric autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases of the central nervous system: Clinical experience and recommendations [^116cKtVG]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

To gather data on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in paediatric autoimmune/immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) conditions, the study focuses on safety and factors that may affect MMF efficacy.

- **Method**: Retrospective, multicentre study based on four paediatric neurology centres.

- **Results**: Forty-four children were included (30 females, 14 males): 19 had proven/suspected autoimmune encephalitis, 14 had inflammatory demyelinating CNS diseases, and 11 had other autoimmune/immune-mediated CNS conditions. Before MMF, all received first-line immune therapies, and 17 had second-line rituximab and/or cyclophosphamide. MMF was initiated at a median of 9.5 months from disease onset (range 1–127mo) with a median age of 9 years 4 months (range 1 year 5 months-16 years 5 months), and was used for a median of 18 months (range 0.3–73mo). While on MMF, 31 patients were relapse-free, whereas eight relapsed (excluding patients with a chronic-progressive course). Relapses on MMF were associated with medication weaning/cessation or suboptimal MMF dosage/duration. Adverse events occurred in eight patients: six moderate (gastrointestinal, movement disorder, dermatological) and two severe (infectious).

- **Interpretation**: MMF use in paediatric neuroimmunology is heterogeneous, although relatively safe. Factors affecting MMF efficacy were identified, and recommendations on MMF usage are provided.

- **What this paper adds**: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) usage was heterogeneous with relatively common adverse events, although mostly not severe. MMF treatment reduced the median annualized relapse rate, although 20% of patients relapsed on MMF.

### Long-term efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disorders: A prospective study [^113rF7Va]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The relapse rates in the MMF− and MMF+ groups were 44.0% (11/25) and 7.4% (4/54), respectively. Median follow-up times for the MMF− and MMF+ groups were 261.0 and 472.5 days, respectively. The time from index date to relapse in the MMF− group (mean, 118.5 days) was similar to that in the MMF+ group (mean, 114.3 days). Most relapse events in the MMF− group (81.8%) and the MMF+ group (75.0%) occurred within the first 200 days after the index date. For the MMF+ group, the median delay from the index date to receiving therapy was 21 days, and delay times were comparable between relapse (median, 15.5 days) and non-relapse (median, 22.5 days) groups (p = 0.427). One (1.9%) patient in the MMF+ group discontinued MMF because of adverse effects, specifically decreased neutrophil count (0.89×10⁹/L). The numbers needed to treat were 2.7.

### Can mycophenolate mofetil be tapered safely in myasthenia gravis? A retrospective, multicenter analysis [^117DfaqA]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is frequently used to treat myasthenia gravis, but there is little information to guide clinicians on the safety of reducing the dose in well-controlled patients.

- **Methods**: This retrospective chart review at three institutions identified 92 patients who had undergone MMF taper after achieving either pharmacologic remission or minimal manifestations status. Statistical analysis was performed to assess differences in patient characteristics between patients who had successfully tapered MMF and those who relapsed.

- **Results**: Of 92 patients undergoing a taper, 30 relapsed. The relapses were mild, transient, and usually responded to an increased MMF dose. MG crisis did not occur. The mean dose at the time of relapse was 888 mg/day. Patients with relapses were tapered more quickly (8.4 vs. 62.4 months).

- **Conclusions**: Tapering MMF appears safe after years of disease stability. Reducing the dose at a rate of 500 mg/day every 12 months is recommended.

### Cognitive disorders in patients with chronic kidney disease: Specificities of clinical assessment [^1125cdbr]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Cognitive function has been shown to improve after kidney transplantation, specifically in psychomotor speed, attention, visual planning, learning and memory, and abstract thinking. Nevertheless, cognitive impairment (CI) remains more frequent in kidney transplant (KT) patients than in the general population and is associated with frailty measured using the physical frailty phenotype developed. Frail KT recipients are at a higher risk of immunosuppression intolerance and mortality than non-frail patients. Post-KT frailty and cognitive performance are likely dynamic. On the one hand, frailty initially worsens in the first month post-KT but then improves by 3 months post-KT. On the other hand, cognitive performance, assessed by the modified MMSE (3MSE), tends to improve in the first 3 months post-KT. More research is needed to differentiate if post-KT issues, like wound healing, immunosuppression, and infections, may affect the reversal of frailty and CI after KT.

Of note, in animal models, stress and corticosteroids are associated with memory impairment and both reversible and irreversible changes in the hippocampus. Clinical studies observed that exposure to exogenous corticosteroids can change mood and declarative memory, but a negative effect on cognition was modest. Psychopathological signs frequently observed indicate that corticosteroids may also induce functional disorder of additional brain regions (e.g. frontal and temporal lobes), which are important for cognitive and emotional processing. In order to minimize the impact of high-dose steroids and operative procedures, further investigations are required.

### Brain fog in central disorders of hypersomnolence: A review [^113WkZGe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Brain fog is an undefined term describing a cluster of symptoms related to fatigue and impaired memory, attention, and concentration. Brain fog or brain fog-like symptoms have been reported in central disorders of hypersomnolence and in a range of seemingly unrelated disorders, including coronavirus disease 2019, major depressive disorder, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and celiac disease. This narrative review summarizes evidence and proposes a consensus definition for brain fog. Brain fog is prevalent in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, with more than three-quarters of patients with either disorder reporting this symptom in a registry study; it has also been reported as particularly difficult to treat in idiopathic hypersomnia.

Studies directly evaluating brain fog are rare; tools for evaluating this symptom cluster typically are patient reports, with few objective measures validated in any disorder. Evaluating brain fog is further complicated by confounding symptoms, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which is a hallmark of hypersomnolence disorders. No treatments specifically address brain fog. The paucity of literature, assessment tools, and medications for brain fog highlights the need for research leading to better disambiguation and treatment. Until a clear consensus definition is established, we propose brain fog in hypersomnia disorders be defined as a cognitive dysfunction that may or may not be linked with excessive sleepiness, related to an underlying neuronal dysfunction, which reduces concentration and impairs information processing, leading to a diminished cognitive function.

### Meta-analysis of cognitive functioning in patients following kidney transplantation [^1179TgBZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Improved understanding of the aetiology of cognitive impairment after kidney transplantation may enable the development of interventions to improve or maintain cognition. Determining whether there are effects on cognition due to specific immunosuppressive medication has important clinical implications. Impairments in attention and executive functioning in kidney transplant patients treated with either tacrolimus or sirolimus have been reported. In contrast, no such cognitive side effects were reported among cyclosporine-treated patients, who performed similarly to healthy controls after transplantation.

Unfortunately, any discrete cognitive outcomes related to medication treatments in the study had to be averaged across immunosuppressive groups to be included in the review, losing the effects of individual immunosuppressive therapies on cognition. However, it is well established that immunosuppressive medication can impact neural function. In normal central nervous system function, the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been demonstrated to be essential for neurogenesis and cognition; its production and action are inhibited by a number of immunosuppressive drugs, including tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and sirolimus. In addition, dopamine and acetylcholine have been found to be innervated to the prefrontal and parietal regions, which may be involved in executive function tasks requiring working memory, visuospatial working memory, planning, and inhibition. Innervation of these neurotransmitters has been shown to be mediated through IL-2. Thus, interference from immunosuppression in the mechanism of IL-2 can profoundly affect cognitive functions.

### Cellcept [^112bZzBQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections. This risk increases with the total immunosuppressive load. These infections may lead to serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and death [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

- **Serious viral infections reported include**:
	- Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection
	- JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
	- **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections**: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease.
	- Viral reactivation in patients infected with Hepatitis B and C
	- COVID-19

Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of CellCept in patients who develop new infections or reactivate viral infections, weighing the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.

PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patient monitoring may help detect those at risk for PVAN.

PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis when patients report neurological symptoms.

In addition to corticosteroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil are the most frequently used immunosuppressants in North America. We aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of these two drugs and to assess the effect of the dose and duration of treatment.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study at 19 academic centers in Canada and the United States. We included patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with autoimmune myasthenia gravis who had never been treated with immunosuppressants. Treating clinicians determined the choice of medication, dose, follow-up intervals, and drug monitoring. Outcome measures and adverse events were recorded at each visit.

	- **Co-primary outcomes**: We assessed two co-primary outcomes. The first was the patient-reported Myasthenia Gravis-Quality of Life 15-revised (MGQOL-15r) score, measured as the mean change from treatment initiation to the follow-up visit with the lowest score. A clinically meaningful reduction (CMR) in MGQOL-15r was defined as a 5-point decrease.

	- **Composite clinical outcome**: The second co-primary outcome was a composite clinical outcome of disease improvement (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Post-Intervention Status Minimal Manifestations or better) and low adverse event burden (defined as grade ≤ 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events).

We also compared these outcomes in patients receiving an adequate dose and duration of azathioprine (≥ 2 mg/kg per day for at least 12 months) or mycophenolate mofetil.

### Long-term efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disorders: A prospective study [^113mtxS1]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Patient data, including sociodemographic information, clinical events, medical history, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, prescriptions, imaging, and results of serum and CSF tests, were prospectively collected at the time of MSNMOBase enrollment. If a patient was suspected of having MOGAD by a neurologist, serum MOG-IgG was detected by IIFT (FA 1156–1010–50; Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) using full-length human MOG transfected into EUROIMMUN 90 cells. Owing to the recommended semi-quantitative evaluation for the IIFT methodology, MOG-IgG titers were determined according to their fluorescence of the different sample dilutions.

On January 1, 2017, the board of neurologists, ophthalmologists, and pediatricians on MOGAD was established. Participating patients in the MOG cohort received either MMF or non-MMF based on the decisions of the patient or their guardians following a complete and thorough discussion with the board. According to the purpose of this study, patients who rejected MMF but chose azathioprine (AZA) as an alternative were excluded. Thus, the participating patients in the MOG cohort were divided into two therapeutic groups, those with and without MMF therapy, i.e. MMF+ and MMF−, respectively. Besides, all patients in the MOG cohort were given the standard of care. The index date, i.e. the start of the follow-up, was defined as the date when the patient was diagnosed with an MOGAD. We regarded the onset prior and closest to the index date as the "index onset".

We conducted clinic follow-ups every six months after the index date.

### Insights on chronic-relapsing opsoclonus-myoclonus from a pilot study of mycophenolate mofetil [^114EpEwb]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is characterized by abnormal lymphocyte trafficking into the brain. The authors hypothesized that mycophenolate mofetil, a lymphocyte proliferation inhibitor, might be therapeutic. The cerebrospinal fluid and blood immunophenotypes of 15 children with predominantly chronic-relapsing opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome were compared before and after treatment by flow cytometry.

Mycophenolate mofetil reduced the cerebrospinal fluid expansion of HLA-DR+ activated T cells (-40%); the frequency of other T-cell or natural killer cell subsets remained unchanged, but cerebrospinal fluid B cells increased significantly. The adrenocorticotropic hormone dose was lowered by 64% over an average of 1.5 years, yet 73% eventually relapsed despite therapeutic drug levels.

Prior treatment with rituximab prevented relapse-associated increases in cerebrospinal fluid B cells, without hindering mycophenolate mofetil-induced reduction in T-cell activation. These data demonstrate resistant immunologic problems in chronic-relapsing opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Mycophenolate mofetil did not prevent relapse. The novel effect of mycophenolate mofetil on chronically activated T cells may contribute to its efficacy in T-cell mediated neurological disorders.

### Long-term efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disorders: A prospective study [^111k2ZZ8]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Seventy-nine patients from MSNMOBase were enrolled (figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the overall cohort, MMF+ group, and MMF− group are presented. Median age on index date was 19.0 years (IQR, 10.0–30.0 years), and 47 patients (59.5%) were women. Patients in the MMF+ group were slightly older than those in the MMF− group, whereas other demographic characteristics, clinical features, MOG-IgG titer, and follow-up times were comparable between groups. Most patients with nonfirst onset disease course received heterogeneous and irregular prednisone therapy before the index date (100.0% in the MMF− group and 97.6% in the MMF+ group, p = 1.000), but only 3 patients had cyclophosphamide/AZA therapy (1 in the MMF− group and 2 in the MMF+ group, p = 1.000). The previous therapies before the index date were also comparable between the MMF+ and MMF− groups among all patients.

- **Prednisone therapy after index date**: After the index date, 25 patients (100.0%) in the MMF− group and 47 (87.0%) in the MMF+ group received formulary standard tapering prednisone therapy. In the MMF+ group, 1 patient (1.9%) modified prednisone for a suspected new lesion on brain MRI, 2 (3.7%) stopped taking prednisone, and the other 4 patients (7.4%) did not receive prednisone therapy. The prednisone therapy and its tapering time were comparable between the two groups. The antibody's rates of negative transformation, persistent seropositivity, and undetermined status were also evaluated.

### Characterizing patient portal use of people with cognitive impairment and potentially inappropriate medications [^116CjAZL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

People with cognitive impairment commonly use central nervous system-active potentially inappropriate medications (CNS-PIM), increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. Patient portals may be a promising tool for facilitating medication-related conversations. Little is known about portal use by this population related to medications. To target portal interventions, we sought to identify individuals with cognitive impairment and CNS-PIM exposure who discussed medications through the portal and to determine how frequently their messages described possible adverse effects.

- **Methods**: We used electronic health record (EHR) data from an academic health system in Maryland (Site 1) from 2017 to 2022, and pharmacy and EHR data from an integrated health system in Colorado (Site 2) in 2022 to identify people with cognitive impairment and CNS-PIM exposure who communicated about medications through the portal. At Site 1, message threads were manually categorized based on content. At Site 2, messages were categorized using natural language processing (NLP).

- **Results**: The Site 1 cohort included 5543 patients aged 65 and older with cognitive impairment and two or more outpatient visits from 2017 to 2022. Over half (n = 3072; 55%) had CNS-PIM prescriptions. Most with CNS-PIM prescriptions had portal use (n = 1987; 65%); 1320 (66%) of those patients sent messages during possible CNS-PIM exposure. Coding of a 5% random sample of message threads revealed that 3% mentioned CNS-PIM and possible adverse effects, while 8% mentioned possible adverse effects without referencing CNS-PIM.

### Long-term maintenance of mycophenolate mofetil in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (LEARN): A multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomised controlled trial [^116Ktoq7]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) is a severe autoimmune disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Treatments have limitations, including relapse, highlighting the need for effective maintenance therapy. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as long-term adjunctive therapy to first-line treatment in newly diagnosed patients with NMDARE.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, randomised, open-label trial in four academic centres in China. Patients aged 14 and older with acute NMDARE, who received first-line treatments within two weeks of presentation to the hospital and had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2 or more, were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to receive first-line treatment with or without MMF (0.5g two times per day for 24 months). Primary outcomes included relapse rates and time to relapse, with secondary outcomes including cognitive deficits, treatment response (the proportion of patients with ≥ 1 point improvement in mRS within 4 weeks), and adverse events (AEs).

- **Results**: Of 100 patients (52% female; median age 27), those in the MMF group had fewer relapses (5.9% vs. 26.5%; p = 0.006) and better treatment response (84.3% vs. 65.3%; p = 0.03). No significant difference was found in long-term functional prognosis at 12 and 24 months. However, MMF patients had less fatigue, cognitive impairment, depression, and seizures. AEs were mild-to-moderate, with no deaths or anaphylactic reactions.

- **Conclusions**: This study provides Class II evidence that long-term adjunctive treatment with MMF is effective and safe for patients with NMDARE.

### Long-term efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disorders: A prospective study [^113nzi8n]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Standard of care**: Standard of care was defined as relatively fixed therapy in the acute or remission stage of the index onset. It included IV high-dose methylprednisolone, IV immunoglobulin, or a combination thereof in the acute phase, followed by tapering of oral prednisone in the remission stage. Patients in the MMF+ and MMF− groups received the same tapering strategy of oral prednisone in the remission stage.

- **MMF therapy**: MMF therapy was defined as the administration of MMF after the index date and lasting more than 14 days continuously. For adults, standard MMF therapy was 0.75 g twice per day (1.5 g per day). For children (< 14 years), standard MMF therapy was calculated and adjusted by body surface area (600 mg per m²) twice per day and fixed to 1.5 g per day if the maximum dose calculated by body surface area exceeded 1.5 g per day.

- **Potential confounders**: Children were considered < 14 years of age, and adults were considered ≥ 14 years of age. MOG-IgG titers of ≥ 1:100 and < 1:100 were defined as high and low, respectively. Prodromes were divided into three groups: none, preceding infection/vaccination, or other (e.g. fatigue and pregnancy). According to the symptoms and neurologic examination, onset attacks were classed as pure optic neuritis, pure cerebrum involvement, pure spinal involvement, or other (e.g. brainstem syndrome). Disease course at index onset was divided into two subgroups: first (only one attack before index date) or nonfirst onset (≥ 2 attacks before index date). The annualized relapse rate (ARR) before the index date was considered but further data is needed to complete this analysis.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: Relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^113HwoA7]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

"Brain fog" is an umbrella term used to describe a wide variety of cognitive symptoms. This term was previously used to outline subjective mild cognitive difficulties encountered in several medical disorders, including celiac disease, rheumatological disorders (e.g. lupus, Sjögren's syndrome), endocrine disorders (e.g. hypothyroidism), chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia, among others. Recently, the term has gained growing interest due to the frequent development of brain fog in patients who have had COVID‐19. Cognitive disorders were included in the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of post‐COVID syndrome (PCS) as one of the three most frequent symptoms.

Several studies have characterized the cognitive deficits present in PCS, emphasizing the impairment of attention and processing speed, which is the most frequent cognitive domain involved, followed by episodic memory. Although these deficits are generally of low to moderate severity, their impact on daily living activities and work capacity has important socioeconomic consequences. Recent studies have shown that cognitive disorders are associated with structural and functional brain changes in multimodal neuroimaging.

PCS is also characterized by other symptoms, including fatigue (which also has a cognitive dimension) and neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression and anxiety. The relationships among subjective cognitive complaints (known as brain fog), objective cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptom severity are still unclear. Further research is needed to deepen our understanding of these relationships.

### Prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in people with long COVID: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111doeeq]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Long COVID can include impaired cognition ('brain fog'; a term encompassing multiple symptoms) and mental health conditions. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate their prevalence and explore relevant factors associated with the incidence of impaired cognition and mental health conditions.

- **Methods**: Searches were conducted in Medline and PsycINFO to cover the start of the pandemic until August 2023. Included studies reported the prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in adults with long COVID after clinically-diagnosed or PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Findings**: Seventeen studies were included, reporting on 41,249 long COVID patients. Across all time points (3–24 months), the combined prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog was 20.4% (95% CI 11.1%-34.4%). The prevalence was lower among those previously hospitalized than in community-managed patients (19.5% vs. 29.7%, respectively; p = 0.047). The odds of mental health conditions and brain fog increased over time and when validated instruments were used. Odds of brain fog significantly decreased with increasing vaccination rates (p = 0.000).

- **Conclusions**: Given the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog over time, preventive interventions and treatments are needed. Research is needed to explore underlying mechanisms that could inform further research in the development of effective treatments. The reduced risk of brain fog associated with vaccination emphasizes the need for ongoing vaccination programs.
