## Question

6. The "Shenzhou 5" spacecraft launched by our country began to operate on an elliptical orbit with the Earth's center $F$ as one of its foci. It was measured that the perigee $A$ is 200 kilometers above the ground, and the apogee $B$ is 350 kilometers above the ground. The radius of the Earth is 6371 kilometers. Therefore, the maximum angle of view of the Earth from a point on the elliptical orbit is
A. $2 \arcsin \frac{6371}{6571}$
B. $2 \arcsin \frac{6371}{6721}$
C. $2 \arccos \frac{6371}{6721}$
D. $2 \arctan \frac{6371}{6571}$

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the maximum angle of view of Earth from a spacecraft in an elliptical orbit, given perigee and apogee altitudes and Earth's radius, and to choose the correct trigonometric expression among four options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry of the viewing angle and when it is maximized. Then, I should calculate the distances from Earth's center at perigee and apogee. Next, I will derive the angular radius formula using right-triangle trigonometry. After that, I need to check which orbital position gives the largest viewing angle. Finally, I will match the resulting expression to the provided options and verify the inverse trigonometric function choice.

> Let me first confirm the geometric setup. The angle of view of Earth from the spacecraft is the angular radius subtended by Earth at the spacecraft's position; this is the angle between the lines of sight to opposite limbs of Earth, which equals twice the angle from the spacecraft to Earth's horizon, forming a right triangle with Earth's radius and the spacecraft's distance from Earth's center [^notfound].

> I need to calculate the distances from Earth's center at perigee and apogee. Perigee altitude is 200 km, so the distance from Earth's center is 6371 km + 200 km = 6571 km. Apogee altitude is 350 km, so the distance from Earth's center is 6371 km + 350 km = 6721 km. Wait, let me verify that I'm adding the altitude to Earth's radius, not subtracting; yes, the orbital radius equals Earth's radius plus the altitude above the surface, so these values are correct [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the angular radius formula. In the right triangle formed by Earth's radius, the spacecraft's distance from Earth's center, and the line of sight to the horizon, the sine of the half-angle (θ/2) is the ratio of Earth's radius to the spacecraft's distance. Thus, the full viewing angle is θ = 2 arcsin(R_earth / r), where r is the distance from Earth's center. Hold on, I should verify that this is the standard expression; yes, this is the correct derivation for the angular radius of a sphere as seen from a distance [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine which orbital position maximizes the viewing angle. Because the viewing angle is inversely related to the distance from Earth's center, the maximum angle occurs at the closest approach, which is perigee. So I should compute the angle at r = 6571 km, not at apogee. Let me double-check that logic; yes, smaller r gives larger arcsin, so perigee yields the maximum viewing angle [^notfound].

> Plugging in the perigee distance, the maximum viewing angle is 2 arcsin(6371 / 6571). I should confirm the options now. Option A matches this exactly, whereas option B uses the apogee distance and would give a smaller angle, option C uses arccos which is not the correct inverse function for this geometry, and option D uses arctan which does not fit the derived sine relationship. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if arccos could be justified via a complementary angle identity, but that would require a different triangle setup; here, the correct derivation uses arcsin, so A is correct and C is not [^notfound].

> Final answer: A. 2 arcsin(6371/6571).

The maximum angle of view of Earth from the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft occurs at **perigee**, where the spacecraft is closest to Earth. At perigee, the spacecraft is 200 km above Earth's surface, so its distance from Earth's center is 6371 km + 200 km = **6571 km**. The angle of view is the angle subtended by Earth's radius at that distance, given by (2 \\arcsin \\left(\\frac{6371}{6571} \\right)). Therefore, the correct answer is **Option A**.

---

## Calculation of the maximum angle of view

The maximum angle of view occurs at **perigee**, where the spacecraft is closest to Earth. At perigee, the spacecraft is 200 km above Earth's surface, so its distance from Earth's center is:

[
d_{\\text{perigee}} = 6371, \\text{km} + 200, \\text{km} = 6571, \\text{km}
]

The angle of view (\\theta) is the angle subtended by Earth's radius at the spacecraft's position, given by:

[
\\theta = 2 \\arcsin \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{Earth}}}{d_{\\text{perigee}}} \\right) = 2 \\arcsin \\left(\\frac{6371}{6571} \\right)
]

This matches **Option A**.

---

## Verification of other options

- **Option B**: Uses 6721 km, which corresponds to the apogee distance (6371 km + 350 km). The angle of view at apogee is smaller than at perigee, so this is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Uses arccos, which is incorrect for this geometry. The correct function is arcsin.
- **Option D**: Uses arctan, which is also incorrect for this geometry.

---

## Conclusion

The maximum angle of view of Earth from the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft is **(2 \\arcsin \\left(\\frac{6371}{6571} \\right))**, corresponding to **Option A**.

### A star in a 15.2-year orbit around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the milky way [^3bda7734]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Many galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centres-more than a million times the mass of the Sun. Measurements of stellar velocities and the discovery of variable X-ray emission have provided strong evidence in favour of such a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, but have hitherto been unable to rule out conclusively the presence of alternative concentrations of mass. Here we report ten years of high-resolution astrometric imaging that allows us to trace two-thirds of the orbit of the star currently closest to the compact radio source (and massive black-hole candidate) Sagittarius A*. The observations, which include both pericentre and apocentre passages, show that the star is on a bound, highly elliptical keplerian orbit around Sgr A*, with an orbital period of 15.2 years and a pericentre distance of only 17 light hours. The orbit with the best fit to the observations requires a central point mass of (3.7 ± 1.5) x 10(6) solar masses (M(*)). The data no longer allow for a central mass composed of a dense cluster of dark stellar objects or a ball of massive, degenerate fermions.

### Bipolar mood cycles and lunar tidal cycles [^6c2a9f21]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Lunar tidal cycles

The spring–neap cycle exerts its maximum effect on the amplitude of the moon's gravimetric tides every 14.8 days, when the sun, moon and earth are aligned at the full moon and at the new moon. The declination cycle exerts its maximum effect on the tides, in one of the two daily tides, every 13.7 days, when the declination of the moon's orbit relative to the plane of the earth's equator causes the moon to reach the northern or southern extreme of its orbit. This cycle is responsible for the diurnal inequality of the tides at many terrestrial locations.

The 206-day perigee-syzygy cycle exerts its maximum effect on the tides every 206 days, when the sun, moon and earth are aligned at the full moon or the new moon, and the moon most nearly approaches the perigee of its elliptical orbit — an event commonly referred to as a 'supermoon'.

### Low cost satellite constellations for nearly continuous global coverage [^93c7da56]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Many objective evolutionary optimization

The 24- and 48-h-period constellations presented in this study were discovered using multiobjective evolutionary optimization techniques to intelligently search the orbital design space. Figure 5 provides an illustration of orbital elements that must be defined for each of the satellites in the 24- and 48-h-period constellations. These elements define the dynamics and coverage performance. The simulation–optimization framework used in this study was implemented on the University of Illinois Blue Waters petascale supercomputer consisting of hundreds of thousands of cores. The Borg multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) was selected as the optimization tool for this work due to its efficient design for massively parallel search and its ability to perform robustly for severely challenging nonlinear problems. The results reported here were attained from search evaluations of over five million simulated orbital designs. As summarized below, high-fidelity orbit propagation and careful simulation of station-keeping significantly increased the computational demands of simulating each candidate design. More details on the simulation–optimization framework can be found in ref.

Fig. 5
Angular orbital elements referred to in this study.

Inclination is the angle at which the orbit is tilted out of the equatorial plane. Right ascension of the ascending node (, RAAN) is the angle of rotation around the Earth spin axis referenced by convention to the direction of the sun at the vernal equinox. The argument of perigee describes the position of the perigee point relative to the point on the orbit which ascends across the equator. True anomaly is the angle in the orbit plane between a satellite at an instant in time and perigee. In addition to these angular elements, the semimajor axis and eccentricity describe the size and shape of the orbit, respectively.

### A confirmation of the general relativistic prediction of the lense-thirring effect [^8b02b627]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

An important early prediction of Einstein's general relativity was the advance of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit, whose measurement provided one of the classical tests of Einstein's theory. The advance of the orbital point-of-closest-approach also applies to a binary pulsar system and to an Earth-orbiting satellite. General relativity also predicts that the rotation of a body like Earth will drag the local inertial frames of reference around it, which will affect the orbit of a satellite. This Lense-Thirring effect has hitherto not been detected with high accuracy, but its detection with an error of about 1 per cent is the main goal of Gravity Probe B — an ongoing space mission using orbiting gyroscopes. Here we report a measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect on two Earth satellites: it is 99 ± 5 per cent of the value predicted by general relativity; the uncertainty of this measurement includes all known random and systematic errors, but we allow for a total ± 10 per cent uncertainty to include underestimated and unknown sources of error.

### Explaining the apparent impenetrable barrier to ultra-relativistic electrons in the outer van allen belt [^705d4fcc]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The radiation belts were one of the first discoveries of the space age. Early in-situ satellite observations revealed that the belts consist of relativistic electrons and ions, populating an inner and outer belt, which were separated by a region void of relativistic particles called the slot. Typically, ultra-relativistic electrons with energies ≳ 2 MeV are confined to the outer radiation belt, outside the slot. It is generally agreed that the morphology and dynamics of the radiation belts are influenced by wave–particle interactions, which lead to both acceleration and loss. Acceleration processes, such as radial diffusion driven by ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves, and/or local accelerationthrough interaction with lower band whistler mode chorus, as well as wave–particle loss processes – must combine in such a way to create the observed belt dynamics. In addition, outward ULF wave radial transport in combination with magnetopause shadowing can also result in outer radiation belt electron loss –. However, how these processes act to collectively produce the observed morphology, and the relative importance of multiple competing acceleration and loss processes under different solar wind driving conditions, remain relatively poorly understood. The NASA Van Allen Probes (formerly known as the Radiation Belt Storm Probes) consist of two elliptically orbiting spacecraft with an inclination of ~ 10°, passing from altitudes of ~ 600 km at perigee to L ~ 6 at apogee (where L is the distance from the equatorial crossing point of a dipole magnetic field line to the centre of the Earth, in units of Earth radii). Using ultra-relativistic (≳ 2 MeV) electron measurements taken over the first 20 months of the Van Allen Probes mission, Baker et al.identified a previously unknown and unexplained apparent impenetrable barrier located at L ~ 2.8, representing a point where the radial gradient of ultra-relativistic electron flux is extremely steep and beyond which the ultra-relativistic electrons do not penetrate. As described by Baker et al. this apparent barrier is not co-located with the plasmapause or any other identifiable magnetospheric boundary. It has also recently been suggested that the sharp boundary in ultra-relativistic electron flux at L = 2.8 might be explained by losses from a sharp outer edge to fast pitch angle scattering into the atmosphere arising from a resonant interaction with man-made very-low frequency (VLF) waves injected into the magnetosphere by ground-based transmitters (e.g. Foster et al.). Note, however, that at lower energies such a barrier feature is not as apparent, with lower energy electrons penetrating more frequently into the slot region,–

### The formation of cluster elliptical galaxies as revealed by extensive star formation [^d8eec0a6]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

The most massive galaxies in the present-day Universe are found to lie in the centres of rich clusters. They have old, coeval stellar populations suggesting that the bulk of their stars must have formed at early epochs in spectacular starbursts, which should be luminous phenomena when observed at submillimetre wavelengths. The most popular model of galaxy formation predicts that these galaxies form in proto-clusters at high-density peaks in the early Universe. Such peaks are indicated by massive high-redshift radio galaxies. Here we report deep submillimetre mapping of seven high-redshift radio galaxies and their environments. These data confirm not only the presence of spatially extended regions of massive star-formation activity in the radio galaxies themselves, but also in companion objects previously undetected at any wavelength. The prevalence, orientation, and inferred masses of these submillimetre companion galaxies suggest that we are witnessing the synchronous formation of the most luminous elliptical galaxies found today at the centres of rich clusters of galaxies.

### Elliptical ejecta of asteroid dimorphos is due to its surface curvature [^8a71fda8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Kinetic deflection is a planetary defense technique delivering spacecraft momentum to a small body to deviate its course from Earth. The deflection efficiency depends on the impactor and target. Among them, the contribution of global curvature was poorly understood. The ejecta plume created by NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test impact on its target asteroid, Dimorphos, exhibited an elliptical shape almost aligned along its north-south direction. Here, we identify that this elliptical ejecta plume resulted from the target's curvature, reducing the momentum transfer to 44 ± 10% along the orbit track compared to an equivalent impact on a flat target. We also find lower kinetic deflection of impacts on smaller near-Earth objects due to higher curvature. A solution to mitigate low deflection efficiency is to apply multiple low-energy impactors rather than a single high-energy impactor. Rapid reconnaissance to acquire a target's properties before deflection enables determining the proper locations and timing of impacts.

### Observations of discrete harmonics emerging from equatorial noise [^3fe2b901]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

Cluster mission

The European Space Agency (ESA) Cluster missionconsists of four identically instrumented spacecraft in a polar, eccentric orbit (apogee 18.6, perigee 3 Earth radii) with a period of 57 h. Launched in August 2000, the mission has been operating since February 2001. During its lifetime, the inter-satellite separation has varied from less than a few hundred kilometres to over 20,000 km, to explore processes occurring within the magnetosphere at different spatial scales (see Supplementary note 3).

To resolve the long-standing scientific question of the generation and propagation of the equatorial noise, ESA's Cluster mission conducted a special Inner Magnetosphere Campaign aimed at studying the structure of these waves in their source region. Figure 1 shows that on 6 July 2013, all four spacecraft were close to the geomagnetic equator. Clusters 3 and 4 were very close to each other, within 60 km, while Cluster 1 was ∼800 km from Clusters 3 and 4, and Cluster 2 was around 4,400 km in the earthward direction from the trio. Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 8 show the expected wavelength of the magnetosonic waves. Satellites 3 and 4 are separated by a maximum of 3–5 wavelengths, depending upon the propagation direction with respect to the separation vector.

The observations of waves made by the Cluster Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations (STAFF) instrument on 6 July 2013, between 18:40 and 18:55, not only present observational evidence for their generation, but also show the most remarkable example of their banded structure ever observed in space. Despite being commonly referred to as magnetosonic noise, the emissions observed by the Clusters 3 and 4 spacecraft separated by 60 km have a remarkably clear discrete structure between the 17th and 30th harmonics of the proton gyrofrequency (Fig. 2) in the frequency range in which equatorial noise is usually observed. This previously unobserved, well organized and periodic structure provides definitive evidence that these waves are generated by protons. The exact match between the harmonics and observed emissions lines shows that these observations are made right in the wave source region.

### Low cost satellite constellations for nearly continuous global coverage [^4f5002a4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

High-fidelity orbit propagation and station-keeping

Modeling the orbital motion of the satellites in high fidelity allows the Borg MOEA to identify solutions that maximally harness the energy of naturally occurring perturbation forces to improve global coverage while simultaneously simulating station-keeping requirements. The Aerospace Corporation's SHARK propagator accomplishes long-term orbit propagation in this work. SHARK is a general-purpose and configurable orbit propagator that can numerically simulate the motion of any Earth-orbiting spacecraft using models that have no known numerical singularities. SHARK is configured in this study to include a 4 × 4 representation of Earth's gravity as well as solar and lunar third-body gravitational perturbations; these were selected to maintain consistency with prior results. Other perturbing effects, such as drag, solar radiation pressure, and higher order geopotential terms, are generally dominated by those modeled in this study at the orbit periods of interest. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows that, although higher order geopotential terms could be incorporated in this framework, their inclusion does not materially affect the results. The model simulates station-keeping maneuvers to maintain the radius of perigee, inclination, and relative phasing between constellation members. The radius of perigee is maintained to within 1,000 km and inclination is maintained to withinof the initial configuration. Relative phase positioning between satellites is maintained with a feed-forward active control that operates on a 2-week cycle. In general, the dominant source of station-keepingin the orbits of interest is inclination control. This fact known a priori about the design space motivated the decision not to incorporate RAAN station-keeping. A series of Chebyshev polynomials capture the final numerically generated orbit state history for each satellite in memory, which permits efficient evaluation of constellation coverage performance. The Supplementary Methods section provides additional details on all of the simulation and search components of this work.

### Earth's trojan asteroid [^3b3be5be]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

It was realized in 1772 that small bodies can stably share the same orbit as a planet if they remain near 'triangular points' 60° ahead of or behind it in the orbit. Such 'Trojan asteroids' have been found co-orbiting with Jupiter, Mars and Neptune. They have not hitherto been found associated with Earth, where the viewing geometry poses difficulties for their detection, although other kinds of co-orbital asteroid (horseshoe orbiters and quasi-satellites) have been observed. Here we report an archival search of infrared data for possible Earth Trojans, producing the candidate 2010 TK(7). We subsequently made optical observations which established that 2010 TK(7) is a Trojan companion of Earth, librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L(4). Its orbit is stable over at least ten thousand years.

### Climate variations on earth-like circumbinary planets [^385df521]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Periodic variations in total solar irradiance

Owing to changes in the distance of the planet relative to the two stars of the Kepler-35 system, the total solar irradiance (TSI) varies with time. The changes in the TSI of a planet orbiting the Kepler-35 binary show a double periodic behaviour (Fig. 1a, b, d, e). For a (habitable) planet with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. these periods are of around 22 and 360 Earth-days. The oscillation with a period of approximately 22 Earth-days is caused by the rotation of the stars around the common centre of mass and will henceforth be denoted by O B. The maximum of TSI with respect to O B is attained when the more luminous star is closest to the planet (Fig. 1, t 1) and the minimum when the less luminous star is closest (Fig. 1, t 3). The oscillation with a period of around 360 Earth-days is caused by the eccentricity of the planetary orbit and will henceforth be denoted by O P. The maximum of that oscillation is reached when the planet is closest to the centre of mass (Fig. 1, t 2) and the minimum when the planet is at apastron (Fig. 1, t 4). Note that an orbit cannot remain circular around a double star, due to angular momentum exchange between the stellar and planetary orbits. In nearly coplanar systems such as Kepler-35, solar eclipses occur in intervals of around 11 Earth-days and result in a brief but substantial reduction in TSI. An interesting peculiarity of this system is that due to the stellar parallax more than one hemisphere of the planet is illuminated at all times except during eclipses. A spectral analysis reveals that the amplitude of the oscillation of the global-mean TSI (which is equal to TSI/4) with a period of O B is 18.8 W m −2 and the one of O P is 5.5 W m −2 (Fig. 2a). Including the solar eclipses, the daily-mean of the global-mean TSI varies roughly from 300 to 370 W m −2 over one orbital period (Fig. 1d) during the time-span we have considered. Owing to oscillations of planet's orbital eccentricity, the variations in TSI from O P change. The climates presented here were evaluated over a 10,800-Earth-day period where the planet's orbital eccentricity was close to the forced eccentricity.

### Propagation of an earth-directed coronal mass ejection in three dimensions [^1d426bf8]. Nature Communications (2010). Medium credibility.

Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most significant drivers of adverse space weather on Earth, but the physics governing their propagation through the heliosphere is not well understood. Although stereoscopic imaging of CMEs with NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) has provided some insight into their three-dimensional (3D) propagation, the mechanisms governing their evolution remain unclear because of difficulties in reconstructing their true 3D structure. In this paper, we use a new elliptical tie-pointing technique to reconstruct a full CME front in 3D, enabling us to quantify its deflected trajectory from high latitudes along the ecliptic, and measure its increasing angular width and propagation from 2 to 46 (∼0.2 AU). Beyond 7, we show that its motion is determined by an aerodynamic drag in the solar wind and, using our reconstruction as input for a 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we determine an accurate arrival time at the Lagrangian L1 point near Earth.

### Orbital stability analysis and photometric characterization of the second earth trojan asteroid 2020 XL [^a49e8f05]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Delta-v budget: patched-conics approach

Despite the proximity of the ETs orbits, they are still deep-space targets, and thus, any practical mission to this kind of orbits is likely to make use of gravity-assists and/or low-thrust solar electric propulsion (SEP). However, for the purpose of this paper, we limited our search to sub-optimal delta-v trajectories using a patched-conics approach with ballistic trajectory.

For the heliocentric segment of the transfer trajectory, we solved Lambert's boundary value problem (BVP) in order to determine the Keplerian orbit that connects the spacecraft and the target asteroid in space in a given elapsed time. Lambert's BVP solver is very computationally fast, which allows us to do a quick survey of ballistic transfers from Earth to 2020 XL 5 for different departure dates and time-of-flights (TOF). For this paper, we used the multi-revolutions Lambert's problem solverimplemented within the pykep softwareby the mission analysis team at ESA/ESOC.

For the geocentric portion of the trajectory, the escape orbit is calculated starting from both a low Earth orbit (LEO) at approximately 300 km, and a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with a perigee altitude of also 300 km and the apogee at GEO altitude. In general, similar research works only deal with a simple launch from LEO; however, it is very expensive to go from LEO directly to escape with only chemical propulsion. For this reason, we also considered the GTO orbit, which is more common in actual space missions (especially if we assume a shared launch) and reduces significantly the cost of getting out of the Earth's sphere of influence (SOI).

### Geological constraints on tidal dissipation and dynamical ellipticity of the earth over the past three million years [^8cc3aede]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The evolution of the Solar System has been shown to be chaotic, which limits our ability to retrace the orbital and precessional motion of the Earth over more than 35–50 Myr (ref. 2). Moreover, the precession, obliquity and insolation parameters can also be influenced by secular variations in the tidal dissipation and dynamical ellipticity of the Earth induced by glacial cyclicity and mantle convection. Here we determine the average values of these dissipative effects over the past three million years. We have computed the optimal fit between an exceptional palaeoclimate record from the eastern Mediterranean Sea and a model of the astronomical and insolation history by testing a number of values for the tidal dissipation and dynamical ellipticity parameters. We find that the combined effects of dynamical ellipticity and tidal dissipation were, on average, significantly lower over the past three million years, compared to their present-day values (determined from artificial satellite data and lunar ranging). This secular variation associated with the Plio-Pleistocene ice load history has caused an average acceleration in the Earth's rotation over the past 3 Myr, which needs to be considered in the construction of astronomical timescales and in research into the stationarity of phase relations in the ocean-climate system through time.

### Solar system expansion and strong equivalence principle as seen by the NASA MESSENGER mission [^23fe7533]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The individual normal equations of all these arcs were combined and inverted to yield the final estimates of the geophysical, heliophysics, and relativity parameters. The orbit of the Earth is not integrated and adjusted in this study since the orbital accuracy of the Earth from the JPL DE432 ephemerides is comparable to the precision of the MESSENGER data.

MESSENGER data set

The data processed in this paper include the three MESSENGER flybys around Mercury, and the whole orbital mission. The three flybys occurred on 14 January 2008, 6 October 2008, and 29 September 2009, respectively. MESSENGER was inserted in a highly eccentric and near-polar orbit about Mercury on 18 March 2011. The initial period was ~12 h and the orbital periapsis was at ~200-km altitude and ~60°N latitude. Orbit-correction maneuvers (OCMs) were required to maintain the periapsis between 200 and 500 km for the first year of operations. The third-body perturbation of the Sun combined with the high eccentricity of the orbit led to a significant drift of the periapsis altitude and latitude.

The mission was extended for a second year in March 2012. The OCMs became less frequent, and one of them was used to reduce the orbital period to ~8 h. A second extended mission (XM2) started in March 2013 and included a low-altitude campaign until Mercury impact on 28 April 2015. The fuel reserves enabled the spacecraft to maintain periapsis altitudes as low as 15–25 km for several weeks. NASA's DSN stations tracked the spacecraft during part of these passages from April to October 2014 leading to accurate measurements of Mercury's gravity at altitudes between 25 and 100 km. In the last 6 months of the mission, the closest approaches of MESSENGER were occulted by Mercury and were thus not visible from the Earth. However, additional range-rate and range measurements were collected at low altitudes between 75 and 100 km.

The data included in this study were collected over ~900 days. The greater part of the excluded data is because of high levels of plasma noise in proximity of superior solar conjunctions (SPE < 35°). Other arcs were also omitted because of the presence of OCMs or reaction wheel momentum desaturation maneuvers that imparted significant ΔVs leading to significant orbital errors.

### Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid vesta by the dawn mission [^be781b55]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Under the above assumptions of equal incident power and equal surface area illuminated at 89° incidence, the relative strengths of surface echo reflections (σ/σ max) can then be attributed to differences in the relative reflectivity of the surface material itself or variations in the roughness of the surface at the scale of the radar wavelength. Potentially greater obstruction of the incident power would result in an increase of σ (km 2), but assuming equal obstruction for all surface echoes, this does not change the relative radar cross section (σ/σ max).

Uncertainty in the differential Doppler shift

The primary sources of uncertainty in theoretical δf include the positions and velocities of (1) the spacecraft and (2) the radar-illuminated surface echo site on Vesta as listed in Supplementary Table 4. We assume that uncertainty in the position and velocity of Earth is negligible at such distances. For a given parameter Y ± Δ Y that depends on multiple variables X i ± (Δ X) i, we calculate Δ Y by summing in quadrature the partial derivative of each contributing variable (∂X i /∂Y) multiplied by its uncertainty (Δ X) i.

The position of the Dawn spacecraft is provided in Cartesian coordinates from SPICE ephemerides with an uncertainty of ± 3 m in the radial, along-track and cross-track directions from the reconstructed trajectory of LAMO, while the error in the position of the echo site on Vesta's surface is calculated from (1) uncertainty in the radius of the echo site from Vesta's center ± ~0.5 km — due to topography within the large surface area illuminated by the HGA beam at grazing incidence — and (2) uncertainty in the latitude and longitude of the echo site center by ± ~0.2°. Uncertainties in the geodetic coordinates of the echo site are then converted to Cartesian coordinates at a height above or below a reference triaxial ellipsoid — which is defined using the best-fit ellipsoid derived from Hubble light-curve observations of Vesta, where R x = 289 km, R y = 280 km and R z = 229 km. Uncertainties in the x, y and z coordinates of the echo site for occultation entry of orbit 355 are on the order of ~0.7 km for the occultation entry of orbit 355.

### Up-to-fivefold reverberating waves through the earth's center and distinctly anisotropic innermost inner core [^e748c31a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Probing the Earth's center is critical for understanding planetary formation and evolution. However, geophysical inferences have been challenging due to the lack of seismological probes sensitive to the Earth's center. Here, by stacking waveforms recorded by a growing number of global seismic stations, we observe up-to-fivefold reverberating waves from selected earthquakes along the Earth's diameter. Differential travel times of these exotic arrival pairs, hitherto unreported in seismological literature, complement and improve currently available information. The inferred transversely isotropic inner-core model contains a ~650-km thick innermost ball with P-wave speeds ~4% slower at ~50° from the Earth's rotation axis. In contrast, the inner core's outer shell displays much weaker anisotropy with the slowest direction in the equatorial plane. Our findings strengthen the evidence for an anisotropically-distinctive innermost inner core and its transition to a weakly anisotropic outer shell, which could be a fossilized record of a significant global event from the past.

### The variable source of the plasma sheet during a geomagnetic storm [^cb5758e9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Figure 2 shows the orbits of the Arase and MMS-1 satellites from before the storm through the storm's early recovery, projected into the X-Y and X-Z geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) planes. Arase spacecraft apogee was in the dusk-side near-earth plasma sheet. With an orbital period of 9.5 h, it samples the near-earth plasma sheet (defined as L > 5) for 6.5 h, then passes through the inner magnetosphere and comes out again to measure the near-earth plasma sheet for another 6.5 h. Thus, it samples the plasma sheet throughout the storm, with gaps for the inner magnetosphere passes. The MMS spacecraft has highly elliptical near-equatorial orbits with 25 Re apogee. Before the storm, MMS moves inbound through the central plasma sheet. The instruments turn off at 20:00 UT on Sept 7, before the spacecraft enters the inner magnetosphere. They turn on again at 1:00 UT on Sept 8, on their outbound pass, moving towards the dusk-side, and ultimately out into the magnetosheath.

### Past, present and future stars that can see earth as a transiting exoplanet [^94d0c088]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

In the search for life in the cosmos, transiting exoplanets are currently our best targets. With thousands already detected, our search is entering a new era of discovery with upcoming large telescopes that will look for signs of 'life' in the atmospheres of transiting worlds. Previous work has explored the zone from which Earth would be visible while transiting the Sun 1–4. However, these studies considered only the current position of stars, and did not include their changing vantage point over time. Here we report that 1,715 stars within 100 parsecs from the Sun are in the right position to have spotted life on a transiting Earth since early human civilization (about 5,000 years ago), with an additional 319 stars entering this special vantage point in the next 5,000 years. Among these stars are seven known exoplanet hosts, including Ross-128, which saw Earth transit the Sun in the past, and Teegarden's Star and Trappist-1, which will start to see it in 29 and 1,642 years, respectively. We found that human-made radio waves have already swept over 75 of the closest stars on our list.

### An earth-mass planet orbiting α centauri B [^74292165]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Exoplanets down to the size of Earth have been found, but not in the habitable zone — that is, at a distance from the parent star at which water, if present, would be liquid. There are planets in the habitable zone of stars cooler than our Sun, but for reasons such as tidal locking and strong stellar activity, they are unlikely to harbour water-carbon life as we know it. The detection of a habitable Earth-mass planet orbiting a star similar to our Sun is extremely difficult, because such a signal is overwhelmed by stellar perturbations. Here we report the detection of an Earth-mass planet orbiting our neighbour star α Centauri B, a member of the closest stellar system to the Sun. The planet has an orbital period of 3.236 days and is about 0.04 astronomical units from the star (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance).

### Low cost satellite constellations for nearly continuous global coverage [^cc073e05]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The constellation designs reported here account for many considerations made in early mission planning. However, they are likely not optimized for specific mission objectives, which would likely require minor modifications, yet are worthy of further consideration by mission planners. Not all missions will find added utility with this class of constellation design compared with other design options, such as medium-earth orbit, geostationary orbit, or highly elliptical orbits (HEO).

Geostationary orbits in particular afford mission planners a fixed subsatellite point that may present an advantage for broader end-to-end mission considerations over the reduction in station-keeping propellant reported here for the designs. However, many governments and commercial interests appear to be pivoting their GEO-based capabilities to low earth orbit. As a result, significant investments are being made to reduce the regrets associated with a moving subsatellite point, which may increase the benefits for the reported designs in this study. The reported designs provide nearly continuous coverage, with repeatable gaps as reported here. However, GEO constellations do not provide any access to the planet's polar regions, which is also a driving requirement for some mission areas. Some traditional GEO constellation designs which serve missions that have polar coverage requirements augment that baseline constellation with services from HEO platforms to fill the gap. Because the gaps in coverage experienced by the reported designs are fixed on the ground, it is possible that for missions that require truly continuous global coverage that the reported designs may likewise be augmented by partnering with or hosting mission payloads on some of the many available GEO space platforms. In these circumstances, the reported constellation designs represent a foundation for broader end-to-end architecture, particularly for disadvantaged entrants who may be able to cover gaps in their capability through partnerships and hosting arrangements.

The designs reported here likewise account for some early considerations in constellation operation and management, but do not represent a fully optimized constellation management approach for an operational system. Additional reduction in station-keeping requirements may be realized through alternate mission management approaches and by providing the optimizer with control over decisions related to that in identifying constellation design alternatives.

### Theory of chaotic orbital variations confirmed by cretaceous geological evidence [^636c7f5b]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Variations in the Earth's orbit and spin vector are a primary control on insolation and climate; their recognition in the geological record has revolutionized our understanding of palaeoclimate dynamics, and has catalysed improvements in the accuracy and precision of the geological timescale. Yet the secular evolution of the planetary orbits beyond 50 million years ago remains highly uncertain, and the chaotic dynamical nature of the Solar System predicted by theoretical models has yet to be rigorously confirmed by well constrained (radioisotopically calibrated and anchored) geological data. Here we present geological evidence for a chaotic resonance transition associated with interactions between the orbits of Mars and the Earth, using an integrated radioisotopic and astronomical timescale from the Cretaceous Western Interior Basin of what is now North America. This analysis confirms the predicted chaotic dynamical behaviour of the Solar System, and provides a constraint for refining numerical solutions for insolation, which will enable a more precise and accurate geological timescale to be produced.

### Solar system expansion and strong equivalence principle as seen by the NASA MESSENGER mission [^b2fc0f76]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We numerically integrate the spacecraft and planet orbits simultaneously in order to provide a comprehensive solution that includes geophysical, heliophysics, and relativity results together with their associated covariances. Here we focus on the results that provide new information on the interior of the Sun and on gravitational theories.

The accuracy of the heliophysics and relativity results largely depends on the precision of the range data. Measurement noise is incurred by the electronics of the radio frequency (RF) telecommunications subsystem onboard the spacecraft that relays spacecraft telemetry and performs as a radio science instrument. The MESSENGER RF subsystem operated at X-band frequencies (7.2 GHz uplink, 8.4 GHz downlink) and its two opposite-viewing phased-array antennas (PAAs) were used to conduct the range data campaigns (Methods).

Figure 1 shows the level of noise of the range data collected over the entire MESSENGER mission. Each point represents the range data RMS (root mean square) during each full tracking pass, which usually provides one measurement every 5 min for several hours, as a function of the Sun–Probe–Earth (SPE) angle. The relative position of the Sun and Earth during MESSENGER radio observations strongly controls the tracking data quality. The solar plasma causes phase scintillations in the RF signal, increasing the noise of both range-rate and range measurements. At low SPE angles (near superior solar conjunctions), the Sun is located between Mercury and the Earth, and the mean level of noise increases from < 0.5 m for 90° < SPE < 180° to ~1.5 m for 35° < SPE < 90° (Fig. 1). MESSENGER orbits close to superior solar conjunctions (SPE < 35°) are not included in the solution because of plasma-induced range errors higher than 3 m. The exclusion of these data does not degrade the phase sampling of Mercury's orbit over the full MESSENGER mission. Figure 2 shows a histogram of the number of the processed measurements vs. the Mercury orbital phase. A great portion of data was collected in proximity to Mercury's perihelion and aphelion, enabling precise measurements of the precession induced by solar and relativistic effects. The rest of Mercury's orbit was evenly sampled, and the level of noise is sufficiently uniform for all orbital phases.

### Rotational breakup as the origin of small binary asteroids [^03635666]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Asteroids with satellites are observed throughout the Solar System, from subkilometre near-Earth asteroid pairs to systems of large and distant bodies in the Kuiper belt. The smallest and closest systems are found among the near-Earth and small inner main-belt asteroids, which typically have rapidly rotating primaries and close secondaries on circular orbits. About 15 per cent of near-Earth and main-belt asteroids with diameters under 10 km have satellites. The mechanism that forms such similar binaries in these two dynamically different populations was hitherto unclear. Here we show that these binaries are created by the slow spinup of a 'rubble pile' asteroid by means of the thermal YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack) effect. We find that mass shed from the equator of a critically spinning body accretes into a satellite if the material is collisionally dissipative and the primary maintains a low equatorial elongation. The satellite forms mostly from material originating near the primary's surface and enters into a close, low-eccentricity orbit. The properties of binaries produced by our model match those currently observed in the small near-Earth and main-belt asteroid populations, including 1999 KW(4) (refs 3, 4).

### About the international asteroid warning network (IAWN) and the space mission planning advisory group (SMPAG) [^6abe08b8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Planetary defence

Besides planets and dwarf planets, a large number of smaller objects known as asteroids (typically rocky or metallic objects) and comets (typically icy objects) exist in our solar system. The Minor Planet Center, endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, holds position measurements for about 1.5 million such objects. The Minor Planet Center currently has classified more than 34,600 as near-Earth objects, with orbits that bring them closer than 1.3 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the distance between Earth and the Sun) to the Sun and thus possibly close to our planet. While they are scientifically very useful to understand the formation and evolution of our solar system, near-Earth objects (NEOs) might also pose a threat when impacting our home planet. Luckily, we are currently not aware of any potentially impacting object that could cause significant damage.

The minimum size of an NEO that could do damage should it impact is around 10 m. Such objects impact Earth typically every few years to tens of years. Larger objects generate more damage but are rarer. For instance, in February 2013, an approximately 20 m-sized asteroid broke up as it impacted Earth's atmosphere above the city of Chelyabinsk. The shock wave caused damage, and about 1500 people were injured. Events like this happen on average every 10 to 100 years somewhere on our planet. The impact of an object around 40 m in size could result in city-wide damage. Such impacts occur every 100 to 1000 years. Only about 1% of the objects in this size range are known, therefore, such an impact could happen any time.

The activity to deal with this topic is called 'Planetary Defence'. In 2013, two groups were recommended by the United Nations to address this topic: The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG). This was a result of a thorough discussion process, which started in the year 2000, following the UNISPACE III conference. The recommendations for an international response to the near-Earth object impact threat were endorsed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) in June 2013 and by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2013. For a detailed description of the process to establish these groups, see Kofler et al.

### Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid vesta by the dawn mission [^c64150db]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Calculating the differential Doppler shift

In order to verify the detection of surface reflections within BSR power spectra, the theoretical differential Doppler shift δf is calculated between the direct signal and grazing surface-reflected echoes, and compared with measured values. Theoretical δf is estimated from the known positions and line-of-sight velocities between (1) the Dawn spacecraft (D) at the time of transmission; (2) the center coordinate of the radar-illuminated surface on Vesta (Vpt) when the signal reaches the surface; and (3) the receiving antenna on Earth (E) after accounting for light travel time; each of which are extracted from the reconstructed trajectory of Dawn's orbit that is provided in SPICE ephemeride data.

For occultation entry during orbit 355, Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the instantaneous total velocities v of Dawn, the surface point of reflection on Vesta (hereafter referred to as "the echo site" or "the site"), and the receiving antenna on Earth within the bistatic plane — defined as the plane containing all three bodies at a given moment. All positions and velocities of D, Vpt and E are obtained with respect to Vesta's inertial frame of reference, such that the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system is Vesta's center of gravity and Vesta's equator defines the xy -plane. The individual components of each body's instantaneous velocity is listed in Supplementary Table 2 for occultation entry during orbit 355, where each velocity v A is given in m s -1 along the line of sight with respect to the position. Velocity components are defined to be positive if body A is moving toward target B, and negative if away. For example, the notation = −82.2 m s −1 (column 2, row 4) indicates that Dawn is traveling away from the echo site at a speed of 82.2 m s −1.

### Unexpected major geomagnetic storm caused by faint eruption of a solar trans-equatorial flux rope [^ca8d460c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Prediction of near-Earth IMF and geomagnetic index

The non-linear force-free coronal magnetic field model, reconstructed using the flux rope insertion method, is used to predict the near-Earth IMF components. The concept is that, if the eruption of the flux rope is roughly self-similar, the observed IMF near-Earth may be similar to the magnetic field along a certain line cutting through the magnetic field model of the source region. However, because of the eastward deflection, tilt angle and southward-leaning propagation of the flux rope, the longitudes and latitudes of the flux rope in this model will change when reaching the Earth. Therefore, the real location of the Earth is different from the location in the model where we can best predict the observations. To address this, our approach is to first determine the location of Solar Orbiter in the model by fitting its observation data. Then, based on the real separation angles between Solar Orbiter and the Earth, we predict the best-fit location of Earth in the model. Some basic assumptions are made to simplify the model. First, Solar Orbiter and the Earth are assumed to cross the model with fixed longitudes and latitudes, which means the fitting lines cutting through the model is radial. Second, the expansion of the flux rope is self-similar in radial direction, meaning the radial spatial resolution of the data points in the model is proportional to the square of the distance to the solar center:where r represents the radial distance to the solar center, and subscripts i and j stand for two different radial grid points. Then, the time resolution can be calculated by dividing the radial resolution by the solar wind speed:where t represents the time, and v s w is the solar wind speed. Third, we assume that the flux rope exhibits a transverse over-expansion, since its angular widths increases from Φ Corona ≈ 10.7° in the coronal field model to Φ CME ≈ 38.6° in the GCS model. This is an effect worth considering, since the latitudinal separation angle between Solar Orbiter and the Earth in the model will be smaller than the real angle, due to the transverse over-expansion of the flux rope. The latitudinal separation angle Δ ϕ in the model can be calculated from the following equation:where Δ ϕ Real is the real latitudinal separation angle. Last, the magnetic field intensity of the same data point in the model is assumed to be proportional to 1/ r 2, and is amplified with a factorwhere a is a fitting parameter, namely the amplifying factor, and r is the radial distance to the solar center. This represents a continuous enhancement of magnetic field due to the accumulation of IMF and the compress of the flux rope during interplanetary propagation.

### Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions years after a nearby tidal disruption event [^f61b1f7c]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The final class of models to explain QPEs involves an orbiting body (EMRI) either transferring mass to an accretion disk or colliding with it repeatedly –. Note that this is very unlikely to be the same star that was disrupted during the TDE: if a bound remnant survived the disruption, it is expected to be on a highly eccentric orbit with a much longer period than the QPEs. The fundamental requirement for star–disk collisions to explain QPEs is that the disk is wider than the orbit of the EMRI. The size of the disk in AT2019qiz is well constrained by our analysis and the posteriors of our fit fully satisfy this requirement, at least in the case of a circular disk.

For an orbit with the QPE period to avoid intersecting the disk would require a disk ellipticity e > 0.7 (assuming that the semimajor axis of the disk is fixed) and an appropriately chosen orbital inclination. Although some TDE spectra support a highly elliptical disk in the tens of days after disruption, most can be explained with an approximately circular disk –. Simulations of TDE accretion disks show a high ellipticity in the days after disruption, but shocks are expected to circularize the disk over the course of a few debris orbital periods(days to weeks), whereas we observe QPEs on a timescale of years after AT2019qiz. An initially highly eccentric disk becomes only mildly elliptical (e ≈ 0.6) on a timescale of several days (refs. –). Once notable fallback has stopped (before the plateau phase), no more eccentricity will be excited in the disk, whereas turbulence will act to further circularize it, so we expect that the disk in AT2019qiz will be circular to a good approximation.

The case of an EMRI interacting with a TDE disk was specifically predicted by refs. The formation rate of EMRIs by the Hills mechanism is about 10 −5 year −1 galaxy −1, about one-tenth of the TDE rate. Because the time for inspiral resulting from gravitational-wave emission (approximately 10 6 years) is longer than the time between TDEs (approximately 10 4 years), theory predicts that ≳1 in 10 TDEs could host an EMRI capable of producing QPEs. This is consistent with recent observational constraints on the QPE rate.

### Flight trajectory prediction enabled by time-frequency wavelet transform [^4afdf43f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Evaluation metrics

In this work, a total of four measurements are considered to evaluate the performance of prediction models, including root of mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) and mean deviation error (MDE). The commonly used metrics in the FTP task are RMSE, MAE, and MRE, as shown below:where N represents the total number of the test set. P i, j is the i -th attribute of the real trajectory point for the j -th sample andis the corresponding predicted value.

As the RMSE, MAE and MRE are useful metrics for assessing prediction performance on a single motion attribute, in this work, the 3D deviation distance between the predicted and ground-truth trajectory point is also measured to consider overall model performance. To resolve the differences in measurements and statistical spans between longitude, latitude, and altitude in the WGS-84 coordinate system, the MDE metric, based on the Euclidean distance between predicted and actual points in earth-centered and earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate system, is proposed to measure the overall prediction performance of the FTP model as shown below:where p o s 1, j, p o s 2, j and p o s 3, j are converted coordinates of the actual position components (i.e. longitude, latitude and altitude) l o n j, l a t j and a l t j, respectively.andare converted coordinates of the predicted position components, andby using the same conversion equations as shown in Eq. (9), respectively. a = 6378.137 kilometers (km) and b = 6356.752 km are the equatorial radius and the polar radius of the earth, respectively. PR(⋅) is the distance from the surface to the line between the north and south poles along the ellipsoid normal. The predicted and target positions are converted into the ECEF coordinate system with the same measurement, kilometers, by using Eq. (9). Finally, the MDE can be computed by their Euclidean distance. Considering that timestamp, longitude, latitude and altitude serve as crucial attributes in general 4D-FTP tasks, the prediction performance is primarily investigated on the position components due to the fixed time interval in this work. The speed is considered as the auxiliary attributes to learn flight patterns in the WTFTP framework.

### A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b [^21e23432]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

'Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close (< 0.05 astronomical units, where 1 au is the average Sun-Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973 ± 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212 ± 11 K at a wavelength of 8 mum, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16 ± 6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 ± 24 s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.

### The European space agency's comet interceptor lies in wait [^d33bde72]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

ESA's new fast approach

Comet Interceptor will be developed on a relatively rapid timescale for ESA, to take advantage of extra space available on the launcher of the medium (M-class) mission Ariel, which is due to launch in 2028. Such a timescale is still not fast enough to react to any comet we currently know, but the specific opportunity offered by the F-class call, i.e. a free launch to a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrangian point, enables an unique approach: to design and launch a mission without a known target, that can wait in space for a suitable comet to be discovered. The L2 point is where the gravitational pull of the Sun and Earth balance to produce a stable point in space 1.5 million km away from Earth, on the planet's night side. It is the favoured parking location for space observatories, as an orbit can be maintained there with little fuel, while keeping a constant distance from Earth and stable illumination. L2 is also the ideal parking location for Comet Interceptor, as both station keeping there and departure for the comet, once it is identified, take relatively little fuel (Fig. 1).

### Real-time earthquake monitoring using a search engine method [^41afab00]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

For any virtual source position, the greatest computational effort is the calculation of the Green's function between source and receiver before convolving it with a focal solution. For a 1D Earth model, there should be nine sets of Green's functions and eight of them contribute to the calculation of the three-component seismogram for a double-couple source. Fortunately, the Green's function is independent of the source-focal mechanism; thus, we only need to calculate one set of Green's function for each grid point.

In addition, we present an interval approach to calculate seismograms efficiently given a distance range from a single station. This approximation method can significantly reduce the computational effort for preparing a search database with acceptable accuracy. Figure 2 explains the interval method with a schematic plot. Solid circles with a constant interval are drawn with a seismic station as the centre and any two adjacent dashed lines to the central solid circle mark the zone of an interval. Within every interval after the earth flattening transformation, we calculated the Green's function for only one virtual source point at the epicentral distance corresponding to the solid circle. For any virtual source at the same depth in the 3D grid, if it falls into the same interval, then it will be assigned the same Green's function for that interval as an approximation. In this study, our epicentral distance range is from 5° to 15°. If we choose 0.2° as an interval, this means we must calculate seismograms for only 600 (50 intervals × 12 depths) virtual source points, regardless of the number of stations, as opposed to 24,366 (8,122 × 3 stations) virtual sources, reducing the computational effort by a factor of ~40. The calculation of the seismograms to create a database for the Xinjiang test site takes ~13 h on a single workstation. Generating 15,789,168 super-traces and setting up a tree structure for the rapid search takes an additional 30 min. Therefore, creating a search database with synthetics is a very efficient process in practice if high-performance computing resources are available.

### A temperate rocky super-earth transiting a nearby cool star [^06930ad4]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

M dwarf stars, which have masses less than 60 per cent that of the Sun, make up 75 per cent of the population of the stars in the Galaxy. The atmospheres of orbiting Earth-sized planets are observationally accessible via transmission spectroscopy when the planets pass in front of these stars. Statistical results suggest that the nearest transiting Earth-sized planet in the liquid-water, habitable zone of an M dwarf star is probably around 10.5 parsecs away. A temperate planet has been discovered orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest M dwarf, but it probably does not transit and its true mass is unknown. Seven Earth-sized planets transit the very low-mass star TRAPPIST-1, which is 12 parsecs away, but their masses and, particularly, their densities are poorly constrained. Here we report observations of LHS 1140b, a planet with a radius of 1.4 Earth radii transiting a small, cool star (LHS 1140) 12 parsecs away. We measure the mass of the planet to be 6.6 times that of Earth, consistent with a rocky bulk composition. LHS 1140b receives an insolation of 0.46 times that of Earth, placing it within the liquid-water, habitable zone. With 90 per cent confidence, we place an upper limit on the orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The circular orbit is unlikely to be the result of tides and therefore was probably present at formation. Given its large surface gravity and cool insolation, the planet may have retained its atmosphere despite the greater luminosity (compared to the present-day) of its host star in its youth. Because LHS 1140 is nearby, telescopes currently under construction might be able to search for specific atmospheric gases in the future.

### Low cost satellite constellations for nearly continuous global coverage [^efb7c3e8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Nearly continuous global coverage

The maximum revisit time for a point on the Earth represents the maximum time between accesses of that point by any satellite in a constellation. It is an important measure of the worst-case frequency of having geometric access to observe points on Earth. Figure 1 a, b presents global contours of maximum revisit time for the discovered 24- and 48-h period constellations, respectively. The data contours account for station-keeping and drift over a period of slightly more than 8 years (3,000 days), with statistics calculated over a grid of ground target points with 1° spacing in latitude and longitude. The contour data indicate that 24- and 48-h-period constellations achieve continuous coverage over 86 and 95% of the globe, respectively. For those regions that experience outages, the maximum duration is on the order of 80 min once per day. The Supplemental Methods section provides additional background on the coverage metrics used in this study.

Fig. 1
Maximum revisit time and minimum elevation angle.

a Maximum revisit time for the 24-h constellation. b Maximum revisit time for the 48-h constellation. c Minimum elevation angle for the 24-h constellation. d Minimum elevation angle for the 48-h constellation. The top color scale represents maximum revisit time from 0 to 75 min. The bottom color scale represents minimum elevation angle from 0 to. Theandaxes are longitude and latitude, respectively.

Orbit phasing describes both the positions of individual spacecraft relative to one another, as well as the position of the spacecraft relative to the rotating Earth. The specific phasing of the constellation determines the longitudinal position of regions that experience outages (Fig. 1 a, b). Thus, these outage regions can be placed over regions of less interest to the constellation operator. An operator of a global agricultural monitoring constellation might, for example, position the coverage gaps over open ocean areas. Furthermore, these outage regions can be easily modified during the lifetime of the constellation if the regions of interest change. Small true anomaly phase changes to the constellation will shift these regions longitudinally for very little propellant cost, and can be performed multiple times.

SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging — orbit type for Anger cameras — offers circular and noncircular (elliptical or body-contoured) options; noncircular orbits follow the patient's contour more closely than circular orbits with fixed radius, thereby improving spatial resolution, and noncircular (elliptical or body-contoured) orbits are standard for Anger camera SPECT MPI.

### Orbital stability analysis and photometric characterization of the second earth trojan asteroid 2020 XL [^ae7d63fc]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Trojan asteroids are small bodies orbiting around the L 4 or L 5 Lagrangian points of a Sun-planet system. Due to their peculiar orbits, they provide key constraints to the Solar System evolution models. Despite numerous dedicated observational efforts in the last decade, asteroid 2010 TK 7 has been the only known Earth Trojan thus far. Here we confirm that the recently discovered 2020 XL 5 is the second transient Earth Trojan known. To study its orbit, we used archival data from 2012 to 2019 and observed the object in 2021 from three ground-based observatories. Our study of its orbital stability shows that 2020 XL 5 will remain in L 4 for at least 4000 years. With a photometric analysis we estimate its absolute magnitude to be [Formula: see text], and color indices suggestive of a C-complex taxonomy. Assuming an albedo of 0.06 ± 0.03, we obtain a diameter of 1.18 ± 0.08 km, larger than the first known Earth Trojan asteroid.

### One-third of sun-like stars are born with misaligned planet-forming disks [^94c73838]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The 'primordial versus post-formation' question

Direct imaging of exoplanets is sensitive to separations spanning tens to hundreds of(ref.) and, recently, minimum obliquities of this population have been explored by comparing the stellar inclination to planetary orbital planes traced out with patient orbit monitoring. This emerging population consists of 11 planets across six systems –, which show a trend towards alignment with the central star. As more planets are discovered at wide separations with direct imaging across a broad range of ages, a direct comparison can be made between the primordial and long-period planet obliquity distributions to determine the role of dynamics in exciting orbital inclinations over time.

The fundamental differences across space and time between the protoplanetary disk sample and planet samples complicate the question of whether the primordial obliquities of Sun-like stars are the primary basis for the obliquity distribution of mature short-period giant planets. This gap in parameter space, the possibility of inner–outer disk misalignments and uncertainty about the dynamical evolutionary pathways following the epoch of planet formation prevent firm conclusions on this topic. However, this gulf in age and orbital distance can soon be addressed with the Gaia astrometric survey's fourth data release, which is expected to yield thousands of 3D Keplerian orbit fits of cold Jupiters — including their inclinations — at orbital distances up to about 7(ref.).

### A gas cloud on its way towards the supermassive black hole at the galactic centre [^4d375597]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

Measurements of stellar orbits provide compelling evidence that the compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Centre is a black hole four million times the mass of the Sun. With the exception of modest X-ray and infrared flares, Sgr A* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate and radiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low. Here we report the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass of Earth that is falling into the accretion zone of Sgr A*. Our observations tightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost radius of approach of only ∼3,100 times the event horizon that will be reached in 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably mainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational force. The cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years will probe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of the supermassive black hole. The kilo-electronvolt X-ray emission of Sgr A* may brighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. There may also be a giant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and its fragments feed gas into the central accretion zone.

Radiation levels in orbit

The Earth is protected from solar wind and cosmic particles by its magnetic field. As a result, high-energy protons and electrons are trapped on trajectories oscillating between both magnetic poles in the so-called Van Allen belts. While essential for life on Earth, the trapped particle belts pose great threat to any spacecraft orbiting through these particle belts. Near the magnetic poles, the inner belt can extend down to altitudes of 200 km. Owing to misalignment of the magnetic dipole and rotation axis of the Earth, this appears as the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA; see Fig. 1a, b). Because of this inhomogeneity, the total radiation dosage is strongly dependent on the orbital inclination. Thus we calculated the particle spectra for different spacecraft trajectories with inclinations of 20° (here defined as equatorial orbit), 51.6° (orbit of the International Space Station (ISS)), and 98° (here defined as polar orbit) for 500 km altitude and average over the full orbit. In general, the energy spectrum for protons in low Earth orbit (LEO) ranges from 100 keV to 400 MeV, while for electrons it ranges from 40 keV to 7 MeV. Low-energy particles are typically absorbed by the walls of the spacecraft, which acts as a non-ideal high-pass filter. High-energy ions, however, loose energy during their interaction with the shielding material and thus the lower ends of the spectra are always finite unless every charge carrier is stopped (e.g. for thick shielding). The shielded flux spectra for protons and electrons after 1.85 mm of Al shielding and integrated over a 1-year mission is shown in Fig. 1c, d. Surprisingly, the polar orbit does not have the highest fluence, as spacecrafts with 51.6° inclination spend more time in the SAA than spacecrafts with 98° inclination, similarly for protons and electrons. A spectral distribution with an absence of low-energy protons, as shown in Fig. 1c, is advantageous, because only low-energy particles can deposit significant amounts of energy into the payload. It should be mentioned that the electrons in Fig. 1d do not originate from trapped electrons in the Van Allen belt but rather are secondary electrons produced via ionizing interactions of high-energy protons with the Al atoms in the shielding material.

### Intense equatorial flux spots on the surface of the earth's core [^02aebdcc]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

A large number of high-accuracy vector measurements of the Earth's magnetic field have recently become available from the satellite Oersted, complementing previous vector data from the satellite Magsat, which operated in 1979/80. These data can be used to infer the morphology of the magnetic field at the surface of the fluid core, approximately 2,900 km below the Earth's surface. Here I apply a new methodology to these data to calculate maps of the magnetic field at the core surface which show intense flux spots in equatorial regions. The intensity of these features is unusually large — some have intensities comparable to high-latitude flux patches near the poles, previously identified as the major component of the dynamo field. The tendency for pairing of some of these spots to the north and south of the geographical equator suggests they might be associated with the tops of equatorially symmetric columnar structures in the fluid, or their antisymmetric equivalents. The drift of the equatorial features may represent material flow or could represent wave motion; discrimination of these two effects based on future data could provide new information on the strength of the hidden toroidal magnetic field of the Earth.

### Collisionless encounters and the origin of the lunar inclination [^7b8f6dc9]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

The Moon is generally thought to have formed from the debris ejected by the impact of a planet-sized object with the proto-Earth towards the end of planetary accretion. Models of the impact process predict that the lunar material was disaggregated into a circumplanetary disk and that lunar accretion subsequently placed the Moon in a near-equatorial orbit. Forward integration of the lunar orbit from this initial state predicts a modern inclination at least an order of magnitude smaller than the lunar value — a long-standing discrepancy known as the lunar inclination problem. Here we show that the modern lunar orbit provides a sensitive record of gravitational interactions with Earth-crossing planetesimals that were not yet accreted at the time of the Moon-forming event. The currently observed lunar orbit can naturally be reproduced via interaction with a small quantity of mass (corresponding to 0.0075–0.015 Earth masses eventually accreted to the Earth) carried by a few bodies, consistent with the constraints and models of late accretion. Although the encounter process has a stochastic element, the observed value of the lunar inclination is among the most likely outcomes for a wide range of parameters. The excitation of the lunar orbit is most readily reproduced via collisionless encounters of planetesimals with the Earth-Moon system with strong dissipation of tidal energy on the early Earth. This mechanism obviates the need for previously proposed (but idealized) excitation mechanisms, places the Moon-forming event in the context of the formation of Earth, and constrains the pristineness of the dynamical state of the Earth-Moon system.

### SNM practice guideline for parathyroid scintigraphy 4.0 [^1305b7e7]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2012). Medium credibility.

Parathyroid SPECT acquisition parameters — The SPECT data should be acquired over a 360° arc using a body-contoured elliptic orbit, optimally obtaining 120 (minimum of 60) projections at 15–25 s per projection (every 3°–6° angle), with the SPECT acquisition taking on average approximately 25 min and images acquired into a 128 × 128 (16-bit) matrix and reconstructed using a 2-dimensional ordered-subset expectation maximization iterative technique (at least 10 subsets and 2 iterations are typical), and a 3-dimensional postprocessing filter is typically applied (e.g., the Hanning postprocessing filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.85 cycles/cm).

The observed stability time interval of the clone orbits appears to be consistent with that of the nominal orbit, as shown in Fig. 1, where a different color for each clone orbit has been used, with the green line representing the nominal orbit. Some clone orbits escape from stability before the nominal one, as shown in the zoomed Fig. 2.

Fig. 2
Beginning of the non-deterministic regime.

The relative mean longitude (λ r) evolution of the 2020 XL 5 nominal orbit as in Table 1 and clones orbit from year ~3300 until year ~4300, where each clone orbit is represented by a different color. Some clone orbits escape from the stability before the nominal one. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To better visualize the results we generated a stack plot classifying the behavior of the nominal and clone orbits in three different states: librating around L 4, librating around L 5, and circulating (Fig. 1). The stack plot covers the entire time span of the simulations, with the time t 0 = 0 set as the mean epoch of the observation arch. The plot shows that some orbits begin to show instability after time t ~ 3500, and by time t = 5000 less than 40% of the orbits are still in L 4. Integrating backward, all the orbits become unstable by time t ~ −500, and less than 5% of orbits are located in L 4 by t ~ −2000 and earlier. Moreover, the plot shows that less than 10% of the orbits are librating around L 5 both before t ~ −1000 and during the interval between t ~ 6000 and t ~ 8000.

### An earth-sized planet with an earth-like density [^69878a65]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Recent analyses of data from the NASA Kepler spacecraft have established that planets with radii within 25 per cent of the Earth's (R Earth symbol) are commonplace throughout the Galaxy, orbiting at least 16.5 per cent of Sun-like stars. Because these studies were sensitive to the sizes of the planets but not their masses, the question remains whether these Earth-sized planets are indeed similar to the Earth in bulk composition. The smallest planets for which masses have been accurately determined are Kepler-10b (1.42 R Earth symbol) and Kepler-36b (1.49 R Earth symbol), which are both significantly larger than the Earth. Recently, the planet Kepler-78b was discovered and found to have a radius of only 1.16 R Earth symbol. Here we report that the mass of this planet is 1.86 Earth masses. The resulting mean density of the planet is 5.57gcm(-3), which is similar to that of the Earth and implies a composition of iron and rock.

### High-resolution subsurface water-ice distributions on mars [^be8fb5a4]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Theoretical models indicate that water ice is stable in the shallow subsurface (depths of < 1–2 m) of Mars at high latitudes. These models have been mainly supported by the observed presence of large concentrations of hydrogen detected by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer suite of instruments on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. The models and measurements are consistent with a water-ice table that steadily increases in depth with decreasing latitude. More detailed modelling has predicted that the depth at which water ice is stable can be highly variable, owing to local surface heterogeneities such as rocks and slopes, and the thermal inertia of the ground cover. Measurements have, however, been limited to the footprint (several hundred kilometres) of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer suite, preventing the observations from documenting more detailed water-ice distributions. Here I show that by observing the seasonal temperature response of the martian surface with the Thermal Emission Imaging System on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, it is possible to observe such heterogeneities at subkilometre scale. These observations show significant regional and local water-ice depth variability, and, in some cases, support distributions in the subsurface predicted by atmospheric exchange and vapour diffusion models. The presence of water ice where it follows the depth of stability under current climatic conditions implies an active martian water cycle that responds to orbit-driven climate cycles. Several regions also have apparent deviations from the theoretical stability level, indicating that additional factors influence the ice-table depth. The high-resolution measurements show that the depth to the water-ice table is highly variable within the potential Phoenix spacecraft landing ellipses, and is likely to be variable at scales that may be sampled by the spacecraft.

### Unexpected major geomagnetic storm caused by faint eruption of a solar trans-equatorial flux rope [^4d1b9687]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To better determine the relationship between the full-halo CME and the ICME observed near Earth, we examined the IMF parameters measured by the Solar Orbiter magnetometer. Solar Orbiter is at about 0.5 AU and almost in the ecliptic plane during March 19–23. Its rough location is shown by 'S' in Fig. 5 h. In order to facilitate the comparison between the magnetic field components observed at Solar Orbiter and near Earth, we convert the RTN (Radial-Tangential-Normal) components of the Solar Orbiter magnetic field to a 'Solar-Orbiter-centric Solar Ecliptic' coordinate frame. In this frame, the center is Solar Orbiter, the x axis points towards the Sun, the y axis is parallel to the ecliptic plane and opposite to the Solar Orbiter moving direction, and the z axis completes the right-hand system. At around 09:30 UT on March 21, the B z at Solar Orbiter suddenly decreases by about 20 nT, while the magnetic elevation angle θ drops down to about −50° and the magnetic azimuth angle starts to vary smoothly from about −100° to about 80° (Fig. 5 i). Meanwhile, as observed by the Solar Orbiter Solar Wind Analyser, the solar wind temperature significantly drops down and the solar wind speed starts to decrease linearly (Fig. 5 j). The aforementioned evidence suggests the passage of an expanding flux rope. The inclination angle of this flux rope is calculated to be −82° via the MVA method, indicating the highly-tilted nature of this flux rope. The variation trends of magnetic elevation and azimuth angles as well as the IMF components, together with the inclination of this flux rope, are remarkably similar to the near-Earth observations. This indicates that the ICMEs observed by Solar Orbiter and near-Earth observatories are manifestations of the same flux rope.

a – f, Cross-eyed stereo versions of the images taken on approach, near-close approach and on departure, respectively (see the 'Observations' section in Methods for a description of the imaging campaign). Dinkinesh has two main geological features: a longitudinal trough and an equatorial ridge (the yellow and rose coloured dots, respectively). The two coloured arrows (green and blue) in a point to the northern boundary of the ridge, as determined by visual inspection, at the two fiducial longitudes discussed in Fig. 3. Scale bar, 200 m. g, A simulated image of Dinkinesh with the trough removed. This is a modified version of a, in which the cyan region was moved 79 m to the lower left in the image (26° from horizontal) and rotated 7° clockwise. We take the fact that the limb profile of Dinkinesh is smooth near the colour transitions of this reconstruction to suggest that the trough is a result of a structural failure that moved the cyan region away from the remainder of the body. h – k, Stereo pairs of images of Selam taken on approach and near-close approach, respectively. l, A single image of Selam taken on departure. Selam was outside the L'LORRI field of view from 10 s to 5.5 min after close approach and so stereo imaging is not possible. The images of Selam allow us to visually estimate the dimensions of its lobes by crudely approximating their complex shapes as triaxial ellipsoids. We find that the inner and outer lobe major axes lengths in the directions parallel to the Dinkinesh vector, the orbital direction and the spin pole are roughly 240 × 200 × 200 m and 280 × 220 × 210 m, respectively. Scale bar, 200 m. m, A departure image of the entire system. Scale bar, 1 km. Also, all images are deconvolved except for m. l and m are the same image, so comparison illustrates the effects of deconvolution.

### Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid vesta by the dawn mission [^d935d951]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Calculating the radar cross section at high incidence

In order to assess the surface's geophysical properties that contribute to the observed surface echoes, the radar cross section σ of Vesta's surface is calculated in m 2 from the BSR equation. This parameter is defined as the effective surface area that isotropically scatters the same amount of power as the echo site on Vesta, such that larger values of σ are associated with stronger surface echoes. Assuming (1) each echo site has approximately the same surface area illuminated by radar and (2) are observed at the same geometry (89° incidence), relative differences in σ imply differences in geophysical properties of the surface.

The latter assumption is supported by excluding surface echoes that occurred in regions of high topographic variability with respect to the incident HGA beam diameter, where the illuminated surface area is estimated using a first-order spherical approximation to Vesta's surface. Notably, this approximation excludes the effects of shadowing and diffraction, which are difficult to quantify at grazing incidence, and does not account for deviations of Vesta's shape from the sphere within the large area illuminated by the HGA beam. Our first-order estimation yields an elongated radar footprint of ~51 km along the line of sight between Dawn's HGA and Earth's receiving antenna, and ~11 km in diameter perpendicular to the line-of-sight. Topographic variability is assessed by calculating the root-mean-square height h rms using elevations from Vesta's digital terrain modelwithin an 11.5° by 11.5° grid (~51 × 51 km) centered on each echo site's coordinates, and must be sufficiently smaller than the incident 11-km beam diameter. Calculated h rms range from 0.002 to 0.13 km. All but one echo site had h rms < 0.11 km (i.e. topographic variability of 1% of the incident beam diameter). The echo site of occultation entry during orbit 377 exceeded this criteria and is therefore excluded from the following analyses.

### Design and flight results of the VHF / UHF communication system of longjiang lunar microsatellites [^e9d47e2c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Mission analysis and system configuration

Longjiang-1 and Longjiang-2 were designed to separate from the launch vehicle at an altitude of ~200 km over the Pacific. Before orbiting the Moon, the satellites had to perform several trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) and a maneuver for lunar orbit injection (LOI), with their own propulsion. After that, a few maneuvers were needed to achieve a stable elliptical orbit. Their partner, Queqiao relay satellite passed by the Moon and continued its journey to the L2 halo orbit. Figure 1a shows a picture of the Longjiang-1/2 satellites on the final stage of CZ-4C launch vehicle, together with the Queqiao relay satellite. The orbit of Longjiang-1/2 from Earth to the Moon and the positions of maneuvers are shown in Fig. 1b.

Based on the designed orbit, after orbiting the Moon, the distance between the satellite and a typical ground station ranges from ~340,000 km to ~420,000 km, much larger than for LEO satellites. The line-of-sight velocity between the satellite and a typical ground station ranges between about ± 2 km/s, much smaller than for LEO satellites. Downlink and uplink budgets for the VHF/UHF radio is shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2.

### Short-term interaction between silent and devastating earthquakes in Mexico [^9f307ad8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The GIPSY displacement time series are estimated with a Precise Point Positioning strategy. The station positions are defined in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame, the year 2014 (ITRF 2014). For daily processing, we used the Jet Propulsion Laboratory final and non-fiducial products (orbits and clocks). We generated observables using 2 model categories: (1) Earth models and (2) observation models. The Earth models include tidal effects (i.e. solid tides, ocean loading, and tide created by polar motion), Earth rotation (UT1), polar motion, mutation, and precession. Observation models, on the other hand, are related to phase center offsets, tropospheric effects, and timing errors (i.e. relativistic effects). The troposphere delay is estimated like a random walk process. This effect is broken into wet and dry components. The azimuthal gradient and the dry component are estimated using the GPT2 model and mapping function (TGIPSY1). The antenna phase center variations are considered through antenna calibration files. For receiver antennas, the correction is estimated by taking the International GNSS Service (IGS) Antex file. We also applied a wide-lane phase bias to account for the ambiguity resolution and removed outliers.

### Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid vesta by the dawn mission [^4f15d754]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

With regard to spacecraft velocity, the SPICE ephemerides containing Dawn's state vector were released by the optical navigation team in 2012before the peer-reviewed publication of Vesta's gravitational solution in 2014. Hence, Dawn's reconstructed trajectory does not include variations in orbital velocity due to the heterogeneous gravity field that exhibits accelerations between −1000 mGal and +2000 mGal (−1 cm s −2 and +2 cm s −2) relative to the homogeneous model. Since each frequency spectrum produced in our BSR analysis is averaged over 5-s observations, unpredicted gravitational accelerations contribute –5 to +10 cm s −1 uncertainty in Dawn's velocity vector.

The rotational velocity of the echo site on Vesta's surface depends on the distance of the site from Vesta's center and the rotation period, the latter of which is known to high precision. Given the large extent of surface area illuminated by the HGA beam on Vesta, we use the radius at the center of the echo site to calculate a representative rotational velocity. During occultation entry of orbit 355, uncertainty of ± 0.5 km in the radius yields an uncertainty of ± 16 cm s −1 in the echo site's rotational velocity.

Using the above-derived uncertainties in the positions and velocities of each body, we calculate the propagation of error into each line-of-sight velocity between Dawn, the surface echo site on Vesta, and the antenna on Earth that contribute to the calculation of theoretical δf. Uncertainty in the velocity of body A projected along the line of site with body B is calculated from the propagation of error in (1) the velocity vector of A, (2) the position of A, and (3) the position of B. Hence, the theoretical differential Doppler shift is calculated to range between ~2 and 20 Hz, and is consistent the observed δf of –12 Hz (Fig. 1b) for the surface echo measured during orbit 355, occultation entry.

### A space hurricane over the earth's polar ionosphere [^35a34539]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In Earth's low atmosphere, hurricanes are destructive due to their great size, strong spiral winds with shears, and intense rain/precipitation. However, disturbances resembling hurricanes have not been detected in Earth's upper atmosphere. Here, we report a long-lasting space hurricane in the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere during low solar and otherwise low geomagnetic activity. This hurricane shows strong circular horizontal plasma flow with shears, a nearly zero-flow center, and a coincident cyclone-shaped aurora caused by strong electron precipitation associated with intense upward magnetic field-aligned currents. Near the center, precipitating electrons were substantially accelerated to ~10 keV. The hurricane imparted large energy and momentum deposition into the ionosphere despite otherwise extremely quiet conditions. The observations and simulations reveal that the space hurricane is generated by steady high-latitude lobe magnetic reconnection and current continuity during a several hour period of northward interplanetary magnetic field and very low solar wind density and speed.

### Million-year solar wind irradiation recorded in chang' E-5 and chang' E-6 samples [^117a0b4b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

While individual SEP events can exhibit strong anisotropy depending on heliospheric magnetic connectivity, the cumulative SEP flux is generally considered near-isotropic across the lunar surface over geological timescale –. In comparison, the flux of lower-energy SW ions can be significantly modulated by various shielding mechanisms, including Earth's magnetosphere (especially the magnetotail), the bow shock at the SW–magnetosphere interface, direct occlusion by the Moon itself, and localized magnetic anomalies –. In a typical 28-day lunar orbit, the Moon spends approximately 25% of its time (~7 days) within Earth's magnetosphere, including up to ~4 days in the magnetotail, where the incident SW flux is largely suppressed due to magnetic shielding. During nearside daytime, the central region may spend roughly half its daytime within the magnetotail, experiencing partial shielding from incoming SW ions. In contrast, the sunlit farside remains continuously exposed to direct SW irradiation, without the geomagnetic protection. Earth's magnetosphere can efficiently shield solar energetic protons with energies up to ~4 MeV when the Moon is within it during SEP events. Outside this protective environment, under direct SW exposure, the lunar body provides only limited occlusion of particles up to ~100 keV. For particles exceeding ~150 keV, the shadowing effect becomes negligible, as fluxes within the lunar wake approximate those in the ambient SW. Moreover, although Earth's bow shock offers some protection, it can also inject additional low-energy particles (below a few hundred keV) into lunar orbit, exerting a significantly greater influence on the nearside relative to the farside. Additionally, local magnetic anomalies on the Moon may form mini-magnetospheres that partially shield the surface by deflecting incoming SW particles, thereby reducing their flux and mitigating space weathering in certain regions –. This spatially variable shielding landscape gives rise to potential long-term asymmetries in SW irradiation between the lunar nearside and farside, which may in turn be recorded as distinct space weathering signatures in the surface regolith.

### Planetary science: constant illumination at the lunar north pole [^d046fdf9]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Images returned by the spacecraft Clementine have been used to produce a quantitative illumination map of the north pole of the Moon, revealing the percentage of time that points on the surface are illuminated during the lunar day. We have used this map to identify areas that are constantly illuminated during a lunar day in summer and which may therefore be in permanent sunlight. All are located on the northern rim of Peary crater, close to the north pole. Permanently sunlit areas represent prime locations for lunar outpost sites as they have abundant solar energy, are relatively benign thermally (when compared with equatorial regions), and are close to permanently shadowed regions that may contain water ice.

### Mid-infrared images of beta pictoris and the possible role of planetesimal collisions in the central disk [^c9be2463]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

When viewed in optical starlight scattered by dust, the nearly edge-on debris disk surrounding the A5V star beta Pictoris (distance 19.3 pc; ref. 1) extends farther than 1,450 au from the star. Its large-scale complexity has been well characterized, but the detailed structure of the disk's central approximately 200-au region has remained elusive. This region is of special interest, because planets may have formed there during the star's 10-20-million-year lifetime, perhaps resulting in both the observed tilt of 4.6 degrees relative to the large-scale main disk and the partial clearing of the innermost dust. A peculiarity of the central disk (also possibly related to the presence of planets) is the asymmetry in the brightness of the 'wings', in which the southwestern wing is brighter and more extended at 12 microm than the northeastern wing. Here we present thermal infrared images of the central disk that imply that the brightness asymmetry results from the presence of a bright clump composed of particles that may differ in size from dust elsewhere in the disk. We suggest that this clump results from the collisional grinding of resonantly trapped planetesimals or the cataclysmic break-up of a planetesimal.

### Electromagnetic power of lightning superbolts from earth to space [^5824ec5b]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Simultaneous ground-based and space measurement of a superbolt

The closest of the two superbolts (1.2 MJ) that we observe synchronously from Earth and space is represented in Fig. 3 (more detail in Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). The waveforms (3c and 3f) are decomposed by Fourier transform to produce electric field (3a) and magnetic field (Supplementary Fig. 6e) PSDs. Other lightning activity (Fig. 3c) is composed of nine lightning events identified with WWLLN, listed in Supplementary Table 4, and plotted on a map in Supplementary Fig. 7f. Among these nine normal lightning events, event #3 is a strong 95.8 kJ stroke occurring ~2 s later. This lightning activity is also visible in space with whistler-mode waves (3a), showing good temporal alignment with the WWLLN signal and representing significant wave power (line plot in 3b and WWLLN estimated power) for times between 2 and 3 s. Nevertheless, this activity does not mask or perturb the superbolt burst-mode signal which persists for ~1 s of the first ~1.4 s of data. The superbolt signal is found to be composed of one main wave (with a 0.4 s delay from WWLLN detection time) and a second similarly powerful wave 0.2 s later (3a, 3c). The time it takes for the wave to travel from the satellite to the magnetically conjugate point along the field line at L ~ 2.43, reflect, and return at the equator is 0.2 s. Computing the Poynting flux (see Supplementary Method 1), we find a change of sign between these two waves, which indicates the second wave reaches the spacecraft from the opposite side of the field line. In the absence of any other event attested by WWLLN and since the time delay is consistent with one reflection, this suggests the two superbolt's waves have entered the magnetosphere at different latitudes surrounding the source, followed then different paths, with one wave reaching first the spacecraft and the second reaching the spacecraft 0.2 s later after bouncing at the conjugate point of the field line. This is one of the plausible and classic scenarios obtained from ray-tracing simulations. The peak squared electric field measured by an ECLAIR ground station for this event is 20 (V/m) 2 1387 km (3e) from the source. The average squared electric field over its duration (1.5 ms) is 4 (V/m) 2, about 400 times greater than cloud-to-ground lightning measured on the ground (cf. discussion below). Quantifying the power spectral density on the ground is critical for validating ray-tracing simulations that predict the wave propagation from the source to space. The ground electric field peak (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 7e) is well resolved (at 0.08 µs from the 12.5 MHz acquisition) and presents a longer-than-average rise time (the time for the signal to go from 50% to 90% of peak magnitude), which is confirmed to be specific to superbolts from rise time and fall time statistics below. This leads to a somewhat more symmetric first peak. In space, the northern magnetic footprint of the Van Allen Probes North (3c) is 3193 km away from the superbolt location and the measured peak squared electric field is 6 × 10 −7 (V/m) 2, for a mean value of 8.5 × 10 −8 (V/m) 2 over 1 s, about 200 times higher than for normal lightning. The root mean-squared (rms) amplitude of the magnetic field (3c), essential to compute pitch angle scattering of radiation belt electrons caused by lightning-generated whistlers in space (see review ref.), is 19 pT, 19 times larger than for normal lightning. However, this is not as large as some of the superbolts we discuss next.

### Evidence for recent climate change on mars from the identification of youthful near-surface ground ice [^2b6244b2]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Ground ice in the crust and soil may be one of the largest reservoirs of water on Mars. Near-surface ground ice is predicted to be stable at latitudes higher than 40 degrees (ref. 4), where a number of geomorphologic features indicative of viscous creep and hence ground ice have been observed. Mid-latitude soils have also been implicated as a water-ice reservoir, the capacity of which is predicted to vary on a 100,000-year timescale owing to orbitally driven variations in climate. It is uncertain, however, whether near-surface ground ice currently exists at these latitudes, and how it is changing with time. Here we report observational evidence for a mid-latitude reservoir of near-surface water ice occupying the pore space of soils. The thickness of the ice-occupied soil reservoir (1–10 m) and its distribution in the 30 degrees to 60 degrees latitude bands indicate a reservoir of (1.5–6.0) x 104 km3, equivalent to a global layer of water 10–40 cm thick. We infer that the reservoir was created during the last phase of high orbital obliquity less than 100,000 years ago, and is now being diminished.

### Successful kinetic impact into an asteroid for planetary defence [^ea48cb60]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Although no known asteroid poses a threat to Earth for at least the next century, the catalogue of near-Earth asteroids is incomplete for objects whose impacts would produce regional devastation 1,2. Several approaches have been proposed to potentially prevent an asteroid impact with Earth by deflecting or disrupting an asteroid 1–3. A test of kinetic impact technology was identified as the highest-priority space mission related to asteroid mitigation 1. NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is a full-scale test of kinetic impact technology. The mission's target asteroid was Dimorphos, the secondary member of the S-type binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos. This binary asteroid system was chosen to enable ground-based telescopes to quantify the asteroid deflection caused by the impact of the DART spacecraft 4. Although past missions have utilized impactors to investigate the properties of small bodies 5,6, those earlier missions were not intended to deflect their targets and did not achieve measurable deflections. Here we report the DART spacecraft's autonomous kinetic impact into Dimorphos and reconstruct the impact event, including the timeline leading to impact, the location and nature of the DART impact site, and the size and shape of Dimorphos. The successful impact of the DART spacecraft with Dimorphos and the resulting change in the orbit of Dimorphos 7 demonstrates that kinetic impactor technology is a viable technique to potentially defend Earth if necessary.

### Geology of the inSight landing site on mars [^ea7ae233]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Surface rock abundance is typically measured using rock size-frequency distributions in which rock diameter of all rocks larger than a given size are measured over an area. The size-frequency distributions are typically plotted as the cumulative fractional area and/or cumulative number of rocks (normalized by area) versus rock diameter in log-log plots (Fig. 10).

Rock edges are digitized as polygonal outlines in orthorectified and oblique images using ArcMap. A convex hull is then calculated for each digitized rock for which there is topography derived from stereoscopic coverage, providing a minimum axis and maximum axis for each rock in map space for orthorectified images (measured in meters) or pixel space for oblique images (measured as pixels). For orthoimages, such as the workspace mosaic, these axes represent the horizontal length and width of rocks. For oblique images, further processing is necessary to calculate the two oblique axes in meters. To convert oblique measurements from pixels to meters, two axes may be calculated as the product of the distance from the camera (in meters), the camera's angular resolution of 0.8 milliradians/pixel, and the number of pixels for each axis calculated from convex hulls. Distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in (x, y, z) coordinates between each rock's center as extracted from a stereo correlation map and the location of the camera derived from IDA telemetry and lander orientation. Minimum and maximum axes are averaged to yield the mean diameter for each rock. The cumulative fractional area (CFA) and cumulative number of the rocks are integrated over the count area as functions of diameter.

Growth rates of SW-damaged rims, together with average normalized solar wind (SW) number fluxand energy flux E f, avg at selected lunar sampling sites

The distribution of SW number flux and energy flux across the entire lunar surface was simulated for various positions of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth, with both fluxes being normalized. The normalized SW number flux and energy flux are defined asand, whereandrepresent the simulated SW number density and its radial velocity component along the lunar radius. The constantsandare set to be 5and 400 km/s, which are parameters of the undisturbed upstream solar wind, used for normalization such thatandcorrespond to unit number flux and energy flux. The average normalized SW number flux and energy flux across the entire lunar surface during the Moon's orbital period were then calculated. Note that, apart from the definition of SW energy flux, all other aspects of the model calculations in this work align with those described in Xie et al.

### Recent ice-rich deposits formed at high latitudes on mars by sublimation of unstable equatorial ice during low obliquity [^05768464]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Observations from the gamma-ray spectrometer instrument suite on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have been interpreted as indicating the presence of vast reservoirs of near-surface ice in high latitudes of both martian hemispheres. Ice concentrations are estimated to range from 70 per cent at 60 degrees latitude to 100 per cent near the poles, possibly overlain by a few centimetres of ice-free material in most places. This result is supported by morphological evidence of metres-thick layered deposits that are rich in water-ice and periglacial-like features found only at high latitudes. Diffusive exchange of water between the pore space of the regolith and the atmosphere has been proposed to explain this distribution, but such a degree of concentration is difficult to accommodate with such processes. Alternatively, there are suggestions that ice-rich deposits form by transport of ice from polar reservoirs and direct redeposition in high latitudes during periods of higher obliquity, but these results have been difficult to reproduce with other models. Here we propose instead that, during periods of low obliquity (less than 25 degrees), high-latitude ice deposits form in both hemispheres by direct deposition of ice, as a result of sublimation from an equatorial ice reservoir that formed earlier, during a prolonged high-obliquity excursion. Using the ice accumulation rates estimated from global climate model simulations we show that, over the past ten million years, large variations of Mars' obliquity have allowed the formation of such metres-thick, sedimentary layered deposits in high latitude and polar regions.

### An estimate of absolute shear-wave speed in the earth's inner core [^2611ae38]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Observations of seismic body waves that traverse the Earth's inner core (IC) as shear (J) waves are critical for understanding the IC shear properties, advancing our knowledge of the Earth's internal structure and evolution. Here, we present several seismological observations of J phases detected in the earthquake late-coda correlation wavefield at periods of 15-50s, notably via the correlation feature I-J, found to be independent of the Earth reference velocity model. Because I-J is unaffected by compressional wave speeds of the Earth's inner core, outer core, and mantle, it represents an autonomous class of seismological measurements to benchmark the inner core properties. We estimate the absolute shear-wave speed in the IC to be 3.39 ± 0.02 km/s near the top and 3.54 ± 0.02 km/s in the center, lower than recently reported values. This is a 3.4 ± 0.5% reduction from the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), suggesting a less rigid IC than previously estimated from the normal mode data. Such a low shear-wave speed requires re-evaluating IC composition, including the abundance of light elements, the atomic properties and stable crystallographic phase of iron, and the IC solidification process.

### Design and flight results of the VHF / UHF communication system of longjiang lunar microsatellites [^5ce81501]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

As a part of China's Chang'e-4 lunar far side mission, two lunar microsatellites for low frequency radio astronomy, amateur radio and education, Longjiang-1 and Longjiang-2, were launched as secondary payloads on 20 May 2018 together with the Queqiao L2 relay satellite. On 25 May 2018, Longjiang-2 successfully inserted itself into a lunar elliptical orbit of 357km × 13,704km, and became the smallest spacecraft which entered lunar orbit with its own propulsion system. The satellite carried the first amateur radio communication system operating in lunar orbit, which is a VHF/UHF software defined radio (SDR) designed for operation with small ground stations. This article describes and evaluates the design of the VHF/UHF radio and the waveforms used. Flight results of the VHF/UHF radio are also presented, including operation of the radio, performance analysis of downlink signals and the first lunar orbit UHF very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment.

### Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid vesta by the dawn mission [^f0bcaf2b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The theoretical value of δf ~2 Hz is therefore the lower limit of the differential Doppler shift between the surface echo and direct signal, under the assumptions that (1) the position and rotational velocity of the echo site on Vesta are well-represented by a point on the surface, and (2) Dawn's orbital velocity is constant. Our calculation is consistent with the expectation of a small frequency separation due to Dawn's low orbital velocity that is orders of magnitude smaller than observed in typical orbital BSR experiments at larger planetary bodies — such as for the orbital BSR experiment by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which detected radar reflections from the martian surface that were separated by as much as 10 kHz from the received direct signal.

Figures 1 and 2 show the temporal progression of received power spectra from BSR observations during orbit 355. In Fig. 1, black spectra have the same circular polarization as the transmitted wave, RCP, while gray spectra correspond to the power received with opposite (left-hand) circular polarization, LCP.

Fig. 1
Typical progression of received radar signal over the course of an occultation. The frequency spectra show power received in the same circular (SC) and opposite circular (OC) polarization a before/after occultation, b during entry into occultation, c during occultation, and d during exit from occultation of orbit 355. All surface echoes during occultation entry are Doppler-shifted to lower frequencies than the direct signal, while all surface echoes during occultation exit exhibit Doppler shifts to higher frequencies than the direct signal

Progression of received radar signal throughout entrance into and exit from occultation during orbit 355. Occultation entry a spans ~16 s while occultation exit b spans ~25 s. Each spectrum is generated from two averages of 2.5-s integrated spectra, corresponding to a total of 5 s of radar data that start at each listed timestamp. Spectra are vertically offset for display purposes, where each successively higher spectrum corresponds to a step forward by 1 s

### Transcription and translation contribute to gene locus relocation to the nucleoid periphery in E. coli [^32928444]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Localization of diffraction-limited spots in a living cell

The location of the diffraction limited dot was determined by a least-squares fit of a 2D Gaussian point spread function to each spot (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The cellular areas identified from the phase-contrast images were fitted with a 2D elliptical function to determine the center, the short, and the long axes of the cells automatically. Two perpendicular lines relative to the cellular centroid were chosen as x, y coordinates of each cell (Fig. 2b). Then, the normalized relative position of each dot was determined. We mapped the positions of all foci into the first quadrant of the cell based on the cylindrical symmetry of E. coli cell.

Method for measuring the muscle cone inner volume (Fig. 3)

Method for determining the standard measurement position

We used the "tangential coronal position" as the standard measurement position. First, on the axial image of the orbit with the optic nerve displayed (Fig. 3 A), we adjusted the sagittal axis to overlap with the optic nerve long axis to obtain the reference sagittal position (Fig. 3 B). Second, on the reference sagittal image, we adjusted the coronal axis to be tangential to the position where the optic nerve exited the eyeball to obtain the "tangential coronal position" for measurement (Fig. 3 C).

Fig. 3
Method for measuring the muscle cone inner volume. On the a the line pointed to by the arrow is the sagittal axis. On the b the line pointed to by the arrow is the coronal axis. On the c the area of the ellipse pointed to by the arrow is the muscle cone bottom area (S), and the length of the line segment pointed to by the arrow is the muscle cone height (h)

Method for calculating the muscle cone inner volume

Because the muscle cone anatomy was similar to an elliptical cone, we used the standard elliptical vertebral body volume formula (V = Sh/3, V: vertebral body volume, S: cone base area, h: vertebral height) to calculate the muscle cone inner volume.

First, on the "tangential coronal position", using the elliptical area measurement tool, with the optic nerve as the measurement center, we manually outlined and adjusted the elliptical edge to be tangential to the inner edges of the four extraocular muscles. The resulting elliptical area was the muscle cone bottom area (S) (Fig. 3 C). Then, on the reference transection with the optic nerve displayed, we used the line measurement tool to measure the distance from the beginning of the intraorbital segment of the optic nerve to the beginning of the optic canal. The resulting distance was the muscle cone height (h) (Fig. 3 D). Three skilled radiologists (Li Feng, Huamin Tang and Wei Lin) independently completed the measurement of each data and obtained the mean. They were masked and double blind.

### Low cost satellite constellations for nearly continuous global coverage [^22ab4c56]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Throughout the 1970's, the minimum number of spacecraft required to realize total continuous coverage of the Earth surface was thought to be five. Then, Draim published his famous result in 1986 that only four spacecraft were required. These findings were based on a low-fidelity modeling of spacecraft motion. Unfortunately, subsequent researchers noted that when higher fidelity perturbations are enabled in the simulation of the Draim orbits, the propellant required to maintain these orbits can be significant. Thus, while this solution was academically interesting, practical implementation proved to be overly difficult.

This paper reports a pair of four-satellite constellations with common period and similar inclination between satellites that very nearly realize the elusive goal of continuous global coverage. The price of a slight degradation in their coverage has bought a significant reward: operational feasibility. Moreover, the modest gaps in coverage can be flexibly moved to longitudes of least importance at minimal costs to missions. By including the perturbative effects of the sun, the moon, and the asymmetric Earth in the analysis, constellations have been discovered that harness these forces and use them for positive gains (i.e. reduced costs and longer design life). The resulting orbits require dramatically less station-keeping propellant than the Draim constellation and other commonly used constellations, permitting reduced costs and longer potential design lives. In this way, the orbits reduce the barrier of entry for new nation-state and commercial members of the growing space community to own and operate constellations that provide nearly continuous global coverage, enabling these interests to independently sustain global satellite services.

### In-orbit operation of an atomic clock based on laser-cooledRb atoms [^42bc8255]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Atomic clocks based on laser-cooled atoms are widely used as primary frequency standards. Deploying such cold atom clocks (CACs) in space is foreseen to have many applications. Here we present tests of a CAC operating in space. In orbital microgravity, the atoms are cooled, trapped, launched, and finally detected after being interrogated by a microwave field using the Ramsey method. Perturbing influences from the orbital environment on the atoms such as varying magnetic fields and the passage of the spacecraft through Earth's radiation belt are also controlled and mitigated. With appropriate parameters settings, closed-loop locking of the CAC is realized in orbit and an estimated short-term frequency stability close to 3.0×10–13 τ -1/2 has been attained. The demonstration of the long-term operation of cold atom clock in orbit opens possibility on the applications of space-based cold atom sensors.

### Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging guidelines: instrumentation, acquisition, processing, and interpretation [^fdc1632d]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Center-of-rotation (COR) calibration — artifacts, error threshold, and frequency are noted: An alignment error between the center of the electronic matrix of the camera and the mechanical COR can result in a "doughnut" artifact if a 360° orbit and a point source are used or a "tuning fork" artifact if a 180° orbit is used; the effects are most evident when the error is greater than two pixels in a 64 × 64 matrix; errors less than this reduce spatial resolution and image contrast and cause significant artifacts; the accuracy of COR alignment should be checked weekly for each camera head, and in some systems two separate acquisitions are required, one for each detector.

### Intradecadal variations in length of day and their correspondence with geomagnetic jerks [^b933fd00]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Earth's core oscillations and magnetic field inside the liquid outer core cannot be observed directly from the surface, we can infer these information from the intradecadal variations in Earth's rotation rate defined by length of day. However, the fine time-varying characteristics as well as relevant mechanisms of the intradecadal variations are still unclear. Here we report that the intradecadal variations present a significant 8.6-year harmonic component with an unexpected increasing phenomenon, besides a 6-year decreasing oscillation. More importantly, we find that there is a very good correspondence between the extremes of the 8.6-year oscillation with geomagnetic jerks. The fast equatorial waves with subdecadal periods propagating at Earth's core surface may explain the origin of this 8.6-year oscillation.

### No large population of unbound or wide-orbit jupiter-mass planets [^0b98e2e4]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Planet formation theories predict that some planets may be ejected from their parent systems as result of dynamical interactions and other processes. Unbound planets can also be formed through gravitational collapse, in a way similar to that in which stars form. A handful of free-floating planetary-mass objects have been discovered by infrared surveys of young stellar clusters and star-forming regions as well as wide-field surveys, but these studies are incomplete for objects below five Jupiter masses. Gravitational microlensing is the only method capable of exploring the entire population of free-floating planets down to Mars-mass objects, because the microlensing signal does not depend on the brightness of the lensing object. A characteristic timescale of microlensing events depends on the mass of the lens: the less massive the lens, the shorter the microlensing event. A previous analysis of 474 microlensing events found an excess of ten very short events (1–2 days)-more than known stellar populations would suggest-indicating the existence of a large population of unbound or wide-orbit Jupiter-mass planets (reported to be almost twice as common as main-sequence stars). These results, however, do not match predictions of planet-formation theories and surveys of young clusters. Here we analyse a sample of microlensing events six times larger than that of ref. 11 discovered during the years 2010–15. Although our survey has very high sensitivity (detection efficiency) to short-timescale (1–2 days) microlensing events, we found no excess of events with timescales in this range, with a 95 per cent upper limit on the frequency of Jupiter-mass free-floating or wide-orbit planets of 0.25 planets per main-sequence star. We detected a few possible ultrashort-timescale events (with timescales of less than half a day), which may indicate the existence of Earth-mass and super-Earth-mass free-floating planets, as predicted by planet-formation theories.

### Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid vesta by the dawn mission [^2b4e309a]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Experimental constraints and data selection

During the BSR experiment at Vesta, the Dawn spacecraft's HGA was used to transmit telemetry data at X-band radar frequency (8.435 GHz, 3.55 cm wavelength) in RCP, while the three 70-m DSN antennas on Earth — at Goldstone (USA), Canberra (Australia) or Madrid (Spain) — were used to receive. The three receiving systems have the same measurement requirements in terms of noise temperature, antenna gain, pointing loss, and polarization loss as listed in Supplementary Table 1. In two-way coherent downlink mode, Dawn's transmission frequency is driven by the DSN's uplink frequency and yields a Doppler stability (Δ f/f) of 10 −12 over 60-s measurements, i.e. a frequency drift of ~0.0001 Hz s −1. In one-way or non-coherent downlink mode — used when the uplink signal is expected to be unavailable, such as the minutes preceding and following an occultation — the transmission frequency is driven by an onboard internal auxiliary oscillator with a maximum frequency drift of 0.05 Hz s −1. One-way downlink mode contains too much Doppler noise to be used for gravity sciencebut is sufficiently stable for BSR measurements since they are integrated over a much shorter timespan — a few seconds, as opposed to one minute for gravity science measurements — and because we are measuring the relative Doppler shift between the surface echo and direct signal, which are equally affected by slow Doppler changes.

Dawn's HGA was almost constantly pointed at ground stations on Earth for communication, so by continuously transmitting basic telemetry information, we had the opportunity to observe surface reflections of the radar signal just before and after each occultation of the Dawn spacecraft behind Vesta at highly oblique incident angles of ~89° as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1, similar to geometry of the BSR experiment at Mars by the Mars Global Surveyor. In order to analyze the resulting BSR data, we selected occultations that occurred specifically during Dawn's lowest-altitude mapping orbit (LAMO) around Vesta, and using the HGA to ensure the strongest observable surface echoes. During LAMO, there were 16 unique orbits during which an occultation occurred, and therefore 16 individual entries and 16 individual exits.

### Biomarkers of space radiation risk [^90704feb]. Radiation Research (2005). Low credibility.

Radiation risk estimates are based on epidemiological data obtained on Earth for cohorts exposed predominantly to acute doses of gamma rays, and the extrapolation to the space environment is highly problematic and error-prone. The uncertainty can be reduced if risk estimates are compared directly to space radiation-induced biological alterations, i.e. by detecting biomarkers in astronauts. Chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes are the only biomarker that can provide simultaneous information on dose, dose equivalent and risk, and they have been measured extensively in astronauts during the past 10 years. Individual relative risks calculated from chromosomal aberration measurements in crew members after single space missions in low-Earth orbit fall in the same range as the estimates derived from physical dosimetry, suggesting that the current system for radiogenic risk evaluation is essentially sound. However, the output of the biomarker test is dependent upon the sampling time. Recent results show a fast time-dependent decay of chromosomal aberrations in blood lymphocytes after space flight and a lack of correlation between translocations and cumulative dose in astronauts involved in two to five space missions. This "time factor" may reflect individual variability and time dependence in the risk produced by exposure to cosmic radiation during the flight. Biomarkers may be superior to dose in predicting space radiation risk, pending technical improvements in sensitivity, and validation by epidemiological studies.

### Weak magnetism of martian impact basins may reflect cooling in a reversing dynamo [^1f54a68d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Field strength at 200 km altitude was much more stochastic than field morphology and displayed a much stronger dependence on reversal history. For all basin sizes, we found that the peak field strengths decreased with increasing reversal rate up to 10 Myr −1 (Fig. 5), consistent with expectations from previous workand our earlier analytical approximation. Even infrequent reversals substantially reduced fields at orbital altitudes; for a given basin size, reversal rates as low as 1.5 Myr −1 typically yielded a ~5–10 × attenuation compared to the non-reversing case.

Fig. 5
Magnetic field strength as a function of mean reversal frequency for basins with diameters of 200 km, 800 km, and 2200 km.

Peak magnetic field strength (black) and magnetic field strength at the basin center (red) at 200 km altitude versus mean reversal frequency for basins with diameters of 200 km (top), 800 km (center), and 2200 km (bottom). Plotted points assume a saturation remanence intensity of 0.1 A m 2 kg −1, and blue arrows indicate the peak field value at zero reversals for that case. The lines show the best-fit curves to the peak field strength data for each basin size, following a square root of reversal frequency relationship as predicted by our analytical approximation, for saturation remanences (M RS) of 0.02 A m 2 kg −1 (solid), 0.04 A m 2 kg −1 (dashed-dotted), 0.1 A m 2 kg −1 (dashed), and 0.5 A m 2 kg −1 (dotted).

Space averaged porosity profiles from each of these runs are given in Fig. 4.

Implications for Habitability

Impact-generated porosity to depths of 3–4 km is conducive to the circulation of near-surface fluids –. The intense impact flux of the Hadean Earth would have generated widespread hydrothermal systems in proximity of large impacts, with important implication for prebiotic evolution –. Assuming the radial extent of impact-generated porosity continues to scale roughly linearly with impactor size (Figs. 1 and 2), we can consider the surface area under which each impact produces porosity in the upper few km of the Earth's crust. Adding the area affected by each Hadean impact we find the cumulative surface area where substantial impact-generated porosity is expected is 1–3 times the surface area of the Earth. In addition, impact-induced fracturing may be even more important in environments more hostile to life, where the fractures could provide a subsurface refuge from variable and harsh surface conditions –. While the deep lying porosity could dissipate with time, it is important to note that impacts are a protracted source of porosity that could have lasted for 100 s Myr. Our work here further highlights the important role of impact cratering in the development and evolution of near-surface habitable conditions on early Earth and Mars.

We combine space and ground-based measurements in a unique manner to follow electromagnetic superbolt signals from Earth to space over thousands of kilometers, to widely characterize their VLF electric and magnetic wave power density in space and on Earth, to compute ground-space transmitted power ratio, and to extract statistical electromagnetic properties of lightning superbolts never before reported. We conclude that, in addition to a location bias, superbolts exhibit other properties that differ from ordinary lightning, deepening the mystery associated with these extreme events.

### ACR-ACNM-SNMMI-SPR practice parameter for the performance of parathyroid scintigraphy [^8a5956be]. SNMMI/SPR/ACR/ACNM (2024). High credibility.

Parathyroid scintigraphy — equipment and acquisition parameters for SPECT/CT. Equipment performance monitoring should be in accordance with the ACR–AAPM Technical Standard for Nuclear Medical Physics Performance Monitoring of Gamma Cameras. Any gamma camera may be used, and a low-energy, high-resolution parallel-hole collimator is the standard; pinhole collimation can improve resolution and permit 35° right and left anterior oblique and lateral images for lesion depth determination, and for technetium-99m sestamibi a 20% window centered around a 140-keV photopeak should be used. For SPECT, data are optimally acquired over a 360° elliptical body-contouring orbit; the acquisition requires approximately 25 minutes and ranges from 120–60 projections obtained at 15–25 seconds per projection at 3° to 6° angles. SPECT data are acquired into a 128 × 128 matrix corrected for attenuation and reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization iterative technique, and a 3-D postprocessing filter is usually applied. CT acquisition typically uses a tube current ranging from 100–200 mAs and a voltage of 120 kVp (ranging from 100–140 kVp), with 10-mm slices reconstructed in a 256 × 256 matrix, and intravenous contrast is usually not administered. The reconstructed data are ideally displayed as separate SPECT, CT, and fusion image sets in axial, coronal, and sagittal projections, and these image sets should be coregistered.

### Design and flight results of the VHF / UHF communication system of longjiang lunar microsatellites [^d79b0b98]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

As a part of China's Chang'e-4 lunar far side mission, two lunar microsatellites for low frequency radio astronomy, amateur radio and education, Longjiang-1 and Longjiang-2, were launched as secondary payloads on 20 May 2018 together with the Queqiao L2 relay satellite. On 25 May 2018, Longjiang-2 successfully inserted itself into a lunar elliptical orbit of 357 km × 13,704 km, and became the smallest spacecraft which entered lunar orbit with its own propulsion system. The satellite carried the first amateur radio communication system operating in lunar orbit, which is a VHF/UHF software defined radio (SDR) designed for operation with small ground stations. This article describes and evaluates the design of the VHF/UHF radio and the waveforms used. Flight results of the VHF/UHF radio are also presented, including operation of the radio, performance analysis of downlink signals and the first lunar orbit UHF very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment.

### Space radiation cancer risks and uncertainties for mars missions [^8f8bbb9f]. Radiation Research (2001). Low credibility.

Projecting cancer risks from exposure to space radiation is highly uncertain because of the absence of data for humans and because of the limited radiobiology data available for estimating late effects from the high-energy and charge (HZE) ions present in the galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Cancer risk projections involve many biological and physical factors, each of which has a differential range of uncertainty due to the lack of data and knowledge. We discuss an uncertainty assessment within the linear-additivity model using the approach of Monte Carlo sampling from subjective error distributions that represent the lack of knowledge in each factor to quantify the overall uncertainty in risk projections. Calculations are performed using the space radiation environment and transport codes for several Mars mission scenarios. This approach leads to estimates of the uncertainties in cancer risk projections of 400–600% for a Mars mission. The uncertainties in the quality factors are dominant. Using safety standards developed for low-Earth orbit, long-term space missions (> 90 days) outside the Earth's magnetic field are currently unacceptable if the confidence levels in risk projections are considered. Because GCR exposures involve multiple particle or delta-ray tracks per cellular array, our results suggest that the shape of the dose response at low dose rates may be an additional uncertainty for estimating space radiation risks.

### Observation of bose-einstein condensates in an earth-orbiting research lab [^cda07e97]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic world, where low mass and momentum reveal a natural wave-particle duality. Magnifying quantum behaviour to macroscopic scales is a major strength of the technique of cooling and trapping atomic gases, in which low momentum is engineered through extremely low temperatures. Advances in this field have achieved such precise control over atomic systems that gravity, often negligible when considering individual atoms, has emerged as a substantial obstacle. In particular, although weaker trapping fields would allow access to lower temperatures 1,2, gravity empties atom traps that are too weak. Additionally, inertial sensors based on cold atoms could reach better sensitivities if the free-fall time of the atoms after release from the trap could be made longer 3. Planetary orbit, specifically the condition of perpetual free-fall, offers to lift cold-atom studies beyond such terrestrial limitations. Here we report production of rubidium Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in an Earth-orbiting research laboratory, the Cold Atom Lab. We observe subnanokelvin BECs in weak trapping potentials with free-expansion times extending beyond one second, providing an initial demonstration of the advantages offered by a microgravity environment for cold-atom experiments and verifying the successful operation of this facility. With routine BEC production, continuing operations will support long-term investigations of trap topologies unique to microgravity 4,5, atom-laser sources 6, few-body physics 7,8 and pathfinding techniques for atom-wave interferometry 9–12.

### The high optical brightness of the blueWalker 3 satellite [^b7466aa6]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Large constellations of bright artificial satellites in low Earth orbit pose significant challenges to ground-based astronomy 1. Current orbiting constellation satellites have brightnesses between apparent magnitudes 4 and 6, whereas in the near-infrared Ks band, they can reach magnitude 2 (ref. 2). Satellite operators, astronomers and other users of the night sky are working on brightness mitigation strategies 3,4. Radio emissions induce further potential risk to ground-based radio telescopes that also need to be evaluated. Here we report the outcome of an international optical observation campaign of a prototype constellation satellite, AST SpaceMobile's BlueWalker 3. BlueWalker 3 features a 64.3m 2 phased-array antenna as well as a launch vehicle adaptor (LVA) 5. The peak brightness of the satellite reached an apparent magnitude of 0.4. This made the new satellite one of the brightest objects in the night sky. Additionally, the LVA reached an apparent V-band magnitude of 5.5, four times brighter than the current International Astronomical Union recommendation of magnitude 7 (refs. 3,6); it jettisoned on 10 November 2022 (Universal Time), and its orbital ephemeris was not publicly released until 4days later. The expected build-out of constellations with hundreds of thousands of new bright objects 1 will make active satellite tracking and avoidance strategies a necessity for ground-based telescopes.

### Snow depth variability in the Northern hemisphere mountains observed from space [^4098a4ad]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Each Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellite has an exact 12-day repeat cycle, with 175 orbits per cycle. In a given 1 km² EASE-2 grid cell, the Sentinel-1 observations from the different orbits within one repeat cycle have different incidence angles, ranging from 29.1° to 46.0° relative to a flat surface. Over mountain areas, the impact of the incidence angle on σ 0 may be large, e.g. when a terrain slope is facing towards or away from the sensor line of sight in ascending and descending overpasses. To account for the effect of the incidence angle, we separated the σ 0 values pertaining to each of the 175 orbits in a 12-day cycle (repeated for every cycle, with identical incidence angles for each of the orbits). The static bias between σ 0 values from different orbits was then removed by rescaling the mean σ 0 of each orbit to the overall mean (i.e. of the entire σ 0 time series, including all orbits) and applying this mean correction to the individual σ 0 measurements. The accuracy of the incidence-angle normalization increases as more observations become available. Outliers were removed by excluding values that are 3 dB above the 90th-percentile or 3 dB below the 10th-percentile of the time series. Four sub-sets of Sentinel-1 data (i.e. ascending (6 p.m.) and descending (6 a.m.) data from Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) were pre-processed separately and combined into a single Sentinel-1 dataset.

Both Sentinel-1 satellites share the same orbital plane with a 6-day offset, thus the two-satellite constellation offers an exact 6-day repeat cycle. However, the observation frequency during the period considered here varies from as much as ~daily (for certain areas in Europe) to every ~2 weeks (Fig. 1a), depending on the latitude, the availability of ascending and descending orbits, the availability of Sentinel-1B data (reaching full capability in early 2017), and the evolving Sentinel-1 observation acquisition strategy. Prior to 2017, observations can (regionally) be irregular in time, with extended no-data gaps. For instance, relatively few observations were available over parts of the USA and Canada for September-December 2016 (Fig. 3a–c). We did not process any Sentinel-1 data taken before September 2016 owing to the extremely limited coverage outside Europe.

### Northern preference for terrestrial electromagnetic energy input from space weather [^cbd20543]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The ESA Swarm mission, launched in late 2013, comprises three identical spacecraft equipped for making simultaneous, high accuracy and high cadence magnetic and electric field measurements. This study uses data from the Swarm A satellite, in a ~450 km polar orbit, equipped with the fluxgate magnetometer instrumentmeasuring magnetic field vectors at 50 samples/s and the Electric Field Instrumentmeasuring ion velocity vectors at 16 samples/s based on observed ion distributions from two sensors, which are converted into a 2 Hz electric field data product. Under the assumption of frozen flux of the observed ions based on ideal Ohm's Law, where:In Eq. (2), the inferred velocity vectors (v) can be converted into electric field vectors in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.

The automatic event identification algorithm used here has been designed to extract useful scientific data from synchronous magnetic and electric field measurements while addressing known caveats in the electric field data (e.g. uncertainties regarding offsets and magnitudes of the electric field instrument data). It is based on the methodology employed by Park et al. Only magnetic latitudes of between ± 60° and ± 80° magnetic latitude are considered for the analysis. This avoids low-latitude phenomena such as plasma bubblesand localised extreme high-latitude phenomena such as polar cap traversals. The magnetic and electric field data are rotated into the mean-field aligned (MFA) frame, where the z -axis points along the direction of the mean magnetic field, the x -axis points towards the geomagnetic North Pole, and the y -axis completes the triad facing eastwards. A sliding 3-min window is used for mean field calculation.

### Development of progressively earth-independent medical operations to enable NASA exploration missions [^e1ab0f2f]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction -The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) transition from operations in low-Earth orbit to long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars necessitates the development of progressively Earth-independent medical operations (EIMO) to support crews and reduce overall mission risk. Previous work has defined and laid the foundation for EIMO, but further development of the concept is required to prepare for future exploration missions. Methods -NASA's Exploration Medical Capability element organized a series of 5 technical interchange meetings from 2023 to 2024, which included internal (NASA) and external subject-matter experts in human spaceflight, health technology, and austere medicine to create a framework for developing the technologies and procedures necessary to maintain human health and performance in a progressively Earth-independent fashion. Results -The EIMO technical interchange meetings provided a forum for a field of experts and stakeholders to better understand gaps between current approaches to medical care in low-Earth orbit and the innovations needed to maintain the health and performance of astronauts on long-duration deep-space missions. These discussions were recorded, analyzed, and collated into reports that can inform the maturation of EIMO concepts. Conclusions -Multidisciplinary input from experts with experience in human spaceflight, health technology, and austere medicine is critical when planning for long-duration exploration missions. Innovations such as probabilistic risk assessment tools, extended reality devices, and advanced clinical artificial intelligence capabilities have been identified as high-value targets that can enhance inflight medical autonomy while maintaining appropriate workload balance and crew safety. By further developing the EIMO paradigm, NASA aims to identify areas of future work, research, and collaboration to reduce overall risk on future human spaceflight missions into deep space.

### An overview of the descent and landing of the huygens probe on titan [^8c0bcd5f]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is the only Solar System planetary body other than Earth with a thick nitrogen atmosphere. The Voyager spacecraft confirmed that methane was the second-most abundant atmospheric constituent in Titan's atmosphere, and revealed a rich organic chemistry, but its cameras could not see through the thick organic haze. After a seven-year interplanetary journey on board the Cassini orbiter, the Huygens probe was released on 25 December 2004. It reached the upper layer of Titan's atmosphere on 14 January and landed softly after a parachute descent of almost 2.5 hours. Here we report an overview of the Huygens mission, which enabled studies of the atmosphere and surface, including in situ sampling of the organic chemistry, and revealed an Earth-like landscape. The probe descended over the boundary between a bright icy terrain eroded by fluvial activity — probably due to methane-and a darker area that looked like a river- or lake-bed. Post-landing images showed centimetre-sized surface details.

### Magnetosheath jets at jupiter and across the solar system [^353d53eb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Comparing magnetosheath jets across planets

The jets in the Jovian magnetosheath had a long duration in spacecraft observation, which exceeded ten minutes and can even approach an hour. This is much longer than the durations observed for jets at Earth (up to ~ 3 min). By using the measured ion speeds and the jet duration, the parallel size of the jet along its flow direction can be estimated (see Methods subsection Voyager 2 trajectory in plasma and jet size).

Here we compare jets at Mars, Earth, and Jupiter. We include four jets at Mars that were recently reported using MAVEN observation, where they were grouped as two jets given the proximity of the jets in each pair. One such pair is depicted in Fig. 4. In this study, we separate them as they show similar features to the second and third jets observed at Jupiter. For terrestrial jets, we include two sunward jets reported in, and two anti-sunward jets reported in. Figure 5 shows the parallel sizes of these jets plotted against the bow shock standoff distance. The parallel size of jets appears to scale with the size of bow shock. A similar trend scaling with shock size has also been found for HFA upstream of planetary bow shocks. Figure 5 indicates that jet size is proportional to the square root of the bow shock standoff distance. However, it is important to acknowledge that this result is limited by the relatively small number of observed jets in planetary magnetosheaths so far.

### The hammam effect or how a warm ocean enhances large scale atmospheric predictability [^382ddf87]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Local dimension and persistence

To determine d, we exploit recent results from the application of extreme value theory to Poincaré recurrences in dynamical systems. This approach considers long trajectories of a system — in our case successions of daily SLP latitude–longitude maps — corresponding to a sequence of states on the attractor. For a given point ζ in phase space (e.g. a given SLP map), we compute the probability that the system returns within a ball of radiuscentred on the point ζ. The Freitas et al.theorem, modified by Lucarini et al. states that logarithmic returns:

yield a probability distribution such that:

where z = g (x (t)) and s is a high threshold associated to a quantile q of the series g (x (t)). Requiring that the orbit falls within a ball of radiusaround the point ζ is equivalent to asking that the series g (x (t)) is over the threshold s; therefore, the ball radiusis simply e − s(q). The resulting distribution is the exponential member of the Generalised Pareto Distribution family. The parameters μ and σ, namely the location and the scale parameter of the distribution, depend on the point ζ in phase space. μ (ζ) corresponds to the threshold s (q), while the local dimension d (ζ) can be obtained via the relation.

When x (t) contains all the variables of the system, the estimation of d based on extreme value theory has a number of advantages over traditional methods (e.g. the box counting algorithm). First, it does not require to estimate the volume of different sets in scale space: the selection of s (q) based on the quantile provides a selection of different scales s, which depends on the recurrence rate around the point ζ. Moreover, it does not require the a priori selection of the maximum embedding dimension as the observable g is always a univariate time-series.

The persistence of the state ζ is measured via the extremal index, an adimensional parameter, from which we extract. θ (ζ) is therefore the inverse of the average residence time of trajectories aroundand it has unit of a frequency (in this study 1/days). If ζ is a fixed point of the attractor. For a trajectory that leaves the neighbourhood of ζ at the next time iteration, θ = 1. To estimate θ, we adopt the Süveges estimator. For further details on the extremal index, see ref.

### Design and flight results of the VHF / UHF communication system of longjiang lunar microsatellites [^318675d4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Longjiang-1 and Longjiang-2 are a pair of lunar micro-satellites for low-frequency radio astronomy, amateur radio, and education, developed by Harbin Institute of Technology, as a part of the Chang'e-4 lunar far side mission. The satellites, each with a volume of 765 × 420 × 570 mm 3 and a mass of ~47 kg, were launched into a lunar transfer orbit on 20 May 2018 by a CZ-4C rocket as secondary payloads, together with the Queqiao L2 relay satellite. Unfortunately, Longjiang-1 was lost because of a malfunction of thruster control logic during the first trajectory correction maneuver (TCM). The logic on Longjiang-2 was later patched, and after 113 h of flight since launch, the satellite successfully inserted itself into a lunar elliptical orbit of 357 km × 13704 km, and became the smallest spacecraft which entered lunar orbit independently.

Besides the S-band and X-band radios operated by the Chinese Deep Space Network (CDSN), Longjiang-1 and Longjiang-2 were equipped with identical VHF/UHF radios for amateur radio experiments and backup tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C). The radio onboard Longjiang-2 is the first radio communication system operating on amateur radio bands that was placed into lunar orbit.

Radio amateurs have been building and tracking satellites since 1961. Nowadays, many small satellites developed for universities and technology development projects use amateur radio frequencies and AX.25 link layer protocol. With the development of the Internet, several global satellite tracking networks have been developed by radio amateurs, for example SatNOGS. Besides that, radio amateurs around the word use the Moon as a natural reflector for moonbounce, or Earth–Moon–Earth (EME) communication. For these purposes, radio amateurs operate a large number of high gain antennas around the world, forming a possible non-governmental, non-commercial deep space network, though the size of antennas is relatively small. VHF/UHF is among the most popular bands used for EME.

### Use of geological maps in detecting asbestos-related diseases; A new region in anatolia [^f5801598]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the potential relationship between the presence of asbestos-related diseases (ARDs) in the region of Kastamonu, Turkey.

Methods

The places of birth of patients with ARDs and control subjects diagnosed between 2008 and 2019 and identified in a tertiary hospital in Istanbul. Soil samples were taken from plaster surfaces and quarries. The analysis was done with transmission electron microscopy.

Results

ARDs was detected in 55(17.9%) of 307 participants. Patients had a mean age of 68 ± 11 years. Residential proximity to ophiolites increased ARD incidence by 6.2% per kilometer (P = 0.003). Birthplaces were identified as being inside an ophiolitic unit, or if they were not, the Google Earth software was used to determine the beeline distance between the settlement's center and the edge of the closest ophiolitic unit. The appropriate threshold for this case is 12.75 km, with 75% sensitivity and 87% specificity.

Conclusion

ARDs due to naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) are present in hitherto unknown places. Geological maps including ophiolites can help locate these places.

### Increases in greenhouse forcing inferred from the outgoing longwave radiation spectra of the earth in 1970 and 1997 [^48370594]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The evolution of the Earth's climate has been extensively studied, and a strong link between increases in surface temperatures and greenhouse gases has been established. But this relationship is complicated by several feedback processes-most importantly the hydrological cycle-that are not well understood. Changes in the Earth's greenhouse effect can be detected from variations in the spectrum of outgoing longwave radiation, which is a measure of how the Earth cools to space and carries the imprint of the gases that are responsible for the greenhouse effect. Here we analyse the difference between the spectra of the outgoing longwave radiation of the Earth as measured by orbiting spacecraft in 1970 and 1997. We find differences in the spectra that point to long-term changes in atmospheric CH4, CO2 and O3 as well as CFC-11 and CFC-12. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect that is consistent with concerns over radiative forcing of climate.

### Detection of magnetospheric ion drift patterns at mars [^e0964b59]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Formation mechanisms of the wedge-like dispersion structures

The wedge-like dispersion structure observed in intrinsic magnetospheres is attributed to the radially spatial separation of ions at different energies –. To gain a comprehensive understanding of our specific case at Mars, it is essential to investigate the spatial separation of ions at different energies within the crustal fields. A useful approach is to examine the drift path of particles and the spacecraft trajectory relative to the crustal fields on the magnetic equator plane –. This plane is defined by the magnetic equator points, which correspond to the locations of the minimum field strength along the field lines. For the Earth's dipole field, the magnetic equator plane is basically parallel to the equator plane and can be easily determined, and we can utilize the L -value parameter to quantitatively ascertain the positions of the magnetic field lines. The magnetic equator points situated in lower L -shells possess higher.

Here we also construct a magnetic equator plane of the crustal fields to determine the spacecraft's relative path and gain insights into the spatial distribution of ions at different energies. First, we extracted the magnetic equator points of the traced field lines (denoted by the magenta dots in Fig. 4a). Subsequently, we employed the least-square method to fit the average magnetic equator plane (depicted by the grey-shaded region) that encompasses most of these magnetic equator points. Figure 4a demonstrates that these magnetic equator points predominantly reside within the magnetic equator plane, indicating that this plane is well-determined. Then, similar to the dipole field, we set a local coordinate system to study the distribution of ions at different energies, where n is the normal direction of the magnetic equator plane, is the azimuthal direction, is the radial direction (pointing to the outer region of crustal fields) which completes the right-handed system (see detailed information in the Methods).

### Geological evidence for extensive basin ejecta as plains terrains in the moon's south polar region [^5362649b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

On the basis of its unexplored nature and distinctive scientific value, the lunar southern polar region and the cold-trapped and potentially abundant volatiles have become popular targets for exploration destinations on the Moon, in particular, for multiple planned landed missions. Due to the large-scale rugged topography of the lunar southern polar region (compared with mare plains that many previous missions landed on) and the unique environments for polar volatile emplacement and preservation, selecting suitable landing and exploration sites is critical for these scientific and volatile prospecting missions. Recent studies of the landing sites of lunar polar missions planned for the coming years have commonly focused on high-standing massifs, for instance, the western Nobile crater rim for NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, the many candidate landing regions for NASA's Artemis III, China's Chang'e-7and beyond missions. The major advantage of these massif areas is the favorable solar illumination conditions, thus providing a relatively benign thermal environment and abundant solar energy for surface exploration activities. However, these high-standing massifs are still subject to considerable difficulties in both science and exploration. Topographic slopes for most portions of these massifs are very steep, commonly larger than 20° (ref.), very challenging for surface landing, rover mobility, and surface experiments. The summits of some massifs are relatively flatter, while their spatial extents are typically very small. For instance, the areas of slope less than 10° on the summit of Mons Malapert are less than 4 × 2 km in size. This is much smaller than the nominal landing ellipses for many lunar missions, such as the 15 × 30 km landing ellipse for the Russian Luna 25-Glob missionand requires very high landing precision (Note that the landing ellipse for NASA's Artemis program is probably much smaller, at a scale of ~100 m.) In addition, frequent solar illumination would result in relatively warm surface temperatures that are not suitable for the long-term retention of water ice and other frozen volatiles. We expect that it will be very difficult to locate and harvest spatially extensive ice deposits on the surface of these massif terrains; the ice deposits are more likely to have accumulated either in sub-kilometer micro-cold traps or at some depth below the surface.

### Light curves and colours of the ejecta from dimorphos after the DART impact [^00231cfd]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

On 26 September 2022, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft struck Dimorphos, a satellite of the asteroid 65803 Didymos 1. Because it is a binary system, it is possible to determine how much the orbit of the satellite changed, as part of a test of what is necessary to deflect an asteroid that might threaten Earth with an impact. In nominal cases, pre-impact predictions of the orbital period reduction ranged from roughly 8.8 to ﻿17min (refs. 2,3). Here we report optical observations of Dimorphos before, during and after the impact, from a network of citizen scientists' telescopes across the world. We find a maximum brightening of 2.29 ± 0.14mag on impact. Didymos fades back to its pre-impact brightness over the course of 23.7 ± 0.7days. We estimate lower limits on the mass contained in the ejecta, which was 0.3–0.5% Dimorphos's mass depending on the dust size. We also observe a reddening of the ejecta on impact.
