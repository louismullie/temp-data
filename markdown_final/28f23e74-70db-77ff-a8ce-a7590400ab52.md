## Question

How do I treat otitis externa in a 2 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat otitis externa in a 2-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing it from look-alikes. Then, I should assess pain and plan analgesia. Next, I will evaluate the tympanic membrane status to choose a safe topical agent. After that, I will optimize delivery of drops and decide on duration. Finally, I need to set expectations for follow-up, define treatment failure, and outline what to do if the child does not improve as expected, including when to add systemic therapy or consider alternative diagnoses.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because diffuse acute otitis externa in children can mimic other causes of otalgia and otorrhea such as acute otitis media, furunculosis, contact dermatitis, or herpes zoster oticus. I should look for classic findings like pain worsened by tragal pressure or pinna movement, canal edema and erythema, and sometimes otorrhea, while remembering that the AAO-HNSF guideline explicitly targets patients aged 2 years and older with diffuse AOE, which fits this child [^501dd35c] [^955a20fb].

> Wait, let me verify the pain assessment and analgesic plan because pain is the dominant symptom and drives caregiver anxiety. I should assess severity and recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen as first-line oral analgesics, reserving topical anesthetics only if the tympanic membrane is intact and avoiding them if there is any perforation risk; I need to ensure dosing is weight-appropriate and reassure that pain typically improves within 24–72 hours of effective topical therapy [^2212c3ca] [^3e4f098c].

> I need to check the tympanic membrane status next because it dictates whether I can use standard topical agents or must choose a non-ototoxic preparation. If the TM is intact, neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone or a fluoroquinolone drop with steroid are reasonable; if the TM is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present, I should avoid ototoxic agents such as aminoglycosides and alcohol-containing drops and use a non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone otic preparation, which is FDA-approved for middle ear exposure and supported by guidelines [^7cd32554] [^e999f581] [^cb9fffef].

> Hold on, I should verify delivery optimization because canal edema can block drops. If the canal is obstructed, I will perform aural toilet to remove debris and consider placing an ear wick to facilitate medication penetration; I should also teach caregivers to position the child with the affected ear up for 1–2 minutes after drops and to warm the bottle to reduce vestibular symptoms, as these steps improve adherence and outcomes [^d96cfe34] [^cb2a1fc8] [^82ed433d].

> Let me think about duration and regimen. Typical topical therapy is 7–10 days, and I should advise continuing until symptoms resolve plus a few extra days, with a hard stop at 14 days if not better. Once-daily fluoroquinolone regimens can improve adherence, and randomized data support 7-day courses with high cure rates in children, which is practical for a 2-year-old [^82ed433d] [^0045658b].

> I should double-check the follow-up plan and define treatment failure clearly. Expected improvement within 48–72 hours means less pain and less edema; if there is no improvement by 48–72 hours, I should reassess the diagnosis, confirm drop delivery and adherence, and consider alternative causes such as fungal infection, contact dermatitis, or unrecognized perforation. Persistent symptoms beyond 2 weeks warrant further evaluation and possible ENT referral [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a] [^ea24514f].

> But wait, what if the infection extends beyond the canal or the child is systemically ill? I need to ensure I escalate appropriately: if there is cellulitis of the pinna, periauricular tissues, or face, or if the child is immunocompromised or diabetic, I should add systemic antibiotics with coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, recognizing that routine oral antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated diffuse AOE and may cause harm without benefit [^74dba929] [^d5cf12a6] [^1920969b].

> Let me reconsider prevention counseling because recurrence is common in children. I should advise keeping the ear dry during treatment, using a petrolatum-coated cotton ball for bathing, avoiding trauma or instrumentation, and considering acidifying drops after swimming once the acute episode resolves, as moisture control and trauma avoidance reduce recurrence risk [^82ed433d] [^87acaa1b].

> Putting this together, my final, practical approach is as follows: confirm diffuse AOE clinically and exclude mimics; treat pain with weight-based acetaminophen or ibuprofen; if the TM is intact, prescribe a topical antibiotic with steroid such as neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone or ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone for 7–10 days, choosing based on cost, adherence, and preference; if the TM is perforated or tubes are present, use a non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone otic preparation; optimize delivery with aural toilet or wick if obstructed; reassess at 48–72 hours if not improving; and escalate to systemic therapy only if there is extension beyond the canal or specific host risk factors, while counseling on water precautions and follow-up if symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks [^501dd35c] [^bb9cfda4] [^7cd32554] [^d96cfe34] [^8bc30361] [^74dba929].

---

Treat a 2-year-old with otitis externa using **topical antibiotics** (ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone) for 7–10 days [^cb9fffef] [^82ed433d], as they are safe and effective even if the tympanic membrane is perforated [^e999f581] [^fcc711ce]. Do not use **oral antibiotics** unless there is cellulitis beyond the ear canal or the child is immunocompromised [^d5cf12a6] [^74dba929]. Manage pain with acetaminophen or ibuprofen [^2212c3ca], and keep the ear dry during treatment [^82ed433d]. If the ear canal is swollen, place an ear wick to improve drop delivery [^d96cfe34] [^cb2a1fc8]. Reassess at 48–72 hours if there is no improvement [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Symptoms**: Ear pain (otalgia), itching, fullness, hearing loss, and otorrhea (discharge) are common [^59d21c16].

- **Signs**: Erythema, edema, and tenderness of the external auditory canal (EAC), often with tragal or pinna tenderness [^59d21c16].

- **Differentiation**: Distinguish from acute otitis media (AOM) by the absence of middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane on otoscopy [^9ec2be00].

---

## Topical antibiotic therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Topical antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment for uncomplicated AOE [^bb9cfda4].

- **Preferred agents**: Fluoroquinolone drops (ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) are preferred due to their safety profile, even with a perforated tympanic membrane [^e999f581] [^fcc711ce].

- **Alternative agents**: Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone drops may be used if the tympanic membrane is intact, but caution is advised due to potential ototoxicity with prolonged use [^e999f581].

- **Duration**: Typically 7–10 days, with improvement expected within 48–72 hours [^82ed433d] [^8bc30361].

---

## Pain management

Pain control is essential; use **acetaminophen or ibuprofen** based on severity [^2212c3ca] [^3e4f098c]. Avoid topical anesthetics (e.g. benzocaine) due to potential toxicity and lack of proven benefit [^3e4f098c].

---

## Adjunctive measures

- **Aural toilet**: Gentle cleaning of the EAC to remove debris and improve medication penetration [^d96cfe34].

- **Wick placement**: If the EAC is edematous, an ear wick (e.g. Pope wick) can facilitate drop delivery [^cb2a1fc8].

- **Water precautions**: Keep the ear dry during treatment to prevent recurrence [^82ed433d].

---

## Indications for systemic antibiotic therapy

Systemic antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated AOE [^d5cf12a6]. Use them only when:

- **Extension**: Cellulitis extends beyond the EAC to the pinna, face, or neck [^74dba929].

- **Immunocompromise**: The child is immunocompromised or has diabetes mellitus [^74dba929].

- **Failure**: Topical therapy fails after 48–72 hours of appropriate treatment [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

Reassess at **48–72 hours** if there is no improvement to confirm the diagnosis, ensure proper medication delivery, and exclude other causes (e.g. fungal infection, contact dermatitis) [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a]. Most children improve within 48–72 hours; persistent symptoms beyond 2 weeks warrant further evaluation [^8bc30361] [^ea24514f].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention focuses on **education** to avoid trauma, minimize moisture, and keep the ear canal dry, especially after swimming [^87acaa1b]. Consider prophylactic acidifying drops (e.g. 2% acetic acid) for recurrent AOE [^87acaa1b].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm diagnosis | - Otoscopy <br/> - Exclude AOM [^955a20fb] |
| 2 | Pain management | Acetaminophen or ibuprofen [^2212c3ca] |
| 3 | Topical antibiotics | - Ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone for 7–10 days [^cb9fffef] [^82ed433d] |
| 4 | Adjunctive measures | - Aural toilet <br/> - Wick if edema <br/> - Water precautions [^d96cfe34] [^cb2a1fc8] [^82ed433d] |
| 5 | Reassess at 48–72 hours | Confirm diagnosis and adherence [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a] |
| 6 | Systemic antibiotics | Only if extension, immunocompromise, or failure of topical therapy [^d5cf12a6] [^74dba929] |

---

Treatment of otitis externa in a 2-year-old centers on **topical antibiotics**, pain control, and ear hygiene, with systemic antibiotics reserved for specific indications. Reassessment at 48–72 hours ensures timely adjustment if response is inadequate [^8bc30361].

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours [corrected] to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: treatment [^a5c59683]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New insights into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) have been gained in recent years. For this reason, the Italian Paediatric Society has updated its 2010 guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was carried out on PubMed. Only pediatric studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 in English or Italian were included. Each included study was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

Prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for children with otorrhea, intracranial complications and/or a history of recurrence and for children under the age of 6 months. For children 6 months to 2 years of age, prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for all forms of unilateral and bilateral AOM, whether mild or severe. Prompt antibiotic treatment is also recommended for children over 2 years with severe bilateral AOM. A watchful-waiting approach can be applied to children over 2 years with mild or severe unilateral AOM or mild bilateral AOM. High doses of amoxicillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for patients with a high risk of infection by Beta-lactamase producing strains, remain the first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions

AOM should be managed on a case-by-case basis that takes account of the child's age, the severity of the episode and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. In patients under 2 years, prompt antibiotic treatment is always recommended.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^6eddd9b3]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 2 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM). The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious disease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^8bde4d29]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

Acute otitis media (AOM) duration of therapy by age and severity: The optimal duration is uncertain, but for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course appears equally effective in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild or moderate AOM, and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms, a 5- to 7-day course is adequate treatment.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment—STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^6a974e18]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) management terminology—Key terms are defined for consistent use: “Otitis externa—an infection of the external auditory canal,” “Tympanometry—measuring acoustic immittance (transfer of acoustic energy) of the ear as a function of ear canal air pressure,” and “Number needed to treat (NNT)—the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent 1 additional bad outcome.” Initial antibiotic therapy is defined as “treatment of AOM with antibiotics that are prescribed at the time of diagnosis with the intent of starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible after the encounter,” whereas initial observation is “initial management of AOM limited to symptomatic relief, with commencement of antibiotic therapy only if the child’s condition worsens at any time or does not show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis; a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and initiation of antibiotics if the child fails observation.”

Introduction

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, in humid environments, in people with narrow ear canals, in hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of empirical treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

Nine studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid, topical aluminium acetate, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, and combinations of these agents.

### Medical and surgical management of otitis media in children [^4adc0f06]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

OM, though frequent and seemingly simple to evaluate and manage, remains a treatment challenge. Increasingly sophisticated clinical trials assessing OM medical treatment efficacy and outcome have demonstrated that many treatment regimens that were commonly used a decade ago are no longer recommended. Surgical therapy for OM, though remaining the same, has come under intense scrutiny from several angles but still plays a central role for this disease. Given the multiple facets of OM, its frequency, and its potential to cause short- and long-term morbidity in children, the next decade is sure to bring further treatment innovations.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^3c25d4f5]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients <2 months or >12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child <4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

Acute otitis externa—antimicrobial treatment emphasizes topical therapy and discourages routine systemic antibiotics. Topical antimicrobials are beneficial for AOE, but oral antibiotics have limited utility, yet about 20% to 40% of patients with AOE receive oral antibiotics, with or without topical therapy, without clinical benefit.

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention [^87acaa1b]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^27e2548e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

### Otitis media with effusion [^fe6a496b]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children," which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children 1 to 3 years old with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced-practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media. The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should 1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME, 2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk, and 3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that 4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME, 5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected, and 6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate (tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure). Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that 1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children, and 2) because antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME, they should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that 1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and 2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery) and provide additional relevant information such as history of acute otitis media and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for 1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME, based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy, or 2) allergy management as a treatment for OME, based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children more than 12 years old, because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child-development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

American Academy of Pediatrics—acute otitis media (AOM) pain management states Key Action Statement 2: “The management of AOM should include an assessment of pain. If pain is present, the clinician should recommend treatment to reduce pain” with “Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Strong Recommendation.” Pain is the major symptom of AOM. Antibiotic therapy “does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours and even after 3 to 7 days, there may be persistent pain, fever, or both in 30% of children younger than 2 years,” whereas “analgesics do relieve pain associated with AOM within 24 hours and should be used whether antibiotic therapy is or is not prescribed; they should be continued as long as needed.” The management of pain “should be addressed regardless of the use of antibiotics,” and “Treating pain is essential whether or not antibiotics are prescribed.” Choice of analgesic is intentionally unspecified, and clinicians should select therapy on “the basis of a consideration of benefits and risks” and “incorporate parent/caregiver and patient preference.” Topical analgesics are excluded “in the presence of a perforated TM.”

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^59d21c16]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis externa: 
- Definition: Acute otitis externa is defined as an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal, possibly involving the tympanic membrane and pinna as well.
- Pathophysiology: More than 90% of acute otitis externa cases are caused by bacteria, most commonly P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Polymicrobial infection is common. Fungi are a rare cause of acute otitis externa.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of acute otitis externa in the US is estimated at 810 per 100,000 person-years.
- Disease course: The characteristic symptom of acute otitis externa is severe pain, which is typically worsened by pressure on the tragus or tension on the pinna. Other symptoms include otorrhea, itch, erythema, and swelling of the ear canal, potentially leading to conductive hearing loss. Inadequately treated acute otitis externa may lead to chronic otitis externa.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of a 4- to 6-week course of antibiotics help lower the morbidity and mortality, but recurrence is common.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution once daily for 7 days in the treatment of otitis externa: a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial [^0045658b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis externa (OE) is an infection of the external auditory canal that is typically treated with topically applied broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twice-daily topical treatment with ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution for 10 days has been reported to be as effective and well tolerated as the standard of care, neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone solution administered 4 times daily for 10 days.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 7 days of a once-daily regimen of ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution in the treatment of OE.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, Phase III study was conducted from June 12, 2002, to October 14, 2002. Eligible patients were aged > or = 6 months and had OE of <2 weeks' duration with moderate to severe edema and tenderness involving 1 or both ears and sufficient exudate for microbiologic culture. Ofloxacin otic solution was instilled once daily for 7 days (5 drops for children aged 6 months to <13 years, 10 drops for adolescents/adults aged > or = 13 years). Assessments were conducted at the end-of-treatment visit and 7 to 10 days later (the test-of-cure visit). Medication was supplied free of charge to study participants who incurred no costs for physician visits.

Results

Of 489 patients enrolled at 58 sites in 3 countries, 439 were clinically evaluable (173 children, 266 adolescents/adults; 52 % males, 48% females; 47% Hispanic, 45% white; 5% black, and 3% other). The cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 91% (95% of children, 88% of adolescents/adults); 68% of patients were cured within 7 days. Forty-three potentially pathogenic strains were isolated from 253 microbiologically evaluable patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 158 (62%) microbiologically evaluable patients and Staphylococcus aureus from 32 (13%). Eradication rates were 96% overall. No serious adverse events were observed. Minor adverse events were experienced by 15 (3%) of 489 patients included in the safety population. The most common adverse events were pruritus (5 patients), increased earache (4 patients), and application-site reactions (3 patients). Overall mean (SD) adherence to therapy was 98% (11.9).

Conclusions

Ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution administered once daily for 7 days was well tolerated and effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure of OE. The compliance rates in this study suggests that this regimen may be better accepted by patients than longer, more repetitive regimens.

### Otitis externa: review and clinical update [^9809f6b7]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, discharge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.

### Treatment of acute otitis media in children under 2 years of age [^b5433c00]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recommendations vary regarding immediate antimicrobial treatment versus watchful waiting for children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media.

Methods

We randomly assigned 291 children 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media diagnosed with the use of stringent criteria, to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or placebo for 10 days. We measured symptomatic response and rates of clinical failure.

Results

Among the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, 35% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 80% by day 7; among children who received placebo, 28% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 54% by day 4, and 74% by day 7 (P=0.14 for the overall comparison). For sustained resolution of symptoms, the corresponding values were 20%, 41%, and 67% with amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 14%, 36%, and 53% with placebo (P=0.04 for the overall comparison). Mean symptom scores over the first 7 days were lower for the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than for those who received placebo (P=0.02). The rate of clinical failure--defined as the persistence of signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination--was also lower among the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those who received placebo: 4% versus 23% at or before the visit on day 4 or 5 (P<0.001) and 16% versus 51% at or before the visit on day 10 to 12 (P<0.001). Mastoiditis developed in one child who received placebo. Diarrhea and diaper-area dermatitis were more common among children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate. There were no significant changes in either group in the rates of nasopharyngeal colonization with nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Conclusions

Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days tended to reduce the time to resolution of symptoms and reduced the overall symptom burden and the rate of persistent signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination.

### A single topical agent is clinically equivalent to the combination of topical and oral antibiotic treatment for otitis externa [^3e07dd91]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate clinical equivalence (statistical noninferiority) of topical ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone (CHC, Cipro HC) and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone (NPH, Cortisporin) with systemic amoxicillin (AMX, Amoxil), for treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Design

Randomized, active-control, observer-blind, multicenter trial.

Patients

Altogether, 206 patients were enrolled (CHC, 106; NPH + AMX, 100). Patients were > or =1 year of age, had AOE >2 days with at least mild symptoms, and gave informed consent. All were evaluable for safety, and 151 were evaluable for efficacy.

Interventions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone 3 drops twice daily for 7 days (adults and children) or NPH 4 drops (adults) or 2 drops (children) with AMX 250 mg (adults and children) 3 times daily for 10 days, as directed in approved product labeling.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy 7 days after treatment ended (test of cure). Secondary variables included time to end of pain, symptom scores (otalgia and tenderness) and microbiological eradication. Noninferiority was declared if the lower confidence limit around the measurement difference was above -10 (nearer zero).

Results

Response to therapy was higher for CHC (95.71% vs 89.83%) but was statistically noninferior (lower confidence limit, -4.98) to NPH + AMX. Median time to end of pain was 6 days for both groups. Noninferiority was declared for symptom scores at all measurement periods and for microbiological eradication. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported.

Conclusions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone is clinically equivalent to NPH + AMX for the treatment of AOE in adults and children. However, low systemic exposure, absence of ototoxicity, and less frequent dosing clearly favor Cipro HC.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^c06882c5]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline—this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion [^7e471e8d]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children," which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM). The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should (1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME; (2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk; and (3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known), or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that (4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer, or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME; (5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; and (6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate, tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure. Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy, with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that (1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children and (2) antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME and should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that (1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and (2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery), and provide additional relevant information such as history of AOM and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for (1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy and (2) allergy management as a treatment for OME based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children older than 12 years because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^e5b5c004]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline—structure of key action statements and role of patient preferences are outlined as follows: Each evidence-based statement is organized in a similar fashion with an evidence-based key action statement in bold, followed by the strength of the recommendation in italics, and each statement is followed by an action statement profile describing aggregate evidence quality, confidence in the evidence, and the guideline development group’s benefit-harm assessment with explicit value judgments, clarification of intentional vagueness, the role of patient preferences, the policy level, and any differences of opinion; the role of patient preferences in making decisions deserves further clarification, and when the evidence base demonstrates clear benefit (such as with intraoperative decision making), clinicians should provide patients with clear and comprehensible information on the benefits to facilitate understanding and shared decision making, which in turn leads to better patient adherence and outcomes.

### A prospective observational study of 5-, 7-, and 10-day antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media [^0963d615]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare 5-, 7- and 10-day duration of antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) in children.

Study Design and Setting

Prospective nonrandomized 1-year evaluation of 3 treatment durations for AOM in a private pediatric setting. Outcomes assessed at 14 +/- 4 days after start of therapy with clinical response categorized as cure, improvement, or failure.

Results

A total of 2172 children were studied; 46.4% were < or =2-years-old. Antibiotics used were amoxicillin (61.9% of patients), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (11.7%), cephalosporins (14.2%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (5.2%), and macrolides/azalides (4.8%). No overall difference in outcome was observed comparing the 5-day (n = 707), 7-day (n = 423), or 10-day (n = 1042) treatments, including children < or =2-years-old. However, in the subset who had an episode of AOM in the preceding month, outcome differed; 5-day treatment was followed by more frequent failure than 10-day treatment (P < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, variables identified as contributing to a cure were: >2-years-old (P < 0.0001), no AOM in the preceding month (P = 0.07), or preceding 12 months (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Our study supports the transition from 10 to 5 days for standard AOM antibiotic treatment duration in most patients. A 10-day regimen may be superior in children who have experienced an episode of AOM within the preceding month, a known risk factor for resistant bacterial infection in the otitis-prone patient.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Treatment of otorrhea in infants and children-AAFP (...) [^b29fe74b]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group A streptococcus, a relatively rare cause of otitis media, appears to be associated with a higher rate of acute perforation and more rapid injury to the tympanic membrane. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cause most cases of otitis externa. Otorrhea is the most common complication of tympanostomy tube placement. The insertion of ototopical drops at the time of surgery appears to be effective in reducing the rate of otorrhea. Acute otorrhea in a patient with a tympanostomy tube may represent acute otitis media or water contamination from the external canal. Aspirating material from the middle ear through the tympanostomy tube will help in identifying the causative organisms. Acute otorrhea associated with otitis media with perforation can be treated with oral antibiotics. It is helpful to obtain a specimen for culture directly through the perforation before initiating treatment.

The use of ototopical agents in the treatment of otitis media with perforation is controversial, but the newer fluoroquinolone otic solutions are not known to be ototoxic and may have a role in these cases. Treatment of otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes should be guided by stain and culture of purulent material. The use of ototopical agents such as ofloxacin and irrigation are usually sufficient, although oral antibiotics are often used. Otitis externa can be treated with gentle suction using hypertonic saline and instillation of 2 percent acetic acid. Antibioticcorticosteroid combination otic drops may be helpful if canal wall inflammation is severe. P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococci and S. pneumoniae. Evaluation includes a complete examination and a culture of organisms from the middle ear. Initial management includes the use of ototopical agents and aural toilet. This may require frequent visits to a physician.

There is little place for oral antibiotics in the treatment of CSOM because of the lack of an oral antibiotic effective against P. aeruginosa in children. If otorrhea continues for an additional two weeks despite treatment, intravenous anti-pseudomonas agents, such as ceftazidime, may be useful. Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who fail all medical therapies.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^bab96ddf]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM)—initial observation, parent partnership, and rescue antibiotics: National guidelines in several countries included observation as an initial treatment option under specified circumstances, and in numerous studies only approximately one-third of initially observed children required a rescue antibiotic, suggesting antibiotic use could potentially be reduced by 65% in eligible children. The decision not to give initial antibiotic treatment and observe should be a joint decision of the clinician and the parents, and a system for close follow-up and a means of beginning antibiotics must be in place if symptoms worsen or no improvement is seen in 48 to 72 hours. Initial observation of AOM should be part of a larger management strategy that includes analgesics, parent information, and provisions for a rescue antibiotic; education of parents should include an explanation about the self-limited nature of most episodes of AOM, especially in children 2 years and older, the importance of pain management early in the course, and the potential adverse effects of antibiotics, and such an approach can substantially reduce prescription fill rates for rescue antibiotics. A critical component is the ability to provide a rescue antibiotic, often by using a “safety net” or “wait-and-see” prescription to be filled only if the child fails to improve within 2 to 3 days or if symptoms worsen at any time, or alternatively instructing the caregiver to call or return if the child fails to improve within 2 to 3 days or if symptoms worsen.

### Acute otitis externa: an update [^bb15ddd3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^2086b726]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible.We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low.Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial).In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively).One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate.No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning.Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid.The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed.Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision.Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

### Otitis media: review of the 2004 treatment guidelines [^86f0923f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the 2004 treatment guidelines provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) regarding the treatment of otitis media in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, restricted to English-language articles about pediatric patients, was conducted (1966-May 2005) using the key words acute otitis media (AOM), guideline, observation therapy, and vaccination. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of cited articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies related to the fundamental basis of the updated guidelines and articles addressing current issues related to otitis media infection were included.

Data Synthesis

Otitis media affects many children in the US. Concerns have been raised about the proper treatment of AOM in the face of increasing drug resistance among primary pathogens responsible for infection. Some countries have chosen to observe patients for a designated period of time prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. The AAP and AAFP have updated the treatment guidelines for otitis media to include the option of observation therapy, recommendations for dosing of various antibiotic regimens and their place in therapy, and the importance of initial pain management.

Conclusions

Updated treatment guidelines for otitis media have been developed in an effort to properly treat children while decreasing current resistance rates for common organisms that cause AOM. In the future, the therapeutic outcomes of observation therapy related to both the incidence of drug resistance and the possibility of increased complications related to otitis media will need to be evaluated in the US.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3e4f098c]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—analgesic options, routes, and cautions: Mild to moderate pain usually responds to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given alone or in fixed combination with an opioid (eg, oxycodone or hydrocodone; ibuprofen with oxycodone), and orally administered analgesics are the preferred route of administration whenever possible, although parenteral analgesia may be necessary rarely. Administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the acute phase of diffuse AOE significantly reduces pain compared with placebo. Acute analgesia and, occasionally, procedure-related sedation, may be required to accomplish adequate aural toilet in patients with extreme inflammation and tenderness of the canal, while nonpharmacologic therapies such as heat or cold, relaxation, and distraction are of unproven value. Benzocaine otic solution, with or without antipyrine, is available for topical anesthesia but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety, effectiveness, or quality; topical anesthetic drops should not be used if a tympanostomy tube is present or if there is uncertainty regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, because these drops are not approved for use in the middle ear. If a topical anesthetic drop is prescribed for temporary pain relief, the patient should be reexamined within 48 to 72 hours to ensure appropriate response; symptoms of uncomplicated AOE should improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating appropriate topical therapy. Adding a topical steroid to topical antimicrobial drops has been shown to hasten pain relief in some randomized trials, but other studies have shown no significant benefit. Use of a faces, Oucher, or visual analog scale may help determine the level of pain, particularly for children and non–English-speaking patients.

### Pediatric acute otitis media: the case for delayed antibiotic treatment [^564023c4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is both a commonly diagnosed condition and a frequent indication for antibiotic use in children. Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are not needed in many children with AOM, as most cases resolve spontaneously without complication. However, a majority of AOM infections in children are still treated with antibiotics. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians released a guideline for treatment of AOM in children. We review the guideline as well as scientific evidence related to AOM treatment options. We support a set of evidence-based guidelines employing a delayed prescription option for antibiotic therapy in selected children. If used appropriately, these cost-effective guidelines will reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed, increase parental satisfaction, and may lower rates of antibiotic resistance while producing similar rates of resolution of AOM.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3f3c4303]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) research priorities emphasize determining if water precautions are necessary or beneficial during active treatment and when to discontinue them, improving recognition of treatment failure versus topical sensitivity, and conducting high-quality randomized trials comparing clinical efficacy with explicit double-blind protocols and assessing systemic antimicrobial therapy versus topical therapy. Trials are also prioritized to report early clinical outcomes (eg, after 2-4 days of therapy) and compare time to symptom resolution alongside categorical responses, and to compare “home therapies” (vinegar, alcohol) versus antimicrobials with attention to the role for patient preferences. Further needs include defining indications for aural toilet and wick placement, determining the independent efficacy of aural toilet, comparing wick versus no wick and suction or active debridement versus dry mopping, and defining best methods to teach clinicians to safely and effectively perform aural toilet and wick insertion. Additional priorities are to determine optimal assessment of tympanic membrane integrity in AOE (including the utility of tympanometry), develop medicated wicks that gradually release drug into the ear canal, and continue monitoring bacteriology and antibiotic resistance patterns in AOE.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days," and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended," and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

The recommended dosage regimen is as follows:

Four drops [equivalent to 0.14 mL of ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension, (consisting of 0.42 mg ciprofloxacin and 0.14 mg dexamethasone)] instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.
The suspension should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness, which may result from the instillation of a cold suspension.
The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled.
This position should be maintained for 60 seconds to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.
Discard unused portion after therapy is completed.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline—action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^317c4b07]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat, fueled by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to adverse drug events such as rash, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and contributes to almost 70 000 emergency department visits in children annually. Each excess day of antibiotic prescribed has been associated with a 5% increase in the odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events.

Acute otitis media (AOM) affects approximately 5 million children in the United States annually and accounts for roughly 25% of all antibiotics prescribed to children each year. Therefore, understanding prescribing habits for AOM is essential to developing effective strategies to reduce overall pediatric antibiotic use. Studies suggest that for most children with uncomplicated AOM (defined as AOM without otorrhea), the risk of treatment failure does not differ between those who receive 5 days of therapy and those who receive 7 or more days of therapy. Additionally, 5-day regimens provide similar rates of clinical cure and bacterial eradication for children ages 2 years and older compared to traditional 10-day regimens. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) AOM guidelines published in 2013 recommend short (5–7 day) durations for children ages 2 years and older with nonsevere and uncomplicated AOM. Despite these recommendations, most children with AOM receive longer (10 day) antibiotic durations. These prior studies were either performed in single centers and may not be generalizable or using large insurance claims databases and unable to provide a granular level of detail to identify potential interventions to promote more widespread use of short treatment durations and first-line antibiotics.

The aims of this study were to evaluate durations of therapy prescribed for children 2 years and older with uncomplicated AOM across the ambulatory care systems of two, large pediatric academic health systems and to assess the variability in prescribed durations between and within the systems, from the individual to the institutional level. We additionally evaluated proportions of nonfirst-line antibiotic use and clinical outcomes such as treatment failure, AOM recurrence, and mastoiditis.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^e999f581]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation—topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for otitis externa [^fcc711ce]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Ofloxacin otic is as effective in curing otitis externa in children (<12 years of age) as is the preparation combining polymyxin/neomycin plus hydrocortisone and as ciprofloxacin otic. Furthermore ofloxacin otic, as it requires less frequent dosing, is likely to encourage greater patient adherence and consequently to achieve a better cure rate than both of these treatment options. Because a number of cases of otitis externa are complicated by an undiagnosed tympanic membrane perforation, the lack of ototoxicity associated with ofloxacin otic makes it a particularly safe option for use in these patients.

### Contemporary concepts in management of acute otitis media in children [^cc7658c0]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease of childhood. AOM is most appropriately diagnosed by careful otoscopy with an understanding of clinical signs and symptoms. The distinction between AOM and chronic otitis media with effusion should be emphasized. Treatment should include pain management, and initial antibiotic treatment should be given to those most likely to benefit, including young children, children with severe symptoms, and those with otorrhea and/or bilateral AOM. Tympanostomy tube placement may be helpful for those who experience frequent episodes of AOM or fail medical therapy. Recent practice guidelines may assist the clinician with such decisions.

### Predictors of pain and / or fever at 3 to 7 days for children with acute otitis media not treated initially with antibiotics: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^57e8ffee]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to determine the predictors of a prolonged course for children with acute otitis media.

Methods

A meta-analysis of data with the observation groups of 6 randomized, controlled trials was performed. Participants were 824 children, 6 months to 12 years of age, with acute otitis media. The primary outcome was a prolonged course of acute otitis media, which was defined as fever and/or pain at 3 to 7 days.

Results

Of the 824 included children, 303 had pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days. Independent predictors of a prolonged course were age of < 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media. The absolute risk of pain and/or fever at 3 to 7 days for children < 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media (20% of all children) was 55%, and that for children > or = 2 years of age with unilateral acute otitis media (47% of all children) was 25%.

Conclusions

The risk of a prolonged course was 2 times higher for children < 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media than for children > or = 2 years of age with unilateral acute otitis media. Clinicians can use these features (ie, age of < 2 years and bilateral acute otitis media) to inform parents more explicitly about the expected course of their child's otitis media and to explain which features should prompt parents to contact their clinician for reexamination of the child.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^45aa076f]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that “Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE,” and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^3af87a40]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is a revision of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians. It provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM. In 2009, the AAP convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the new literature related to AOM since the initial evidence report of 2000. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures. It also addresses recurrent AOM, which was not included in the 2004 guideline. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

### Otitis media: rapid evidence review [^b2d3d3d4]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis in childhood acute sick visits. By three years of age, 50% to 85% of children will have at least one episode of AOM. Symptoms may include ear pain (rubbing, tugging, or holding the ear may be a sign of pain), fever, irritability, otorrhea, anorexia, and sometimes vomiting or lethargy. AOM is diagnosed in symptomatic children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not caused by acute otitis externa, and in children with mild bulging and either recent-onset ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. Treatment includes pain management plus observation or antibiotics, depending on the patient's age, severity of symptoms, and whether the AOM is unilateral or bilateral. When antibiotics are used, high-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day in two divided doses) is first-line therapy unless the patient has taken amoxicillin for AOM in the previous 30 days or has concomitant purulent conjunctivitis; amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically used in this case. Cefdinir or azithromycin should be the first-line antibiotic in those with penicillin allergy based on risk of cephalosporin allergy. Tympanostomy tubes should be considered in children with three or more episodes of AOM within six months or four episodes within one year with one episode in the preceding six months. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding until at least six months of age can reduce the risk of AOM.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^38ce79e0]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane—topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

Acute otitis externa (AOE)—overuse and harms of oral antibiotics: Despite the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy of topical preparations, about 20% to 40% of subjects with AOE nonetheless receive oral antibiotics, often in addition to topical antimicrobials, and despite a strong recommendation against systemic antibiotics clinicians actually prescribed more systemic antibiotics postpublication (31% vs 22%). Many of the oral antibiotics selected are inactive against P aeruginosa and S aureus, and treatment with penicillins, macrolides, or cephalosporins increases disease persistence (rate ratios 1.56 to 1.91) and treatment with cephalosporins also increases recurrence (rate ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.58). Orally administered antibiotics have systemic adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.

### Pooled analysis of two clinical trials comparing the clinical outcomes of topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone otic suspension and polymyxin B / neomycin / hydrocortisone otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa in adults and children [^420be4bb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcome of patients receiving topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (CD) otic suspension with that of those receiving polymyxin B/neomycin/ hydrocortisone (PNH) otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Methods

Data from 2 institutional review board-approved, multicenter, observer-masked, parallel-group, randomized, noninferiority clinical trials conducted at 76 institutions across the United States between April 1998 and July 1999 were pooled together for this analysis. Patients > or =1 year of age diagnosed with AOE were considered for inclusion in the studies. Patients with AOE >4 weeks' duration, a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic suppurative otitis media, or use of either antibiotics or steroids within the previous 7 days were excluded from the studies. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CD or PNH for 7 days. CD was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients > or =12 years of age BID. PNH was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients > or =12 years of age TID. The clinical investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. Due to the different dosing regimens, patients were not blinded, but they also were not directly informed of their treatment assignments. Otic inflammation, tenderness, edema, and discharge were clinically assessed on days 3, 8, and 18 of the studies. Otic inflammation and edema were evaluated using a 4-point scale (none = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3). Otic tenderness and discharge were rated on a binomial scale (absent = 0 and present = 1). The clinical assessments were aggregated into a 9-point composite clinical scale (range, 0-8) to compare baseline severity between groups. For the final outcomes assessment in this study, the aggregated clinical scores were dichotomized into cured (0) versus noncured (>0) and analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier survival technique. A log-rank test was used to compare the cure curves between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier summary statistics provide the mean and median times to cure, and the mean times to cure for the 25th and 75th patient quartiles. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring patients for adverse events at each visit.

Results

Data from 1072 patients (1242 ears) were included in the analysis (CD, 537 patients; PNH, 535 patients). Baseline AOE severity and demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The mean patient age was 21.7 and 22.0 years in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. Both groups were similar with respect to sex, with 50.7% and 53.5% females in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. The racial composition was predominately white (88.6% vs 84.9% in the CD and PNH groups, respectively). The log-rank test revealed a significant difference in the AOE cure curves between the CD and PNH groups (P = 0.038). The proportions cured in the AOE at-risk groups at the day-3, -8, and -18 assessments in the CD and PNH treatment groups were 0.14 and 0.10, 0.75 and 0.72, and 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier summary statistics indicated that the mean time to cure was 0.6 day less with CD compared with PNH (9.7 vs 10.3 days). Treatment-related adverse event rates were similar between the 2 groups and occurred in 3.8% of the patients. The most common adverse events included otic pruritus (2.1%), otic congestion (0.6%), otic debris (0.5%), otic pain (0.3%), superimposed ear infection (0.3%), and erythema (0.1%).

Conclusion

These data from 2 previous studies suggest that time to cure was significantly less with CD compared with PNH in patients with AOE.

Surgery for children aged ≥4 years with OME—if a decision is reached to manage OME in a child aged ≥4 years with surgical intervention, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tube insertion, or both can be recommended, and the availability of at least 3 surgical options (tubes alone, adenoidectomy alone, or adenoidectomy plus tubes) creates an opportunity for shared decision making with caregivers; evidence from an individual patient data meta-analysis based on 1761 children from 10 randomized trials (9 comparisons of adenoidectomy with or without tubes vs no surgery or tubes alone) found no clinically important benefits for adenoidectomy in children <4 years old, whereas children aged ≥4 years old spent 50 fewer days with OME over the next 12 months, had lower failure rates (51% vs 70%), and a lower rate of future surgery (2% vs 19%); in that study, failure at 12 months was defined as additional surgery, recurrent AOM, middle ear effusion at least 50% of the time, or average hearing improvement <10-dB HL; additionally, a review of 15 randomized trials and observational studies evaluated tympanostomy tubes with or without adenoidectomy as primary therapy for OM.
