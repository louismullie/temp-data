## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option would increase the rate of gas diffusion between the alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the governing physical principle, which is Fick's law of diffusion. Then, I should verify how each answer choice maps to the variables in Fick's law. Next, I will consider the specific physiology of the alveolar–capillary interface, including surface area, membrane thickness, partial pressure gradients, and perfusion. Finally, I will eliminate incorrect options and confirm the single best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the core principle. Gas transfer across the alveolar–capillary membrane follows Fick's law, which states that the rate of diffusion is proportional to surface area and the partial pressure gradient, and inversely proportional to membrane thickness; in clinical pulmonary function testing, this is operationalized as the transfer factor (TLCO) being the product of the transfer coefficient (KCO) and alveolar volume (VA), reflecting membrane conductance and capillary blood volume effects [^13185665] [^c371bfaf].

> Now, Option A claims decreasing the partial pressure gradient would increase diffusion. Wait, let me verify that. Fick's law shows diffusion is directly proportional to the partial pressure difference (P1 − P2), so reducing the gradient would decrease, not increase, the diffusion rate. Therefore, Option A is incorrect [^13185665].

> Option B proposes decreasing solubility would increase diffusion. Hold on, I should verify the relationship. Diffusion across the membrane depends on the gas's solubility and diffusivity in the relevant media; for respiratory gases, higher solubility facilitates diffusion, so decreasing solubility would be expected to reduce, not increase, the diffusion rate. Thus, Option B is incorrect [^13185665] [^c371bfaf].

> Option C suggests increasing the total surface area available for diffusion. Let me think about this carefully. Fick's law explicitly includes surface area in the numerator, and in the lung, surface area corresponds to the functional alveolar–capillary interface. Increasing surface area, via capillary recruitment and distension during exercise or with therapeutic maneuvers, increases diffusion capacity; this is precisely why DLCO rises with exercise and why diseases that destroy surface area reduce diffusion. So, Option C aligns with both physics and physiology and is likely correct [^13185665] [^e9241cd4] [^a7221a84].

> Option D proposes decreasing pulmonary capillary blood flow. I need to check the dual effects here. Slower flow increases capillary transit time, which can allow more complete equilibration, but diffusion rate is not simply a function of transit time; critically, reduced perfusion lowers the effective surface area for gas exchange and can reduce measured diffusion capacity, and in many contexts (e.g. VA-ECMO, low output states), reduced pulmonary blood flow impairs gas exchange. Moreover, the Roughton–Forster model shows diffusion depends on membrane conductance and capillary blood volume, so decreasing flow generally reduces the functional capacity for diffusion rather than increasing it. Therefore, Option D is incorrect [^9c7d7680] [^c371bfaf] [^a7221a84].

> Putting this together, the only choice that directly increases diffusion rate per Fick's law and is supported by pulmonary physiology is Option C, increasing the total surface area available for diffusion. This is achieved physiologically by capillary recruitment and distension with higher flow or appropriate lung volumes, and it is the primary reason diffusion capacity rises during exercise and falls with loss of alveolar–capillary units in disease [^13185665] [^e9241cd4] [^a7221a84].

The correct answer is **C. Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion**. According to Fick's law, the diffusion rate is directly proportional to the surface area and the partial pressure gradient, and inversely proportional to the diffusion distance. Thus, increasing the alveolar-capillary surface area — via capillary recruitment or alveolar expansion — increases gas diffusion, whereas decreasing the partial pressure gradient (A), decreasing solubility (B), or reducing blood flow (D) would decrease diffusion or not directly increase it [^13185665] [^e9241cd4].

## Physiological basis of gas diffusion in the lungs

Gas diffusion in the lungs is governed by **Fick's law of diffusion**, which states that the rate of diffusion is directly proportional to the surface area available for diffusion, the partial pressure gradient of the gas, and the solubility of the gas, and inversely proportional to the diffusion distance (thickness of the alveolar-capillary membrane) [^13185665]. Mathematically, Fick's law is expressed as:

Diffusion rate = [(Surface area × Partial pressure gradient × Solubility)/(Diffusion distance)]

---

## Analysis of answer choices

### A. Decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas

The partial pressure gradient is the primary driving force for diffusion; **reducing it decreases the diffusion rate** [^13185665]. For example, at high altitude, the lower alveolar oxygen partial pressure reduces oxygen diffusion into the blood, causing hypoxemia. Thus, decreasing the partial pressure gradient would not increase diffusion; it would decrease it.

---

### B. Decreasing the solubility of the gas in water

Solubility is a key determinant of diffusion; **gases with higher solubility diffuse more rapidly** across the alveolar-capillary membrane. For instance, carbon dioxide (CO2) is more soluble than oxygen (O2), so CO2 diffuses more rapidly despite a smaller partial pressure gradient. Decreasing solubility would therefore reduce the diffusion rate, not increase it.

---

### C. Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion

Increasing the surface area directly increases the diffusion rate, as shown by Fick's law. In the lungs, surface area is increased by **capillary recruitment and distension** during exercise, which enhances gas exchange [^e9241cd4]. Diseases that reduce surface area, such as emphysema, impair diffusion and cause hypoxemia [^5024acda]. Thus, increasing the surface area would increase the diffusion rate.

---

### D. Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary

Blood flow affects gas exchange by influencing the **contact time** between alveolar gas and capillary blood. While slower flow can allow more complete equilibration, diffusion rate itself is not directly increased by reducing flow; in fact, reduced flow can limit overall gas exchange, especially during exercise when increased flow is needed to match ventilation. Therefore, decreasing blood flow would not increase the diffusion rate.

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding these principles has important clinical implications. For example, in emphysema, **destruction of alveolar walls reduces surface area**, impairing diffusion and causing hypoxemia [^5024acda]. In contrast, during exercise, capillary recruitment and distension increase surface area, enhancing diffusion and oxygen uptake [^e9241cd4]. Therapies that improve surface area or reduce diffusion distance (e.g. lung volume reduction surgery) can improve gas exchange in selected patients.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion**. This is the only option that directly increases the diffusion rate according to Fick's law. The other options either decrease diffusion or do not directly increase it.

### Influence of resting lung diffusion on exercise capacity in patients with COPD [^bd207338]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

DLCO is a variable of paramount importance in pulmonary medicine. It represents a complex integration of factors including ventilation distribution, matching of ventilation to perfusion, the resistance at the alveolar-capillary membrane as well as the combination rates with hemoglobin. Since all of the above factors can be affected with more classic patterns of emphysema and COPD with ultimate destruction of the alveolar-capillary bed, preservation of DLCO is an important marker of lung health. For example, a major factor contributing to recruitment or distension of the pulmonary capillary bed is cardiac output or pulmonary blood flow (Qc). As alveolar-capillary walls are remodeled, destroyed or even stiffened with disease, the DLCO/Qc relationship would be altered. With exercise, ventilation rises and pulmonary blood flow increases resulting in elevation of DLCO. In emphysema and COPD with loss of alveolar volume, an important adaption to maintain gas exchange in the face of increased blood cell transit time is a rise in pulmonary capillary blood volume. Thus preservation of this relationship in this population should be a discernible advantage. It was interesting that the IBDLCO, while highly correlated to the SBDLCO, was not as predictive of exercise capacity as the SB method. Our original rational was that since the IB method was performed more quickly and at a lung volume more specific to tidal breathing, that it may be a more sensitive predictor of functional gas exchange surface area. However, during the rapid inspiratory phase of the SBDLCO method, potentially increasing pulmonary blood volume, and with the inhalation to total lung capacity, increasing alveolar volume, it is likely this gives a better overall representation of functional or possibly recruitable surface area available for use during exercise. Also of note was the fact that the IBDLCO method was more variable across subjects and less reproducible than the SB method.

### Mechanics of ventilation-SEER training modules… [^bd3d6bd8]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanics of Ventilation Ventilation, or breathing, is the movement of air through the conducting passages between the atmosphere and the lungs. The air moves through the passages because of pressure gradients that are produced by contraction of the diaphragm and thoracic muscles. Pulmonary ventilation Pulmonary ventilation is commonly referred to as breathing. It is the process of air flowing into the lungs during inspiration and out of the lungs during expiration. Air flows because of pressure differences between the atmosphere and the gases inside the lungs. Air, like other gases, flows from a region with higher pressure to a region with lower pressure. Muscular breathing movements and recoil of elastic tissues create the changes in pressure that result in ventilation. Pulmonary ventilation involves three different pressures:

- Atmospheric pressure
- Intraalveolar pressure
- Intrapleural pressure Atmospheric pressure is the pressure of the air outside the body. Intraalveolar pressure is the pressure inside the alveoli of the lungs. Intrapleural pressure is the pressure within the pleural cavity. These three pressures are responsible for pulmonary ventilation. Inspiration Inspiration is the process of taking air into the lungs. It is the active phase of ventilation because it is the result of muscle contraction. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and the thoracic cavity increases in volume. This decreases the intraalveolar pressure so that air flows into the lungs. Inspiration draws air into the lungs. Expiration Expiration is the process of letting air out of the lungs during the breathing cycle. During expiration, the relaxation of the diaphragm and elastic recoil of tissue decreases the thoracic volume and increases the intraalveolar pressure.

Expiration pushes air out of the lungs.

Diffusion and filtration — the two principles of microvascular exchange, the final goal of perfusion

Rates of mass transfer between compartments or phases depend linearly on the exchange area. Additionally, diffusion coefficients, membrane carrier or channel-mediated transport, and barrier permeability plus solvent drag can come to bear in specific cases. Diffusion is the quantitatively most important form of capillary exchange activity for small, lipid-soluble molecules, especially the respiratory gases, since their diffusional mobility is extremely high and the distance that needs to be overcome is small, e.g. about 1–2 μm between erythrocyte and endothelial cell basement membrane. This normally allows for a complete equilibration between blood and the surrounding interstitial space during the passage through the microvasculature. In the lung, for instance, the respiratory gases have already equilibrated between the alveolar space and the blood after about one-third of the pulmonary passage time available to blood at resting CO. Without capillary recruitment, however, i.e. a pronounced enlargement of exchange area, equilibration at 4–5-fold heightened CO would no longer occur. In the special case of water, transport via aquaporins can be the quantitatively significant mode of exchange in microvascular segments with extremely tight endothelium, as in the brain. Most other organs and tissues have more leaky microvessels, so that paracellular filtration of water plays the major role in transport. High hydraulic conductivity is found especially in glomerular capillaries and in the liver, but practically no vascular bed is completely impermeable to water. One can be fatalistic about this and say that it just was not worth it for nature to go to the trouble of making vessels impermeable. However, exchange of fluid across the vascular wall — in both directions — is an enormously vital physiological function.

### Loss of alveolar membrane diffusing capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^67ed13d6]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first longitudinal study to describe the changes in gas transfer in PAH over time. Lung diffusing capacity for NO, but not CO, dropped due to the disproportionate loss of membrane diffusion, Dm, as compared to changes in the vascular bed available for gas exchange, Vc. These findings suggest that the efficiency of the alveolar-capillary unit in PAH worsens over time independent of traditional clinical and echocardiographic measures. The results also put forward the potential utility of DL NO in tracking progression of disease in PAH.

As in prior work, DL was reduced in PAH patients. Although PAH patients and controls were not well matched by age and gender, the decrease in DL is not likely explained by age and gender alone. Earlier studies measured DL CO at two different oxygen concentrations and calculated D m and V c except for the study by Borland et al. where the single breath test measuring both CO and NO uptake was used. All discovered a decrease in DL, but earlier studies showed predominant loss of V c while more recent ones showed that D m is reduced out of proportion to V c. The difference between earlier studies and more recent ones could be attributed to differences in techniques or use of pulmonary vasodilators leading to higher measured V c. In this study, the single breath technique measuring DL NO and DL CO was used to assess D m and V c. D m was reduced proportionally to V c in patients with PAH, and thus D m /V c was not different from controls. This confirms the interdependence of D m and V c in pulmonary vascular diseases and any change in the vascular bed that reduces V c would lead to a reduction in D m through a reduction in the surface area available to gas exchange.

### Simultaneous measurement of lung diffusing capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics reveals exertional alveolar-capillary dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^e8903885]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by impaired left ventricular (LV) relaxation and an inability to augment cardiac output during exercise without abnormal increases in LV filling pressures. The gold standard for diagnosing HFpEF is through invasive hemodynamic demonstration of high pulmonary venous pressure, specifically a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWPm) ≥ 15 mm Hg at rest or ≥ 25 mm Hg during exercise. An abnormally high PCWPm relates to exercise intolerance, evidenced by reductions in exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency, suggesting that cardiopulmonary interactions play an important role in exercise intolerance in HFpEF.

Pulmonary hypertension is common in HFpEF, initially caused by passive increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) due to left atrial hypertension, which results in elevated pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. Elevated pulmonary capillary pressure can lead to lung fluid accumulation, or, with chronic exposure, remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature. With an increase in lung fluid accumulation and/or adverse capillary remodeling, diffusion of gases between the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries, a crucial link in the oxygen transport chain, and ventilation‐perfusion matching would be impaired. Indeed, lung diffusing capacity is impaired at rest and during exercise in HFpEF and appears to be primarily due to reductions in alveolar‐capillary membrane conductance (Dm) and somewhat to the inability to augment pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc) during exercise. In healthy individuals during exercise, recruitment and distension of the pulmonary capillaries distributes blood throughout the lung, expands lung surface area available for gas exchange, and prevents abnormal increases in pressure, resulting in a linear increase in Vc with cardiac output. In HFpEF, elevation in LV filling pressures may cause blood to accumulate in the pulmonary capillaries, uncoupling increases in Vc from cardiac output and generating high pulmonary vascular pressures that further impair lung diffusing capacity. However, no study has directly assessed components of lung diffusing capacity as well as invasive hemodynamics simultaneously in patients with HFpEF.

Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between lung diffusing capacity and central hemodynamics during exercise in patients with HFpEF. It was hypothesized that patients with HFpEF would have impaired lung diffusing capacity and that the degree of impairment would correlate with higher pulmonary vascular pressures.

### Alveolar gas diffusion abnormalities in heart failure [^f7ed8880]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2008). Low credibility.

In heart failure (HF), development of pressure or volume overload of the lung microcirculation elicits a series of structural adaptations, whose functional correlate is an increased resistance to gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Acutely, hydrostatic mechanical injury causes endothelial and alveolar cell breaks, impairment of the cellular pathways involved in fluid filtration and reabsorption, and resistance to gas transfer. This process, which is reminiscent of the so-called alveolar-capillary stress failure, is generally reversible. When the alveolar membrane is chronically challenged, tissue alterations are sustained and a typical remodeling process may take place that is characterized by fixed extracellular matrix collagen proliferation and reexpression of fetal genes. Remodeling leads to a persistent reduction in alveolar-capillary membrane conductance and lung diffusion capacity. Changes in gas transfer not only reflect the underlying lung tissue damage but also bring independent prognostic information and may play a role in the pathogenesis of exercise limitation and ventilatory abnormalities. They are not responsive to fluid withdrawal by ultrafiltration and tend to be refractory even to heart transplantation. Some drugs can be effective that modulate lung remodeling (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, whose impact on the natural course of cardiac remodeling is well known) or that increase nitric oxide availability and nitric oxide-mediated pulmonary vasodilation (eg, type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors). This review focuses on the current knowledge of these topics.

### Recruitment of lung diffusing capacity: update of concept and application [^e9241cd4]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Lung diffusing capacity (DL) for carbon monoxide (DLCO), nitric oxide (DLNO) or oxygen (DLO2) increases from rest to peak exercise without reaching an upper limit; this recruitment results from interactions among alveolar volume (VA), and cardiac output (q), as well as changing physical properties and spatial distribution of capillary erythrocytes, and is critical for maintaining a normal arterial oxygen saturation. DLCO and DLNO can be used to interpret the effectiveness of diffusive oxygen transport and track structural alterations of the alveolar-capillary barrier, providing sensitive noninvasive indicators of microvascular integrity in health and disease. Clinical interpretation of DL should take into account Q in addition to VA and hemoglobin concentration.

### Simultaneous measurement of lung diffusing capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics reveals exertional alveolar-capillary dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^0b53b73f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Consistent with prior hemodynamic studiesand an autopsy study of patients with HFpEF revealing remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, pulmonary arterial compliance during exercise was lower in patients with HFpEF, coupled with a systematically lower DLco at rest and during exercise. Interestingly, the reduced DLco in patients with HFpEF was predominantly driven by a reduced alveolar‐capillary membrane conductance (Table 2). Collectively, these findings suggest that remodeling of the alveolar or pulmonary capillary membrane may impair gas diffusion by increasing the diffusion distance and decreasing the distensibility of the pulmonary vessels. While not significantly different, Vc trended lower in patients with HFpEF, and it is possible that the absence of difference could be related to increased variability for this measure. The trend of a lower Vc in patients with HFpEF suggests that pulmonary capillaries might be underperfused, which may relate to the increased dead space in HFpEF. Alternatively, Vc may be similar in the groups because of the competing pathophysiologic processes present in HFpEF that nullify one another. Oligemia and loss of effective capillary units caused by chronic remodeling may reduce Vcwhile, concomitantly, the increase in capillary distending pressure owing to left atrial hypertension may increase capillary recruitment and Vc. The pattern of increase in DLco during exercise was similar between groups (ie, HFpEF could still augment DLco during exercise), suggesting that higher pulmonary vascular pressures in patients with HFpEF may be necessary to maintain, to some extent, ventilation‐perfusion matching at rest and during exercise.

### Loss of alveolar membrane diffusing capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^c054d219]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Where DL represents total lung diffusing capacity; D m alveolar-capillary membrane diffusing capacity; V c pulmonary capillary bed available for gas transfer; and θ is the rate of reaction of the gas with the red cell. Traditionally, measure of the two components of DL CO relied upon repeated performance of the test at different oxygen concentrations and solving the equation for D m and V c. These technical challenges resulted in an arduous method and inaccuracies in measures that limited utility. However, nitric oxide (NO) has a greater affinity to Hgb compared to CO or O 2, and thus NO diffusion is mainly limited by the transfer of gas across the alveolar capillary membrane. Based on this, DL NO can be used as a direct measure of D m. Recent advances allow measure of DL NO and DL CO simultaneously and direct determination of D m and V c from single breath maneuver at one oxygen tension. Few studies have evaluated the components of DL in pulmonary hypertension (PH) in an attempt to understand the pathophysiology of the decreased DL. Cross-sectional data from studies are inconsistent and there are no longitudinal data. In 1968, Nadel et al. showed that DL CO was reduced in PH as a result of low V c. Borland et al. were the first to apply a single breath technique to measure DL NO and DL CO and identified that both were reduced in PH. However, recent studies have attributed the low DL to a loss of D m rather than V c. Oppenhiemer et al. measured D m and V c in different groups of PH patients and found that D m was reduced out of proportion to V c as shown by a reduction in the ratio of D m /V c. Measuring the components of DL in PAH would give insight into the disease, especially that recent advances have unveiled the intricacy of the pathogenesis of PAH. We hypothesized that both D m and V c are decreased in PAH patients and that there is progressive decline of DL and its components over time in parallel to disease progression. To test this, DL NO and DL CO were measured by single breath technique in PAH patients in comparison to healthy controls and over time in order to evaluate changes in D m and V c in relation to clinical parameters including echocardiography, 6MWD and BNP levels.

### Impaired O2 unloading from stored blood results in diffusion-limited O2 release at tissues: evidence from human kidneys [^5dabf7bb]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings have implications for our fundamental understanding of gas exchange. Contemporary models of blood transport should consider the possibility that at least under certain conditions, capillary P O 2 may not reach equilibrium with interstitial P O 2, leading to a mismatch between demand and supply. If kinetically-compromised RBCs transiting capillaries have insufficient time to equilibrate P O 2, then the cardiovascular responses that are normally effective in restoring oxygenation under a perfusion-limited scenario may not produce the desired outcome. Faster blood flow will further reduce transit time, and any increase in arterial delivery would be offset by incomplete fractional unloading of RBCs. Consequently, a diffusion-limited process is more likely to incur an oxygen debt, and the only way of improving delivery would be to address the rate-limiting process underpinning slow gas exchange in capillaries, that is, restoring RBC O 2 -handling kinetics. In the case of pulmonary capillaries, diffusion-limited exchange may cause arterial hypoxemia, particularly under strenuous exercise. Indeed, there are reports of arterial hypoxemia in elite female athletes because of incomplete O 2 uptake by RBCs, and any exacerbation of RBC kinetic properties would make this scenario more likely.

### Loss of alveolar membrane diffusing capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^d3315bf8]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL CO) is a valuable clinical tool in the assessment of pulmonary diseases. It measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from the alveolar space to the red blood cells in the pulmonary vessels. Measurement of DL is informative for pathophysiologic diagnoses of lung diseases and serial measurements are used to follow the course of disease. The components of DL can provide more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of loss of gas exchange capacity. Based on the Roughton and Forster model, DL CO is described as a series of resistances: the diffusion of the gas across the alveolar-capillary membrane, the transfer into the plasma and across the red blood cell membrane, and the chemical reaction of the gas with hemoglobin (Hgb). The following equation summarizes these concepts:

### The individual response to training and competition at altitude [^37d3d936]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Scientific thinking on the response of SaO 2 during exercise in healthy individuals has undergone substantial change over time. The concept that oxygen transport by the pulmonary system was sufficient to maintain SaO 2 at or very near to the resting levels during submaximal and maximal exercise was the established belief among early physiologists. Later, conflicting data emerged documenting considerable reductions in SaO 2 during heavy exercise in select numbers of endurance-trained men, and subsequent work by Dempsey et al established the incidence of exercise-induced arterial hypoxaemia (EIH) in a group of highly trained distance runners. However, the prevalence of EIH is far from a universal phenomenon, and the finding of EIH within an individual athlete may be strongly dependent on the techniques used to determine arterial PO 2 and SaO 2 (eg, muscle temperature correction, arterial blood gas sampling vs. oximetry measures). The mechanism behind arterial oxyhaemoglobin desaturation during exercise seems to be greater pulmonary gas exchange limitations, secondary to some combination of inadequate hyperventilation, arterial-venous shunting, greater ventilation — perfusion (V/Q) mismatch or diffusion limitations. It is believed that each of these mechanisms plays a role in arterial hypoxaemia, with the specific magnitude of contribution of each mechanism differing both (1) across individuals, and (2) within individuals, dependent on factors such as exercise workload, training status, altitude acclimatisation status, pulmonary mechanics and more. However, on average, ∼20% of the variation in arterial PO 2 between individuals during exercise is due to variations in the hyperventilatory response, with the remaining ∼80% of the variance in arterial PO 2 roughly divided evenly between V/Q mismatch and diffusion limitations. In the case of diffusion limitations within the athletic population, the limitation does not seem to derive from a clinical issue with the alveolar — capillary barrier, but rather from a decreased transit time of the erythrocyte across the pulmonary capillary. When the endurance athlete trains chronically, this leads to an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output; however, pulmonary capillary blood volume remains unchanged. As a result, the erythrocyte must transverse the pulmonary capillary at a faster rate during maximal exercise, the available time for oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli to the erythrocyte is reduced, and in some (but not all) highly trained endurance athletes, this reduced erythrocyte transit time is shorter than the time needed for haemoglobin to become fully saturated with O 2. Ultimately, independent of the mechanism behind desaturation, endurance-trained athletes with significant pulmonary gas exchange limitations, a given decline in inspired PO 2 with altitude results in a greater decline in SaO 2, and thus a greater reduction in skeletal muscle oxygen delivery and VO 2 max compared with lesser trained individuals.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^2701ec45]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Assessing ventilation and acinar air–tissue–blood diffusion with HP 129Xe MRI — HP 129Xe MRI permits breath-hold imaging of inhaled gas distribution in airspaces and its uptake in interstitial tissues and plasma and transfer to pulmonary capillary RBCs. Each of these compartments is associated with unique 129Xe resonant frequencies, which combined with novel MR acquisition strategies allow 129Xe distribution in each to be 3D encoded during a breath-hold; signal is constrained to arise primarily from the alveolar–capillary gas exchange interface, and not larger vessels. 129Xe thus reports on structure and function at much smaller length scales (micrometers) than the resolution of the images (3–5 mm isotropic). Additional 129Xe spectroscopic sampling of the alveolar–capillary unit every 15 ms provides metrics of blood oxygenation and hemodynamics. HP 129Xe MRI is fast and well tolerated, allowing visualization of gas distribution, and yielding information on ventilation, alveolar barrier integrity, and capillary RBC transfer.

### Simultaneous measurement of lung diffusing capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics reveals exertional alveolar-capillary dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^5e08b1f9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In controls, exercise‐induced increases in PCWP are accompanied by substantial increases in lung diffusing capacity, whereas patients with HFpEF appear to hit a PCWPm ceiling, beyond which lung diffusing capacity does not increase. This could be because of the development of lung fluid, which has been detected in patients with HFpEF during exercise by sonographic B‐line artifacts or "comet tails"and CT‐derived estimates of extravascular lung fluid. It is possible that lung fluid develops in some patients during exercise caused by high pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure impeding alveolar‐capillary gas transfer and causing a reduction in Dm.

In this study, patients with HFpEF had markedly reduced lung diffusing capacity for a given PAP, PCWP, and pulmonary arterial compliance. Recruitment and distension of pulmonary capillaries improves ventilation‐perfusion matching within the lungs during exercise and allows for the increase in pulmonary blood flow without a proportional increase in pressure. While recruitment and distension patterns cannot be measured directly, the distensibility of the pulmonary vasculature, estimated by the α coefficient mathematically determined from the curvilinearity of multipoint PAPm‐cardiac output plots, independently predicts aerobic capacity and relates to lung diffusing capacity, and distensibility has previously been shown to be reduced in patients with HFpEF as compared with controls. It is notable that the diminished DL CO response was similar relative to both PAPm and PCWPm in HFpEF, and here we have chosen to focus on PCWPm since the increase in filling pressure drives the augmented PAPm in patients with HFpEF. The increase in lung diffusing capacity for a given increase in PCWP may provide insight into the ability of the pulmonary microcirculation to accommodate increases in blood flow during exercise despite high LV filling pressure.

Lung diffusing capacity was lower for a given transpulmonary gradient in HFpEF. The transpulmonary gradient describes the ability of the pulmonary circulation to promote forward blood flow despite high ventricular filling pressures. In this study, controls appear to increase TPG throughout exercise, while patients with HFpEF reach a ceiling at 20 W. Pharmacological reduction of PCWP and the transpulmonary gradient in older individuals using sildenafil reduces lung diffusing capacity, suggesting that a higher PCWP and transpulmonary gradient may be needed to overcome pulmonary vascular remodeling and maintain lung diffusing capacity. A therapy that decreases PCWPm while maintaining or increasing TPG, such as pericardiotomy, may improve pulmonary perfusion and alveolar‐capillary gas diffusion in these patients.

Discussion

In this study employing simultaneous measures of lung diffusing capacity and invasive central hemodynamics during exercise in HFpEF, we observed that lung diffusing capacity was reduced for a given PAP, PCWP, pulmonary arterial compliance, and transpulmonary gradient in patients with HFpEF both at rest and during exercise compared with controls without HFpEF. Consistent with previous studies, impaired lung diffusing capacity in HFpEF was predominantly due to a reduction in alveolar‐capillary membrane conductance, rather than reductions in pulmonary capillary blood volume. Given that lung diffusing capacity impairments were associated with altered pulmonary hemodynamics in this study, alveolar‐capillary membrane dysfunction may play a central role in pulmonary limitations previously described in HFpEF such as ventilation‐perfusion mismatch, a thickening of the pulmonary capillaries due to remodeling, or the development of extravascular lung fluid due to increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure.,

Alveolar‐capillary membrane conductance reflects the total diffusive surface area in the lung, where ventilation and perfusion are matched and gas transfer can occur. Ventilation‐perfusion inhomogeneity, estimated by the ratio of the partial pressure of expired CO 2 to end‐tidal CO 2 (P E CO 2 /P ET CO 2)did not differ between patients with HFpEF and controls. However, there was a trend towards a greater difference between P a CO 2 measured in the blood and end‐tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide in patients with HFpEF compared with controls, which might suggest a slight gas exchange impairment. Abnormal breathing patterns, such as rapid and shallow breathing, have been reported in HFpEF and would lead to increased dead space and reduced ventilatory efficiency. Indeed, there was a significant effect of HF on the ratio of dead space to tidal volume, which may be caused by shallower breathing patterns in patients with HFpEF during exercise. While increased dead space can contribute to reduced ventilatory efficiency (estimated by the ventilation required to remove 1 L of CO 2 from the blood via the lungs), V E /VCO 2 was not different between patients with HFpEF and controls. Additionally, severe ventilation‐perfusion mismatch would be expected to cause an increase in the alveolar to arterial O 2 difference, and while alveolar to arterial O 2 difference trended higher in patients with HFpEF, it was not different between groups. Abnormal breathing patterns and ventilation perfusion mismatch may contribute to the reduction in lung diffusing capacity in patients with HFpEF, but do not appear to be the primary factor.

### Single breath-hold measurement of pulmonary gas exchange and diffusion in humans with hyperpolarizedXe MR [^03b26ad9]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary diseases usually result in changes of the blood-gas exchange function in the early stages. Gas exchange across the respiratory membrane and gas diffusion in the alveoli can be quantified using hyperpolarized 129 Xe MR via chemical shift saturation recovery (CSSR) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), respectively. Generally, CSSR and DWI data have been collected in separate breaths in humans. Unfortunately, the lung inflation level cannot be the exactly same in different breaths, which causes fluctuations in blood-gas exchange and pulmonary microstructure. Here we combine CSSR and DWI obtained with compressed sensing, to evaluate the gas diffusion and exchange function within a single breath-hold in humans. A new parameter, namely the perfusion factor of the respiratory membrane (SVR d/g), is proposed to evaluate the gas exchange function. Hyperpolarized 129 Xe MR data are compared with pulmonary function tests and computed tomography examinations in healthy young, age-matched control, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease human cohorts. SVR d/g decreases as the ventilation impairment and emphysema index increase. Our results indicate that the proposed method has the potential to detect the extent of lung parenchyma destruction caused by age and pulmonary diseases, and it would be useful in the early diagnosis of pulmonary diseases in clinical practice.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^2146af35]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Hyperpolarized 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (HP 129Xe MRI) — ventilation and acinar air–tissue–blood diffusion metrics are detailed: HP 129Xe MRI permits breath-hold imaging of inhaled gas distribution in airspaces and its uptake in interstitial tissues and plasma with transfer to pulmonary capillary red blood cells (RBCs). It can image acinar diffusion, and unique 129Xe resonant frequencies combined with novel acquisition strategies allow distribution in each compartment to be 3D encoded during a breath-hold while signal is constrained to arise primarily from the alveolar–capillary gas exchange interface and not larger vessels. 129Xe reports on structure and function at much smaller length scales than image resolution, noted as micrometers versus 3–5 mm isotropic. Additional spectroscopic sampling of the alveolar–capillary unit every 15 ms provides metrics of blood oxygenation and hemodynamics. HP 129Xe MRI is fast and well tolerated, allowing visualization of gas distribution, alveolar barrier integrity, and capillary RBC transfer.

Definitions

TLco: transfer factor, the product of K co and V A.
K co: transfer coefficient, the rate of transfer of gas between the alveoli and the erythrocytes into the alveolar capillaries.
V A: alveolar volume, the volume of the lungs during the measurement of gas transfer.
V IN: volume inspired, the volume of test gas inhaled during the measurement of gas transfer.
D m: the diffusing membrane capacity.
Vc: the pulmonary capillary blood volume.
θ: theta, the chemical reaction rate of CO with Hb.

Measurement principles

Gas transfer is governed by Fick's law of diffusion, which states that 'the rate of transfer of a gas through a membrane of constant thickness is proportional to its surface area (A) and the difference in gas partial pressure between the two sides (P 1 −P 2), and inversely proportional to the membrane thickness (t)'. Consequently, TLco is the product of the rate of CO uptake (K co) and the alveolar volume (V A) (see equation 2).

Equation 2, Fick's law of diffusion:

Volume of gas (per unit time) = area/thickness × diffusion constant × (partial pressure 1 – partial pressure 2).

CO uptake is measured as a concentration fall in alveolar CO per unit time per unit driving pressure. Alveolar volume is determined by the dilution of a tracer gas in the RV and the volume of gas inspired (V). Analysis of K co and V A individually provides information on disease pathology that would not be identified by the use of TLco alone.

The SI units of transfer factor are mmol/min/kPa and represent the uptake of a gas (mmol/min) per unit pressure gradient (kPa). The SI unit of transfer coefficient (K co) is mmol/min/kPa/L. The ATS continues to prefer traditional units of mL/min/mm Hg. To convert from SI to traditional units, divide by 0.335. To convert from traditional units to SI, divide by 2.987.

### Loss of alveolar membrane diffusing capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^d3e0fcd5]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced gas transfer in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is traditionally attributed to remodeling and progressive loss of pulmonary arterial vasculature that results in decreased capillary blood volume available for gas exchange.

Methods

We tested this hypothesis by determination of lung diffusing capacity (DL) and its components, the alveolar capillary membrane diffusing capacity (D m) and lung capillary blood volume (V c) in 28 individuals with PAH in comparison to 41 healthy individuals, and in 19 PAH patients over time. Using single breath simultaneous measure of diffusion of carbon monoxide (DL CO) and nitric oxide (DL NO), DL and D m were respectively determined, and V c calculated. D m and V c were evaluated over time in relation to standard clinical indicators of disease severity, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) by echocardiography.

Results

Both DL CO and DL NO were reduced in PAH as compared to controls and the lower DL in PAH was due to loss of both D m and V c (all p < 0.01). While DL CO of PAH patients did not change over time, DL NO decreased by 24 ml/min/mmHg/year (p = 0.01). Consequently, D m decreased and V c tended to increase over time, which led to deterioration of the D m /V c ratio, a measure of alveolar-capillary membrane functional efficiency without changes in clinical markers.

Conclusions

The findings indicate that lower than normal gas transfer in PAH is due to loss of both D m and V c, but that deterioration of D m /V c over time is related to worsening membrane diffusion.

### Cancer therapy and exercise intolerance: the heart is but a part: state-of-the-art review [^dc29a8f9]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diffusive Oxygen Loading

The pulmonary system performs 2 important roles in the oxygen cascade: ventilation, allowing the movement of air molecules from the atmosphere into the alveoli, and gas exchange, which includes the diffusion of oxygen from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries. Ventilation increases in response to exercise to enable greater movement of oxygen into the alveoli, where oxygen diffuses into the pulmonary capillary membrane and binds to hemoglobin. Impairment in the efficiency of gas exchange (alveolar to arterial P 2 difference) can occur during exercise when there is a mismatch in the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio or changes to oxygen tension. For example, pulmonary embolism, which is a common complication among patients with cancer, can be provoked by multiple agents (Table 1)and is associated with profound exercise intolerance due to V/Q mismatch. There have been a few case reports of interstitial lung disease following treatment with the BCR-ABL TKIs imatinib and nilotinib, which are first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia, although this is an uncommon complication (estimated at < 1%). Interstitial lung diseases are characterized by alveolar and interstitial space damage, pulmonary inflammation, and fibrosis, resulting in decreased pulmonary capacity and impaired gas exchange. Novel hypoxia-inducible transcription factor inhibitors (eg, belzutifan) can cause severe hypoxia for unclear reasons, but it is thought to be related to pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and V/Q mismatch. Thus, this severe complication of cancer therapy can affect oxygen diffusion capacity within the lungs and likely affects V 2 peak (Central Illustration).

Multifactorial Contributors and Cardiorespiratory System Impact in Cancer Survivors That Drive Exercise Tolerance

Multiple factors can contribute to poor exercise tolerance in cancer survivors. Cancer therapeutics can interact with patient cardiovascular risk factors including age, physical inactivity, comorbidities, genetic risk, and inflammation, as well as the cancer itself to potentially affect multiple steps of the oxygen pathway and limit exercise tolerance. Taking a more holistic approach to consider factors that can be affected by treatment beyond the heart provides new opportunities to treat exercise intolerance and could lead to reduced cardiovascular risk, hospitalizations, and fatigueand better quality of life (QOL)for cancer survivors.

### Gas phase diffusion does not limit lung volatile anesthetic uptake rate [^4ee1ef43]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inefficiency of lung gas exchange during general anesthesia is reflected in alveolar (end-tidal) to arterial (end-tidal-arterial) partial pressure gradients for inhaled gases, resulting in an increase in alveolar deadspace. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch is the main contributor to this, but it is unclear what contribution arises from diffusion limitation in the gas phase down the respiratory tree (longitudinal stratification) or at the alveolar-capillary barrier, especially for gases of high molecular weight such as volatile anesthetics.

Methods

The contribution of longitudinal stratification was examined by comparison of end-tidal-arterial partial pressure gradients for two inhaled gases with similar blood solubility but different molecular weights: desflurane and nitrous oxide, administered together at 2 to 3% and 10 to 15% inspired concentration (FiG), respectively, in 17 anesthetized ventilated patients undergoing cardiac surgery before cardiopulmonary bypass. Simultaneous measurements were done of tidal gas concentrations, of arterial and mixed venous blood partial pressures by headspace equilibration, and of gas uptake rate calculated using the direct Fick method using thermodilution cardiac output measurement. Adjustment for differences between the two gases in FiG and in lung uptake rate (VG) was made on mass balance principles. A 20% larger end-tidal-arterial partial pressure gradient relative to inspired concentration (PetG - PaG)/FiG for desflurane than for N2O was hypothesized as physiologically significant.

Results

Mean (SD) measured (PetG - PaG)/FiG for desflurane was significantly smaller than that for N2O (0.86 [0.37] vs. 1.65 [0.58] mmHg; P < 0.0001), as was alveolar deadspace for desflurane. After adjustment for the different VG of the two gases, the adjusted (PetG - PaG)/FiG for desflurane remained less than the 20% threshold above that for N2O (1.62 [0.61] vs. 1.98 [0.69] mmHg; P = 0.028).

Conclusions

No evidence was found in measured end-tidal to arterial partial pressure gradients and alveolar deadspace to support a clinically significant additional diffusion limitation to lung uptake of desflurane relative to nitrous oxide.

### Influence of resting lung diffusion on exercise capacity in patients with COPD [^eb78f4ac]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The intra-breath method (IBDLCO) is interesting in that it potentially represents a relatively simple way to quantify DLCO in patients that may struggle with longer breath hold times and there is potential for use during exercise to quantify alveolar–capillary surface area recruitment. It requires the exhalation of test gas typically near residual volume, followed by a deep inhalation and essentially instantaneous exhalation back towards residual volume (RV). The expiratory sampling relies on a fast response CO analyzer and as exhalation continues towards RV, the DLCO at any point is dependent then on the exhaled lung volume and each time point would represent a DLCO that is a mix of CO uptake and mixing with other lung gases. An advantage of this technique compared to other more discrete techniques is that the exhaled gas stream is used in its entirety to calculate DLCO.

In patients with lung disease it is likely that the intra-breath method may be more sensitive to disease pathology relative to the single breath method due to abnormalities in ventilation and perfusion and delayed time constants for ventilation with the shortened gas exchange times.

Lung diffusion is dependent on pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc) and alveolar-capillary gas exchange surface area, usually reported as membrane diffusion capacity. While these components of DLCO can be estimated by performing DLCO at multiple oxygen concentrations or with a second gas such as nitric oxide (DLNO), a surrogate may be obtained for blood volume by examining the DLCO relative to cardiac output (Qc). Since a rise in Q tends to be the major reason for distension or recruitment of capillaries, a larger ratio would be indicative of a healthier phenotype.

Thus in the present study we were interested in the role of resting DLCO in predicting exercise capacity in a relative diverse group of COPD patients. More specifically we were interested if a higher intra-breath to single breath DLCO ratio or a higher DLCO relative to Qc ratio would better predict exercise capacity relative to other common measures of lung mechanics. We hypothesized that those subjects with a higher IBDLCO relative to SBDLCO or a higher SBDLCO/Qc ratio would have better preserved exercise capacity.

### Change in pulmonary blood volume changes pulmonary artery systolic storage [^b70d2b98]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A fraction of right ventricular stroke volume (pulmonary artery systolic storage, [PASS]), which is stored in pulmonary arteries during systole and then discharged to the capillaries, determines the diastolic pulmonary capillary blood flow and hence the capillary blood volume participating in gas diffusion. Possibility that increases in pulmonary blood volume (PBV) increase PASS, leading to an improved distribution of ventilation-to-perfusion ratios (V/Q), was examined.

Methods and Results

Included were 34 obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We used a nitrous oxide-airway-pneumotachographic method to measure PASS. The measurements were repeated before and after increasing PBV. In 20 patients, PBV was increased with infusion of crystalloids, which was guided by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). There was a good correlation between change in PASS and change in PBV (r(2) = 0.741, P < 0.0001). However, when the baseline PASS was high, changes in PASS were much less. In patients with a pulmonary artery diastolic-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure gradient ≥ 6 mmHg, the baseline PASS was correlated with pulmonary venous resistance (r(2) = 0.644, P = 0.017). In 14 patients, in whom PBV was increased with both changes in position and infusion of crystalloids, the physiologic dead space-to-tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) was measured as an index of the distribution of V/Q. There was a good negative correlation between PASS and VD/VT (r(2) = 0.697, P < 0.0001). However, at a high baseline PASS, increases in PBV decreased PASS (P = 0.0006) and increased VD/VT (P = 0.0018).

Conclusions

Changes in PBV change PASS and thereby the distribution of V/Q, depending on pulmonary venous resistance, which determines the baseline PASS.

### Quantification of pulmonary perfusion in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with first pass dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI [^eeda2983]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The transit time of contrast through the lung increases in proportion to worsening gas exchange in our IPF cohort and exhibits a mild strength of non-parametric correlation with established metrics of gas exchange, but not FVC. The FWHM mean of the transit time demonstrates an increase in our sample IPF population over a 6-month follow-up period and the IQR (FWHM IQR) may be a simple means of describing perfusion heterogeneity. Regional increases in transit time, although analysed on a purely qualitative basis in this study, appear to be spatially congruous with the known peripheral and basal distribution of disease in IPF.

Previous literature suggests changes in lung perfusion may represent loss of the vascular bed due to vascular remodelling. Histologically, fibrotic regions contain epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis, but also proliferation, leading to a complex and aberrant vascular network involving anastomoses between alveolar capillaries and pulmonary veins. This disruption of perfusion contributes along with alveolar destruction and septal thickening to gas exchange impairment and thus explain the correlation we see between FWHM IQR and TL CO. Patients with IPF are at increased risk of venous and arterial clot formation, leading to suggestions that intramural thrombus in the pulmonary vasculature may also contribute to perfusion limitation in IPF.

Our model assumes that the FWHM mean is a surrogate of transit time of blood through the lung and therefore can represent blood flow; with the FWHM IQR a measure of heterogeneity. IPF is generally thought of as a disease of the lung parenchyma, rather than a disease of perfusion limitation and while the parenchymal disease leading to diffusion limitation is the significant mechanism that causes changes in TL CO, the accompanying changes in capillary perfusion should also be considered in the understanding of gas exchange in IPF. If DCE-MRI can indeed identify subclinical changes in pulmonary perfusion, this technology may fulfil a clinical need to identify patients with early pulmonary vascular changes, disproportionate to the degree of ILD. Anecdotal observations of clinical improvement of some patients with IPF on sildenafil have been reported and there is biological plausibility of its effect, even though a randomised controlled trial of patients with IPF and low TL CO demonstrated no significant difference between subjects on sildenafil or placebo.

### Loss of pulmonary capillaries in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with low diffusion capacity is accompanied by early diffuse emphysema detected byXe MRI [^bfdeba44]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies showed that even in patients with no or minimal changes in CT, histopathology may detect emphysematous and fibrotic changes. However, as autopsies are rarely performed, verifying the existence of a vanishing pulmonary capillary syndrome histologically proved difficult.

Hyperpolarised gas MRI may assess lung microstructure and, e.g. emphysematous changes through increases in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) noninvasively. Since xenon is taken up in lung tissue and blood and 129 Xe experiences strong chemical shifts, 129 Xe MRI is sensitive to alveolar-capillary diffusion and microvascular pulmonary blood volume. With the appropriate choice of sequence parameters, 129 Xe MRI metrics are specific to the gas uptake region and pulmonary capillaries as opposed to, e.g. dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Imaging of the 129 Xe dissolved phase and dynamic acquisition of cardiogenic oscillations of 129 Xe in red blood cells (RBC) may differentiate cardiopulmonary diseases and may provide information on pre- or postcapillary involvement in PH. Although widespread clinical application is hampered by limited dissemination of necessary equipment, hyperpolarised 129 Xe MRI is a useful tool for clinical research and the field of 129 Xe MRI continues to grow.

We hypothesise that patients with IPAH and low D LCO differ from other patient groups by a loss of pulmonary capillaries, as judged by the ratio of 129 Xe in RBCs and membrane tissues (M). The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis and to evaluate alveolar microstructure by comparing results from 129 Xe MRI in IPAH with low D LCO with those from IPAH with preserved D LCO, as well as with those from PH patients with CPFE and with those from patients with emphysema without echocardiographic signs of PH.

### Precapillary oxygenation contributes relevantly to gas exchange in the intact lung [^c9cb2e9f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

Oxygen uptake is the elemental function of the lung. However, current understanding of this process has largely been derived from theoretical considerations and measurements of global pulmonary gas exchange.

Objectives

To report the direct visualization of pulmonary oxygen uptake in vivo and its use for the analysis of temporal and spatial oxygenation profiles along individual arteriovenous pathways in lungs of healthy and chronic hypoxic mice.

Methods

A murine model for intravital microscopy of the breathing lung under sealed thorax conditions was combined with multispectral oximetry for two-dimensional oxygen saturation mapping. This combination allowed for visualization of the blood oxygenation process from pulmonary arterioles to capillaries and venules in two-dimensional oxygen saturation maps.

Measurements and Main Results

Temporal and spatial oxygenation profiles revealed that oxygenation occurs within 100 milliseconds over a distance of approximately 130 μm in the pulmonary microvasculature of the anesthetized mouse. About 50% of total oxygen uptake takes place in precapillary arterioles of less than 30 μm in diameter before the blood enters the alveolar capillary bed. In chronic hypoxic mice, precapillary oxygenation was significantly attenuated as a result of the widened transarteriolar diffusion distance.

Conclusions

Oxygen saturation mapping in the intact lung yields unique insights into the temporal and spatial characteristics of pulmonary gas exchange in intact and diseased lungs. Precapillary gas exchange contributes importantly to blood oxygenation at rest, but is attenuated in remodeled lung arterioles, which may be of relevance in pulmonary hypertension.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^9910ecf8]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society and Fleischner Society — quantitative lung imaging overview: Quantitative analysis of functional and structural lung imaging complements traditional visual assessment and supports diagnosis, monitoring, and understanding of physiology and pathophysiology. Modalities include computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission CT (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); these use endogenous molecules, injected contrast agents, or radioactive isotopes as tracers to measure airway mechanics and regional ventilation and perfusion with spatiotemporal relationships. Volumetric CT is routinely used to render three-dimensional (3D) maps of lung structures and can be combined with PET to obtain functional data. Beyond visual assessment, quantitative imaging (QI) endpoints could be used in clinical trials to identify anatomical and physiological phenotypes such as airway remodeling, progressive emphysema and fibrosis, and textural patterns quantifying architectural alterations. Intravenous iodine and dual-energy CT (DECT) are used to separate blood and tissue volumes, and coregistered landmarks on paired images at different lung volumes are used to infer regional air trapping, lung compliance, and deformation. MRI using ultrashort-echo time (UTE) sequences improves signal detection from parenchyma; oxygen or hyperpolarized noble gases are used to deduce physiological processes including distributions of ventilation, perfusion, and alveolar diffusion; proton MRI measures regional perfusion and ventilation-perfusion ratio; and hyperpolarized gas MRI can quantify gas diffusion to capillary red blood cells (RBCs) to estimate oxygen transfer. Major challenges include technical and analytical standardization across modalities and platforms, effects of differing lung inflation states and acquisition/segmentation methods, quality of training data, lack of gold standards for validation, and the need to verify imaging-based conclusions against physiological and clinical outcomes.

### Simultaneous measurement of lung diffusing capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics reveals exertional alveolar-capillary dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^01c676b6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Hemodynamic perturbations in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) may alter the distribution of blood in the lungs, impair gas transfer from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries, and reduce lung diffusing capacity. We hypothesized that impairments in lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL CO) in HFpEF would be associated with high mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures during exercise. Methods and Results Rebreathe DL CO and invasive hemodynamics were measured simultaneously during exercise in patients with exertional dyspnea. Pulmonary pressure waveforms and breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange were recorded at rest, 20 W, and symptom-limited maximal exercise. Patients with HFpEF (n = 20; 15 women, aged 65 ± 11 years, body mass index 36 ± 8 kg/m 2) achieved a lower symptom-limited maximal workload (52 ± 27 W versus 106 ± 42 W) compared with controls with noncardiac dyspnea (n = 10; 7 women, aged 55 ± 10 years, body mass index 30 ± 5 kg/m 2). DL CO was lower in patients with HFpEF compared with controls at rest (DL CO 10.4 ± 2.9 mL/min per mm Hg versus 16.4 ± 6.9 mL/min per mm Hg, P < 0.01) and symptom-limited maximal exercise (DL CO 14.6 ± 4.7 mL/min per mm Hg versus 23.8 ± 10.8 mL/min per mm Hg, P < 0.01) because of a lower alveolar-capillary membrane conductance in HFpEF (rest 16.8 ± 6.6 mL/min per mm Hg versus 28.4 ± 11.8 mL/min per mm Hg, P < 0.01; symptom-limited maximal exercise 25.0 ± 6.7 mL/min per mm Hg versus 45.5 ± 22.2 mL/min per mm Hg, P < 0.01). DL CO was lower in HFpEF for a given mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial compliance, and transpulmonary gradient. Conclusions Lung diffusing capacity is lower at rest and during exercise in HFpEF due to impaired gas conductance across the alveolar-capillary membrane. DL CO is impaired for a given pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary arterial compliance. These data provide new insight into the complex relationships between hemodynamic perturbations and gas exchange abnormalities in HFpEF.

Measurement of carbon monoxide transfer factor

Introduction

The primary function of the lungs is to exchange gas between the atmosphere and the pulmonary circulation. The ability of the lungs to exchange gas across the alveolar capillary membrane is determined by its structural and functional characteristics. Structurally these include lung volume, path length, membrane thickness, the surface area of the lungs and the capillary blood volume. Functionally it is influenced by the level of ventilation and perfusion of the lung and its matching, haemoglobin (Hb) levels, blood transit time, the alveolar capillary membrane characteristics and the chemical reaction rate with Hb (θ). In the lung function laboratory, CO is used as a surrogate for oxygen. CO is an ideal test gas because it has the same diffusion coefficient and rate of reaction with Hb as oxygen, binds to the same site on the Hb molecule, and their respective Hb dissociation curves are affected in the same way by temperature, O 2, CO 2, pH and 2–3 diphosphoglycerate (DPG). In addition, its high affinity for Hb (210 times that of oxygen) means that the PO 2 remaining in the physiological state does not influence the measurement. Additionally, CO is safe to breathe at low concentrations and easy to measure by infrared/electrochemical analysis.

The Roughton and Forster equation from 1957partitions alveolar-capillary diffusion of oxygen and CO into a membrane component (D m), a red cell component (θ) and a capillary blood volume component (V c).

Equation 1, the Roughton and Forster equation:

where T l is the transfer factor, D m is the membrane diffusing capacity, θ is the rate of reaction of CO with Hb, and V c is the capillary blood volume in contact with the inhaled CO.

Although there is more than one technique for measuring CO uptake (and it is acknowledged that other techniques have been tried), this section will describe the single-breath technique, which is the most widely adopted and the one for which regression equations are readily available.

### Pulse oximetry values from 33, 080 participants in the apple heart&movement study [^213e4d0b]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The age-dependent average decline in oxygen saturation measured for the full subject cohort (−0.031%/year for dSpO 2) is in close quantitative agreement with trends published previously by other researchers (−0.036%/year reported by Crapo et al. −0.027%/year reported by Perez-Padilla et al. −0.020%/year reported by Klæstrup, et al.). Progressive decline in pulmonary function with age has been described extensively in research literature, with quantitative trends reported for spirometry metrics, respiratory muscle function, gas exchange metrics, and physical lung tissue properties such as elastic recoil and alveolar size. Age-related lung tissue changes include progressive remodeling of the collagen fibers that surround and support the alveoli, contributing to increased average alveolar size and loss of elastic recoil. Combined, this results in a tendency for smaller airways of older lungs to close during breathing even under resting conditions. The closure of these airways translates into mismatch between alveolar ventilation and pulmonary capillary perfusion (V/Q mismatch) which hampers the diffusion of inhaled oxygen into the arterial blood stream. Additionally, alveolar enlargement reduces total alveolar surface area, which further impairs gas exchange and contributes to increasing alveolar-arterial O 2 gradient. Collectively these age-related changes cause a progressive decline in arterial oxygen saturation that is approximately linear with age, even in the absence of overt lung disease.

### Studying the pulmonary endothelium in health and disease: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^211c7670]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary endothelial barrier function — regional variability and assessment methods — states that barrier function varies across the pulmonary circulation, with arteries and arterioles providing a relatively restrictive barrier, alveolar capillaries providing per surface area the most restrictive barrier to fluid and macromolecule flux, and venules being the most permeable and highly sensitive to mediators that increase permeability; interpretation should consider that different stimuli affect different vascular segments and that barrier integrity is defined by interactions with adjacent cells and underlying matrix; assessment distinguishes structural integrity from functional measurement of molecule flux, using techniques such as transendothelial electrical resistance and Transwell tracer penetration assays; measurement is feasible in animal models and in humans, each with specific considerations, caveats, and limitations.

### Gas diffusion in a pulmonary acinus model: experiments with hyperpolarized helium-3 [^a09a2b8a]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2008). Low credibility.

Diffusion of hyperpolarized helium-3 in epoxy phantoms was experimentally studied by pulsed-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). One phantom with a dichotomic branching structure densely filling a cubic volume was built using the Kitaoka algorithm to model a healthy human acinus. Two other phantoms, one with a different size and the other one with a partial destruction of the branched structure, were built to simulate changes occurring at the early stages of emphysema. Gas pressure and composition (mixture with nitrogen) were varied, thus exploring different diffusion regimes. Preliminary measurements in a cylindrical glass cell allowed us to calibrate the gradient intensity with 1% accuracy. Measurements of NMR signal attenuation due to gas diffusion were compared to a classical Gaussian model and to Monte Carlo simulations. In the slow diffusion regime, the Gaussian model was in reasonable agreement with experiments for low gradient intensity, but there was a significant systematic deviation at larger gradient intensity. An apparent diffusion coefficient Dapp was deduced, and in agreement with previous findings, a linear decrease of Dapp/D0 with D0(1/2) was observed, where D0 is the free diffusion coefficient. In the regime of intermediate diffusion, experimental data could be described by the Gaussian model for very small gradient intensities only. The corresponding Dapp/D0 values seemed to reach a constant value. Monte Carlo simulations were generally in fair agreement with the measurements in both regimes. Our results suggest that, for diffusion times typical of medical magnetic resonance imaging, an increase in alveolar size has more impact on signal attenuation than a partial destruction of the branched structure at equivalent surface-to-volume ratio.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the time course of hyperpolarizedXe gas exchange in the human lungs and heart [^7b299735]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), human lung imaging, and quantification of the gas-transfer dynamics of hyperpolarized xenon-129 (HPX) from the alveoli into the blood plasma.

Materials and Methods

HPX MRI with iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-square estimation (IDEAL) approach were used with multi-interleaved spiral k-space sampling to obtain HPX gas and dissolved phase images. IDEAL time-series images were then obtained from ten subjects including six normal subjects and four patients with pulmonary emphysema to test the feasibility of the proposed technique for capturing xenon-129 gas-transfer dynamics (XGTD). The dynamics of xenon gas diffusion over the entire lung was also investigated by measuring the signal intensity variations between three regions of interest, including the left and right lungs and the heart using Welch's t test.

Results

The technique enabled the acquisition of HPX gas and dissolved phase compartment images in a single breath-hold interval of 8 s. The y-intersect of the XGTD curves were also found to be statistically lower in the patients with lung emphysema than in the healthy group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

This time-series IDEAL technique enables the visualization and quantification of inhaled xenon from the alveoli to the left ventricle with a clinical gradient strength magnet during a single breath-hold, in healthy and diseased lungs.

Key Points

### Extracorporeal gas exchange: when to start and how to end? [^b83cec9a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of high-flow V-V ECMO, as a rescue for life-threatening hypoxemia, has never been questioned. Few noted that paradoxically the PaO 2 in control and ECMO patients is the same throughout the clinical course, as clearly shown in EOLIA trial. Therefore, we may wonder if the use of high flow is really necessary in patients with adequate hemodynamics. To rationally answer this question, the mechanisms of oxygenation during high-flow V-V ECMO must be discussed. Let us assume that in a patient, in whom 4–5 L/min of extracorporeal blood flow are applied, the amount of oxygen transfer per minute is close to the total oxygen consumption (200–300 ml/min). This has two major consequences:
The oxygen transfer in the natural lung decreases proportionally to the increase of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin perfusing the open lung units. Indeed, the PO 2 in the pulmonary capillaries, perfusing the open lung units, only depends on FIO 2, barometric pressure, and respiratory quotient. Therefore, the drive for the oxygen transfer in the natural lung is the difference between PAO 2 (equal to the pulmonary capillary partial pressure) and the PVO 2 /saturation of the blood entering the venous side. Higher PvO 2 and oxygen saturation implies decrease of oxygen transfer. It is worth to understand that the capillary PO 2 of the ideally perfused pulmonary unit does not change, whatever is the ECMO blood flow.

Second, the increased oxygen content in the venous side increases the hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the pulmonary artery and decreases the hypoxic vasoconstriction, which, although dampened, is well-presented and effective in ARDS patients. Indeed, the hypoxic vasoconstriction depends both on alveolar hypoxia, unlike in ARDS patients ventilated with high FIO 2, and on oxygen partial pressure in the mixed venous blood. When the saturation of the blood perfusing the gasless regions increases, the fraction of blood flowing through them increases remarkably up to 60–70%. This explains why the PaO 2, in high veno-venous blood flow, at the beginning of extracorporeal support, does not increase dramatically, but only by few mmHg. Indeed, the oxygenation gain in the arterial side, therefore, is only due to the increased oxygen saturation of the blood flowing through the shunted area, which increases due to the release of hypoxic vasoconstriction. In Fig. 1, this phenomenon is quantitatively exemplified.

### Relationship between diffusion capacity and small airway abnormality in COPDGene [^5024acda]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The importance of small airways disease (SAD) in COPD pathogenesis was first described by Hogg et al. in the 1960s, who determined that peripheral resistance contributes minimally to total airway resistance in healthy lungs but significantly in emphysematous lungs. Recent research using advanced computed tomography (CT) has further suggested that a CT metric for small airway disease (SAD) radiographically precedes emphysema development and is associated with subsequent FEV 1 decline.

Diffusing capacity of the lung (DLCO) is a commonly tested measurement in pulmonary function studies, indirectly measuring degree of gas transfer from alveoli to pulmonary capillary blood, with results depending on the lung's structural and functional properties. Emphysema irreversibly destroys alveoli, leading to gas exchange impairment and manifesting as an inverse relationship between emphysema severity and DLCO. We hypothesized that CT defined SAD among COPD subjects with mild disease (GOLD 1–2) may detect lung regions in transition from bronchiolar pathology to emphysema, and hence, may be associated with diffusion capacity impairment.

### Diffusion of nitrous oxide into the pleural cavity [^6544b134]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

We postulated that nitrous oxide transfer into the pleural cavity can occur by diffusion from the alveoli, independent of vascular transport. Under general anaesthesia, six sheep were studied in two phases, a control and an experimental phase. The sheep were anaesthetized, intubated, and received positive pressure mechanical ventilation. A catheter was placed in the right pleural cavity and 150 mL air injected. The animals were ventilated with 100% oxygen. The inspired gas was changed to a mixture of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen, and the rate of increase of nitrous oxide concentration in the pleural space was measured. The animals were then ventilated with 100% oxygen and then killed by exsanguination while ventilation was continued. The inspired mixture was changed to 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen and the rate of increase in nitrous oxide concentration was measured in the pleural space again. During venitilation with nitrous oxide in the living animals, the concentration of nitrous oxide in the pleural cavity increased rapidly and decreased to zero during ventilation with 100% oxygen. During ventilation without circulation, the rate of increase in the concentration of nitrous oxide in the pleural cavity was the same as in the control phase. This suggests that nitrous oxide enters the pleural space by diffusion, rather than by vascular delivery. This mechanism may explain the rapid increase in the volume of pneumothorax if nitrous oxide is given in the inspired gas.

### Preschool multiple-breath washout testing. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^cf26d267]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Effect of inert gas diffusion across the alveolar–capillary membrane in preschool MBW — There are no data currently available to quantify the impact of inert gas diffusing across the alveolar–capillary membrane on measured MBW outcomes in preschool subjects. Although N2 is inert, in the sense that the human body does not metabolize it, it is a soluble gas, and because of the high partial pressure of the atmosphere, a large amount of N2 is stored within the body. As a result, N2 will diffuse into the alveoli when the partial pressure of N2 is lowered, as occurs during N2-based MBW using 100% O2, and this process applies to all gases to differing degrees and occurs to lesser degrees, in the opposite direction, with both SF6 and helium. The magnitude of diffusion and its effect on subsequent MBW outcomes has not been adequately described to date, beyond initial modeling efforts for N2 MBW.

### Xenon (xenon, Xe-133) [^1017f3ee]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Xenon Xe 133 is a readily diffusible gas which is neither utilized nor produced by the body. It passes through cell membranes, freely exchanges between blood and tissue, and tends to concentrate more in body fat than in blood, plasma, water or protein solutions. In the concentrations recommended for diagnostic studies, it is physiologically inactive. Inhaled Xenon Xe 133 Gas will enter the alveolar wall and the pulmonary venous circulation via capillaries. Most of the Xenon Xe 133 Gas that enters the circulation from a single breath is returned to the lungs and exhaled after a single pass through the peripheral circulation.

### Physiology of circulation-SEER training modules… [^22e8208d]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Physiology of Circulation Roles of Capillaries In addition to forming the connection between the arteries and veins, capillaries have a vital role in the exchange of gases, nutrients, and metabolic waste products between the blood and the tissue cells. Substances pass through the capillary wall by diffusion, filtration, and osmosis. Oxygen and carbon dioxide move across the capillary wall by diffusion. Fluid movement across a capillary wall is determined by a combination of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. The net result of the capillary microcirculation created by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure is that substances leave the blood at one end of the capillary and return at the other end. Blood Flow Blood flow refers to the movement of blood through the vessels from arteries to the capillaries and then into the veins. Pressure is a measure of the force that the blood exerts against the vessel walls as it moves the blood through the vessels.

Like all fluids, blood flows from a high pressure area to a region with lower pressure. Blood flows in the same direction as the decreasing pressure gradient: arteries to capillaries to veins. The rate, or velocity, of blood flow varies inversely with the total cross-sectional area of the blood vessels. As the total cross-sectional area of the vessels increases, the velocity of flow decreases. Blood flow is slowest in the capillaries, which allows time for exchange of gases and nutrients. Resistance is a force that opposes the flow of a fluid. In blood vessels, most of the resistance is due to vessel diameter. As vessel diameter decreases, the resistance increases and blood flow decreases. Very little pressure remains by the time blood leaves the capillaries and enters the venules. Blood flow through the veins is not the direct result of ventricular contraction.

Instead, venous return depends on skeletal muscle action, respiratory movements, and constriction of smooth muscle in venous walls. In common usage, the term blood pressure refers to arterial blood pressure, the pressure in the aorta and its branches. Systolic pressure is due to ventricular contraction. Diastolic pressure occurs during cardiac relaxation. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer and is recorded as the systolic pressure over the diastolic pressure. Four major factors interact to affect blood pressure: cardiac output, blood volume, peripheral resistance, and viscosity. When these factors increase, blood pressure also increases.

### Estimation of dead space fraction can be simplified in the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^93a89647]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are characterized by a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema responsible for a significant impairment of gas exchange. The pulmonary dead space increase, which is due primarily to an alteration in pulmonary blood flow distribution, is largely responsible for carbon dioxide retention. Previous studies, computing the pulmonary dead space by measuring the expired carbon dioxide and the Enghoff equation, found that the dead space fraction was significantly higher in the non-survivors; it was even an independent risk of death. The computation of the dead space not by measuring the expired carbon dioxide but by applying a rearranged alveolar gas equation that takes into account only the weight, age, height, and temperature of the patient could lead to widespread clinical diffusion of this measurement at the bedside.

### Effect of pressure support on end-expiratory lung volume and lung diffusion for carbon monoxide [^e976b0cb]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The level of pressure-support ventilation can affect mean airway pressure and potentially lung volume, but its increase is usually associated with a reduced respiratory rate, and the net effects on the gas exchange process and its components, including end-expiratory lung volume, have not been carefully studied. We measured pulmonary conductance for gas exchange based on lung diffusion for carbon monoxide in patients receiving pressure-support ventilation.

Design

Prospective, randomized, crossover study.

Setting

Medical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Sixteen patients mechanically ventilated in pressure-support ventilation mode and free from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Interventions

Two pressure-support ventilation levels (5 cm H2O difference) at the same level of positive end-expiratory pressure.

Measurements and Main Results

End-expiratory lung volume, lung diffusion for carbon monoxide, and SpO2/Fio2 were evaluated. Increasing pressure-support ventilation by 5 cm H2O significantly increased the mean tidal volume from 6.8 to 8.5 mL/kg of predicted body weight and decreased the mean respiratory rate by 6.6 breaths per minute. Although SpO2/Fio2 did not change significantly, there was a slight but significant decrease in lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (average decay rate of 4.5%) at high pressure-support ventilation. The pressure-support ventilation level did not significantly affect end-expiratory lung volume (1737 ± 629 mL at 9.6 ± 2.5 cm H2O pressure-support ventilation level vs. 1749 ± 657 mL at 14.9 ± 2.1 cm H2O pressure-support ventilation level).

Conclusions

A 5-cm H2O increase in pressure-support ventilation neither affected end-expiratory lung volume nor increased the pulmonary volume participating in gas exchange. A target tidal volume closer to 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight than to 8 mL/kg during pressure-support ventilation was associated with better gas exchange.

### Impaired pulmonary diffusion in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^f050bc4f]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare measures of gas exchange at rest and during exercise in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with age- and sex-matched control subjects.

Background

Patients with HFpEF display elevation in left heart pressures, but it is unclear how this affects pulmonary gas transfer or its determinants at rest and during exercise.

Methods

Patients with HFpEF (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 26) completed a recumbent cycle ergometry exercise test with simultaneous measurement of ventilation and gas exchange. Diffusion of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and its subcomponents, pulmonary capillary blood volume (VC) and alveolar-capillary membrane conductance (DM), were measured at rest, and matched for low-intensity (20 W) and peak exercise. Stroke volume was measured by transthoracic echocardiography to calculate cardiac output.

Results

Compared with control subjects, patients with HFpEF displayed impaired diastolic function and reduced exercise capacity. Patients with HFpEF demonstrated a 24% lower DLCO at rest (11.0 ± 2.3 ml/mm Hg/min vs. 14.4 ± 3.3 ml/mm Hg/min; p < 0.01) related to reductions in both DM (18.1 ± 4.9 ml/mm Hg/min vs. 23.1 ± 9.1 ml/mm Hg/min; p = 0.04), and VC (45.9 ± 15.2. mL vs. 58.9 ± 16.2 ml; p = 0.01). DLCO was lower in patients with HFpEF compared with control subjects in all stages of exercise, yet its determinants showed variable responses. With low-level exercise, patients with HFpEF demonstrated greater relative increases in VC, coupled with heightened ventilatory drive and more severe symptoms of dyspnea compared with control subjects. At 20-W exercise, DM was markedly reduced in patients with HFpEF compared with control subjects. From 20 W to peak exercise, there was no further increase in VC in patients with HFpEF, which in tandem with reduced DM, led to a 30% reduction in DLCO at peak exercise (17.3 ± 4.2 ml/mm Hg/min vs. 24.7 ± 7.1 ml/mm Hg/min; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Subjects with HFpEF display altered pulmonary function and gas exchange at rest and especially during exercise, which contributes to exercise intolerance. Novel therapies that improve gas diffusion may be effective to improve exercise tolerance in patients with HFpEF.

### Positive end-expiratory pressure-induced functional recruitment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^9d77c098]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

In acute respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar recruitment improves gas exchange only if perfusion of the recruited alveolar units is adequate. To evaluate functional recruitment induced by positive end-expiratory pressure, we assessed pulmonary conductance for gas exchange based on lung diffusion for carbon monoxide and its components, including pulmonary capillary blood volume.

Design

Prospective, randomized, crossover study.

Setting

Medical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Sixteen patients with lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as eight control patients under invasive ventilation and eight healthy volunteers.

Interventions

Mechanical ventilation with two levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (5 and 15 cm H2O).

Measurements and Main Results

Lung diffusion for carbon monoxide and lung volumes, arterial blood gas analysis, and pressure-volume curves. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, high positive end-expiratory pressure induced a 23% mean lung diffusion for carbon monoxide increase (4.4 ± 1.7 mm Hg. min vs. 3.6 ± 1.4 mL. mm Hg. min). In control patients and in healthy volunteers, lung diffusion for carbon monoxide values were (median [interquartile range]) 5.5 [3.8–8.0] mm Hg. min and 19.6 [15.1–20.6] mL. mm Hg. min, respectively. Among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, eight showed a > 20% lung diffusion for carbon monoxide increase (responders) when increasing positive end-expiratory pressure. In the other eight, lung diffusion for carbon monoxide decreased or showed a < 5% increase (nonresponders) with high positive end-expiratory pressure. Compared with nonresponders, responders at low positive end-expiratory pressure had smaller lungs with higher capillary blood volume-to-lung-volume ratio, higher values of the lower inflection point, and significantly greater increases in pulmonary capillary blood volume with high positive end-expiratory pressure. High positive end-expiratory pressure increased PaO2/Fio2 only in the responders.

Conclusions

The functional response to positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome seems better when the lungs are smaller and with a higher capillary blood-volume-to-lung-volume ratio. Lung diffusion for carbon monoxide measurement supplies additional information about functional lung recruitment, which is not synonymous with mechanical recruitment.

### A small amount of inhaled nitric oxide does not increase lung diffusing capacity [^af042a0f]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to determine: 1) whether 40–50 ppm nitric oxide (NO) increases diffusing capacity of the lung for NO (D(L, NO)) and carbon monoxide (D(L, CO)), membrane diffusing capacity for CO (D(m, CO)) and pulmonary capillary blood volume (V(c)); 2) the actual number of tests required to provide a reasonable estimate of D(L, NO), D(L, CO), D(m, CO) and V(c); and 3) repeatability of these parameters using the single-breath D(L, NO)-D(L, CO) method. In total, 31 subjects performed five single-breath hold manoeuvres at rest, inhaling 43 ± 3 ppm NO together with a standard diffusion mixture. D(L, NO) (D(m, CO)) remained unchanged from the first to fifth trial. However, compared with the first trial, D(L, CO) and V(c) had decreased by the fourth (-4 ± 5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -5- -2%) and third trial (-5 ± 7%; 95% CI = -7- -2%), respectively. Repeatability over five trials was 17, 3 and 7 mL.min(-1).mmHg(-1) for D(L, NO), D(L, CO) and D(m, CO), respectively, and 13 mL for V(c) when D(m, CO) = D(L, NO)/2.42. In conclusion, nitric oxide inhaled during sequential single-breath manoeuvres has no effect on diffusing capacity of the lung for nitric oxide and, thus, membrane diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide. Since more than two and three trials will lower pulmonary capillary blood volume and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, respectively, the average value of only two properly performed trials is suggested.

Measurement caveats for perfusion imaging: Tissue deformation with gravity can create an apparent gradient in alveolar-capillary perfusion per unit volume even when perfusion per alveolus is uniform; lung volume during image acquisition affects quantification and perfusion distribution; and depending on the study, it is important to distinguish between perfusion per unit lung volume and perfusion per alveolus.

### The reliability of a novel structured testing device for single-breath lung carbon monoxide uptake: a randomized comparison crossover study [^a09ad9a6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary diffusion capacity refers to the process where gases such as oxygen diffuse through the alveolar-capillary membrane from the alveoli to the capillaries, eventually entering the bloodstream and binding with hemoglobin in red blood cells. Clinically, carbon monoxide(CO) is commonly used as a test gas to assess this function, and in diffusion function tests, the tracer gases commonly used are helium (He) and methane (CH4). The key indicator of diffusion function testing is the Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide (D LCO). The factors affecting it include the concentration of the test gas as well as the inspired volume (V I), breath-hold time (tBH), environmental factors (including ambient temperature (T), barometric pressure (PB), and the partial pressure of water vapor (PH2O)), and alveolar volume (V A).

NORMAL EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY

Exercise requires coordination across multiple organ systems and reflects the body's ability to maintain a balance between energy production and consumption. From daily activities to intense exertion, exercise demands ATP regenerated from ADP through either oxygen‐dependent (oxidative phosphorylation) or oxygen‐independent pathways. Aerobic metabolism (oxygen‐dependent) is more efficient and predominates during light to moderate intensity exercises. Oxygen consumption increases during exercise. When the oxygen supply is less than the metabolic demand, due to high consumption or low supply, there is a relative increase in energy production through oxygen‐independent pathways, also called anaerobic metabolism.

Oxygen use for cellular metabolism requires transport from ambient air to tissue mitochondria, particularly in the skeletal muscle. This oxygen pathway involves several systems and can be didactically divided into 6 steps related to oxygen delivery: the convective oxygen transport components (the respiratory, cardiac, and hematologic systems) and oxygen extraction as related to diffusive oxygen transport components (the vascular, skeletal muscle, and nervous systems). Figure 2 illustrates the oxygen pathway.

Figure 2
Illustration of the 6 steps of O 2 pathway from environment to mitochondria.

O 2 indicates oxygen.

Inspired oxygen passes through airways to the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. Alveoli are predominantly lined by type I pneumocytes, which are exceptionally thin (0.1 μm) to allow efficient gas diffusion. Surrounding the alveoli are capillaries of similar thickness that form a vascular network. This close proximity and thin structures facilitate the exchange of gases through simple diffusion. Once oxygen diffuses into the capillaries it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells to form oxyhemoglobin. The delivery of oxygen absorbed in the lungs depends on 2 important factors: cardiac preload and afterload. Preload refers to stretching of heart muscle fibers at the end of diastole, which is determined by the volume of venous blood return and elasticity of the cardiac tissue. Moderate stretching enhances the force of contraction (Frank–Starling mechanism) and increases stroke volume, but excessive preload overstretches myocardial fibers and reduces stroke volume. Afterload, the resistance the right heart must overcome to eject blood, is primarily determined by pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial compliance, limited by pulmonary valve pathology. In PAH, high pulmonary vascular resistance and low pulmonary arterial compliance from distended and remodeled vessels increase afterload, decrease stroke volume, and reduce cardiac output.

### Reference values for alveolar membrane diffusion capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume [^38b16a6e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The reference values for diffusion capacity of the alveolar capillary membrane (Tm, CO) and pulmonary capillary volume (Qc) are scarce, while the standard deviations of the equations are large. New equations and residual standard deviations (RSDs) were determined in a sample of healthy subjects. Tm, CO and Qc values were measured in 117 (72 females, 45 males) nonsmoking healthy subjects. The carbon monoxide transfer factor (TL, CO) was determined when the volunteer was breathing room air and subsequently, when the volunteer was breathing 100% oxygen. From these data, Tm, CO and Qc values were calculated. The females' TL, CO was 3.15 mmol x min(-1) x kPa(-1) lower than the males', apparently caused by lower female lung volume. Tm, CO and Qc were lower in females, but correction for lung volume eliminated this difference. Qc(-1) reference equations for females and males, respectively, are 4.375 x 10(-2) - 1.085 x l0(-2) x height and 4.455 x 10(-2) -1.085 x 10(-2) x height (RSD for both sexes: 2.544 x 10(-3)). Tm, CO(-1) reference equations for females and males, respectively, are 0.111+3.304 x 10(-4) x age-4.753 x 10(-2) x height and 0.127+3.304 x 10(-4) x age-4.753 x 10(-2) x height (RSD for both sexes: 1.085 x 10(-2)). The general character of these equations complies with earlier publications, the only difference being that the RSDs are 1.18–2.76 times lower. New reference equations for diffusion capacity of the alveolar capillary membrane and pulmonary capillary volume are available with considerably smaller residual standard deviations.

### Pulmonary complications associated with veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation: a comprehensive review [^9c7d7680]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

VA-ECMO-related lung ischemia

Lung blood supply

The lung is characterized by a dual circulation, comprising the pulmonary circulation, which supplies the alveoli for gas exchange, and the bronchial circulation, which conveys oxygen and nutrients to the airways, but not alveoli, whose oxygen supply is almost exclusively provided by direct diffusion from the alveolar spaces. Bronchopulmonary anastomoses allow collateralization between these two circulations. In case of chronic decrease of pulmonary blood flow (e.g. in chronic thromboembolic disease or pulmonary stenosis), the bronchial flow may increase from 1 to 30% of the cardiac output, permitting to compensate this decrease and participate to gas exchange, providing a kind of "rescue flow" to the ischemic areas.

Disturbances induced by VA-ECMO

As depicted in Fig. 1, venous blood during VA-ECMO is derived from the vena cava and the right atrium through the venous canula, resulting in a reduction of right ventricle (RV) filling, pulmonary blood flow, and pulmonary arterial pulsatility. In a porcine model, Vardi et al. demonstrated that the pulmonary capillary blood flow decreases dramatically as the VA-ECMO flow increases. Moreover, in case of pulmonary congestion (see above), the upstream transmission of increased left atrial pressure reduces the transpulmonary perfusion gradient. Ventilation with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) might also impede pulmonary blood flow by compression of alveolar vessels. Several additional mechanisms, including alveolar hypoxia, reduction of local NO production, and the actions of inflammatory mediators can promote vasoconstriction and the subsequent increase of pulmonary vascular resistance, with a reduction of pulmonary blood flow. It is also noteworthy that blood flow through the bronchial arteries (BAs) is also reduced during VA-ECMO, due to attenuated pulsatility of the systemic circulation (which supplies the BAs). This can further limit blood supply to ischemic areas within the congested lung. Eventually, these various hemodynamic changes may lead to hypoperfusion of the entire pulmonary vasculature, which, superimposed to alveolar hypoxia, can promote a state of global, persistent lung ischemia.

### Mapping the amplitude and phase of dissolvedXe red blood cell signal oscillations with keyhole spectroscopic lung imaging [^d966b492]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hyperpolarized (HP) 129 Xe MRI is a powerful tool for functional lung imaging, providing regional information about lung ventilation, microstructure, and gas exchange. 129 Xe is soluble in the alveolar parenchymal tissue, capillary blood plasma, and red blood cells (RBC), giving rise to dissolved 129 Xe signals distinct from the gaseous 129 Xe resonance, with a chemical shift of about 200 ppm. The dissolved 129 Xe signals comprise a tissue‐plasma (collectively "membrane" [M]) peak and an RBC peak, which occur at approximately 197 ppm and 218 ppm, respectively. Spectral encoding of the dissolved compartment gives HP 129 Xe MRI unique sensitivity for measuring alveolar‐to‐capillary gas diffusion in diseases such as interstitial lung disease (ILD), asthma, and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD).,

In dissolved‐phase 129 Xe lung spectroscopy, the M and RBC signals decay over the 10–15‐s duration breath hold, due to RF pulse‐induced depolarization and T 1 relaxation of the gas‐phase signal, which acts as a magnetization "reservoir" replenishing dissolved‐phase signal (T 1 ˜ 20 s). Additionally, the RBC signal is periodically modulated by the heartbeat frequency; these oscillations originate from changes in the capillary blood volume over the cardiac cycle. The underlying 129 Xe RBC signal is also dependent on the diffusion rate of 129 Xe across the alveolar membrane and the hematocrit within the alveolar capillary bed. The cardiogenic RBC oscillations revealed in 129 Xe spectroscopy provide a potential means to monitor blood flow in the pulmonary microvasculature, which is often affected by chronic lung disease. The 129 Xe spectroscopy‐derived RBC oscillation has been shown to be sensitive to disease state: the oscillation amplitude is increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and left heart failure patients but decreased in COPD and pulmonary arterial hypertension patients when compared with healthy subjects. Furthermore, the amplitude of the RBC oscillations may be able to differentiate between pulmonary hypertension subtypes.

### The rate of alveolar-capillary uptake of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide following anaesthetic induction [^b14bbcea]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The rate of anaesthetic gas uptake from the breathing system has been extensively measured, but this does not reflect the true rate of early gas uptake by pulmonary blood, which drives inhalational induction of anaesthesia. In eight patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery, we measured the rate of alveolar-capillary uptake of anaesthetic gases up to 30 min following introduction of 0.5% sevoflurane and 33% nitrous oxide using the reverse Fick method, in which blood partial pressures were measured using a headspace equilibration technique. Simultaneous measurements of gas uptake from the breathing system were made by indirect calorimetry. Measured rates of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide uptake from the breathing system agreed well with previously described formulae when adjusted for inspired concentration. The time course of alveolar-capillary gas uptake followed a characteristic rising curve peaking at 3–4 min and then exponentially declining, and for nitrous oxide was significantly higher than previously estimated.

### Cancer therapy and exercise intolerance: the heart is but a part: state-of-the-art review [^c05333c9]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview of the Oxygen Transport Cascade

The oxygen transport cascade describes the physiological steps involved in transporting oxygen from the atmosphere to muscle mitochondria where the efficient production of energy in addition to numerous other enzymatic reactions that require molecular oxygen occur. During aerobic exercise, the increase in metabolic demand requires more oxygen uptake through convective and diffusive processes coupled with mitochondrial respiration to meet the adenosine triphosphate requirement of the exercising muscles. The convective steps involve the movement of oxygen into the lungs (alveolar ventilation) and transport from the lungs into the periphery via the circulatory system (hemoglobin and cardiac output). The diffusive steps occur as oxygen moves across the alveolar-pulmonary capillary membrane in the lung and during the unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin into capillaries, where cells use oxygen for a variety of biological functions. Importantly, most of the oxygen is consumed by mitochondria to generate adenosine triphosphate via oxidative phosphorylation. Although prior reviews focused on cardiac-specific toxicities, we focus on the impact cancer therapies have on the factors peripheral to the heart (lungs, blood, vasculature, and skeletal muscle) and subsequently V 2 peak as organized by the noncardiac components of the oxygen cascade (Table 1).

### Influences of sildenafil on lung function and hemodynamics in patients with chronic heart failure [^ea886f38]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic heart failure (CHF) may be associated with a disordered nitric oxide (NO)-mediated regulation of the pulmonary vessel tone and permeability and of the gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Whether enhancement of NO availability is beneficial with regard to these functions has not been explored. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, may provide a tool with which to test this possibility.

Methods

In 10 patients with CHF and 10 normal subjects, before and at 60 minutes after sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo, we measured left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary hemodynamics, lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and its alveolar-capillary membrane and blood capillary volume subcomponents, and flow-mediated brachial artery dilation (FMD) during reactive hyperemia to distal circulatory arrest (an indirect index of NO-mediated endothelial function).

Results

In patients with CHF, sildenafil caused no variations in ejection fraction, cardiac index, wedge pulmonary pressure, and blood capillary volume; it decreased pulmonary artery systolic (-21.6%) and diastolic (-31.8%) pressure and arteriolar resistance (-36.9%); and it increased lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (+11.2%), diffusing capacity of the alveolar-capillary membrane (+10.6%), and FMD (from +8.3% to +13.4%). All changes were significant at P < .01. None of these effects was observed in healthy subjects. Placebo was ineffective in both patients and control subjects.

Conclusion

This study provides the novel information that, in patients with CHF, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition with sildenafil ameliorates the pulmonary hemodynamics and reduces the impedance of the alveolar-capillary interface, even if left ventricular filling pressure and function remain steady. The associated improvement in FMD at the periphery substantiates the possibility that an enhancement in NO release may underlie these effects.

### Validation of math model using porous media for determining alveolar CO 2 in ventilated patients [^558a6b0f]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Transport in Pathways 3 and 4

This will be treated as a porous medium, where the local mass balance is:

where D eff is the effective diffusivity of the analyzed gas in the mixture of respiratory gases, ρ s is the gas concentration in blood, and a is the specific surface area defined as the ratio between the interfacial area of the pore and its volume.

The lung porosity, denoted as ε, is defined as the total volume of the pores (alveoli and airways) divided by the overall lung volume. This is a value that remains constant over time for each specific clinical condition (although it may vary according to the disease pathology), and therefore equation (4) can be reformulated as follows:

F a andare the alveolated fraction, and the average velocity, respectively, which are functions of the axial position of the airway from generations 2 to 23. The term on the left-hand side of equation (5) represents the mass accumulation in the porous media. The first term on the right-hand side (RHS) of equation (5) represents diffusive gas transport, the second RHS term refers to convective transport in the porous medium, and the third RHS term refers to the transport of 2 between the alveoli and the blood, where K is the exchange constant or diffusive capacity of the lung and which depends on the permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane, the geometry, and the solubility and diffusivity characteristics of each gas.

Considering that the effective diffusivity is expressed as, where D p is the diffusivity in the pore and τ is the tortuosity of the porous media. D p is defined according to the following equation, whereis Knudsen's diffusivity. However, since Knudsen-type diffusion is only dominant for pores whose average diameter varies between 2 and 50 nm, D p is fundamentally equal to D m in this case. Additionally, the specific surface area for cylindrical pores can be expressed as, where r p is the pore radius. Based on the above and considering a constant porosity over time, upon division of equation (4) by ε, we ultimately derive the subsequent equation:

Given that the variables for specific surface area, alveolar fraction, and pore radius possess distinct values corresponding to their relative positioning within the porous medium, they need to be expressed through dedicated piecewise functions for each individual variable. Furthermore, the velocityis subject to variations throughout the porous medium due to fluctuations in the cross-sectional area, a factor that is consequently incorporated into this equation.

Assessing pulmonary perfusion with positron emission tomography (PET) — assessment is based on tracer kinetics using 13NN, oxygen-15–labeled water (15O-H2O), or gallium-68 (68Ga)–labeled particles/compounds; because of its low blood–gas partition coefficient, intravenously injected 13NN reaching lung capillaries mostly diffuses into alveoli, allowing assessment of true capillary perfusion; main 13NN-based approaches include continuous 13NN infusion with ventilation computed from inhalation of neon-19 gas, and 13NN–saline bolus in which perfusion is computed during a breath hold and the end-of–breath hold activity characterizes capillary perfusion specific to aerated regions; the 15O-H2O–based method measures perfusion from local kinetics of injected 15O-H2O, accounting for the input function into pulmonary circulation and water extraction.

### Tetrastarch sustains pulmonary microvascular perfusion and gas exchange during systemic inflammation [^cdf54632]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

According to Fick's law of diffusion, gas exchange depends on the size and thickness of the blood perfused alveolocapillary membrane. Impairment of either one is tenuous. No data are available concerning the impact of hydroxyethyl starches and saline on pulmonary microperfusion and gas exchange during systemic inflammation.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study.

Setting

University research laboratory.

Subjects

Thirty-two anesthetized rabbits assigned to four groups (n = 8).

Interventions

Except for the control group, systemic inflammation was induced by lipopolysaccharide. Fluid resuscitation was performed with saline alone or in conjunction with tetrastarch or pentastarch. Pulmonary microcirculation was analyzed at 0 hr and 2 hrs using intravital microscopy. Thickness of the alveolocapillary membrane was measured using electron microscopy.

Measurements and Main Results

Macrohemodynamics were stable in all groups. In pulmonary arterioles, lipopolysaccharide reduced the erythrocyte velocity and impeded the microvascular decrease of the hematocrit in the saline and pentastarch group. In contrast, infusion of tetrastarch normalized these perfusion parameters. In capillaries, lipopolysaccharide decreased the functional capillary segment density and the capillary perfusion index, which was prevented by both starches. However, compared with saline and pentastarch, treatment with tetrastarch prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced reduction of the capillary erythrocyte flux and inversely reduced the erythrocyte capillary transit time. Thickening of alveolocapillary septae after lipopolysaccharide application was solely observed in the saline and pentastarch group. In contrast to pentastarch and saline, the application of tetrastarch prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase of the alveoloarterial oxygen difference.

Conclusions

Tetrastarch sustains pulmonary gas exchange during experimental systemic inflammation more effectively than saline and pentastarch by protecting the diffusion distance and the size of the microvascular gas exchange surface. Improved capillary perfusion resulting from tetrastarch therapy, which is typically applied to increase blood pressure, may according to the Ohm's law locally decrease hydrostatic perfusion pressures in the pulmonary microvasculature during systemic inflammation.

### The effects of anesthesia, muscle paralysis, and ventilation on the lung evaluated by lung diffusion for carbon monoxide and pulmonary surfactant protein B [^a7834306]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

An increased alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference is frequent in anesthetized patients. In this study, we evaluated the effect on the lung of anesthesia, muscle paralysis, and a brief course of mechanical ventilation.

Methods

Lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO), including pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc) and conductance of the alveolar-capillary membrane (DM), and pulmonary surfactant protein type B (a marker of alveolar damage) were measured in 45 patients without pulmonary disease undergoing extrathoracic surgery.

Results

Anesthesia, muscle paralysis, and mechanical ventilation led to impairment of gas exchange, with a reduction of DLCO values immediately after anesthetic induction due to a concomitant reduction of both DM and Vc. While changes in DM were due to the reduction of lung volume, changes in Vc were not limited to volume loss, since the Vc/alveolar volume ratio decreased significantly. Although DLCO and its components decreased immediately after induction, none of the values decreased further at 1 and 3 hours. Surfactant protein type B, however, was unchanged immediately after anesthesia but increased at 1 hour after induction and further increased after 3 hours of anesthesia. The level of alveolar damage correlated with the reduction of lung perfusion and lung dynamic strain (i.e., ratio between tidal volume and end-expiratory lung volume).

Conclusions

A brief course of anesthesia and controlled ventilation leads to: (1) alveolar damage, which is correlated with lung strain and perfusion, and (2) impaired gas exchange mainly due to volume loss but also to reduced aerated lung perfusion.

### Diminished alveolar microvascular reserves in type 2 diabetes reflect systemic microangiopathy [^9189b1f2]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetic microangiopathy can involve alveolar tissue and capillaries, the largest microvascular bed in the body, leading to restriction of lung volume and alveolar gas transport, as manifested by reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL CO), as well as its components: membrane diffusing capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume (V C). Lung diffusing capacity is the gas conductance across the lung, modeled as diffusion across alveolar-capillary membrane barrier followed by chemical binding to capillary hemoglobin. In young nonsmokers with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, DL CO and its components were reduced 15–30% at rest and exercise compared with age-matched nondiabetic subjects. In type 1 diabetic patients who maintained near-normoglycemia, these parameters are near normal, suggesting a relationship between alveolar function and systemic microangiopathy. Impaired alveolar gas transfer in type 1 diabetes signifies erosion of microvascular reserves that could accelerate clinical decline in conjunction with primary lung disease, aging, or cardiorenal complications and affect long-term tolerance to the use of inhaled insulin.

### Developmental respiratory physiology [^45345f4c]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Significant differences in respiratory physiology between infants and adults explain the higher vulnerability of the infant respiratory system for decompensation and failure. In general, breathing efficiency is determined by the work of breathing per tidal breath and the gas exchange achieved per tidal breath. Numerous factors render the infants' respiratory system less efficient (Table 1), and a variety of counteractive mechanisms exist to compensate for the respiratory instability. However, anesthesia and/or severe illness may compromise these counteractive mechanisms or they may prove counter‐productive (eg, laryngospasm). Respiratory adverse events are common in pediatric anesthesia and comprise more than three quarters of all critical incidents and half of all unplanned admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit, and approximately a third of cardiac arrests during anesthesia is attributed to respiratory complications. Unsurprisingly, young age is a major risk factor, increasing the odds ratio of critical incidents in infants less than a year by a factor of four compared to older children.

TABLE 1
Aspects of developmental respiratory physiology contributing to respiratory vulnerability of infants (adapted from ref.)

Following the path of a breathing cycle, pulmonary gas exchange requires.
‐ a functional neural control which includes the initiation and coordination of the breathing cycle, the maintenance of upper airway patency, and the generation of protective reflexes
‐ building‐up of a pressure gradient to generate an airflow and to overcome the airway resistance, the viscoelastic forces, and the inertia of the lungs and the chest wall
‐ bronchiolo‐alveolar gas mixing and diffusion of gas across the air‐blood barrier
‐ renewal of oxygenated and decarbonized capillary blood.

All four functions are negatively affected by developmental characteristics.

### Pulmonary capillary recruitment is attenuated post left ventricular assist device implantation [^8537c0f7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is limited knowledge of pulmonary physiology and pulmonary function after continuous flow-left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation. Therefore, this study investigated whether CF-LVAD influenced pulmonary circulation by assessing pulmonary capillary blood volume and alveolar-capillary conductance in addition to pulmonary function in patients with heart failure. Seventeen patients with severe heart failure who were scheduled for CF-LVAD implantation (HeartMate II, III, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL or Heart Ware, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) participated in the study. They underwent pulmonary function testing (measures of lung volumes and flow rates) and unique measures of pulmonary physiology using a rebreathe technique that quantified the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for nitric oxide before and 3 months after CF-LVAD implantation. After CF-LVAD, pulmonary function was not significantly changed (p > 0.05). For lung diffusing capacity, alveolar volume (VA) was not changed (p = 0.47), but DLCO was significantly reduced (p = 0.04). After correcting for VA, DLCO/VA showed a trend toward reduction (p = 0.08). For the alveolar-capillary component, capillary blood volume (Vc) was significantly reduced (p = 0.04), and alveolar-capillary membrane conductance trended toward a reduction (p = 0.06). However, alveolar-capillary membrane conductance/Vc was not altered (p = 0.92). In conclusion, soon after CF-LVAD implantation, Vc is reduced likely because of pulmonary capillary derecruitment, which contributes to the decrease in lung diffusing capacity.

### The influence of venous admixture on alveolar dead space and carbon dioxide exchange in acute respiratory distress syndrome: computer modelling [^50e406bd]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), dead space is often high. This impedes gas exchange and efforts to ventilate at low tidal volume in order to provide lung protective ventilation. Airway dead space is increased by connecting tubes, often including a humidifying filter, and by limiting time for equilibration between airway and alveolar space. In a complex relationship, dead space at the alveolar level reflects uneven ventilation/perfusion among lung compartments. Ventilated compartments with nearly zero perfusion may result from microthrombosis. Other compartments may have a broad distribution of ventilation/perfusion relationships. In a ground breaking study, West showed that this impedes gas exchange by increasing alveolar dead space.

In ARDS intrapulmonary shunt depends on collapsed lung units that are perfused but not ventilated. Part of venous blood thereby passes the lung without exchanging carbon dioxide and then mixes with arterial blood. Venous blood has a higher carbon dioxide content than does arterialized blood from ventilated and perfused lung units, and a shunt thereby leads to an increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2). Therefore, a right-to-left shunt widens the difference between alveolar carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) and PaCO 2, which defines the alveolar dead space (see Equation 1, below). Accordingly, it contributes to the classical concept physiological dead space. Such a shunt may reach 50% of cardiac output or more and increases the need for alveolar ventilation (V'A) and total ventilation (V'tot). The effect of a shunt on arterial oxygenation is routinely considered in critical care and can easily be estimated by using the shunt equation. The effect of shunt on dead space and carbon dioxide exchange reflects complex relationships between content and partial carbon dioxide tension and oxygen saturation in venous, arterial and pulmonary end-capillary blood. Applying a simplified lung model, Mecikalski and coworkers calculated the extent to which shunt affects alveolar dead space under specific circumstances. Later, Giovannini and colleagues developed a model that allows accurate calculations of difference in carbon dioxide concentration between venous and arterial blood. We amended this model to calculate effects of shunt on carbon dioxide exchange under different conditions.

The purpose of the present study was to analyze the extent to which intrapulmonary shunt contributes to alveolar dead space, thereby perturbing carbon dioxide exchange, at varying physiological conditions that are relevant in ARDS. The effects of varying cardiac output, metabolic rate, respiratory and metabolic acid-base status, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit were analyzed, as were the effects of combinations of these factors.

### Gas diffusion and alveolar-capillary unit in chronic heart failure [^6af7c463]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Alveolar gas diffusion (DLCO) is impaired in chronic heart failure (CHF). Diffusion depends on membrane diffusion (DM) and the amount of blood participating in gas exchange (VC). How DM, VC, and the alveolar-capillary unit behave in relationship to CHF severity is unknown.

Methods and Results

We measured pulmonary function, including DLCO, DM, VC, and alveolar volume (VA), in 191 CHF patients in NYHA class I-III. CHF patients were grouped accordingly to peak exercise oxygen uptake (pVO(2)): group < 12 mL/min/kg (n = 24), group 12–16 (n = 76), group 16–20 (n = 64), and group > 20 (n = 27). DLCO, DM, VC, and VA were lowest in severe CHF and were linearly related to pVO(2) (DLCO, r = 0.577, P < 0.001; DM, r = 0.490, P < 0.001; VC, r = 0.216, P < 0.01; VA, r = 0.565, P < 0.01). DM/VC ratio, an index of the alveolar-capillary unit efficiency, was higher in group < 12 (0.49 ± 0.39 mL/min/mmHg/mL) and > 20 (0.46 ± 0.29), compared with 12–16 (0.34 ± 0.19) and 16–20 (0.35 ± 0.17).

Conclusion

DLCO progressively worsens as CHF severity increases due to reduction in lung tissue participating to gas exchange (low VC and VA). In severe CHF, the few working alveolar-capillary units are the most efficient as shown by the high DM/VC. This is useful for maintaining gas exchange efficiency in severe CHF.

### Preschool multiple-breath washout testing. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^e323c22e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Preschool multiple-breath washout (MBW) — tissue nitrogen (N2) diffusion and correction: Modeling suggests a small effect on adult functional residual capacity (FRC) of 1.8% (within the 5% accuracy limit) and a larger relative effect on lung clearance index (LCI) of 6.3%, with error magnitude worsening with increasing ventilation inhomogeneity and with decreasing FRC in analyses using values for a 10-year-old child; preliminary in vivo studies suggest the effect of tissue N2 increases with increasing lung volume and subject size, and as lung function worsens. Until the magnitude of error introduced is defined and validated correction equations are available for inert gas diffusion across the alveolar–capillary barrier, correction of MBW data for this effect is not recommended.

### Volumetric capnography: lessons from the past and current clinical applications [^8a62c4fb]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Definitions

The terms physiological or respiratory dead space (VDphys) refer to lung units that are ventilated but do not contribute to gas exchange because the expired gas from these units has no contact with pulmonary capillary blood flow. VDphys can be divided further into alveolar dead space (VDalv) and anatomical dead space, which also is known as airway dead space (VDaw). As shown in Fig. 1, VDaw corresponds to the volume in conducting airways and ends at the alveolar compartment. The term VDalv refers to volume in alveoli that is ventilated but not perfused (compartment C in Fig. 1) as described by Riley and Cournand. This compartment corresponds to West zone I as identified by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. West zone I occurs when alveolar pressure is greater than the pressure inside the collapsible pulmonary vessels and the alveolar pressure thus stops pulmonary flow in that region. This can occur with hyperinflation of the lungs or even due to gravitational effects as vascular pressures in upper regions become less than alveolar pressure.

Fig. 1
Riley three compartment model. Compartment A: shunt = perfused but not ventilated alveolae (V/Q = 0). Compartment B: ideal condition. Compartment C: dead space = ventilated but not perfused alveolae (V/Q = ∞). VDaw airway dead space, VDalv alveolar dead space, VDphys the sum of airway and alveolar dead space

In the clinical context, VDalv typically arises through two general processes. The first involves over-inflation of the lung, which can be due to dynamic hyperinflation because the expiratory period is too short to completely expire the inflated volume, the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is high, or the delivered tidal volume is large. The second process involves decreased pulmonary perfusion or changes in the distribution of perfusion caused by either direct obstruction of arterial pulmonary vessels or by reduction of output from the right ventricle. VDaw normally is relatively fixed, but it changes with changes in body position or tracheal diameter. The latter can be decreased by the presence of an endotracheal tube and increased by high levels of PEEP. Additional equipment attached in series between the patient's mouth and the Y-piece of the ventilator circuit also increases VDaw; this is called instrumental dead space (VDinst). The product of VDphys (mL) and respiratory rate give the dead space ventilation (VD) (L/min).

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^706fa7c3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of ARDS results from acute inflammation affecting the lung's gas exchange surface, the alveolar-capillary membrane. Increased permeability of the membrane associated with the recruitment of neutrophils and other mediators of acute inflammation into the airspace manifests as high permeability pulmonary oedema. The resulting acute inflammatory exudate inactivates surfactant leading to collapse and consolidation of distal airspaces with progressive loss of the lung's gas exchange surface area. This would be compensated for by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, if the inflammatory process did not also effectively paralyse the lung's means of controlling vascular tone, thereby allowing deoxygenated blood to cross unventilated lung units on its way to the left heart. The combination of these two processes causes profound hypoxaemia and eventually type 2 respiratory failure as hyperventilation fails to keep pace with carbon dioxide production.

Diagnosis

Any diagnostic strategy for ARDS is sufficiently dependent on local factors, such as the prevalent causes of infectious pneumonia and access to imaging modalities, that a single protocol cannot be recommended. An exemplar from a tertiary referral centre used to dealing with complex and very severe cases is included (figure 1, p43–44). There are two main broad categories of condition that resemble ARDS but have a distinct pathophysiology: first, cardiovascular conditions of rapid onset including left heart failure, right-to-left vascular shunts usually with some lung pathology and major pulmonary embolism; second, lung conditions which develop more slowly than ARDS, for example, interstitial lung diseases (especially acute interstitial pneumonia), bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, lymphangitis and the pulmonary vasculitides.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^d90258f9]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary function — sex differences in lung size, airway caliber, and ventilatory responses are summarized as follows: Pulmonary function at rest and during exercise is different between males and females, with females having smaller lungs when matched for height and smaller conductive airways when matched for lung size and irrespective of fitness. The larger lung and airway size of healthy males compared with females emerge by 14 yr of age, and females consequently have lower maximum expiratory flows at rest. Females also exhibit lower diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (corrected for hemoglobin), likely driven by lower pulmonary capillary blood volume and alveolar capillary diffusion capacity compared with males; however, there is no sex difference in diffusion capacity when normalized to alveolar volume, indicating the difference is driven by sex differences in lung size. Because airway size affects airway resistance, females have a higher work of breathing and exhibit shallower breathing with greater breathing frequency compared with males, and endurance trained females have a higher propensity toward expiratory flow limitation principally observed when ventilatory demand approaches maximal ventilatory capacity during exercise. Finally, females have a blunted inspiratory muscle metaboreflex, which increases blood pressure in response to metabolic accumulation in the muscle during exercise, and this is likely due to the effect of estradiol on β-adrenergic receptors on the leg muscle vasculature.

### Simultaneous measurement of lung diffusing capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics reveals exertional alveolar-capillary dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^f6290e11]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary Gas Exchange and Lung Diffusing Capacity Measures

At rest, gas exchange and ventilatory parameters were similar between groups (Table 2); however, patients with HFpEF had a higher end‐tidal partial pressure of CO 2. At 20 W, tidal volume and VO 2 (absolute and normalized to mass) were lower, and the ratio of dead space to tidal volume was higher in patients with HFpEF. At symptom‐limited maximal exercise, VCO 2, ventilation, and tidal volume were lower in patients with HFpEF. At rest and throughout exercise, DL CO and DL NO were lower in patients with HFpEF, attributable to lower Dm, while Vc was not different between groups (Table 2). During symptom‐limited maximal exercise, there was a significant correlation between VO 2 and Dm (R = 0.82, P < 0.001).

Relationship Between Lung Diffusing Capacity and Pulmonary Hemodynamics

The relationship between lung diffusing capacity variables (DL CO, Dm, and Vc) and PAPm was shallower and rightward‐shifted in patients with HFpEF compared with controls (Figure 1), resulting in lower DL CO, Dm, and Vc for a given PAPm. In controls, there was a linear increase in DL CO and Dm relative to PAPm from rest to symptom‐limited maximal exercise, while patients with HFpEF increase DL CO and Dm relative to PAPm from rest to 20 W exercise and then reached a plateau. Similarly, Vc increased from rest to 20 W and then reached a plateau in both groups at symptom‐limited maximal exercise.

### The influence of chlorine in indoor swimming pools on the composition of breathing phase of professional swimmers [^33eae36a]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

During the experiment, athletes dealing with professional swimming were examined regarding the composition of exhaled air before training (on empty stomach/ fasting) after training and two hours after leaving the swimming pool hall. Results showed clear changes between the registered signals for group A pre-training, group B immediately after training and group C, measured two hours after leaving the sports hall. The results clearly indicate that during the training there was an increase in the content, quantitatively and qualitatively, of volatile organic compounds in exhaled air in swimmers. Explanation of this phenomenon may rely on the reaction of chlorine compounds taken into the bioreactor – which are the lungs –during swimming and its reaction with the gas content of the lungs and airways, including hydrocarbons derived from the gastrointestinal tract.

The human respiratory system is made up of lungs and respiratory tract, the operated air travels to the alveoli and back. Respiratory include nostrils, nasal cavity, throat, larynx and trachea, which branches into two bronchi - left and right, leading to the lungs. The pulmonary vesicles are surrounded by a dense network of capillary blood vessels. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between the blood and air in the alveoli occurs through the walls of the alveoli. Gas exchange occurs by diffusion. Under normal physiological conditions, alveolar air contains a large amount of volatile organic substances diffusing from the blood, through the pulmonary alveolar membrane, according to a vapor pressure gradient. In addition, in exhaled air, substances belonging to various chemical classes: saturated hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, pentane), unsaturated hydrocarbons (isoprene), aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene), aldehydes (ethanal, methanal, acetaldehyde), ketones (acetone), alkoxy (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol), esters (methyl acetate, ethyl acetate), sulfur compounds (methanothiol, ethanethiol, carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, dimethyl sulfide), nitrogen-containing compounds (dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine (TMA), ammonia) and others. The breath sample may contain several sets of volatile organic compounds collected at nmol levels.

### Insulin improves alveolar-capillary membrane gas conductance in type 2 diabetes [^236e0335]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In type 1 diabetes, lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL(CO)) may be impaired, and insulin has been shown to be beneficial in cases in which near-normal metabolic control is achieved. An influence of insulin, per se, on the alveolar-capillary membrane conductance is unexplored. We aimed at testing this possibility.

Research Design and Methods

We studied 19 life-long nonsmoking, asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes and normal cardiac function, whose GHb averaged 6.2 ± 0.3% with diet and hypoglycemic drugs. DL(CO) and its subcomponents (alveolar capillary membrane conductance [D(M)] and pulmonary capillary blood volume available for gas exchange [Vc]), vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume 1 s (FEV(1)), cardiac output (CO), ejection fraction (EF), pulmonary wedge pressure (WPP), and pulmonary arteriolar resistance (PAR) were determined before and within 60 min after infusion of 50 mL saline + 10 IU of regular insulin or after saline alone on 2 consecutive days (random block design). Glycemia was kept at baseline levels during experiments by dextrose infusion.

Results

Percent of normal predicted DL(CO) averaged 84.2 ± 7.9% and in 14 patients was < 100%. Insulin infusion, not saline alone, improved (P < 0.01) DL(CO) (12%) and D(M) (14%) and raised DL(CO) to 98% of the normal predicted value. There were no variations in VC, FEV(1,) CO, EF, WPP, or PAR, suggesting that the influences of the hormone on gas transfer were not mediated by changes in spirometry, volumes, and hemodynamics of the lung.

Conclusions

Several cases of type 2 diabetes present with increased impedance to gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane, and hypoglycemic drugs do not prevent this inconvenience. Insulin, independently of the metabolic effects, acutely improves gas exchange, possibly through a facilitation of the alveolar-capillary interface conductance.

### Diminished alveolar microvascular reserves in type 2 diabetes reflect systemic microangiopathy [^cd18b8ce]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes has also been linked to lower spirometric indexes and resting DL CO. However, previous studies had not taken into account the dependence of DL CO on pulmonary blood flow (Q̇). Normally, DL CO and its components increase 40–60% in a linear relationship as Q̇ increases up to peak exercise. The ability to augment DL CO and its components indexes the recruitment of alveolar microvascular reserves via enlarged membrane surfaces, as well as increased mass and improved distribution of alveolar-capillary erythrocytes. Recruitment is essential for maintaining a normal diffusion-to-perfusion (D/Q̇) ratio and achieving adequate oxygenation of end-capillary blood leaving the lung. Conventional interpretation of DL CO implicitly assumes an unchanged Q̇; this assumption is unwarranted and can be misleading. For example, lower cardiac output associated with diabetic heart disease decreases apparent DL CO even when alveolar diffusion is normal. Conversely, elevated cardiac output associated with obesity increases apparent DL CO and could mask the impairment of alveolar diffusion. Thus, the adequacy of alveolar-capillary recruitment and gas transfer cannot be optimally assessed without knowledge of both DL CO and Q̇. We hypothesized that restriction of lung volume, DL CO, and microvascular recruitment develops in type 2 diabetes independent of Q̇ and that abnormalities correlate with disease duration, glycemic control, and extrapulmonary microangiopathy and are compounded by obesity. We simultaneously measured lung volume, Q̇, DL CO, membrane diffusing capacity, and V C using a noninvasive rebreathing technique in type 2 diabetic patients from rest to heavy exercise. Measurements were compared with reference values obtained in nondiabetic control subjects and adjusted for Q̇. Alveolar-capillary recruitment was assessed from the slopes of the increase in DL CO, diffusing capacity of the lung for nitric oxide (DL NO) and V C with respect to Q̇.

Respiratory — airway management, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) use: PEEP "improves oxygenation or decreases risk of developing hypoxemia" by "decreasing intrapulmonary shunting of blood and better matching perfused lung to ventilated lung tissue, thus improving arterial oxygenation". It "does not open fully collapsed alveoli but re-expands partially collapsed ones" and "does not decrease extravascular lung water but redistributes it". "Higher levels of PEEP are particularly useful in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)". PEEP "should be increased slowly by 2–3 cmH2O from 5 cmH2O to a max of 15 cmH2O" with close monitoring. "Excessive PEEP over distends alveoli, increases dead space and work of breathing, reduces lung compliance, and compresses alveolar capillaries, reducing oxygenation and risking pulmonary barotrauma". "Increased intrathoracic pressure can progressively decrease cardiac output and is most notable when PEEP is greater than 15 cmH2O. The higher the level of PEEP (over 5 cmH2O), the more likely the patient will experience a variety of adverse consequences, both ventilatory and hemodynamic".

### Pulmonary capillary blood volume response to exercise is diminished in mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^f4e935cb]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous work suggests that mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have greater lung dysfunction than previously appreciated from spirometry alone. There is evidence of pulmonary microvascular dysfunction in mild COPD, which may reduce diffusing capacity (DLCO) and increase ventilatory inefficiency during exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine if DLCO, pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and membrane diffusing capacity (Dm) are diminished during exercise in mild COPD, and whether this is related to ventilatory inefficiency and dyspnea.

Methods

Seventeen mild COPD patients (FEV 1 /FVC: 64 ± 4%, FEV 1 = 94 ± 11% pred) and 17 age- and sex-matched controls were recruited. Ten moderate COPD patients were also tested for comparison (FEV 1 = 66 ± 7% pred). DLCO, Vc, and Dm were determined using the multiple-fraction of inspired oxygen (F I O 2) DLCO method at baseline and during steady-state cycle exercise at 40W, 50%, and 80% of V˙O 2peak. Using expired gas data, ventilatory inefficiency was assessed by V˙ E /V˙CO 2.

Results

Compared to controls, mild COPD had lower DLCO at baseline and during exercise secondary to diminished Vc (P < 0.05). No difference in Dm was observed between controls and mild COPD at rest or during exercise. Patients with high V˙ E /V˙CO 2 (i.e. ≥ 34) had lower Vc and greater dyspnea ratings compared to control at 40W. Moderate COPD patients were unable to increase Vc with increasing exercise intensity, suggesting further pulmonary vascular impairment with increased obstruction severity.

Conclusion

Despite relatively minor airflow obstruction, mild COPD patients exhibit a diminished DLCO and capillary blood volume response to exercise, which appears to contribute to ventilatory inefficiency and greater dyspnea.

### Quantifying regional radiation-induced lung injury in patients using hyperpolarizedXe gas exchange magnetic resonance imaging [^49aa3ca8]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Radiation-induced lung injury has been shown to alter regional ventilation and perfusion in the lung. However, changes in regional pulmonary gas exchange have not previously been measured.

Methods and Materials

Ten patients receiving conventional radiation therapy (RT) for lung cancer underwent pre-RT and 3-month post-RT magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using an established hyperpolarized 129 Xe gas exchange technique to map lung function. Four patients underwent an additional 8-month post-RT MRI. The MR signal from inhaled xenon was measured in the following 3 pulmonary compartments: the lung airspaces, the alveolar membrane tissue, and the pulmonary capillaries (interacting with red blood cells [RBCs]). Thoracic 1 H MRI scans were acquired, and deformable registration was used to transfer 129 Xe functional maps to the RT planning computed tomography scan. The RT-associated changes in ventilation, membrane uptake, and RBC transfer were computed as a function of regional lung dose (equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions). Pearson correlations and t tests were used to determine statistical significance, and weighted sum of squares linear regression subsequently characterized the dose dependence of each functional component. The pulmonary function testing metrics of forced vital capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide were also acquired at each time point.

Results

Compared with pre-RT baseline, 3-month post-RT ventilation decreased by an average of -0.24 ± 0.05%/Gy (ρ = -0.88; P < .001), membrane uptake increased by 0.69 ± 0.14%/Gy (ρ = 0.94; P < .001), and RBC transfer decreased by -0.41 ± 0.06%/Gy (ρ = -0.92; P < .001). Membrane uptake maintained a strong positive correlation with regional dose at 8 months post-RT, demonstrating an increase of 0.73 ± 0.11%/Gy (ρ = 0.92; P = 0.006). Changes in membrane uptake and RBC transfer appeared greater in magnitude (%/Gy) for individuals with low heterogeneity in their baseline lung function. An increase in whole-lung membrane uptake showed moderate correlation with decreases in forced vital capacity (ρ = -0.50; P = 0.17) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (ρ = -0.44; P = 0.23), with neither correlation reaching statistical significance.

Conclusions

Hyperpolarized 129 Xe MRI measured and quantified regional, RT-associated, dose-dependent changes in pulmonary gas exchange. This tool could enable future work to improve our understanding and management of radiation-induced lung injury.

### Alveolar-capillary membrane conductance is the best pulmonary function correlate of exercise ventilation efficiency in heart failure patients [^7fda8804]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In heart failure (HF), changes in lung mechanics and gas diffusion are limiting factors to exercise. Their contribution to an increased exercise ventilation to CO2 production (VE/VCO2) slope is undefined.

Methods

A total of 67 stable HF patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise and pulmonary function tests, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), total lung capacity (TLC) and alveolar diffusing capacity with its subcomponents (alveolar-capillary membrane conductance (D(m)) and capillary blood volume (V(c))).

Results

Patients showed a mild restrictive pattern (FEV1 = 85 ± 15% and FVC = 75 ± 13% of normal predicted) and a moderate D(m) reduction (32 ± 12 mL min(-1) mm Hg(-1)). Average peak VO(2) was 15.6 ± 4.0 mL min(-1) kg(-1) and the VE/VCO2 slope was 39.6 ± 11.0. At simple Spearman correlation analysis, all variables, but V(c), correlated with peak VO2; only D(m) correlated with VE/VCO2 slope. At partial Spearman correlation, all variables lost the peak VO2 correlation, and D(m) still inversely correlated with VE/VCO2 slope (r = -0.35; p = 0.005). In patients with a high VE/VCO2 slope (cutoff value 34), despite comparable lung volumes, D(m) was significantly more depressed (30 ± 13 vs. 35 ± 10 mL min(-1) mm Hg(-1); p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Pulmonary function tests and alveolar gas diffusing capacity poorly correlate with peak VO2. D(m) impairment rather than lung volumes correlates with exercise ventilation efficiency. This finding further adds to the pathophysiological relevance of an abnormal gas exchange in HF patients.

Ventilation/perfusion mismatching

The ratio of ventilation (V) to perfusion (Q) is decisive for the quality of the gas exchange in the lungs. Pronounced ventilation/perfusion mismatch (V/Q) occurs in pulmonary disease, pulmonary vascular disorders and heart failure. Therefore, gas exchange measurements are central to the understanding of the pathophysiology of exercise limitation.

Due to gravity, at rest there is a small gradient in ventilation and a much more pronounced gradient in perfusion from the apex to the bottom of the lung in the upright position (e.g. V/Q drops from the apex [high V/Q] to the bottom) and renders gas exchange ineffective. During exercise, these V/Q heterogeneities diminish, because the upper lung segments are now well ventilated and perfused through deep inhalation, vascular dilation and recruitment of previously closed capillaries. The result is an enlarged gas exchange area. In principle, two kinds of ventilation/perfusion disturbances reflecting true ventilatory inefficiency can be distinguished, and these often overlap:
low V/Q regions (incomplete ventilation disorder; shunt effect). The ventilation to perfusion ratio decreases in subventilated but normally perfused alveoli (relative hypoventilation). Examples include chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD) and restrictive lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis). As a net effect, hypoxaemia occurs as a result of venous admixture, which cannot be compensated for by hyperventilation, resulting in an increase of P(A-a) O 2. Elevated PaCO 2 is usually prevented by hyperventilation in other lung areas. The different effects on PaO 2 and PaCO 2 are attributable to the different dissociation curves of O 2 (sigmoidal form of the O 2 dissociation curve) and CO 2 (linear form of the CO 2 dissociation curve). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is one mechanism to redistribute perfusion to better oxygenated regions and thus limit the extent of hypoxaemia.
high V/Q regions (incomplete distribution disorder; increased dead-space ventilation [VD/VT↑]). In normally ventilated but poorly perfused alveoli (relative hyperventilation), the V/Q ratio increases (dead-space effect). Examples include pulmonary emphysema (compression effects due to hyperinflation, reduced capillary bed), chronic heart failure, primary or secondary pulmonary vascular disease, and restrictive lung disease (e.g. interstitial lung disease [ILD] with reduced capillary bed). Overall, high V/Q mismatch usually has only a minor effect on arterial blood gases (more on CO 2 than on O 2 due to impaired release of CO 2 to the alveoli), resulting in increased P(a-ET)CO 2, because other lung areas are overventilated in a compensatory manner.

### Diabetic microvascular disease in non-classical beds: the hidden impact beyond the retina, the kidney, and the peripheral nerves [^23d4b321]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathological findings in lung microangiopathy in diabetes

The lung's large vascular bed and the presence of abundant connective tissue make it an organ very sensitive to microvascular damage. For instance, compared to capillaries in other organs and the pulmonary macrovasculature, pulmonary microvascular ECs generally exhibit much lower permeability and respond differently to barrier-disruptive stimuli such as pathogens, alterations in intracellular calcium, or oxidative stress.

The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of diabetes-lung injury are not fully understood. One proposed mechanism involves the combination of hyperglycaemia-induced microangiopathy and non-enzymatic glycosylation of connective tissue matrix proteins (elastin and collagen). Hyperglycaemia-induced microangiopathy can lead to thickening of the alveolar epithelium and basal lamina of pulmonary capillaries, resulting in reduced pulmonary capillary blood volume (Fig. 2). Furthermore, non-enzymatic glycosylation of connective tissue matrix proteins can lead to impaired vascular diffusion, stiffening of the lung parenchymal tissue, and reduced elasticity. Overall, these changes impair the efficiency of gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane and compromise the lung's ability to expand and recoil during breathing, further contributing to respiratory difficulties.

Morphological changes observed in post-mortem lung tissues of patients with DM compared to controls include thickened endothelial capillary basal lamina and alveolar epithelial cells and nodular fibrosis in the alveolar walls (Fig. 2). Besides, research in experimental animal models of diabetes has reported diverse structural modifications compared with control animals. These modifications include an increase in the proportion of alveoli per unit volume, the collapse of alveolar space because of increased fibrosis (with higher relative amounts of collagen, elastin, and basal laminae in the alveolar wall), narrowing of the alveolar space and enlarging the interstitium, as well as intense inflammatory reaction with neutrophil infiltration or aggregation in BM. Additionally, biopsy specimens of bronchial mucosa of patients with diabetes have shown significantly thicker BM of bronchial epithelial cells compared to those without diabetes.

Evidence of physiological dysfunction — gas exchange and lung mechanics measures were emphasized, as different measures of gas exchange, including partial pressure of arterial oxygen, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen, oxygen saturation, alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, or ventilation–perfusion mismatch, were commonly named by all respondents, and arterial blood gas measurements of oxygenation were ranked by ≥ 30% of the panelists as being "most relevant" to the domain; practical limitations are noted because arterial blood sampling for blood gas analysis is commonly a terminal procedure in mice, while noninvasive assessment of oxygenation by pulse oximetry may provide a reasonable alternative and was considered by nearly half the respondents as one of the top four "most relevant" measures, and changes in lung or respiratory system compliance were considered the "most relevant" among lung mechanics measures.

Lung mechanics and acquisition standardization highlight that the lung deforms under its own weight and that lung tissue density is higher in gravitationally dependent than nondependent regions, as alveolar size at resting volume is smaller except at total lung capacity (TLC); standardizing lung volume at acquisition is important. In addition to gravitationally based hydrostatic gradients, variation in alveolar size also creates apparent perfusion gradients because capillaries within alveolar walls are closer.

### Diminished alveolar microvascular reserves in type 2 diabetes reflect systemic microangiopathy [^81c98342]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diffusion and alveolar-capillary recruitment

Normally, lung volume and Q̇ are the major determinants of DL CO, DL NO, and V C. Upon exercise, DL CO, DL NO, and V C increase 40–60% in a linear relationship with respect to perfusion. In nonobese patients, the lower lung volume and lower Q̇ at exercise fully explain the 10–25% reduction in measured DL CO DL NO, and V C. Because lung volume was similarly reduced in obese and nonobese patients, the persistently lower DL CO DL NO, and V C in obese patients after adjustment for Q̇ suggest additional factors, e.g. infiltrative fat or connective tissue deposition within alveolar tissue, that cause diffusion impairment.

One major effect of type 2 diabetes is decreased alveolar microvascular perfusion, leading to proportionately lower DL CO, DL NO, and V C at rest or exercise. Obesity further impairs DL CO, DL NO, and V C, but the effect is partially offset by an obesity-associated increase in cardiac output. These results highlight the need to consider perfusion when interpreting lung diffusion. The magnitude of diffusion impairment in type 2 diabetes is milder than that observed in type 1 diabetes; differences could relate to longer disease duration in our earlier type 1 diabetes study (> 15 years) compared with that for type 2 diabetes (∼8 years) in this study. True disease duration is often uncertain in type 2 diabetes, and we did not observe a significant relationship between type 2 diabetes duration and lung function. Also, type 1 diabetes is uniformly severe, whereas the severity of type 2 diabetes is heterogeneous. Nonetheless, a consistent inverse relationship between lung function and glycemia emerged in type 2 diabetes as in type 1 diabetes.

Assessing ventilation and inhaled gas distribution — alveolar ventilation, "V̇A, is the rate of fresh gas delivery to the alveolar space (the dot denotes a rate)". In MRI and nitrogen washout studies, specific ventilation (SV) "is defined as the fraction of the original regional lung gas volume at end-expiration (Vr) that is replaced by a volume of fresh air or tracer gas (Ve) with each breath: SV = Ve / Vr (1)", and "is used to describe overall ventilation heterogeneity… in multiple-breath washout studies". Alternatively, "fractional ventilation… is sometimes used to measure the fraction of end-inspiratory lung volume that is made up of fresh air (or tracer gas)…: Fractional ventilation = Ve / (Ve + Vr) = SV / (1 + SV) (2)". "V̇A is a metric of primary importance for gas exchange".

### Assessment of gas exchange in lung disease: balancing accuracy against feasibility [^2e11de8d]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

While the principles underlying alveolar gas exchange have been well-known for over 50 years, we still struggle to assess gas exchange in hypoxemic patients. Unfortunately, simple measurements lack discrimination while complex measurements are infeasible in clinical care. The paper by Karbing et al. in this issue seeks a middle ground based on the arterial PO2 (PaO2)/inspired O2 fraction (FIO2) ratio measured at different FIO2s with the outcomes fed into proprietary software to account for both shunting and ventilation/perfusion inequality. Whether this is the optimal compromise between measurement difficulty and information available will have to be answered by those willing to test the approach in their own patients.

### A step forward toward a bedside and timely monitoring of regional / matching [^e55cd0fe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Efficient gas exchange is the result of an intimate matching of regional ventilation and perfusion across alveoli. Pulmonary embolism (PE) produces partial or complete blockage of perfusion to lung regions, resulting in very high/mismatch and/or dead-space ventilation. In addition, the interruption of blood flow to some regions diverts perfusion to areas without embolism. Normal ventilation may not be enough to oxygenate the surplus of blood flow within these units, and their/relation decreases, producing low/units and consequent hypoxemia. Imaging of/matching can therefore become an invaluable diagnostic tool for PE.

Cyclic variations in pulmonary air and blood content are the major determinants for the changes in thoracic impedance. Besides features like being a bedside imaging tool and providing the possibility of around-the-clock monitoring, the high temporal resolution is a crucial aspect of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) imaging that allows for the study not only of ventilation but also of faster physiological phenomena, such as pulmonary perfusion and the pulsatility of the lung during the cardiac cycle.

The measurement of lung pulsatility correlates well with stroke volume measured by thermodilution and can be used to track relative changes in stroke volume, helping optimize hemodynamics. Lung pulsatility, however, cannot reliably estimate pulmonary perfusion because the cyclic perturbations in local impedance caused by the passage of the stroke volume through the lung can be influenced by changes in parenchyma architecture, distensibility of the small pulmonary vessels, and size and patency of the pulmonary microvascular bed. We favor the estimation of lung perfusion based on first-pass kinetics of an EIT-indicator dilution curve using a hypertonic saline bolus, which is similar to X-ray computed tomography estimation of perfusion using iodinated contrast. A study that compared the pulsatility and the hypertonic-based approach using single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated that the approach using a hypertonic saline bolus was superior. A fundamental reason for the poorer performance of the pulsatility method is probably related to the fact that it measures the pulsatile changes in pulmonary blood volume instead of measuring real forward blood flow. Changes in vascular compliance can confound the relationship between the cyclic pulsatile changes in regional impedance and the perfusion to those regions. The largest difference between local blood flow measured by single-photon emission computerized tomographic and EIT pulsatility was found during unilateral lung collapse. Stronger pulsatile changes were found within the collapsed lung, whereas the amount of blood flowing to this region was significantly reduced. These data agree with findings of a retrograde flow from atelectatic zones to healthy ones during the diastolic phase.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^a5e86c51]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas — pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and analysis of arterial blood gas (ABG) or arterialized capillary blood are necessary to distinguish between pulmonary hypertension groups, assess comorbidities and the need for supplementary oxygen, and determine disease severity, and the initial work-up of suspected pulmonary hypertension should comprise forced spirometry, body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and ABG; in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PFTs are usually normal or may show mild restrictive, obstructive, or combined abnormalities, DLCO may be normal although it is usually mildly reduced, and a severely reduced DLCO (< 45% of the predicted value) with otherwise normal PFTs can occur in PAH associated with systemic sclerosis, PVOD, in PH group 3 conditions (emphysema, interstitial lung disease, or combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema), and in some PAH phenotypes, with a low DLCO associated with a poor prognosis in several forms of PH; patients with PAH usually have normal or slightly reduced partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), severe reduction of PaO2 might raise suspicion for patent foramen ovale, hepatic disease, other right-to-left shunt abnormalities (e.g. septal defect), or low-DLCO-associated conditions, and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is typically lower than normal due to alveolar hyperventilation.

### Carbon monoxide: a critical physiological regulator sensitive to light [^55124e4a]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study population was female, so these findings remain to be confirmed in males, although there is no a priori reason to expect that there will be a different result in men than in women. These results are still germane to understanding potential physical mechanisms by which light therapy has an antidepressant effect, in that, women tend to be more susceptible to depression than men and, especially during the reproductive ages and in northern latitudes, women also have higher rates than men of experiencing winter seasonal depression and subsyndromal seasonal depression (both responsive to light therapy).

While this finding does not prove any clinical effect of the physical phenomena, the robustness of the finding suggests that humoral mechanisms of visible light's effects be contemplated. It is commonly recognized that CO binds to hemoglobin and is a competitive inhibitor that displaces the oxygen-carrying sites of hemoglobin. CO poisoning is a well-known fatal risk of exposure to elevated concentrations of CO. But the impression that CO is only a poisonous and toxic gas is outdated in the context of current understanding of physiology. For example, typical concentrations of blood CO in nonsmokers measure up to 1% saturation of oxygen-binding sites of hemoglobin. But this binding is not irreversible. Physiologically produced CO is carried by hemoglobin and diffuses out of the body through pulmonary gas transport via diffusion across the pulmonary blood capillaries into the alveoli. Especially important for numerous aspects of physiology, CO metabolism and production is critical to the function of circadian-clock machinery, metabolism and behavior through regulation of CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent circadian gene expression and glucose metabolism. When CO is generated de novo or when it is released from hemoglobin — both processes robustly catalyzed by light — and can circulate in the bloodstream it becomes a potential physiological gasotransmitter, capable of acting in numerous locations, including circadian regulation. In contrast to the view often held by clinicians that CO is invariably a poison, it is a critical physiological regulator. Other critical physiologically active gases such as NO are also subject to dissociation from hemoglobin by bright light and to stimulation of production by bright light.

### Exercise hyperventilation and pulmonary gas exchange in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: effects of balloon pulmonary angioplasty [^bc180b00]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive ventilation (V̇E) and abnormal gas exchange during exercise are features of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). In selected CTEPH patients, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) improves symptoms and exercise capacity. How BPA affects exercise hyperventilation and gas exchange is poorly understood.

Methods

In this longitudinal observational study, symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise tests and carbon monoxide lung diffusion (DLCO) were performed before and after BPA (interval, mean (SD): 3.1 (2.4) months) in 36 CTEPH patients without significant cardiac and/or pulmonary comorbidities.

Results

Peak work rate improved by 20% after BPA whilst V̇E at peak did not change despite improved ventilatory efficiency (lower V̇E with respect to CO 2 output [V̇CO 2]). At the highest identical work rate pre- and post-BPA (75 (30) watts), V̇E and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (P(Ai-a)O 2) decreased by 17% and 19% after BPA, respectively. The physiological dead space fraction of tidal volume (VD/VT), calculated from measurements of arterial and mixed expired CO 2, decreased by 20%. In the meantime, DLCO did not change. The best correlates of P(Ai-a)O 2 measured at peak exercise were physiological VD/VT before BPA and DLCO after BPA.

Conclusions

Ventilatory efficiency, physiological VD/VT, and pulmonary gas exchange improved after BPA. The fact that DLCO did not change suggests that the pulmonary capillary blood volume and probably the true alveolar dead space were unaffected by BPA. The correlation between DLCO measured before BPA and P(Ai-a)O 2 measured after BPA suggests that DLCO may provide an easily accessible marker to predict the response to BPA in terms of pulmonary gas exchange.

### Fifty years of research in ARDS. gas exchange in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^94b16c63]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by severe impairment of gas exchange. Hypoxemia is mainly due to intrapulmonary shunt, whereas increased alveolar dead space explains the alteration of CO 2 clearance. Assessment of the severity of gas exchange impairment is a requisite for the characterization of the syndrome and the evaluation of its severity. Confounding factors linked to hemodynamic status can greatly influence the relationship between the severity of lung injury and the degree of hypoxemia and/or the effects of ventilator settings on gas exchange. Apart from situations of rescue treatment, targeting optimal gas exchange in ARDS has become less of a priority compared with prevention of injury. A complex question for clinicians is to understand when improvement in oxygenation and alveolar ventilation is related to a lower degree or risk of injury for the lungs. In this regard, a full understanding of gas exchange mechanism in ARDS is imperative for individualized symptomatic support of patients with ARDS.

### Sensitivity analysis of models of gas exchange for lung hyperpolarisedXe MR [^1d525522]. NMR in Biomedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis enables the identification of influential parameters and the optimisation of model composition. Such methods have not previously been applied systematically to models describing hyperpolarised 129 Xe gas exchange in the lung. Here, we evaluate the current 129 Xe gas exchange models to assess their precision for identifying alterations in pulmonary vascular function and lung microstructure. We assess sensitivity using established univariate methods and scatter plots for parameter interactions. We apply them to the model described by Patz et al and the Model of Xenon Exchange (MOXE), examining their ability to measure: i) importance (rank), ii) temporal dependence and iii) interaction effects of each parameter across healthy and diseased ranges. The univariate methods and scatter plot analyses demonstrate consistently similar results for the importance of parameters common to both models evaluated. Alveolar surface area to volume ratio is identified as the parameter to which model signals are most sensitive. The alveolar-capillary barrier thickness is identified as a low-sensitivity parameter for the MOXE model. An acquisition window of at least 200ms effectively demonstrates model sensitivity to most parameters. Scatter plots reveal interaction effects in both models, impacting output variability and sensitivity. Our sensitivity analysis ranks the parameters within the model described by Patz et al and within the MOXE model. The MOXE model shows low sensitivity to alveolar-capillary barrier thickness, highlighting the need for designing acquisition protocols optimised for the measurement of this parameter. The presence of parameter interaction effects highlights the requirement for care in interpreting model outputs.
