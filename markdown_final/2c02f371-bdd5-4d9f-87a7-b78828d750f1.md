## Question

Please correct any mistakes in: DIltiezam; bumex 1mg tablet; apixaban 2.5mg BID

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to correct any mistakes in the medication list "DIltiezam; bumex 1mg tablet; apixaban 2.5mg BID". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about drug name accuracy and generic versus brand conventions. Then, I should verify proper dose formatting and units. Next, I will confirm that the apixaban 2.5 mg BID dose is clinically appropriate for specific indications. After that, I need to consider important drug–drug interactions that could affect safety. Finally, I will compile the corrected phrase and double-check that each change is supported by authoritative sources [^112y5Rib] [^115zaAWu] [^1125jo7v].

> Let me first confirm the documentation standards I should apply, because I need to ensure consistency with FDA labeling norms and clinical style; generics are preferred unless brand conveys clinically necessary information, and SI unit formatting should include a space between the numeral and unit, which is reflected throughout FDA dosage statements such as "2.5 mg" and "1 mg" in apixaban and bumetanide labels respectively [^112G7Uhf] [^116TLQPr].

> Now, I will examine "DIltiezam", and wait, let me verify the correct spelling and case for the generic calcium channel blocker; the correct generic is diltiazem (all lowercase for generic), and the FDA SPL consistently uses "diltiazem hydrochloride", confirming the spelling and nomenclature standard I should apply here [^112y5Rib] [^1122sdUL].

> Next, I should review "bumex 1mg tablet", and hold on, I need to check whether to use brand or generic and whether the strength is valid; "Bumex" is the brand, but formal clinical documentation should prefer the generic "bumetanide", and the 1 mg tablet strength is standard, with proper spacing written as "1 mg", as reflected in FDA materials on bumetanide [^114QvYqh] [^115zaAWu] [^116TLQPr].

> I will now examine "apixaban 2.5mg BID", and I should double-check both the spacing and whether 2.5 mg twice daily is an appropriate dose in common indications; first, the space is required, so it should read "2.5 mg", and second, 2.5 mg BID is correct for several indications including VTE prophylaxis after knee or hip replacement and extended secondary prevention after initial VTE therapy, and it is also used for atrial fibrillation when the label's dose-reduction criteria are met, so the formatting and dose can be appropriate depending on the clinical context [^112G7Uhf] [^113PJ11K] [^111z5ptX] [^112svMyJ] [^113iMMcA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 2.5 mg BID might be only a postoperative prophylaxis dose, but let me reconsider; it is also an evidence-based extended-treatment dose after 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation for VTE as demonstrated in AMPLIFY-EXT, which supports the 2.5 mg BID regimen for extended prevention and aligns with FDA-listed secondary prevention dosing, so my earlier narrow framing would have been incomplete [^1113z9jn] [^116bGtqJ] [^111z5ptX].

> Before I finalize, I should confirm potential interactions because I need to ensure the list is not only formatted correctly but also clinically coherent; apixaban exposure increases with P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors, and while the label's strongest warning is for potent inhibitors, concomitant use with diltiazem, a moderate inhibitor, has been associated with higher bleeding risk in observational data, so if the clinical scenario includes both apixaban and diltiazem, careful monitoring is prudent and dose adjustments should follow the label's instructions when applicable [^1138Kjw6] [^114dw672] [^1168QTDD].

> Let me first confirm the original-to-corrected transformation so there is no ambiguity; Original: DIltiezam; bumex 1mg tablet; apixaban 2.5mg BID [^112y5Rib] [^115zaAWu] [^112G7Uhf].

> Now, I will compile the corrected phrase and I need to ensure every element reflects the verified standards; Corrected: diltiazem; bumetanide 1 mg tablet; apixaban 2.5 mg BID [^112y5Rib] [^116TLQPr] [^113iMMcA].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for each change one more time to avoid any oversight; I corrected the misspelling and case for diltiazem to match FDA SPL naming for the generic, I standardized "Bumex" to the generic "bumetanide" and fixed the spacing to "1 mg", and I standardized apixaban to "2.5 mg BID" with appropriate spacing, noting that the dose is clinically appropriate for multiple labeled uses depending on indication and patient factors, including AF dose-reduction criteria and post-orthopedic prophylaxis or extended VTE prevention [^112y5Rib] [^114QvYqh] [^112G7Uhf] [^113PJ11K] [^113iMMcA] [^1113z9jn].

> Finally, I need to ensure there are no hidden pitfalls; abbreviations like "BID" are common and acceptable in clinical documentation, but clarity on indication and patient-specific criteria for apixaban 2.5 mg BID would typically be documented elsewhere in the chart, and if diltiazem is coadministered with apixaban, vigilance for bleeding is warranted given the interaction profile and observational data, even though the strongest label restrictions pertain to potent inhibitors rather than diltiazem's moderate inhibition [^1138Kjw6] [^114dw672] [^1168QTDD].

---

The correct spellings and dosing are: **diltiazem** (not "DIltiezam") [^112y5Rib], **bumetanide 1 mg tablet** (not "Bumex 1mg tablet"), and **apixaban 2.5 mg BID** — appropriate only for specific indications (VTE prophylaxis after hip/knee replacement [^113PJ11K] [^112G7Uhf] or extended VTE prevention) [^116bGtqJ] or for atrial fibrillation when ≥ 2 dose-reduction criteria are met (age ≥ 80, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) [^113iMMcA] [^116AqjZP]. For AF without dose-reduction criteria, use **apixaban 5 mg BID** [^116AqjZP].

## Corrected medication names and dosages

| **Incorrect entry** | **Corrected medication name** | **Corrected dosage** | **Clinical notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| DIltiezam | Diltiazem | Dose varies by indication and formulation | Calcium channel blocker for AF rate control [^112y5Rib], angina, and SVT [^1122sdUL] |
| Bumex 1mg tablet | Bumetanide 1 mg tablet | 1 mg tablet | Loop diuretic; 1 mg ≈ 40 mg furosemide [^116TLQPr] |
| Apixaban 2.5mg BID | Apixaban 2.5 mg BID | 2.5 mg BID | Correct for VTE prophylaxis after hip/knee replacement [^113PJ11K] [^112G7Uhf], extended VTE prevention [^116bGtqJ], or AF with ≥ 2 dose-reduction criteria [^113iMMcA] |

## Clinical implications of corrected medications

### Diltiazem

Diltiazem is indicated for AF rate control [^112y5Rib], angina, and SVT [^1122sdUL]. Dosing varies by indication and formulation (**IR vs ER**) [^117HiCPw]. Use caution in **heart failure** and when combined with **beta-blockers** [^116Dv1aF]; monitor for bradycardia and hypotension [^114VXSkv].

---

### Bumetanide

Bumetanide is indicated for edema associated with CHF, hepatic disease, or renal disease. Typical dosing uses a 1 mg tablet; onset is rapid and duration short [^115zaAWu], and 1 mg ≈ 40 mg furosemide [^116TLQPr]. Monitor **electrolytes**, renal function [^111ztW5r], and volume status, and avoid use in **anuria** [^116Ly2dc].

---

### Apixaban

- **Indications**: NVAF, VTE treatment, and VTE prophylaxis [^1125jo7v].
- **Dosing**: 2.5 mg BID for VTE prophylaxis after hip/knee replacement [^113PJ11K] [^112G7Uhf], extended VTE prevention [^1113z9jn], or AF with ≥ 2 dose-reduction criteria (age ≥ 80, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) [^113iMMcA].
- **Precautions**: Monitor for bleeding; adjust for renal impairment [^113iMMcA] and drug interactions [^114dw672].

---

## Potential drug interactions and contraindications

- **Diltiazem and apixaban**: Diltiazem (CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor) can increase apixaban levels and bleeding risk; consider dose adjustment and monitor closely.
- **Bumetanide and apixaban**: Bumetanide-induced electrolyte disturbances may increase bleeding risk with apixaban; monitor electrolytes and bleeding.
- **Diltiazem and bumetanide**: Both can cause hypotension [^114VXSkv] [^111ztW5r] monitor blood pressure and adjust therapy as needed.

---

## Clinical scenarios for apixaban 2.5 mg BID

- **VTE prophylaxis**: After hip replacement (35 days) [^113PJ11K] or knee replacement (12 days) [^112G7Uhf].
- **Extended VTE prevention**: After ≥ 6 months of initial treatment [^111z5ptX] [^112svMyJ] [^1113z9jn].
- **AF dose reduction**: Use 2.5 mg BID if ≥ 2 of age ≥ 80, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL [^113iMMcA] [^116AqjZP].

---

## Summary of corrections

The **corrected entries** are diltiazem, bumetanide 1 mg tablet, and apixaban 2.5 mg BID for specific indications. For diltiazem, ensure correct spelling and dose per indication and formulation. For bumetanide, use the correct spelling and the 1 mg tablet. For AF, apixaban is generally **5 mg BID** unless dose-reduction criteria are met; **2.5 mg BID** is used only for specific indications.

### Eliquis [^114dw672]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Apixaban metabolism and elimination involve complex processes:

- **Metabolism**: Approximately 25% of an orally administered apixaban dose is recovered in urine and feces as metabolites. Apixaban is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2. O-demethylation and hydroxylation at the 3-oxopiperidinyl moiety are the major sites of biotransformation. Notably, unchanged apixaban is the major drug-related component in human plasma, and there are no active circulating metabolites.

- **Elimination**: Apixaban is eliminated through both urine and feces. Renal excretion accounts for about 27% of total clearance, while biliary and direct intestinal excretion contribute to its elimination in the feces. The total clearance of apixaban is approximately 3.3 L/hour, and it has an apparent half-life of approximately 12 hours following oral administration. Apixaban is also a substrate of transport proteins P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein.

- **Drug interaction studies**: During in vitro apixaban studies conducted at concentrations significantly greater than therapeutic exposures, no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, or CYP2C19, nor induction effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 was observed. Therefore, apixaban does not alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Additionally, apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of P-gp.

The effects of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban are documented and should be considered in clinical settings.

### Bumetanide [^115zaAWu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg of bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by a marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH₂O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TcH₂O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and it is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic. Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide in a dose-related fashion.

Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced diuresis indicates this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with a diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, and bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels.

### SPL drug information for diltiazem hydrochloride ER [^116Dv1aF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of diltiazem hydrochloride ER PO (also known as Cardizem CD, Cartia XT, Matzim LA, Tiadylt ER, Taztia XT, Tiazac):

- **Bradycardia**: Use caution in patients taking β-blockers or cardiac glycosides.
- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as diltiazem may cause acute liver injury with elevations in liver enzymes.
- **Exacerbation of heart failure**: Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure.
- **Hypotension**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as diltiazem may decrease blood pressure resulting in symptomatic hypotension.

### Bumetanide [^111ztW5r]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The most frequent clinical adverse reactions considered probably or possibly related to bumetanide are muscle cramps (seen in 1.1% of treated patients), dizziness (1.1%), hypotension (0.8%), headache (0.6%), nausea (0.6%), and encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing liver disease (0.6%). One or more of these adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 4.1% of patients treated with bumetanide.

	- Serious skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported in association with bumetanide use.

	- Less frequent clinical adverse reactions to bumetanide include impaired hearing (0.5%), pruritus (0.4%), electrocardiogram changes (0.4%), weakness (0.2%), hives (0.2%), abdominal pain (0.2%), arthritic pain (0.2%), musculoskeletal pain (0.2%), rash (0.2%), and vomiting (0.2%). One or more of these adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 2.9% of patients treated with bumetanide.

### Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116AqjZP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The ARISTOTLE study, published by Granger CB and colleagues in 2011 in The New England Journal of Medicine, investigated conditions such as atrial fibrillation, acute ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack.

- **Trial question**: What is the role of apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: 18,201 patients (6,416 female, 11,785 male) were included. The inclusion criteria required patients to have atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Key exclusion criteria included atrial fibrillation due to a reversible cause, moderate or severe mitral stenosis, conditions other than atrial fibrillation that required anticoagulation (e.g. a prosthetic heart valve), stroke within the previous 7 days, a need for aspirin at a dose greater than 165 mg a day or both aspirin and clopidogrel, and severe renal insufficiency.

- **Interventions**:
	- 9,120 patients received apixaban (5 mg orally twice a day).
	- 9,081 patients received dose-adjusted warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease was observed in the incidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 0.66 to 0.95 (1.2% per year versus 1.6% per year).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant decrease in the incidence of major bleeding (2.13% per year versus 3.09% per year; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.8).
	- A significant decrease in deaths from any cause (3.52% versus 3.94%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.8 to 0.99).
	- A significant decrease in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (0.24% per year versus 0.47% per year; HR 0.51, 95% CI).

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^1113z9jn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The AMPLIFY-EXT study investigated the effectiveness of apixaban (2.5 mg) for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, as published by Agnelli G and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013. The key question addressed was: What is the role of apixaban in patients with VTE?

- **Study design**: The study was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study included 1,669 patients, comprising 714 females and 955 males, who had VTE.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Participants needed to have VTE. Key exclusion criteria included contraindications to continued anticoagulant therapy, requirement for ongoing anticoagulant, dual antiplatelet therapy, aspirin at a dose greater than 165 mg/day, and a hemoglobin level of 2.5 mg/dL or lower.

- **Interventions**: Subjects were divided into two groups: 840 patients received apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily for 12 months) and 829 patients received a matching placebo (twice daily for 12 months).

- **Primary outcome**: The trial showed a significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE (1.7% vs. 8.8%; relative risk 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.33).

- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant reduction in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause was observed (3.8% vs. 11.6%; relative risk 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.48). There was no significant difference in non-VTE-related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.5% vs. 1.3%; relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 1.12). The study also noted a significant decrease in recurrent VTE.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^116bGtqJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor that can be administered in a simple, fixed-dose regimen, may be an option for the extended treatment of venous thromboembolism.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared two doses of apixaban (2.5 mg and 5 mg, twice daily) with placebo in patients with venous thromboembolism who had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and for whom there was clinical equipoise regarding the continuation or cessation of anticoagulation therapy. The study drugs were administered for 12 months.

- **Results**: A total of 2486 patients underwent randomization, of whom 2482 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or death from venous thromboembolism occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving placebo, compared with 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 5.0 to 9.3) and 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.9 to 9.1). The rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the placebo group, 0.2% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, and 0.1% in the 5-mg apixaban group. The rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.3% in the placebo group, 3.0% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group, and 4.2% in the 5-mg apixaban group. The rate of death from any cause was 1.7% in the placebo group, compared with 0.8% in the 2.5-mg apixaban group and 0.5% in the 5-mg apixaban group.

### Matzim LA [^117HiCPw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Matzim LA (diltiazem hydrochloride) extended-release tablets result in detectable plasma levels within 3 to 4 hours and peak plasma levels between 11 and 18 hours. Absorption occurs throughout the dosing interval. The apparent elimination half-life for Matzim LA is 6 to 9 hours after single or multiple dosing. When coadministered with a high-fat content breakfast, diltiazem peak and systemic exposures are not affected, indicating that the tablet can be administered without regard to food. As the dose of Matzim LA is increased from 120 to 240 mg, the area-under-the-curve increases 2.5-fold.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Impact of diltiazem on other coadministered drugs**:
		- **Anesthetics**: The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity, as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics, may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully.
		- **Benzodiazepines**: Studies showed that diltiazem increased the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and the Cmax by 2-fold, compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects.

### SPL drug information for apixaban [^1138Kjw6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):

- **Ais**: Use extreme caution in patients with AF transitioning from apixaban to warfarin.

- **Bleeding**: Use caution in patients taking other drugs affecting hemostasis, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.

- **Increased serum apixaban levels**: Use caution in patients taking P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). Reduce the dose of apixaban from 5–10 mg BID by 50%. Do not use P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients receiving 2.5 mg BID of apixaban.

### Bumetanide [^116TLQPr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg of bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by a marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH₂O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH₂O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide in a dose-related fashion.

- **Proximal tubule action**: Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide-induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, which is associated with a diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

- **Uric acid and diuresis onset**: Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of bumetanide, the onset of diuresis occurs in 30 to 60 minutes.

### SPL drug information for diltiazem hydrochloride [^114VXSkv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of diltiazem hydrochloride PO (also known as Cardizem):

- **Bradycardia**: Use caution in patients taking β-blockers or cardiac glycosides.

- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as diltiazem may cause acute liver injury with elevations in liver enzymes.

- **Exacerbation of HF**: Use caution in patients with congestive HF.

- **Hypotension**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as diltiazem may decrease BP resulting in symptomatic hypotension.

### Andexxa [^111AhnLu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Do not use unfractionated heparin following Andexxa administration due to unresponsiveness characterized by non-prolongation of activated clotting times. See full prescribing information for details on drug interactions.

- **Use with unfractionated heparin**: Unresponsiveness to unfractionated heparin has occurred following Andexxa administration, characterized by non-prolongation of activated clotting times and requirement for increased dosing of heparin. Do not use unfractionated heparin following Andexxa administration.

- **Interference of Andexxa with anti-FXa activity test**: Commercial clinical anti-FXa activity assays are unsuitable for measuring FXa activity following administration of Andexxa. Due to the reversible binding of Andexxa to the FXa inhibitor, the high sample dilution currently used in commercial clinical assays promotes dissociation of the inhibitor from Andexxa, resulting in detection of erroneously elevated anti-FXa activity levels. This leads to an underestimation of the reversal activity of Andexxa.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113EzNca]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Background**: This study outlines the development of a universal anti-Xa assay designed to measure the levels of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with high accuracy. The assay is calibrated using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH).

- **Methodology**: The validation process involved a comparative analysis against existing assays to determine diagnostic accuracy and reliability. The study ensured that external validation was conducted to affirm the assay's applicability in diverse clinical settings.

- **Findings**: Results indicated that the proposed universal assay could effectively measure all three target anticoagulants. This could streamline laboratory practices by reducing the need for separate assays for each medication.

- **Conclusion**: With its promising diagnostic accuracy and versatile application, this assay can potentially enhance therapeutic monitoring of patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy with rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

### Diltiazem HCI [^117TUEcx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage & administration**: Direct intravenous single injections (bolus) should begin with an initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection at 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight, administered over 2 minutes. A dose of 20 mg is reasonable for the average patient. If the response is inadequate, administer a second dose after 15 minutes. This second bolus should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight and administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is reasonable for the average patient). Subsequent doses should be individualized. Patients with low body weights should be dosed on a mg/kg basis. Note that some patients may respond to a dose of 0.15 mg/kg, albeit with a potentially shorter duration of action. Experience with this dose is limited.

- **Continuous intravenous infusion**: For continued heart rate reduction (up to 24 hours) in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, administer an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection. (For reconstitution of diltiazem hydrochloride for injection, refer to packaging instructions.) Begin the infusion immediately following bolus administration of either 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) or 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg) diltiazem hydrochloride injection, and after achieving heart rate reduction. The recommended initial infusion rate is 10 mg/h.

### Asundexian versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112uaboQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Stroke prevention with direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation confers a risk of bleeding and limits their use. Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding.

- **Methods**: In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events.

- **Results**: A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 73.9 ± 7.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA2DS2-VASc score (range, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke) was 4.3 ± 1.3. The trial was stopped prematurely at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 98 patients (1.3%) assigned to receive asundexian and in 26 (0.4%) assigned to receive apixaban (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval, 2.46 to 5.83). Major bleeding occurred in 17 patients (0.2%) who received asundexian and 5 patients (0.1%) who received apixaban.

### Reversal of antithrombotic agents [^115bNhtK]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants are the mainstay of therapy for thromboembolic diseases. In addition to the more traditional agents, new oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been shown to be effective across several indications. Bleeding is a serious complication associated with any anticoagulant, but many of the traditional parenteral and new oral agents do not currently have specific antidotes. This review describes available and future options for the reversal of the effects of anticoagulants, particularly the new oral agents, and discusses management strategies for bleeding events in clinical practice.

### Automated misspelling detection and correction in Persian clinical text [^115q95GJ]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Accurate electronic health records are important for clinical care, research, and ensuring patient safety. Correction of misspelled words is required to ensure the correct interpretation of medical records. In the Persian language, the lack of an automated misspelling detection and correction system is evident in medicine and healthcare. In this article, we describe the development of an automated misspelling detection and correction system for radiology and ultrasound free texts in the Persian language. To achieve our goal, we used an n-gram language model and three different types of free texts related to abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, head and neck ultrasound, and breast ultrasound reports. Our system achieved a detection performance of up to 90.29% for radiology and ultrasound free texts, with a correction accuracy of 88.56%. Results indicated that high-quality spelling correction is possible in clinical reports. The system also achieved significant savings during the documentation process and final approval of the reports in the imaging department.

### Oral apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism [^113CuUEV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered in fixed doses, may simplify the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind study, apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months) was compared with conventional therapy (subcutaneous enoxaparin, followed by warfarin) in 5,395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcomes included major bleeding alone and major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

- **Results**: The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 59 of 2,609 patients (2.3%) in the apixaban group, compared with 71 of 2,635 (2.7%) in the conventional therapy group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.18; difference in risk [apixaban minus conventional therapy], -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.4). Apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (P < 0.001) for predefined upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for both relative risk (< 1.80) and difference in risk (< 3.5 percentage points). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who received apixaban and in 1.8% of those who received conventional therapy (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.55; P < 0.001 for superiority). The composite outcome of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of patients in the apixaban group, compared with 9.7% of those in the conventional therapy group.

**Essentials**: DOAC-specific measurement is not widely implemented in the US, while it is more common in other areas of the world. The position from the Food and Drug Administration may explain this situation. Measurement of DOACs does not represent any technical difficulty and could be easily implemented in all laboratories. However, the fact that these laboratory tests are not available in some locations suggests disparities in patient care.

### Comparative safety and efficacy of a hybrid intravenous and oral diltiazem protocol for acute rate control in the emergency department [^112PvevF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Intravenous diltiazem has experienced numerous supply shortages over the past few years. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of a traditional diltiazem intravenous bolus and continuous infusion protocol to a diltiazem intravenous bolus and oral maintenance protocol for acute rate control in the emergency department.

- **Methods**: Patients who received intravenous diltiazem in the emergency department between January 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019, were screened. Patients were included if they received the diltiazem intravenous bolus and continuous infusion protocol (IV + infusion group) or the hybrid diltiazem intravenous bolus and oral maintenance protocol (IV + PO group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with rate control, without need for additional rate control agents or additional boluses during the maintenance phase.

- **Results**: A total of 106 patients were matched with 53 patients in each group. For the primary outcome of rate control at four hours, 62.3% of patients in the intravenous bolus + infusion group versus 75.5% of patients in the IV bolus + PO group achieved rate control (p = 0.142). There was no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia between groups.

- **Conclusion**: Results of this study demonstrated no difference in acute rate control when using a hybrid IV and oral diltiazem protocol compared to a traditional IV bolus and infusion strategy. This information supports the further use of a hybrid diltiazem IV and oral protocol, which provides increased flexibility during shortages of either medication.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^116Hnqcv]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Results

Spiking experiments and calculated concentrations of the spiked samples are shown in Table SI of the supplemental material. Figure 2 illustrates the association between LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa measurements and drug concentrations in all seven laboratories. The Spearman correlation coefficient between anti-Xa activity and drug concentrations was 1.0 in all laboratories.

- **Retrospective analysis**: A total of 698 samples from 474 patients were available for analysis. Among them, 432 patients were taking rivaroxaban and 73 apixaban. The median (range) age was 68.2 (18–99) years, and 70.1% were female. The correlations between LMWH- and drug-calibrated anti-Xa activities are shown in Figure S1 of the supplemental material. The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.96 for rivaroxaban [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95–0.97] and 0.98 for apixaban (95% CI 0.97–0.99). A deviation from linearity was observed in patient samples > 483 µg/l.

### Efficacy and safety of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. The Botticelli DVT dose-ranging study [^113KaUjN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Apixaban, an oral potent reversible direct inhibitor of activated factor X, has shown promise in the prevention of venous thromboembolism following major orthopedic surgery. We conducted a dose-ranging study in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis were included and randomized to receive 84–91 days of apixaban 5 mg twice-daily, 10 mg twice-daily, or 20 mg once-daily, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of symptomatic re-venous thromboembolism and asymptomatic deterioration of bilateral compression ultrasound or perfusion lung scan. The principal safety outcome was the composite of major and clinically relevant, non-major bleeding.

- **Results**: The mean age of the 520 included patients was 59 years, and 62% were male. The primary outcome occurred in 17 of the 358 apixaban-treated patients [4.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8–7.5%] and in five of the 118 LMWH/VKA-treated patients [4.2%, 95% CI 1.4–9.6%] who were evaluable. The incidence in all three apixaban groups was low and comparable without evidence of a dose response. The principal safety outcome occurred in 28 (7.3%) of the 385 apixaban-treated patients and in 10 (7.9%) of the 126 LMWH/VKA-treated patients. No dose response for apixaban was observed.

- **Conclusion**: These observations warrant further evaluation of apixaban in phase III studies. The attractive fixed-dose regimen of this compound may meet the demand to simplify anticoagulant treatment.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1158bzAp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been shown to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, many patients are not suitable candidates for, or are unwilling to receive, vitamin K antagonist therapy, and these patients have a high risk of stroke. Apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, may be an alternative treatment for such patients.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 5,599 patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable to receive apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81 to 324 mg per day), to determine whether apixaban was superior. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism.

- **Results**: Before enrollment, 40% of the patients had used a vitamin K antagonist. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban. There were 51 primary outcome events (1.6% per year) among patients assigned to apixaban and 113 (3.7% per year) among those assigned to aspirin (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.62; P < 0.001). The rates of death were 3.5% per year in the apixaban group and 4.4% per year in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.02; P = 0.07). There were 44 cases of major bleeding (1.4% per year) in the apixaban group and 39 (1.2% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.75; P = 0.57).

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^115meMtu]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate determination of anticoagulant drug levels is essential in critical clinical situations such as urgent surgery, planned thrombolysis, or major bleeding. Any anticoagulation treatment is inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding. This risk is as high as 15% per year in certain patient populations. Additionally, approximately 25% of intracranial hemorrhages, which are among the most dangerous adverse events, are linked to anticoagulation treatment. The bleeding risk associated with anticoagulants is particularly significant in trauma patients because uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of death in these patients. In any patient with massive bleeding, early and targeted treatment is the most critical measure to save lives, as 80% of trauma deaths occur within the first hour after trauma. Laboratory tests that can rapidly verify the presence of a relevant anticoagulant drug level will support fast treatment with reversal agents. Moreover, knowledge of the anticoagulant drug level is essential in cases of urgent surgery and planned thrombolysis. Rapid intervention is required in both cases, but an increased bleeding risk exposes patients to high procedural risks. Thus, simple laboratory tests that accurately determine the anticoagulant drug level would improve care in patients receiving anticoagulation treatment.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112F87kz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Apixaban Dosage Calculator" is used for perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for non-cardiac surgery, periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cancer-associated thrombosis, acute ischemic stroke, portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator serves as a clinical tool to determine the appropriate dose of apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The dosage depends on three factors: age, weight, and renal function (creatinine clearance). The recommended dose in atrial fibrillation is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following three characteristics: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Apixaban Dosage Calculator determines the appropriate apixaban dosage based on specific patient information. This involves considering the patient's age, weight, creatinine clearance, and the reason for using apixaban. Here's how the process works:

- **Inputs**:
	- Age is captured in years, with a range of 18 to 120.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis - can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies [^111Mb5pD]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Apixaban drug levels were measured 143 times between August 2017 and January 2023. In total, 24 patients participated, with 7 patients changing dosing during the observation period, thereby providing data for both dosing regimens. Seventeen patients were on 2.5 mg once daily, providing 87 levels with a median (range) of 4 (1–17) measurements per case. Fourteen patients were on 2.5 mg twice daily, providing 56 levels with a median (range) of 2 (1–11) measurements per case. The median (IQR) follow-up, defined as the time between the first and last drug level measurement, was 12.5 (5.5–21) months, with a maximum follow-up of 51 months.

- **Apixaban drug levels for the total population and the two dosing groups**:
	- The total number of patients is 24. The total number of cases is 31, as 7 patients were in both dosing groups due to changes in dosing during the treatment period. Drug levels (all) in the twice-daily dosing are significantly higher than those in the once-daily dosing. Trough level and non-trough level within each dosing group were not significantly different from each other.

Median (IQR) apixaban drug levels were 54.1 (< 40–72.1) ng/mL in the 2.5 mg once-daily group and 71.3 (45.8–104.1) ng/mL in the twice-daily group, P < 0.001. The highest levels observed were 157.6 ng/mL and 223.7 ng/mL, respectively. Thirty percent of drug levels in the once-daily group and 14% in the twice-daily dosing group were below our assay's detection limit of < 40 ng/mL. Drug levels pre- and post-hemodialysis did not differ from each other. However, there were only 8 post-hemodialysis levels from 5 patients available for comparison.

### Reply to "Key points to consider when evaluating Andexxa for formulary addition" [^112o76rT]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Low credibility.

The topic of society guidelines, conflict of interest, and bias is thoroughly explored by Peled et al. They discuss the conflicting society guidelines for managing DOAC-related bleeding. Guidelines often become quickly obsolete given the rapid introduction of new studies and data, as they take years to synthesize and publish. Many guidelines were written before the availability of andexanet alfa and the final ANNEXA-4 study results, and are currently under revision. More recent guidelines are placing andexanet alfa as a first-line agent ahead of PCC.

The authors also emphasize the importance of considering the conflicts of interest declared by guideline writers. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is crucial to ensure that decision-makers remain independent, with minimal conflict related to industry and sponsors. However, data show that 84% of physicians have had some relationship with industry. Ultimately, industry and national organizations typically rely on experts for advice and research to optimize the development of critical medications and create guidelines. Excluding those most knowledgeable about the medication and therapeutic area would reduce the impact of the guidelines.

Importantly, an individual may be free from conflict but not free from bias. Conflicts of interest are frequently declared, but biases often are not. Studies note cognitive biases in healthcare providers, including physicians and pharmacy and medical directors who serve on pharmacy and therapeutics committees. Cognitive biases are tendencies to process information in patterns that may interfere with optimal decision-making.

### Eliquis [^114DeRbj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdosage: An overdose of Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In controlled clinical trials, orally administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily for 7 days or 50 mg once daily for 3 days) had no clinically relevant adverse effects. In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of Eliquis overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

### Pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its metabolites in relation to CYP2D6 genotype [^114BG5eP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, it was shown in vitro that the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 mediates O-demethylation of diltiazem. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its major metabolites in healthy human volunteers representing different CYP2D6 genotypes.

- **Methods**: Norwegians of Caucasian origin were screened for their CYP2D6 genotype on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by melting-curve analysis of allele-specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes hybridized to polymerase chain reaction-amplified deoxyribonucleic acid. The first five individuals identified with genotypes corresponding to a homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive, or homozygous poor CYP2D6-metabolizing phenotype, respectively, were voluntarily enrolled in the pharmacokinetic study. The participants received diltiazem, 120 mg, as a single oral dose, and plasma samples were collected up to 24 hours after administration. Plasma samples were purified by solid-phase extraction, and diltiazem along with seven phase I metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

- **Results**: The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem was not significantly different between the subgroups. However, the systemic exposure of the pharmacologically active metabolites desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem was greater than or equal to five times higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers than in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: CYP2D6 activity does not have a major impact on the disposition of diltiazem. In contrast, desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem show significantly higher systemic exposure in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, highlighting the importance of genotype in drug metabolism.

### Apixaban to prevent recurrence after cryptogenic stroke in patients with atrial cardiopathy: The ARCADIA randomized clinical trial [^113pEXH6]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

The ARCADIA study, published in 2024 by Hooman Kamel and colleagues in the journal JAMA, focused on acute ischemic stroke. The trial investigated the role of apixaban in patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without atrial fibrillation (AF). It was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), including a population of 1,015 patients (551 female, 464 male).

Inclusion criteria were patients with cryptogenic stroke and evidence of atrial cardiopathy without AF, occurring within 180 days of stroke. Key exclusion criteria included a major-risk cardioembolic source, any history of AF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 30%, definite indication or contraindication to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, history of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and clinically significant bleeding diathesis.

- **Interventions**:
	- 507 patients received apixaban (an oral dose of 5 mg or 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin placebo).
	- 508 patients received aspirin (an oral dose of 81 mg once daily plus apixaban placebo).

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was no significant difference in stroke recurrence (4.4% vs. 4.4%; HR 1, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.55).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (4.1% vs. 4.4%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.44).
	- No significant difference in recurrence of stroke or death from any cause (7.3% vs.…).

### The role of the laboratory in treatment with new oral anticoagulants [^111GpvGB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Orally active small molecules that selectively and specifically inhibit coagulation serine proteases have been developed for clinical use. Dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are given at fixed doses and do not require monitoring. In most circumstances, these drugs have predictable bioavailability, pharmacokinetic effects, and pharmacodynamic effects. However, there will be clinical circumstances when assessment of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs will be required.

The effect of these drugs on laboratory tests has been determined in vitro by spiking normal samples with a known concentration of active compound or ex vivo by using plasma samples from volunteers and patients. Data on the sensitivity of different reagents are now available, and so guidance as to the effect and interpretation of a test result is now possible. Laboratories should be aware of the sensitivity of their own assays to each drug. This may be achieved by using appropriate calibrated plasma samples.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^114ptydy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The ARTESIA study, published by Jeff S. Healey and colleagues in 2024 in the journal New England Journal of Medicine, focuses on atrial fibrillation. The trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with subclinical AF? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 4012 patients (1447 females, 2565 males).

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with subclinical AF lasting 6 minutes to 24 hours.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Clinical AF, mechanical valve prosthesis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), recent pulmonary embolism (PE), or any other condition requiring treatment with an anticoagulant; contraindication to apixaban or aspirin; pregnancy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Apixaban group**: n = 2015, administered at a dose of 5 mg twice daily (BID).
	- **Aspirin group**: n = 1997, administered at a daily dose of 81 mg.

- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in stroke or systemic embolism was noted (0.78% per patient-year vs. 1.24% per patient-year; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism (1.17% per patient-year vs. 1.56% per patient-year; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1).
	- No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.52% per patient-year vs. 0.59% per patient-year; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.4).
	- No significant difference in death (5.06% per patient-year vs. 4.82% per patient-year; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.21).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in fatal bleeding.
	- Significant difference in major bleeding (1.71% per patient-year vs. 0.94% per patient-year).

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^115dkaES]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although no laboratory monitoring is needed for new anticoagulants, the measurement of their activity is required in special clinical situations. Standardized tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran, which allow the measurement of the patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg per mL of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations. The influence of the new anticoagulants on coagulation assays has been determined. Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported, and a severe coagulopathy was found in these patients (prolonged PT and aPTT, increased drug concentration in plasma). These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship of assay results with bleeding or thrombotic complications. Pros and cons of laboratory measurements are discussed.

The manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs.

A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics include:

1. **Eligibility for NOACs**: Criteria for patient selection.
2. **Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs**: Guidelines for initiating and monitoring therapy.
3. **Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake**: Strategies to enhance compliance.
4. **Switching between anticoagulant regimens**: Protocols for transitioning between therapies.
5. **Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs**: Understanding metabolism and interaction with other medications.

The list continues with detailed guidance for each clinical scenario…

### The X factor: Lack of bleeding after an acute apixaban overdose [^116T5vLb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We present an acute apixaban overdose case without reported coingestants; it is the first such case report associated with multiple serum drug levels to assist in determining overdose kinetics. A 62-year-old female presented to an emergency department (ED) 2 hours after ingesting sixty 5 mg tablets (5 mg/kg) of her spouse's apixaban medication. She denied coingestants and did not take her prescribed medications that day. Her vital signs were normal, and she denied symptoms. Chemistry and hematology labs were unremarkable. Plasma apixaban concentrations were 2765.6 ng/ml at 14 hours post ingestion with a non-linear half-life. There was no utilization of blood products or factor replacement. There was never any bleeding, and her hemoglobin did not decrease. This case demonstrates that a single ingestion of apixaban can occur without any complications occurring.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) — are anticoagulation pharmacotherapy used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. DOACs are categorized into two main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (i.e. dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in the subsequent years.

DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or non-inferiority to prior standards of care, such as anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; e.g. warfarin) or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can be too cumbersome for practical use.

### Clinical and pharmacological effects of apixaban dose adjustment in the ARISTOTLE trial [^114Xcg4W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, patients with atrial fibrillation and ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl [133 μmol/l]) were randomized to receive apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or warfarin.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of apixaban dose adjustment on clinical and pharmacological outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients receiving the correct dose of the study drug were included (n = 18,073). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin on population pharmacokinetics, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (PF1+2), and clinical outcomes was compared with the standard dose (5 mg twice daily).

- **Results**: Patients receiving apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily exhibited lower apixaban exposure (median area under the concentration time curve at a steady state 2,720 ng/ml vs. 3,599 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) than those receiving the standard dose. In patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria, reductions in D-dimers (p interaction = 0.20) and PF1+2 (p interaction = 0.55) were consistent with those observed in the standard-dose population. Patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (n = 751) were at higher risk for stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause death than the standard-dose population (0 or 1 dose-adjustment criterion, n = 17,322). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin in the ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria population was consistent with the standard dose in the reductions in stroke or systemic embolism.
