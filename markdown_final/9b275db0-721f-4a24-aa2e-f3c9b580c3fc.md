## Question

Hypertryglyceridemia insulin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and insulin, including pathophysiology, acute management, and guideline-based care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and severity thresholds for hypertriglyceridemia. Then, I should verify the bidirectional relationship between insulin resistance and triglycerides. Next, I will examine hepatic VLDL overproduction and clearance defects, followed by the role of apoC-III and selective hepatic insulin resistance. After that, I need to review acute management of triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, including insulin infusion and alternatives like therapeutic plasma exchange. Finally, I will align chronic management with ADA and AACE guidelines and close with a concise synthesis and practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definitions and severity cut points because management hinges on these thresholds. Hypertriglyceridemia is generally defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, with moderate 200–999 mg/dL, severe ≥ 1000 mg/dL, and very severe > 2000 mg/dL, noting that pancreatitis risk rises progressively and becomes clinically important around ≥ 1000 mg/dL, though some data suggest risk begins to increase even at lower levels, so I should keep that nuance in mind [^112anW1F] [^1135617H] [^116smTsW].

> Now, I need to check the bidirectional relationship between insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin resistance drives hepatic VLDL overproduction and impairs clearance, causing hypertriglyceridemia, while elevated triglycerides and their lipolysis products can worsen insulin resistance and β-cell function, creating a vicious cycle. However, Mendelian randomization suggests circulating triglycerides per se may not be causal for type 2 diabetes, implying that much of the association is secondary to insulin resistance rather than a primary causal role for triglycerides, so I should be careful not to overstate causality [^112XQtyb] [^113py54K] [^113fQJsr] [^111qATYp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the hepatic mechanisms next. In insulin-resistant states, insulin fails to suppress hepatic glucose production but continues to stimulate lipogenesis, a selective hepatic insulin resistance that increases VLDL-TG secretion. Concurrently, impaired insulin signaling reduces apoB degradation, further augmenting VLDL output, while increased fatty acid flux from adipose tissue supplies substrate for hepatic triglyceride synthesis, all of which amplify hypertriglyceridemia [^112XQtyb] [^114zaAjo] [^113c8aZt].

> I will now examine clearance defects and apoC-III, because overproduction alone does not fully explain severe hypertriglyceridemia. Elevated apoC-III inhibits lipoprotein lipase, slows clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and promotes remnant accumulation; in obesity and insulin resistance, LPL responsiveness to insulin is blunted, and although total LPL activity may appear increased, it is relatively inadequate for the triglyceride load, leading to impaired clearance and persistence of hypertriglyceridemia [^117QuQdY] [^1175tdr8] [^113NnyQF].

> Wait, let me verify the role of selective insulin resistance more explicitly. Experimental models and human data show that when hepatic insulin signaling is completely blocked, hyperglycemia occurs without hypertriglyceridemia, whereas selective loss of insulin's suppressive effects on gluconeogenesis with preserved lipogenic signaling yields both hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, reinforcing that preserved or exaggerated insulin action on lipid pathways in the face of impaired glucose control is central to the dyslipidemia phenotype [^114avuTc] [^113c8aZt].

> Next, I should review acute management of triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and I need to be cautious about insulin infusion. Initially, I thought routine insulin infusion is recommended for all severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis, but wait, I should double-check guideline nuance; the Endocrine Society advises against routine insulin infusion in triglyceride-induced pancreatitis without diabetes, whereas insulin is appropriate when diabetes is present to achieve glycemic control, and if insulin is used off-label for its lipoprotein lipase–activating effect, it should be low-dose with close glucose monitoring to avoid hypoglycemia and rebound lipogenesis from dextrose infusions [^116oHKwx] [^113BjHV6] [^111qQbrA].

> Let me consider the magnitude and timing of triglyceride lowering with insulin, and I should confirm comparative data. Observational cohorts report roughly 40–68% triglyceride decline within 24 hours of intravenous insulin, with faster and larger declines when combined with fasting, though a nonrandomized comparison did not show superiority of insulin over fasting alone; therapeutic plasma exchange achieves faster triglyceride reduction, about 70% within 24 hours, but high-quality randomized data are pending, so selection between strategies should be individualized based on severity, trajectory, pregnancy, and local expertise [^113BjHV6] [^112z52Dg] [^115Mm3uo] [^115p9qV5].

> I should confirm chronic management principles now. For triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, prioritize pancreatitis risk reduction with a very low-fat diet, address secondary causes, and initiate pharmacotherapy such as fibrates and high-dose EPA omega-3s; for triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL, focus on ASCVD risk reduction with statins, lifestyle therapy, and consider icosapent ethyl if triglycerides remain 135–499 mg/dL on statin with ASCVD risk factors; throughout, optimize glycemic control because improving insulin action lowers triglycerides, and use structured nutrition patterns that reduce refined carbohydrates and alcohol while aligning with overall caloric goals [^1179LXZ5] [^1168ffWd] [^115JUt2M] [^111BCJYt].

> But wait, what about the role of insulin therapy itself in chronic management? I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. Insulin improves dyslipidemia primarily by correcting hyperglycemia and reducing lipolysis, thereby lowering VLDL production; in diabetes care plans, insulin is used as needed for glycemic control, while adjuncts like fibrates and omega-3s are added specifically for triglyceride lowering, and agents that promote weight loss or are weight-neutral are preferred when feasible to mitigate insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia [^115KEEar] [^1168ffWd].

> Let me synthesize the key relationships succinctly, and I should double-check that I'm not overstating any link. Hypertriglyceridemia in insulin-resistant states reflects a combination of hepatic VLDL overproduction driven by selective insulin signaling, impaired clearance due to apoC-III–mediated LPL inhibition, and increased fatty acid flux; insulin therapy lowers triglycerides mainly via glycemic control and reduced lipolysis, while acute insulin infusion can accelerate triglyceride decline in selected pancreatitis cases but is not routinely recommended without diabetes; guideline-directed care stratifies by triglyceride level, addresses secondary causes, and deploys fibrates and omega-3s for severe elevations alongside lifestyle and statin-based ASCVD risk management [^112XQtyb] [^117QuQdY] [^116oHKwx] [^1179LXZ5] [^1168ffWd].

> Finally, I should confirm practical takeaways. Always screen for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, medications, and alcohol; use fasting triglycerides for diagnosis and monitoring; in severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis, coordinate endocrinology and gastroenterology for insulin versus apheresis decisions; and in chronic care, pair nutrition therapy with pharmacotherapy and glycemic optimization to durably lower triglycerides and reduce both pancreatitis and ASCVD risk [^116R8cNS] [^111BCJYt] [^115Mm3uo].

Hypertriglyceridemia and insulin are linked through **insulin resistance** [^112XQtyb] and **selective hepatic insulin resistance** [^113c8aZt], which drive hepatic VLDL overproduction and impaired clearance, causing hypertriglyceridemia [^112Vbqxj]. Hypertriglyceridemia worsens insulin resistance via lipotoxicity and inflammation [^112EoRV8], creating a vicious cycle [^112Yoeyt]. Insulin therapy lowers triglycerides by **suppressing lipolysis** and **enhancing LPL activity** [^115KEEar] [^1123hmHv] [^1175tdr8], but routine insulin infusion is not recommended for hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis without diabetes [^116oHKwx] [^111qQbrA]. Management focuses on **glycemic control** [^1168ffWd], lifestyle changes, and triglyceride-lowering drugs [^1132spPP]; insulin is reserved for diabetes or acute pancreatitis with severe hyperglycemia [^111qQbrA].

## Pathophysiological relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and insulin

### Insulin resistance and hepatic VLDL overproduction

In insulin resistance, **selective hepatic insulin resistance** [^113c8aZt] preserves lipogenesis while impairing glucose control, increasing VLDL production and hypertriglyceridemia [^112XQtyb]. Hyperinsulinemia further stimulates hepatic triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion, worsening hypertriglyceridemia [^116KZuvS].

---

### Impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins

Insulin resistance reduces **LPL activity** [^1175tdr8], slowing clearance of VLDL and chylomicrons and raising triglycerides [^113NnyQF]. Elevated apoC-III in insulin resistance inhibits LPL and remnant uptake, further impairing clearance [^117QuQdY].

---

### Hypertriglyceridemia-induced insulin resistance

Elevated triglycerides and NEFAs cause **lipotoxicity** [^113y7Ydt], impairing insulin signaling and worsening insulin resistance [^113py54K]. Inflammation from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins further impairs insulin action [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of hypertriglyceridemia in insulin resistance

- **Increased cardiovascular risk**: Hypertriglyceridemia with insulin resistance raises ASCVD risk via atherogenic lipoproteins and inflammation [^115r8FA3].

- **Pancreatitis risk**: Severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dL) increases pancreatitis risk, especially with insulin resistance [^1135617H].

- **Worsening glycemic control**: Hypertriglyceridemia impairs insulin action, worsening hyperglycemia and diabetes progression [^113JpWei].

---

## Role of insulin therapy in managing hypertriglyceridemia

### Mechanisms of insulin-mediated triglyceride lowering

- **Suppression of lipolysis**: Insulin reduces adipose lipolysis, lowering NEFAs and hepatic VLDL synthesis [^1123hmHv].

- **Enhancement of LPL activity**: Insulin upregulates LPL, improving clearance of VLDL and chylomicrons [^1175tdr8].

- **Reduction of hepatic VLDL secretion**: Insulin suppresses hepatic VLDL secretion, lowering triglycerides [^112b5XrA].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting insulin therapy

In acute settings, **intravenous insulin** lowers triglycerides by 40–68% within 24 hours in hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis [^113BjHV6]. For chronic management, **improving glycemic control** with insulin reduces triglycerides in diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia [^115KEEar].

---

### Limitations and risks of insulin therapy

- **Hypoglycemia**: Insulin can cause hypoglycemia, especially with high doses or in renal impairment [^111qQbrA].

- **Weight gain**: Insulin may increase weight, worsening insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia [^notfound].

- **Not routinely recommended**: Insulin infusion is not recommended for hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis without diabetes [^116oHKwx] [^111qQbrA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dL) | - Lifestyle changes <br/> - Fibrates <br/> - Omega-3 fatty acids <br/> - Glycemic control if diabetic [^1132spPP] [^1168ffWd] |
| Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis without diabetes | - Avoid routine insulin infusion <br/> - Use supportive care and triglyceride-lowering therapy [^116oHKwx] [^111qQbrA] |
| Hypertriglyceridemia with diabetes | - Optimize glycemic control <br/> - Consider insulin therapy if indicated <br/> - Add triglyceride-lowering agents as needed [^1168ffWd] |

---

## Conclusion

Hypertriglyceridemia and insulin are interlinked through insulin resistance and hepatic VLDL overproduction, with a bidirectional relationship that worsens metabolic outcomes. Insulin therapy can lower triglycerides by suppressing lipolysis and enhancing clearance, but it is not routinely recommended for hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis without diabetes. Management should prioritize **glycemic control**, lifestyle changes, and triglyceride-lowering drugs, reserving insulin for diabetes or acute pancreatitis with severe hyperglycemia.

Triglyceride-induced pancreatitis without diabetes — In patients without diabetes who have TG-induced pancreatitis, we suggest against the routine use of insulin infusion; when uncontrolled diabetes is present, insulin therapy should be used to normalize glucose levels. Evidence notes there is little data to support the use of insulin infusion in TG-induced pancreatitis, and the use of high doses of insulin, such as the amounts routinely used for diabetic ketoacidosis (> 0.1 units/kg), increases the risk of acute hypoglycemia; when used with concomitant glucose infusion to prevent hypoglycemia, it is likely to lead to carbohydrate-induced increase in TG production, which would be counterproductive.

### The role of apheresis and insulin therapy in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis-a concise review [^113BjHV6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Reported lowering of triglycerides in cohorts using intravenous insulin was 40–68% within the first 24 h. As decline in triglycerides after the initiation of fasting and other therapies is exponential and thus dependent on the baseline values, expressing it as % of baseline value seems appropriate. A comparison of non-intensive and intensive insulin therapy showed similar therapeutic efficacy and also a similar incidence of hypoglycemic events. Therefore, low-dose insulin seems to be easier to use, unless there is severe hyperglycemia present. There is only one non-randomized study comparing insulin therapy with fasting-only, which did not show a more rapid decline in triglycerides with insulin. Therefore, there is currently no evidence that insulin is more effective than fasting alone.

### Effects of hypertriglyceridemia with or without NEFA elevation on β-cell function and insulin clearance and sensitivity [^1149Kbpf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of this study was to distinguish the effects of triglycerides alone or triglycerides and NEFAs on glucose tolerance and its key determinants, namely insulin sensitivity, secretion, and clearance. To this end, we infused a 20% triglyceride emulsion (Intralipid) with and without heparin in 2 groups of healthy individuals at rates calculated to reproduce the high physiological triglyceride levels that can be observed in the general population without diabetes. Both infusions similarly reduced oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and insulin clearance. Isolated hypertriglyceridemia had opposite effects on insulin secretion, impairing β-cell glucose sensitivity and increasing potentiation, which were abolished by a concomitant rise in NEFA.

Since the seminal work by Randle and coworkers, the prevailing concept has been that excess NEFAs induce insulin resistance due to substrate competition at the level of the skeletal muscle that is evident in condition of hyperinsulinemia. Given that most subsequent studies in humans have used the combination of hyperinsulinemia and Intralipid infusion with heparin, the effect of triglycerides per se on fasting insulin sensitivity and secretion has been overlooked. In the present study, the infusion of lipids did not significantly affect plasma glucose values or insulin sensitivity under fasting conditions, while ISR and plasma insulin levels were increased only when both triglycerides and NEFA were raised. Under physiologic conditions, postabsorptive plasma glucose levels are sustained by endogenous glucose production (EGP) from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In subjects with normal hepatic insulin sensitivity, an enhanced ISR should suppress EGP and lower plasma glucose. Here, during I + H infusion the increased ISR was not associated with changes in plasma glucose concentration. This finding may indicate a direct stimulatory action of NEFAs on the β-cell (not mediated by hyperglycemia) that counterbalances the concomitant primary increase in EGP driven by a larger substrate (glycerol) and energy (NEFA) availability. With regard to the mechanisms, β-cells express the G-protein–coupled receptor 40 (GPR-40), also known as free fatty acid receptor 1, which is activated by medium- and long-chain NEFAs to acutely enhance insulin secretion. There are several lines of evidence suggesting the importance of this receptor in the control of insulin secretion. Human islets from T2D donors have reduced expression of GPR-40 compared with islets from donors without T2D, and there is a positive correlation between glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and GPR-40 expression. Under normal conditions, triglycerides would also be expected to indirectly activate GPR-40 following hydrolysis to NEFAs and glycerol. Furthermore, β-cells express receptors for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, whose triglyceride content and circulating levels correlate with insulin secretion. However, there is a 5.5-fold concentration gradient between plasma and interstitial fluid in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels, and sustained hypertriglyceridemia has been associated to reduced activity of the lipoprotein lipase, a rate-limiting enzyme that hydrolyzes circulating triglycerides.

### Disordered fat storage and mobilization in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [^113EPJ63]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The primary genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors responsible for causing insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell failure and the precise sequence of events leading to the development of type 2 diabetes are not yet fully understood. Abnormalities of triglyceride storage and lipolysis in insulin-sensitive tissues are an early manifestation of conditions characterized by insulin resistance and are detectable before the development of postprandial or fasting hyperglycemia. Increased free fatty acid (FFA) flux from adipose tissue to nonadipose tissue, resulting from abnormalities of fat metabolism, participates in and amplifies many of the fundamental metabolic derangements that are characteristic of the insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes. It is also likely to play an important role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to fasting hyperglycemia and conversion to frank type 2 diabetes in insulin resistant individuals. Adverse metabolic consequences of increased FFA flux, to be discussed in this review, are extremely wide ranging and include, but are not limited to: 1) dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis, 2) impaired glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver, 3) diminished insulin clearance, aggravating peripheral tissue hyperinsulinemia, and 4) impaired pancreatic beta-cell function. The precise biochemical mechanisms whereby fatty acids and cytosolic triglycerides exert their effects remain poorly understood. Recent studies, however, suggest that the sequence of events may be the following: in states of positive net energy balance, triglyceride accumulation in "fat-buffering" adipose tissue is limited by the development of adipose tissue insulin resistance. This results in diversion of energy substrates to nonadipose tissue, which in turn leads to a complex array of metabolic abnormalities characteristic of insulin-resistant states and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the biochemical mechanisms whereby glucose and fat exert adverse effects in insulin-sensitive and insulin-producing tissues are shared, thus implicating a diabetogenic role for energy excess as a whole. Although there is now evidence that weight loss through reduction of caloric intake and increase in physical activity can prevent the development of diabetes, it remains an open question as to whether specific modulation of fat metabolism will result in improvement in some or all of the above metabolic derangements or will prevent progression from insulin resistance syndrome to type 2 diabetes.

### Mendelian randomization studies do not support a role for raised circulating triglyceride levels influencing type 2 diabetes, glucose levels, or insulin resistance [^111qATYp]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Using a Mendelian randomization approach, our results show strong evidence that higher circulating triglyceride levels do not increase type 2 diabetes risk, fasting glucose, or fasting-based measures of insulin resistance. Our results are consistent with lifelong, raised circulating triglycerides conferring no net harm to the liver or β-cell. Our results suggest that alternative explanations are needed to explain the observational associations between raised triglyceride levels and diabetes and related traits. These explanations could include confounding factors or reverse-direction causal effects (i.e. type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance causing raised triglycerides). Other human genetic studies support the reverse-causation argument. For example, postreceptor defects in insulin resistance caused by AKT mutations result in increased hepatic lipogenesis and increased circulating triglycerides, and polymorphisms near the IRS1 gene that are robustly associated with insulin resistance also result in raised triglycerides (both associations at conventional levels of genome-wide significance, P < 5 × 10⁻⁸).

### The metabolic syndrome or the insulin resistance syndrome? Different names, different concepts, and different goals [^111qCFCT]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The goal of this article is to differentiate the insulin resistance syndrome from the metabolic syndrome. In the case of the insulin resistance syndrome, the abnormalities and clinical syndromes that are increased in prevalence in insulin-resistant individuals have been summarized, with a brief discussion of the causal relationship between insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinemia, and associated consequences. Discussion of the metabolic syndrome has focused on the five criteria chosen by the adult treatment panel III to diagnose the syndrome, evaluating them in terms of their relationship to insulin resistance and their role as cardiovascular disease risk factors.

### The role of apheresis and insulin therapy in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis-a concise review [^112rbNex]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The association between hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and acute pancreatitis (AP) was first described by Speck as early as 1865. HTG is often considered the third most common cause of AP and accounts for about 2–10% of cases in the general population and up to 28–48% of cases during pregnancy, where it is the second most common cause of AP. The overall mortality of AP is low, about 2%, but increases to 15–20% in severe pancreatitis, defined by organ failure persisting beyond 48 h. The reduction of TG with insulin in HTG-AP was first described by Bagdade in 1967 in a patient with deranged diabetes. A decade later, in 1978, Betterige described the first use of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and noted that it was able to reduce TG much faster than insulin. The use of apheresis, either TPE or any form of lipoprotein apheresis, has since often been used in clinical practice to treat HTG-AP, especially in centers with good availability of apheresis, although the evidence for this treatment is still poor and many centers never use it. The use of insulin is often advocated as simple and safe, but also lacks firm evidence. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the role of both treatments for HTG-AP with focus on the possible mechanisms by which TPE could ameliorate the course of HTG-AP.

### World congress on insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease: part 3 [^112d2F5x]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The pattern, then, is one of dysfunctional adipocytes releasing excess fatty acid and cytokines, enhancing hepatic lipogenesis, and contributing to the imbalance between import and export of triglyceride. Hepatic fat is, independent of visceral fat, the driving force for VLDL cholesterol overproduction in this scenario, with hypertriglyceridemia caused by a dual metabolic defect of overproduction of large VLDL particles due to excess hepatic fat coupled with impaired clearance driven by increased apoC-3. Taskinen wondered whether apoC-3 measurement might be useful in determining cardiometabolic risk.

Sam Klein (St. Louis, MO) further discussed the relationship of liver fat to lipoprotein metabolism, underscoring the powerful effect of weight loss and comparing metabolically normal and abnormal forms of obesity. The major metabolic complications of obesity — insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and NAFLD — all are CVD risk factors. Obesity-related metabolic dysfunction involves fatty acid and adipokines released from both subcutaneous and visceral fat, which, if not oxidized or secreted as VLDL cholesterol, lead to increased hepatic fat. Klein reviewed studies suggesting that the notion of a particularly adverse effect of visceral fat "may not be so true". Not all obese individuals have metabolic abnormalities. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study, 30% of obese individuals were metabolically normal. Hepatic fat is, however, strongly associated with metabolic dysfunction, correlating with insulin resistance at the levels of liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. When individuals with hypo-β-lipoproteinemia are compared with individuals with NAFLD, with similar intrahepatic triglyceride, the former have greater insulin sensitivity, implying that intrahepatic triglyceride may not itself be the mediator of insulin resistance. Lean women have higher VLDL triglyceride production than men at rates similar to those of obese women, and at any BMI level women have more fat than men, but triglyceride levels remain normal because of higher clearance rates. The VLDL triglyceride secretion in NAFLD reflects triglyceride derived from peripheral fat stores and from de novo lipogenesis rather than from circulating fatty acid per se. Klein pointed out the curvilinear relationship between intrahepatic fat and hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion so that when liver fat exceeds 10% of liver mass there is no further increase in triglyceride secretion, leading to further hepatic triglyceride accumulation. In his studies of individuals with NAFLD, apoB secretion is not increased to as great an extent as VLDL triglyceride, leading to triglyceride enrichment of nascent VLDL particles. Indeed, transgenic mice overexpressing sterol regulatory element binding protein 1A have VLDL particles so large that they appear to have difficulty escaping the endoplasmic reticulum.

### Role of therapeutic plasma exchange in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia: an experience [^116gsMgw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes mellitus are highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a rare but well known cause of acute pancreatitis. In treatment pancreatic rest, lifestyle changes, and lipid-lowering medications are essential, but the response is slow. Recently the role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been stressed for fast and effective management in addition to insulin and heparin infusion. TPE for hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis resulted in drastic improvements in clinical and laboratory findings and patient outcomes as suggested in our cases. However, this procedure is limited due to its high cost and availability only in specialized hospitals.

### The role of increased liver triglyceride content: a culprit of diabetic hyperglycaemia? [^112v7wAi]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The role of fat in the aetiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has been re-considered in the present review. This is because of the questions raised by recent created mouse models imitating human lipodystrophy diabetes. It appears that hepatic steatosis, which is shared by both lipodystrophy and most if not all obesity patients, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes despite the fact that lipodystrophy is an extreme state and occurs more rarely than obesity. The possible link between lipid and glucose metabolisms via peroxisome activity has been examined and its role in determining hyperglycaemia is suggested. Moreover, new avenues towards a better understanding of insulin resistance at the genomic level have also been proposed. It appears that one of the most fundamental biological phenomena, fuel selection, may underlie the causes of diabetic hyperglycaemia and perplex the role of fat in the aetiology of insulin resistance.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^112EoRV8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, as one of the components of the MS, is closely related to a constellation of metabolic risk factors including a central distribution of adiposity or visceral obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, and high TG and/or low HDL-C, associated with an atherogenic, procoagulant, and proinflammatory state.

One could thought that TG are not directly involved in the development of atherosclerotic lesions because FFA released from TG by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) act either as an active energy source or stored energy reserve. However, there are several plausible mechanisms by which FFA might cause CV disease and death. Furthermore, an increase in plasma FFA leads to endothelial activation, inflammation and thrombosis which may initiate early vascular abnormalities that promote atherosclerosis. Elevation of plasma FFA, in addition to producing peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance, also activates the proinflammatory NFκB pathway resulting in increased hepatic expression of several proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL1-β, IL6, matrix metalloproteinases and an increase in circulating MCP-1, supporting the notion that FFA is an important link between hypertriglyceridemia and the development of inflammatory changes. Moreover, elevated plasma FFA levels, via producing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, promote a state of increased tendency for thrombosis and decreased ability to fibrinolysis. Together, this substantially increases the risk for acute atherothrombotic events.

Therefore, elevated FFA are not only an independent risk factor for the development of T2DM, but also give rise to metabolic derangements in organs such as the liver and pancreas. Hypertriglyceridemia, FFAs overload and lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues influence both insulin action and insulin secretion and are frequently associated with IR and the development of T2DM. However the role of FFAs extends beyond their ability to induce or exacerbate insulin resistance: they may contribute directly to the deterioration of beta cell function that accompanies the development of diabetes. Both acute stimulatory and long-term detrimental effects of FFAs overloading on pancreatic beta-cell have long been recognized. Chronic exposure of the pancreatic beta-cell to FFA results in desensitization and suppression of secretion (lipotoxicity) as a consequence of TG accumulation in the islets of Langerhans.

Role of IR isoforms and IGF-IR in VSMC migration in an experimental model of atherosclerosis

To assess the role of IR isoforms and IGF-IR in experimental atherosclerosis, we used ApoE −/− mice at 8, 12, 18 and 24 weeks of age. This model showed hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia at all weeks of age without alterations in body weight, glucose or insulin plasma levels (see Table 1).

Table 1
Characterization of an experimental model of atherosclerosis

Male ApoE −/− mice were fed with Western type diet since 6 week of age for 2 weeks (control and ApoE −/− at 8 weeks of age), 6 weeks (control and ApoE −/− at 12 weeks of age), 12 weeks (control and ApoE −/− at 18 weeks of age) or 18 weeks (control and ApoE −/− at 24 weeks of age). We measured the body weight, BAT (mg)/BW (g), WAT (mg)/BW (g), glucose, insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides plasma levels the same day of sacrifice in fasted mice. ApoE −/− mice at all weeks of age showed hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and the other parameters with no significant differences in relation to each their controls

### Risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia: a review of real-world evidence [^115r8FA3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Residual cardiovascular (CV) risk in statin‐treated patients persists despite control of LDL cholesterol. 1 Other atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins, such as triglycerides (TGs) and TG‐rich lipoproteins (TRLs), are also likely causal and prognostic factors as well as potential treatment targets in atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). 1, 2 The biological plausibility of elevated TG and TRL levels as factors in residual CV risk is supported by epidemiological, genetic and clinical evidence. TG levels correlate with heightened risk for CV events in patients with well‐controlled LDL cholesterol levels on statin therapy. 3 Given that TGs are hydrophobic and do not float freely in plasma but are carried in such TG‐enriched lipoproteins as VLDL, VLDL remnants and intermediate‐density lipoprotein (IDL), the relationships observed probably reflect atherogenic effects exerted by both TGs and TRLs; this is reflected in non‐HDL cholesterol. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 TG‐enriched remnants, which include both small VLDL and IDL, are proinflammatory, induce endothelial dysfunction, and can be isolated from atheromatous plaque. 5, 11

In addition to the direct association between TG levels and CVD risk, elevated TGs also contribute to the atherogenic lipid triad. In patients with elevated TGs, there is typically a reduction in the activity of lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme primarily responsible for hydrolysing TGs in the core of TRL. As TRL levels increase in plasma, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) engages in neutral lipid exchange between TRLs and both LDL cholesterol and HDL particles. CETP catalyses a 1:1 exchange of TGs for cholesterol between TRL and HDL and LDL particles. The LDL and HDL particles become more enriched with TGs and become better substrates for lipolysis by hepatic lipase, which results in increased HDL catabolism (and corresponding reductions in serum levels of this lipoprotein) and the formation of large numbers of smaller, denser LDL particles. This atherogenic lipid triad, consisting of high concentrations of TGs/TRLs, increased numbers of small‐dense LDLs and low levels of HDL, is particularly prevalent in patients with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus and is believed to underlie much of the accelerated atherogenesis in these patients.

### Mendelian randomization studies do not support a role for raised circulating triglyceride levels influencing type 2 diabetes, glucose levels, or insulin resistance [^113fQJsr]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

The causal nature of associations between circulating triglycerides, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes is unclear. We aimed to use Mendelian randomization to test the hypothesis that raised circulating triglyceride levels causally influence the risk of type 2 diabetes and raise normal fasting glucose levels and hepatic insulin resistance.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We tested 10 common genetic variants robustly associated with circulating triglyceride levels against the type 2 diabetes status in 5,637 case and 6,860 control subjects and four continuous outcomes (reflecting glycemia and hepatic insulin resistance) in 8,271 nondiabetic individuals from four studies.

RESULTS

Individuals carrying greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles had increased circulating triglyceride levels (SD 0.59 [95% CI 0.52–0.65] difference between the 20% of individuals with the most alleles and the 20% with the fewest alleles). There was no evidence that the carriers of greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles were at increased risk of type 2 diabetes (per weighted allele odds ratio [OR] 0.99 [95% CI 0.97–1.01]; P = 0.26). In nondiabetic individuals, there was no evidence that carriers of greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles had increased fasting insulin levels (SD 0.00 per weighted allele [95% CI −0.01 to 0.02]; P = 0.72) or increased fasting glucose levels (0.00 [−0.01 to 0.01]; P = 0.88). Instrumental variable analyses confirmed that genetically raised circulating triglyceride levels were not associated with increased diabetes risk, fasting glucose, or fasting insulin and, for diabetes, showed a trend toward a protective association (OR per 1-SD increase in log 10 triglycerides: 0.61 [95% CI 0.45–0.83]; P = 0.002).

CONCLUSIONS

Genetically raised circulating triglyceride levels do not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or raise fasting glucose or fasting insulin levels in nondiabetic individuals. One explanation for our results is that raised circulating triglycerides are predominantly secondary to the diabetes disease process rather than causal.

### Changes in triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may precede peripheral insulin resistance, with 2-h insulin partially mediating this unidirectional relationship: a prospective cohort study [^111w2q11]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Further, we found changes in TG and HDL-C preceded changes in 2-h insulin concentration. The effect of TG/FFA cycle on lipid signaling of β-cells is likely one primary mechanism of these unidirectional relationships. The intermediates within the TG/FFA cycle can increase insulin secretion in β-cells through: (1) activating lipases from islet tissue; (2) activating protein kinase C; (3) alteration of membrane physicochemical properties of β-cells. Moreover, FFA forms from hydrolysis of TG can cross β-cell membrane and active β-cell surface fatty acids receptor, which causes an increase in intracellular Ca 2+, leading to increased insulin secretion. In addition, HDL-C regulates insulin secretion through regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in β-cells via ATP-binding cassette transporters. Increased in HDL-C can reduce β-cell cholesterol content in mice with dyslipidemia, which consequently influence β-cell function.

We also found change in 2-h insulin preceded peripheral IR. Catherine Le Stunff et al. showed that early change in postprandial insulin concentration, not in insulin sensitivity, was associated with obesity in early life. This study suggested that postprandial insulin may play an earlier role than peripheral IR in the development of metabolic defects throughout the whole body, further supporting our result in this study. Some mechanisms may also support the result that increased insulin concentration preceded peripheral IR. Increased insulin concentration can cause peripheral IR by mediating its own signaling pathway through: (1) diminishing insulin receptors affinity and insulin receptor's kinase activity, (2) reducing the number of insulin receptors exposed on the cell surface by promoting internalization and degradation of hormone-occupied receptors.

Because the unidirectional relationships from TG and HDL-C to 2-h insulin, and from 2-h insulin to peripheral IR were established in this study, these findings prompted us to hypothesize that 2-h insulin concentration probably played mediating roles in the temporal relationships of TG and HDL-C with peripheral IR. The results of mediation analysis in this study did, in fact, show that 2-h insulin partially mediated the temporal relationships with a 59.3% mediating effect for TG and a 61.0% mediating effect for HDL-C. Moreover, hepatic IR probably influences this mediating effect. Hepatic IR causes the overproduction of VLDL, which results in hypertriglyceridemia. Hypertriglyceridemia probably augments the effect of TG on the peripheral IR and reduces the percentage of mediating effect of 2-h insulin.

### Sphingolipids and phospholipids in insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders [^112aVQzx]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease form a metabolic disease continuum that has seen a dramatic increase in prevalence in developed and developing countries over the past two decades. Dyslipidaemia resulting from hypercaloric diets is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of metabolic disease, and lipid-lowering therapies are the main therapeutic option for this group of disorders. However, the fact that dysfunctional lipid metabolism extends far beyond cholesterol and triglycerides is becoming increasingly clear. Lipidomic studies and mouse models are helping to explain the complex interactions between diet, lipid metabolism and metabolic disease. These studies are not only improving our understanding of this complex biology, but are also identifying potential therapeutic avenues to combat this growing epidemic. This Review examines what is currently known about phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism in the setting of obesity and how metabolic pathways are being modulated for therapeutic effect.

### Apolipoprotein CIII and diabetes. is there a link? [^117QuQdY]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII), a small protein that resides on the surface of lipoprotein particles, is a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism. The inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the increased assembly and secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and the decreased reuptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) by the liver are mechanisms associating elevated serum ApoCIII levels and hypertriglyceridemia. ApoCIII concentration is high in individuals with diabetes mellitus, indicating a possible positive correlation with impairment of glucose metabolism. The aim of this review (based on a Pubmed search until August 2018) is to present the possible mechanisms linking ApoCIII and deterioration of carbohydrate homeostasis. ApoCIII enhances pancreatic β-cells apoptosis via an increase of the cytoplasmic Ca 2+ levels in the insulin-producing cells. In addition, overexpression of ApoCIII enhances non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and exacerbates inflammatory pathways in skeletal muscles, affecting insulin signalling and thereby inducing insulin resistance. Moreover, recent studies reveal a possible mechanism of body weight increase and glucose production through a potential ApoCIII-induced LPL inhibition in the hypothalamus. Also, the presence of ApoCIII on the surface of high-density lipoprotein particles is associated with impairment of their antiglycemic and atheroprotective properties. Modulating ApoCIII may be a potent therapeutic approach to manage hypertriglyceridemia and improve carbohydrate metabolism.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^112Vbqxj]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia — mechanisms emphasize hepatic overproduction and impaired clearance: "In mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, there is typically overproduction of VLDL-TG by the liver". This is "often driven by excessive exposure of hepatocytes to free fatty acids", including from expanded abdominal/visceral adipose tissue and insulin resistance. With high VLDL-TG production, VLDL particles are "enriched with Apo C3 and are Apo E deficient", leading to "impairment of TG clearance by LPL due to inhibition of LPL activity by Apo C3" and reduced hepatic uptake of remnants; consequently, "in most patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia, increased VLDL-TG output by the liver and impaired TG clearance are contributing factors".

### Lipoprotein profiles across a spectrum of insulin signaling [^113Ehe5H]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with insulin resistance (IR), a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In these conditions, IR affects only a subset of insulin signaling pathways, with preserved insulin signaling in others (termed "pathway-selective IR"). Consequently, individuals with obesity and T2D develop both hypertriglyceridemia from excess insulin signaling and hyperglycemia from insufficient insulin signaling.

Objective

As IR involves biology mediated by both increased and decreased insulin signaling, we created a conceptual rare disease model to better understand whether ASCVD risk in states of IR is predominately driven by excessive insulin action, insufficient insulin action, or a combination of both.

Methods

We compared nuclear magnetic resonance lipoprotein profiles (markers of ASCVD risk) in 14 patients (86% female, age 39 ± 17 years) with type B IR (TBIR), a disorder where autoantibodies against the insulin receptor block all insulin signaling (low insulin signaling), which is restored in remission (normal insulin signaling). Age and sex- matched patients with lipodystrophy were included to represent high insulin signaling.

Results

Across the spectrum of insulin signaling, from lowest (TBIR active) to intermediate (TBIR remission) to highest (lipodystrophy), there were increases in all triglyceride-rich lipoprotein parameters. We also observed a shift toward smaller high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, with reciprocal decreases in large HDL-Ps and increases in small HDL-Ps across groups.

Conclusion

Excess insulin signaling contributes to a proatherogenic lipoprotein profile. Interventions that downregulate or rebalance insulin signaling may offer cardiovascular benefits for individuals with severe (lipodystrophy) and mild (obesity and T2D) forms of pathway-selective IR.

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^111wPh5y]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Correlation and discordance of apoB, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C — population data show high correlations yet wide variability at the individual level. It is well-established that there exists discordance in LDL-C and non-HDL-C for any given value of apoB, and United Kingdom data report correlations of ≥ 0.95 between apoB and non-HDL-C at the population level with a slightly lower degree of correlation between apoB and LDL-C, yet wide variation in apoB for any given non-HDL-C or LDL-C value. In NHANES 2005–2016 untreated adults, for a non-HDL-C of 100 mg/dL (~10th percentile), the apoB range covering 95% of values was 52–78 mg/dL (~5–30th percentile), and for a non-HDL-C of 160 mg/dL (~70–80th percentile), 95% of apoB values were 88–112 mg/dL (~40–80th percentile), with similar findings for LDL-C compared to apoB. Conditions such as hypertriglyceridemia, obesity, and insulin resistance can yield lower LDL-C but still elevated apoB levels.

### The role of apheresis and insulin therapy in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis-a concise review [^115p9qV5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis during pregnancy

AP during pregnancy is a rare condition that occurs approximately once in 1,000–10,000 pregnancies and often occurs in the third trimester. Hormonal changes during pregnancy lead to an increase in triglycerides, especially in patients with an underlying disorder of lipid metabolism, making hypertriglyceridemia the second most common cause of AP during pregnancy. An episode of AP in pregnant women not only endangers the life of the mother, but also increases fetal mortality, which is about 11%, but can be as high as 44% in severe AP, as AP of any etiology often requires delivery or termination of pregnancy. The use of medications in limited during pregnancy and TPE should be considered, possibly as a preventive measure in severe hypertriglyceridemia without AP, but especially in the case of HTG-AP, although reports are limited. TPE is well tolerated during pregnancy and complications are rare.

Upcoming randomized trials

There are several randomized controlled trials registered in the WHO clinical trials registry, which plan to recruit patients with (severe) HTG-AP and aim to compare TPE with conservative therapy / insulin or insulin with conservative therapy (see Table 1). The vast majority of registered trials are from China, where apheresis is widely used. It is possible that not all of them are actually active or ever started, as some should have already been completed by now, but they may have been delayed due to the COVID-19 epidemic and their status has not been updated. I believe that the one, which will provide the most definitive data, is the ELEPHANT trial (ISRCTN41530928), which is the biggest, with almost 500 patients planned. Importantly, this trial has TPE, insulin and conservative arms, so it should provide data on both therapies, possibly settling the question of optimal HTG-AP therapy in the near future.

In this prespecified post hoc analysis, we pooled the data of 2 previous studies in subjects with NGT where we experimentally increased circulating triglyceride levels to equally high physiological concentrations by an intravenous infusion of lipids or lipids and heparin. We compared the effects of the 2 infusions on insulin sensitivity, model-derived β-cell function, and insulin clearance, assessed under fasting and postload conditions, to dissect the pathogenetic mechanisms of glucose intolerance induced by mild hypertriglyceridemia from those mediated by a parallel increase in NEFAs, which frequently occurs in the metabolic syndrome.

### Decreased apolipoprotein A5 is implicated in insulin resistance-related hypertriglyceridemia in obesity [^112f3EDW]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is associated insulin resistance in obese people. Recently identified apolipoprotein A5 (apoA5) is involved in triglyceride (TG) metabolism. This study was to investigate the role of apoA5 in insulin resistance-related hypertriglyceridemia in obesity. 682 participants including 340 non-obese individuals and 342 obese individuals were recruited in this study. Plasma apoA5 levels were measured. The insulin resistance in participants was assessed by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). An insulin resistant and hypertriglyceridemic rat model was established by high-fructose diet with obese Zucker rats as positive controls. Besides, two insulin resistant models in vitro were induced by insulin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in HepG2 cells. Obese participants had lower plasma apoA5 levels. Plasma apoA5 levels were inversely correlated with TG, body mass index and HOMA-IR in humans. Furthermore, hepatic and plasma apoA5 reduced in fructose-fed rats whereas no significant changes of apoA5 were observed in obese Zucker rats. In addition, treatment of HepG2 cells with insulin and TNFalpha decreased apoA5 expression and increased TG content. Thus, decreased apolipoprotein A5 is implicated in insulin resistance-related hypertriglyceridemia in obesity.

### Selective versus total insulin resistance: a pathogenic paradox [^114avuTc]. Cell Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Mice with type 2 diabetes manifest selective hepatic insulin resistance: insulin fails to suppress gluconeogenesis but continues to activate lipogenesis, producing the deadly combination of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Biddinger et al.

### The role of apheresis and insulin therapy in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis-a concise review [^1135617H]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis

It is generally believed that triglycerides above 10 mmol/L (equal to 882 mg/dL, but a round value of 1000 mg/dL is usually used in the literature) should be considered a causative factor for AP, although it is well known that very high triglycerides can occur without AP. The 2012 Endocrine Society guidelines only consider very severe HTG (above 2000 mg/dL) as a risk factor for development of pancreatitis. In 2016, a large population study nicely showed that the risk of developing AP actually starts increasing at (non-fasting) triglyceride levels above 2 mmol/L (177 mg/dL). Probably, there is a level at which the future risk of AP starts increasing (as one can expect higher peaks in the future in such a patient due to a metabolic disorder) and another level at which triglycerides actually trigger an episode of AP. From a diagnostic point of view, it should be acknowledged, that triglyceride levels can drop fast with fasting, so the timing of triglyceride measurement in relation to the onset of AP is important.

The pathophysiological mechanisms that trigger an episode of AP in very severe hypertriglyceridemia are not yet fully understood. One of likely mechanisms is formation of chylomicrons, very large lipoprotein particles, in the blood, when triglyceride levels reach 10–20 mmol/L. This results in grossly lipemic serum and increased blood viscosity, inducing and maintaining ischemia in the pancreatic capillary bed. The other likely mechanism is increased formation of free fatty acids (FFA) resulting from hydrolysis of excess triglycerides by pancreatic lipase. When they exceed binding capacity of albumin, FFAs are toxic to the acinar cells and induce inflammation within the pancreas, which increases cytokine levels. FFAs also damage endothelial cells and induce distant organ damage, especially acute lung injury. Furthermore, lipotoxicity may also result from hydrolysis of the adipose tissue surrounding the pancreas in obese patients, resulting in more severe course of AP in obese patients, regardless of AP etiology.

Given involvement of triglycerides and lipotoxicity in aggravation of AP, one would expect severity of hypertriglyceridemia to be related to severity of AP and frequency of systemic complications. Some studies have shown this, but in other large cohorts, triglycerides were not associated with disease severity or mortality. Nevertheless, given their pathogenic role and multiple mechanisms leading to distant organ damage, rapid lowering of triglycerides in HTG-AP is generally considered to be an important treatment goal.

### Short-term triglyceride lowering with fenofibrate improves vasodilator function in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia [^114PpQvy]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of lowering plasma triglycerides (TGs) on endothelial function and gain insight into the role played by free fatty acids (FFAs) in hypertriglyceridemia-associated vascular dysfunction.

Methods and Results

Eleven hypertriglyceridemic subjects without coronary artery disease, diabetes, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tobacco use, or hypertension were studied using a randomized, double-blinded, crossover design (fenofibrate and placebo, 14 days). After each regimen, forearm blood flow was assessed by plethysmography in response to arterial acetylcholine, nitroprusside, and verapamil infusion. Hourly plasma TGs, FFA, glucose, and insulin were measured during a 24-hour feeding cycle to characterize the metabolic environment. Changes in plasma FFA after intravenous heparin were used to estimate typical FFA accumulation in the luminal endothelial microenvironment. Fenofibrate lowered plasma TG (P < 0.001), total cholesterol (P < 0.01), and apolipoprotein B (P < 0.01) without altering high-density lipoprotein or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Forearm blood flow in response to acetylcholine (P < 0.0001), nitroprusside (P < 0.001), and verapamil (P < 0.0001) improved after fenofibrate. Fenofibrate lowered 24-hour (P < 0.0001) and post-heparin (P < 0.001) TG and tended to lower 24-hour (P = 0.054) and post-heparin (P = 0.028) FFA.

Conclusions

Vascular smooth muscle function significantly improves after lowering plasma TG without changes in confounding lipoproteins or insulin resistance. The data raise additional questions regarding the role of FFA in hypertriglyceridemia-associated vascular dysfunction.

### World congress on insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease: part 3 [^116SPJUa]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Taskinen discussed a study of obese hyper- versus normotriglyceridemic individuals, both with similar visceral fat but the former with higher liver fat, in association with elevated plasma triglyceride and apoB-100 and reduced HDL cholesterol and LDL peak size. VLDL1 triglyceride and apoB production rates were similarly increased in those with hypertriglyceridemia, and the two measures showed strong correlation. Liver fat content, then, correlates closely with VLDL1 triglyceride and apoB secretion rates and is its major driver. Taskinen observed that hepatic fat, although correlated with plasma triglyceride, only explains a portion of hypertriglyceridemia, with decreased triglyceride clearance being a crucial additional factor, suggesting that "dual mechanisms are required to produce hypertriglyceridemia in obesity".

Taskinen amplified Krauss's discussion of the critical role of apoC-3 in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. It is synthesized by the liver and gut and circulates mainly on VLDL and HDL particles. ApoC-3 inhibits LPL, playing a critical role in triglyceride hydrolysis and hence in VLDL cholesterol clearance, with elevated apoC-3 common in insulin resistant states such as obesity and hypertriglyceridemia. There is strong negative correlation between apoC-3 and the VLDL cholesterol catabolic rate, whereas hepatic fat moderately correlates with apoC-3. Acute elevation of fatty acid levels increases the apoC-3 production rate in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and, when central obese men are compared with nonobese men, the former have increased VLDL apoC-3 and VLDL apoB production rates.

### Comparison of various steady state surrogate insulin resistance indices in diagnosing metabolic syndrome [^116DeNHL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

The most determined and least clinically utilized role of lipid metabolism in relationship with insulin resistance needs definitive clinical translation. Nor only that lipids, and in specific triglycerides expands the lipid stores/fat deposition through stimulation of lipoprotein lipase but also causes increase in lipolysis leading to hypertriglyceridemia. The criteria of metabolic syndrome already acknowledges there but most of the reviewed data does not incorporate the effect of lipids in mathematical equations of surrogate insulin resistance biomarkers. Some studies have indirectly included lipids, especially triglycerides in association with other biochemical parameters to generate valuable new mathematical indicators for insulin resistance, albeit with differing results. Why not insulin with triglycerides? The authors feel that this aspect has to be considered in relation with in vogue steady state clinical biomarkers in some way.

Considering multiple steady-state insulin resistance biomarkers we decided to compare them through ROC curve analysis. We also decided to study the concordance between these steady state markers. We also planned to correlate these steady-state insulin resistance indices for glycated hemoglobin, anthropometric and lipid indices.

### The mechanism of HDL lowering in hypertriglyceridemic, insulin-resistant States [^112z6tCK]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia and reduced plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) are the most frequent forms of dyslipidemia observed in insulin-resistant states, such as obesity, impaired fasting glucose, and Type 2 diabetes, and are highly atherogenic in these settings. The hypertriglyceridemia of insulin resistance is primarily due to an overproduction of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and in some instances, is also due to reduced VLDL clearance and postprandial accumulation of VLDL, chylomicrons, and their remnants [i.e., triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins]. TG-rich lipoproteins actively exchange their core lipids with HDL in vivo, a process that is facilitated by cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer protein (CETP), and in hypertriglyceridemic states, this process is enhanced. This results in TG enrichment of HDL in hypertriglyceridemic states. There is accumulating evidence that TG enrichment of HDL plays an important role in determining the rate at which HDL particles are cleared from the circulation. Here, we review the evidence that TG-enriched HDL, when modulated by lipolytic enzymes in the circulation, are catabolized more rapidly than native HDL, and may ultimately explain the lowering of HDL-c in insulin-resistant, hypertriglyceridemic states. Since we have recently reviewed in detail the evidence by Lamarche et al. [Clin. Chim. Acta 286 (1999) 145; J. Clin. Invest. 103 (8) (1999) 1191.] to support this hypothesis, in the present brief review, we will focus predominantly on our own recent research in this area.

### Should we treat moderately elevated triglycerides? Yes… [^113vHb65]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

At values greater than 500 mg per dL, triglycerides may cause pancreatitis. At lower values, especially with normal lipid subfractions, the risk of hypertriglyceridemia is not clear. Patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia do not appear to have higher cardiovascular risk. However, patients with abnormal triglyceride values typically have other lipid derangements, such as high levels of low-density lipoprotein and low levels of high-density lipoprotein. Additionally, patients with hypertriglyceridemia often have metabolic syndrome, which is a risk factor for developing coronary heart disease. Treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia should begin immediately to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Usually, a fibrate is tried first with therapeutic lifestyle changes.

Treatment of modest hypertriglyceridemia should begin with therapeutic lifestyle changes and a search for underlying causes or contributing factors, such as obesity, hypothyroidism, or diabetes. If triglycerides remain elevated, the NCEP-ATP III guidelines recommend treating the LDL cholesterol first, and then the non-HDL cholesterol to reach goals based on the patient's Framingham risk assessment. Drug therapy in these cases should begin with a statin, which should be titrated accordingly. Combination therapy with a fibrate should follow if needed. There are no specific guidelines from the NCEP-ATP III about treating isolated moderate hypertriglyceridemia. However, if the triglyceride level remains elevated once LDL and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations are normalized, it may be worthwhile to pursue further triglyceride-lowering treatment, especially in high-risk patients with CHD or type 2 diabetes.

In the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 trial of patients after acute coronary syndrome, a final triglyceride level less than 150 mg per dL was associated with a 27 percent relative reduction in coronary events.

### Effects of hypertriglyceridemia with or without NEFA elevation on β-cell function and insulin clearance and sensitivity [^113py54K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The natural history of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is typically characterized by an early increase in insulin availability due to elevated insulin production and reduced insulin clearance, coupled with a parallel reduction in insulin responsiveness. The biological mechanisms responsible for maintaining chronic hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in the absence of significant hyperglycemia remain largely unknown. Key features of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome are hypertriglyceridemia and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Mounting evidence suggests that elevated triglycerides and NEFAs are not innocent bystanders in the context of the metabolic syndrome but may further exacerbate insulin resistance and the attendant metabolic dysregulation (reviewed in). On the other hand, the effects of excess lipid availability on insulin secretion and clearance are still debated.

Most prior human studies focused primarily on the metabolic consequences of increased NEFA availability during infusion of both lipid emulsions and heparin, the latter to activate the conversion of the infused triglycerides into NEFAs and glycerol. Acute and chronic elevation of plasma NEFA concentration consistently induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, acute NEFA elevation had a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion, while prolonged NEFA elevation impaired glucose-stimulated β-cell function, particularly in subjects without diabetes. Few available studies focused specifically on the effects of triglyceride elevations by employing low-grade lipid infusions without heparin. Acute hypertriglyceridemia induced by a single lipid bolus did not alter the mean blood glucose or insulin response to oral glucose in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). However, low-grade Intralipid infusion induced insulin resistance, impaired β-cell function, and reduced insulin clearance in the long-term. A single available study comparing the metabolic effects of lipid vs lipid plus heparin infusions demonstrated the potentiating effect of supraphysiological hypertriglyceridemia on the deterioration of peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance due to the accompanying NEFA elevation. While this study did not explore the effect of hypertriglyceridemia alone and only focused on insulin resistance, it supports the direct effect of hypertriglyceridemia on glucose metabolism independent of circulating NEFA. Interpretation of previous findings is often complicated by the use of supraphysiological NEFA and/or triglyceride levels, which are not always representative of the varying increases of these lipids occurring in the metabolic syndrome. Moreover, results vary according to whether acute or chronic effects were studied, the degree of glucose tolerance of the participants enrolled, the use of surrogate indexes of β-cell function, and the heterogeneous experimental settings. These complexities make it challenging to discern the isolated effects of elevated triglycerides from those of NEFA, especially in relation to β-cell function.

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^116UGzfp]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia and Atherosclerosis in Diabetes

The dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes is characterized by high triglyceride levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, changes observed many years before the onset of clinically relevant hyperglycemia. Recent evidence suggests that low HDL cholesterol is an independent factor not only for cardiovascular disease but also for the development of diabetes itself. These changes, and the presence of small dense LDL particles, probably contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis even before diabetes is formally diagnosed. In type 1 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia may occur, but HDL cholesterol levels are often normal or even high unless glycemic control is poor or nephropathy is present. In addition, patients with diabetes show qualitative and kinetic abnormalities for all lipoproteins.

A number of factors may contribute to the alterations in lipid metabolism observed in patients with diabetes, including insulin deficiency or resistance, adipocytokines, and hyperglycemia. Many aspects of the pathophysiology and consequences of diabetes dyslipidemia remain unclear, but the mechanism by which hypertriglyceridemia arises is fairly well understood. Insulin deficiency or resistance activates intracellular hormone-sensitive lipase which increases the release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) from triglycerides stored in the more metabolically active centrally distributed adipose tissue. High circulating levels of NEFA increase hepatic triglyceride production. Increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis is associated with increased secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, the normal inhibitory effect of insulin on hepatic apoB production and triglyceride secretion in VLDL is lost, and the VLDL secreted is larger and more triglyceride-rich. The tendency to hypertriglyceridemia is further augmented by reduced VLDL catabolism. Lipoprotein lipase located on vascular endothelium largely determines the rate of removal of triglycerides from the circulation. In contrast to intracellular hormone-sensitive lipase this lipoprotein lipase may be downregulated in states of insulin resistance or deficiency. This reduction in lipoprotein lipase activity also contributes to postprandial lipemia.

An important complication of insulin-resistant states, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, is an atherogenic dyslipidemia profile characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low plasma high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and a small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle profile. The physiological basis of this metabolic dyslipidemia appears to be hepatic overproduction of apoB-containing very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. This has focused attention on the mechanisms that regulate VLDL secretion in insulin-resistant states. Recent studies in animal models of insulin resistance, particularly the fructose-fed hamster, have enhanced our understanding of these mechanisms, and certain key factors have recently been identified that play important roles in hepatic insulin resistance and dysregulation of the VLDL secretory process. This review focuses on these recent developments as well as on the hypothesis that an interaction between enhanced flux of free fatty acids from peripheral tissues to liver, chronic up-regulation of de novo lipogenesis by hyperinsulinemia and attenuated insulin signaling in the liver may be critical to the VLDL overproduction state observed in insulin resistance. It should be noted that the focus of this review is on molecular mechanisms of the hypertriglyceridemic state associated with insulin resistance and not that observed in association with insulin deficiency (e.g., in streptozotocin-treated animals), which appears to have a different etiology and is related to a catabolic defect rather than secretory overproduction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

ACC nonstatin LDL-C — older adults and hypertriglyceridemia in primary prevention emphasizes that in primary prevention patients aged > 75 years, the patient-clinician discussion should consider the limited adequate RCT data, and if there is persistent hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL), clinicians should refer to the 2021 ACC ECDP on management of hypertriglyceridemia for further evaluation and management.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^111BCJYt]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Isolated elevated triglyceride (TG) levels — hypertriglyceridemia is attributed to combinations of monogenic or polygenic influences and secondary factors, and in the initial workup contributing factors should be identified and managed. Examples include medical conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes and hypothyroidism; medications such as estrogens, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, and corticosteroids; metabolic disorders such as overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance; and unhealthy dietary/lifestyle practices including excess alcohol and caloric intake, high intakes of added sugars and refined starches, and physical inactivity. Most individuals with hypertriglyceridemia have mild-to-moderate TG elevations, but some have severe elevations with chylomicronemia that increases risk for pancreatitis, and plasma TG are transported principally by very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron particles with clearance facilitated by lipoprotein lipase (LPL).

### Are hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL causal factors in the development of insulin resistance? [^112Yoeyt]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance often occurs with dyslipidemia as part of the metabolic syndrome and the current dominant paradigm is that insulin resistance leads to dyslipidemia. However, dyslipidemia may also cause insulin resistance; this was postulated 30 years ago, but has never been substantiated. Establishing whether dyslipidemia plays a causal role in the etiology of insulin resistance is important since it could reveal new avenues for combating type 2 diabetes. In this review we summarize recent evidence from epidemiological, genetic and intervention studies to re-address this old hypothesis.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^112uZX6k]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia in obesity — marked triglyceride elevations are often due to a "two hit" phenomenon of genetic predisposition plus secondary causes; contributors include unhealthy diet, alcohol, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, diabetes, certain medications, chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism, pregnancy, increased delivery of fatty acids to the liver, and adiposopathic endocrinopathies and immunopathies. In obesity specifically, adipose tissue endocrinopathies and immunopathies increase triglyceride-rich lipoprotein production and decrease lipolysis, and adiposopathic impairment increases fatty acid flux to the liver, leading to increased hepatic VLDL production and increased circulating blood triglyceride levels.

### First-line therapies for lowering triglyceride levels… [^114yN5M9]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

First, the authors have given statins the preeminent position by listing them first in their choice of pharmacologic agents for treating patients with high triglycerides. Statins are not the first-line agents. In patients with triglyceride levels higher than 500 mg per dL, the first priority should be lowering their triglycerides, not their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 2 Initial therapy should always begin with fibrates, extended-release niacin, and fish oil. When used alone or in combination, all three of these agents are more efficacious in lowering triglyceride levels than statins.

Many such persons have a genetic hyperlipidemia, such as Type V hyperlipoproteinemia, and drug therapy must be undertaken immediately to expeditiously reduce serum triglyceride levels to lower than 500 mg per dL. In patients with diabetes and insulin resistance, insulin therapy with a basal insulin and multiple doses of short-acting insulin injections at mealtime will substantially impact postprandial lipemia, as patients with diabetes and high fasting triglyceride levels risk further elevation in serum triglyceride levels after a mixed meal. 3 Bile acid sequestrants are contraindicated in those with high triglyceride levels, as these agents cause further elevation in serum triglyceride levels. Oral agents that impact prandial glucose regulation may be less effective in this situation.
4.

In my clinic, a common and recurrent theme is the practice of prescribing high-dose statins to treat high triglyceride levels, and then adding on a fibrate as a second-line agent. This combination often results in complications and eventual withdrawal of all drug therapy, and could be avoided if therapy was initiated with fibrates and niacin rather than statins. Rosuvastatin, as opposed to other statins, may have a slight advantage in lowering of triglyceride levels on a weight-for-weight basis; in general, however, statin use should be limited to recalcitrant cases after initial use of fibrates, niacin, and fish oil, and after ensuring patient adherence.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^1175tdr8]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Insulin resistance and lipoprotein lipase activity — obesity is usually associated with increased total LPL activity, but among those with obesity the responsiveness of LPL to insulin and feeding may be relatively decreased; even if total LPL activity is increased with obesity, it may be inadequate to fully hydrolyze the obesity-related increase in circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, contributing to elevated triglyceride levels in patients with obesity. Insulin resistance is associated with increased activity of apoC-III, reduced activity of apoC-II, and reduced activity of apoA-V, which would be expected to reduce LPL activity, and while total LPL activity may be increased in patients with obesity and insulin resistance, relative impairment per unit fat mass may render LPL activity insufficient to prevent hypertriglyceridemia.

### Association between insulin resistance and the development of cardiovascular disease [^1123hmHv]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the vascular actions of insulin are complex, which may have either protective or deleterious effects on the vasculature. The protective effects are related to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation via PI3K/Akt pathway (Fig. 1). The deleterious effects involve the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, vasoconstriction and proinflammatory activity. These vascular effects are mediated through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is involved only in the mitogenic effects of insulin, but not in its metabolic effects.

Fig. 1
A simplified model of insulin resistance. The loss of suppressive effects of insulin on lipolysis in adipocytes increases free fatty acids. Increased free fatty acids flux to the liver stimulates the assembly and secretion of VLDL resulting in hypertriglyceridemia. Triglycerides (TG) in VLDL are transferred to both HDL and LDL through the action of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). This process results in a triglyceride-enriched HDL and LDL particle. Triglyceride-enriched HDL is more rapidly cleared from the circulation by the kidney, leaving fewer HDL particles to accept cholesterol from the vasculature. In the glucose metabolism, the insulin resistance results in decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis, owing to decreased activation of glycogen synthase, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and glucose delivery by the liver

### Hypertriglyceridemia in the genomic era: a new paradigm [^115it6jr]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a highly prevalent condition that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. HTG may arise as a result of defective metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, ie, impaired clearance, or increased production, or both. Current categorization of HTG segregates primary and secondary cases, implying genetic and nongenetic causes for each category. Many common and rare variants of the genes encoding factors involved in these pathways have been identified. Although monogenic forms of HTG do occur, most cases are polygenic and often coexist with nongenetic conditions. Cumulative, multiple genetic variants can increase the risks for HTG, whereas environmental and lifestyle factors can force expression of a dyslipidemic phenotype in a genetically susceptible person. HTG states are therefore best viewed as a complex phenotype resulting from the interaction of cumulated multiple susceptibility genes and environmental stressors. In view of the heterogeneity of the HTG states, the absence of a unifying metabolic or genetic abnormality, overlap with the metabolic syndrome and other features of insulin resistance, and evidence in some patients that accumulation of numerous small-effect genetic variants determines whether an individual is susceptible to HTG only or to HTG plus elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we propose that the diagnosis of primary HTG and further delineation of familial combined hyperlipidemia from familial HTG is neither feasible nor clinically relevant at the present time. The hope is that with greater understanding of genetic and environmental causes and their interaction, therapy can be intelligently targeted in the future.

### Mendelian randomization studies do not support a role for raised circulating triglyceride levels influencing type 2 diabetes, glucose levels, or insulin resistance [^112HK88X]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Further Mendelian randomization studies will be needed to test the role of circulating FFAs, which may be more critical to reduced β-cell function than triglycerides. We excluded from our main analysis the common variant near the FADS1 gene because this variant is most strongly associated with polyunsaturated fatty acids. The FADS1 variant is also associated with fasting-based measures of insulin secretion, such as fasting glucose and HOMA-B, and to a lesser extent type 2 diabetes, suggesting that FFAs could have a causal role in diabetes. Additional genetic studies are needed to assess the role of FFAs and different types of FFAs in insulin resistance and secretion.

In conclusion, we have performed a powerful Mendelian randomization analysis of circulating triglyceride levels. Our data provide evidence that genetically influenced raised circulating triglyceride levels do not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and related metabolic traits.

### A hepatic amino acid / mTOR / S6K-dependent signalling pathway modulates systemic lipid metabolism via neuronal signals [^113BFxeK]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

What then is the physiological role of this inter-tissue and inter-nutrient mechanism? Among nutrients, AAs, which activate the mTORC1/S6K pathway, are well known to be utilized for nutrition sensing. For instance, AA deficiency intracellularly induces autophagy via alterations in the mTORC1/S6K pathway to make up for nutrient deficiencies. On the other hand, AA excess may represent states of over-nutrition. As the liver efficiently receives the nutritional information derived from foods via the portal vein, it can function as a metabolic sensor tissue at the whole-body level. In fact, high-protein diet loading, that is, surplus intake of dietary AAs, reportedly enhances postprandial TG elevation in both miceand humans. The present results indicate that, in the state of obesity, the hepatic mTORC1/S6K pathway is physiologically activated, leading to downregulation of LPL in adipose tissue via a neuronal relay. LPL suppression decreases lipid uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues by inhibiting TG breakdown into fatty acids. Therefore, it is considered that this mechanism leads to systemic negative feedback responses to over-nutrition. However, this inter-nutrient mechanism induces marked hypertriglyceridemia, one of the major features of the metabolic syndrome in the state of obesity.

As for glucose metabolism, it is well known that obesity induces insulin resistance, thereby suppressing glucose transport and utilization in peripheral tissues. Insulin resistance is considered to play a physiological role in preventing further energy accumulation and obesity, but it induces diabetes and many other disorders of the metabolic syndrome under conditions of sustained over-nutrition. Therefore, these two mechanisms, that is, insulin resistance and the neuronal relay identified in this study, might be conceptually analogous in terms of glucose and lipid metabolism, respectively. These mechanisms might have worked advantageously when foods were repeatedly in excess or short supply, but, in the current age of constant plenty, they ironically trigger obesity-related disorders. On the basis of several clinical studies, hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known independent risk for atherosclerosis development. The hepatic mTORC1/S6K pathway and neuronal signals may constitute a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^111J592M]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein particle number (LDL-P) — utility and guidance: LDL-P reflects particle concentration rather than cholesterol mass, where "LDL particle number (LDL-P) is the concentration of LDL particle volume, as opposed to the weight of LDL-C per volume that is more routinely measured", and smaller, denser LDL are "considered more atherogenic". In prediction studies, "LDL-P is a better predictor of ASCVD risk than LDL-C" and "When LDL-P and LDL-C are discordant, risk is more closely associated with LDL-P when measured by the LipoScience NMR method", yet "In Framingham, no advantage for LDL-P measured by a NMR method developed by LipoScience (Morrisville, NC) was observed beyond traditional lipids for the occurrence of initial ASCVD events, and similar results were obtained in the Women's Health Initiative". In the FATS trial, "a clinical trial that included 160 adults who received aggressive lipid interventions versus usual care. The primary findings were that favorable changes in traditional lipid measures LDL-C and HDL-C were associated with less progression of coronary artery disease evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography". Guidance notes, "The 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society Cholesterol Guideline does not comment on the utility of LDL-P measurements". Use is conditional: "Measurement of LDL-P may be considered when there is evidence of or concern for hypertriglyceridemia and/or insulin resistance" and "LDL-P measurement may also be considered in those with a personal or family history of ASCVD to help understand if a high particle number is contributing to risk". If elevated, "the first-line management strategy should be LDL-C lowering with statin therapy", and if LDL-C is already controlled, elevated LDL-P likely reflects "hypertriglyceridemia and/or insulin resistance"; overall, in much of the population LDL-P testing "does not provide useful information to guide treatment beyond traditional lipoprotein cholesterol information".

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1137stGA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1.3 — lipoprotein testing in hypertriglyceridemia states: We recommend against the routine measurement of lipoprotein particle heterogeneity in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (1⊕⊕⊕○). We suggest that measurement of apoB or Lp(a) levels can be of value, whereas measurement of other apolipoprotein levels has little clinical value (2⊕⊕○○). Supporting evidence notes it is not necessary to measure LDL size or density; however, measurement of non-HDL cholesterol and/or apoB levels can indicate the presence of increased numbers of LDL particles, and several reports also show that measurement of apoB is superior to measurement of LDL or even non-HDL cholesterol as an indicator of global CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have not provided conclusive evidence that measurement of HDL size contributes to risk prediction, and for these reasons, assessment of lipoprotein heterogeneity is not recommended in the assessment of hypertriglyceridemia. Regarding Lp(a), studies over the past decade have confirmed and more robustly demonstrated a risk factor role for cardiovascular disease; however, there are limited treatment options to alter its level and a current lack of outcome evidence supporting its use as a specific therapeutic target.

### Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia: is hyperinsulinemia the cart or the horse? [^111cHKmj]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance, recently recognized as a strong predictor of disease in adults, has become the leading element of the metabolic syndrome and renewed as a focus of research. The condition exists when insulin levels are higher than expected relative to the level of glucose. Thus, insulin resistance is by definition tethered to hyperinsulinemia. The rising prevalence of medical conditions where insulin resistance is common has energized research into the causes. Many causes and consequences have been identified, but the direct contributions of insulin itself in causing or sustaining insulin resistance have received little sustained attention. We examine situations where insulin itself appears to be a proximate and important quantitative contributor to insulin resistance. 1) Mice transfected with extra copies of the insulin gene produce basal and stimulated insulin levels that are two to four times elevated. The mice are of normal weight but show insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. 2) Somogyi described patients with unusually high doses of insulin and hyperglycemia. Episodes of hypoglycemia with release of glucose-raising hormones, postulated as the culprits in early studies, have largely been excluded by studies including continuous glucose monitoring. 3) Rats and humans treated with escalating doses of insulin show both hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. 4) The pulsatile administration of insulin (rather than continuous) results in reduced requirements for insulin. 5) Many patients with insulinoma who have elevated basal levels of insulin have reduced (but not absent) responsiveness to administered insulin. In summary, hyperinsulinemia is often both a result and a driver of insulin resistance.

### Liver insulinization as a driver of triglyceride dysmetabolism [^113c8aZt]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is an increasingly prevalent fellow traveller with the insulin resistance that underlies type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanistic connection between MAFLD and impaired insulin action remains unclear. In this Perspective, we review data from humans to elucidate insulin's aetiological role in MAFLD. We focus particularly on the relative preservation of insulin's stimulation of triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis despite its waning ability to curb hepatic glucose production (HGP). To explain this apparent 'selective insulin resistance', we propose that hepatocellular processes that lead to TG accumulation require less insulin signal transduction, or 'insulinization', than do those that regulate HGP. As such, mounting hyperinsulinaemia that barely compensates for aberrant HGP in insulin-resistant states more than suffices to maintain hepatic TG biosynthesis. Thus, even modestly elevated or context-inappropriate insulin levels, when sustained day and night within a heavily pro-lipogenic metabolic milieu, may translate into substantial cumulative TG biosynthesis in the insulin-resistant state.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113HrNkQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine disorders — Diabetes mellitus and acromegaly are linked to hypertriglyceridemia. Patients with untreated diabetes mellitus and insulin deficiency commonly have hypertriglyceridemia; this condition occurs more frequently in type 2 than in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Appropriate diabetes management reduces triglyceride levels, and mild hypertriglyceridemia in treated type 2 diabetes is probably related to central obesity and insulin resistance. In acromegaly, hypertriglyceridemia is related to increased insulin resistance and to decreased activity of both hepatic lipase and LpL.

### Mendelian randomization studies do not support a role for raised circulating triglyceride levels influencing type 2 diabetes, glucose levels, or insulin resistance [^114UxvoS]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. Most importantly, we are testing circulating, not intracellular, triglycerides. We have not tested the role of triglycerides in the liver, and fasting insulin (and HOMA-IR) is primarily a measure of hepatic insulin resistance rather than muscle insulin resistance. Several of the gene variants are likely to operate in the liver by increasing the clearance of triglycerides into the circulation, which could be consistent with a lack of effect of these variants on hepatic-based measures of insulin resistance. A net effect of the triglyceride-raising alleles on increased clearance of triglycerides from the liver could also explain the suggestive protective association between increased (genetically influenced) circulating triglycerides and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in the instrumental variable analysis. However, this association was not reflected by a protective association between triglyceride-raising alleles and hepatic measures of insulin resistance and could be attributed to chance. It will be important to test the association between triglyceride variants and oral glucose tolerance test–based or muscle-based measures of insulin resistance, such as those based on hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Therefore, our results do not necessarily provide evidence against the lipotoxicity hypothesis, which states that raised triglyceride levels contribute to whole-body insulin resistance. In contrast, our results provide stronger evidence against the lipotoxicity hypothesis, in that raised circulating triglyceride levels contribute to altered β-cell function and type 2 diabetes. A second limitation is that we have not tested the effects of raised circulating triglyceride levels alone but rather a mixture of raised circulating triglycerides and, to a lesser extent, raised LDL and total cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. However, an analysis using just the four variants with disproportionate effects on circulating triglyceride levels relative to HDL cholesterol provided similar results. With the identification of an increasing number of genetic variants related to lipid fractions, it will be possible to produce multiple allele score instruments, which would allow a demonstration of a lack of pleiotropy in generating the observed findings. Finally, the 10 SNPs used only account for 3–5% of the phenotypic variation in circulating triglyceride levels. We have therefore not tested the full spectrum of genetically influenced triglyceride levels.

### Management of severe hypertriglyceridemia in the hospital: a review [^1139NVfR]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

For hospitalists, hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is more than cardiovascular risk. Severe HTG occurs when serum triglycerides rise above 1000 mg/dL, and it carries a risk of abdominal pain and pancreatitis. The etiology of severe HTG is usually a combination of genetic and secondary factors. A detailed history with attention to family history, medications, and alcohol consumption can often lead to the cause. Physical examination findings may stretch across multiple organ systems. Patients with severe HTG should be admitted to the hospital for aggressive medical therapy if they develop symptoms such as abdominal pain or pancreatitis. Asymptomatic patients with severe HTG who have significant short-term risk for developing symptoms require urgent consultation that may lead to a brief hospitalization to address exacerbating factors. Treatment of severe HTG includes a combination of pharmacologic agents and a restriction on dietary triglyceride intake. If oral medications fail to adequately lower triglyceride levels, intravenous insulin and in rare cases therapeutic plasma exchange may be required. To prevent recurrent severe HTG, the patient should be counseled about adherence to long-term medications and lifestyle changes.

Causes of elevated triglycerides — pathophysiology notes that triglycerides are the most dense form of calories and serve as an important source of energy; dietary triglycerides are assembled in the gut into chylomicrons; and their interaction with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells leads to liberation of free fatty acids from triglyceride, and free fatty acids are able to traverse cell membranes.

### Obesity and dyslipidemia [^114PanAJ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The alarming and still increasing prevalence of obesity and associated cardiovascular risk raises much concern. The increase in cardiovascular risk depends to a significant extent on the changes in lipid profiles as observed in obesity. These changes are decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased triglyceride levels. Much effort has already been expended into the elucidation of the mechanisms behind these obesity-associated lipid changes. Insulin resistance certainly plays a central role and, in addition, both hormonal and neurologic pathways have recently been found to play an important role. This article focuses on the mechanisms involved in the development of the proatherogenic lipid changes associated with obesity.

Hypertriglyceridemia — severe and very severe management: For severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Determination and treatment of underlying causes of very severe hypertriglyceridemia should be considered first. Restriction of both saturated and unsaturated dietary fat, particularly at initiation of therapy and in LpL deficiency, assists in lowering triglyceride acutely, and design of the dietary intervention may benefit from input from nutrition specialists; regain of weight loss might exacerbate pancreatitis risk.

### Syndromic insulin resistance: models for the therapeutic basis of the metabolic syndrome and other targets of insulin resistance [^116HWx9v]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the link between insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome how to develop treatment approaches.

Methods

We present 3 cases of extreme syndromic insulin resistance: lipodystrophy, autoantibodies to the insulin receptor, and mutations in the insulin receptor gene, with accompanying discussion of pathophysiology and treatment.

Results

In lipodystrophy, insulin resistance is a direct consequence of leptin deficiency, and thus leptin replacement reverses metabolic syndrome abnormalities, including diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. The insulin "receptoropathies", including autoantibodies to the insulin receptor and insulin receptor gene mutations, are characterized by extreme insulin resistance and ovarian hyperandrogenism, without dyslipidemia or fatty liver disease. Autoantibodies to the insulin receptor can be treated using an immunosuppressive paradigm adapted from treatment of other autoimmune and neoplastic conditions. Leptin treatment has shown some success in treating hyperglycemia in patients with insulin receptor gene mutations. Treatment for this condition remains inadequate, and novel therapies that bypass insulin receptor signaling, such as enhancers of brown adipose tissue, are needed.

Conclusions

We present a clinical approach to the treatment of syndromic insulin resistance. The study of rare diseases that replicate the metabolic syndrome, with clear-cut pathophysiology, promotes understanding of novel physiology and development of targeted therapies that may be applicable to the broader population with obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes.

Hypertriglyceridemia in obesity — causes and mechanisms are described as "often the result of a 'two hit' phenomenon of genetic predisposition, accompanied by secondary contributors", with secondary factors including adiposopathic endocrinopathies and immunopathies, ultra-processed energy dense foods high in refined simple sugars, insulin resistance & diabetes mellitus, concomitant medications, chronic kidney disease and nephrotic syndrome, hormonal environment (hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism, pregnancy), impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and increased circulating fatty acids; insulin resistance is highlighted as a key contributor to hypertriglyceridemia, with adverse consequences that include impaired lipolysis coupled with increased delivery of fatty acids to adipose tissue increasing fat mass and impaired suppression of lipolysis in adipocytes leading to increased release of fatty acids, fatty liver, and increased VLDL secretion.

### Acute hypertriglyceridemia induces platelet hyperactivity that is not attenuated by insulin in polycystic ovary syndrome [^114dXucK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin resistance (IR), defined as resistance to insulin‐stimulated glucose uptake, is a common precursor to both diabetes and associated vascular disease. – IR is a multisystem disorder that is associated with multiple metabolic and cellular alterations including atherogenic dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and a prothrombotic state. This triad of factors predisposes patients with IR to accelerated atherothrombosis. – Dyslipidemia is very common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a disorder in which IR occurs in 95% of obese cases. Consequently, subjects with PCOS are susceptible to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), metabolic syndrome (MBS), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) – that are associated with premature cardiovascular (CVD) related mortality. –

Postprandial triglyceride levels are strongly and positively correlated to incidence of coronary artery disease diagnosed by coronary angiography. Lowering plasma triglyceride concentrations by fibrates in patients with either isolated hypertriglyceridemia or atherogenic metabolic dyslipidemia significantly reduces CVD events. However, the nature of the link between hypertriglyceridemia and CVD is poorly defined. Hypertriglyceridemia may play an indirect role in the causation of atherosclerosisbeing a central component of the "atherogenic dyslipidemia triad" together with reduced levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐c) and a preponderance of small dense low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐c). It is also possible that hypertriglyceridemia may have a direct effect on atherosclerosis as it has been proven that triglycerides are present in the form of triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins in the aorta, in atherosclerotic lesions, and in the foam cells formed by macrophagesin previous studies.

The procoagulant state associated with IR is thought, at least in part, to be associated with platelet hyperactivity. In healthy blood vessels, platelet activation is counterbalanced by inhibitory signalling cascades that are activated by endothelial‐derived nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI 2), which modulate excessive activation, although there is potential for platelet resistance to these key inhibitory factors in some disease states. The effective compliance of platelet function at all times is critical since, in addition to their classical role in acute thrombosis, platelets are involved in the initiation of atheroma, modulation of inflammatory responses, and contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Platelets can adhere to intact activated endothelium in the absence of exposed extracellular matrix proteins. These adherent platelets may play a critical role in atherogenesis by the secretion of the chemokines CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL4 (platelet factor 4), and interleukin‐1.

Primary hypertriglyceridemia — risk assessment and lipid-pattern categories: We recommend that patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia be assessed for other cardiovascular risk factors, including central obesity, hypertension, abnormalities of glucose metabolism, and liver dysfunction; elevated triglycerides can occur with or without other lipid disturbances, and patients with elevations of both total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride can be divided into three categories: VLDL and/or LDL cholesterol elevated (as in familial combined hyperlipidemia), VLDL and chylomicron remnant cholesterol elevated (as in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), and severe/very severe hypertriglyceridemia with increased VLDL and chylomicron cholesterol.

### Metabolic markers predict insulin resistance… [^114fuHq2]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The large number of overweight persons in the United States is increasing the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Weight control might be enhanced if better identification of a high-risk population were available, particularly if weight reduction actually could decrease risk. Measurement of insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia might provide a clue, because the prevalence of insulin resistance is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, and CVD. The presence of a dyslipidemia characteristic of insulin-resistance might be a useful predictive tool. Plasma triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, which are independently associated with insulin resistance, are predictors of CVD. Patients with a high ratio of triglycerides to HDL have an increased CVD risk independent of the more conventional risk factors.

Because weight reduction is known to decrease CVD risk in overweight patients with disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism, developing measurements to provide early identification of insulin resistance would be useful. In their study, healthy persons with a body mass index of 25 or greater underwent testing to estimate insulin-mediated glucose disposal as a way to measure insulin activity. A steady-state plasma glucose concentration in the upper tertile of the 490 participants in a large database who were gathered for an ongoing 10-year research study was defined as insulin resistance. Fifty percent of the 258 overweight or obese participants in this study were in the most insulin-resistant tertile. Metabolic markers that were correlated with insulin resistance included insulin levels, triglyceride concentrations, and the triglyceride: HDL ratio.

The authors conclude that because insulin resistance is a risk factor for CVD, and weight reduction can decrease that risk, identification of overweight or obese patients who are insulin resistant can help direct weight reduction efforts. The plasma insulin level probably is most closely related to insulin resistance, but the absence of a standardized insulin assay decreases the clinical utility of this analysis. Plasma triglyceride levels and the triglyceride: HDL cholesterol ratio also accurately identify insulin resistance. The latter analysis is more attractive because of the consistent observation that low HDL cholesterol is related to CVD. editor's note: The presence of insulin resistance imparts a significantly higher relative risk of a cardiovascular event in patients with or without diabetes. Obesity and weight gain are associated with hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia.

Weight increases of more than 10 percent over the 30 years starting at age 20 appear to be related to the insulin resistance syndrome in a linear manner.

### The role of apheresis and insulin therapy in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis-a concise review [^115Mm3uo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis (AP) and is involved in its pathogenesis. Chylomicrons increase blood viscosity and induce ischemia, while free fatty acids induce inflammation and distant organ damage. Conservative treatment options include fasting and insulin; limited evidence shows their comparable efficacy. Plasma exchange might provide more rapid lowering of triglycerides and amelioration of systemic effects of severe AP. Available data from controlled studies show only moderately faster lowering of triglycerides with apheresis (about 70% vs. 50% with conservative treatment within 24 h) and limited data from non-randomized studies show no improvement in clinical outcomes. New evidence is expected soon from ongoing large randomized trials. Until then, insulin may be used in mild HTG-AP and plasma exchange should be considered only in severe HTG-AP, especially if the decline of triglycerides with conservative treatment is slow, and in HTG-AP during pregnancy.

### Triglyceride-rich very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) are independently associated with insulin secretion in a multiethnic cohort of adolescents [^113j4UX9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Excess insulin secretion and hyperinsulinaemia contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms leading to insulin hypersecretion remain largely unknown. Based on our preliminary data, we examined whether triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) are independently associated with insulin secretion, and whether ethnicity/race modulates these associations. Fasting triglycerides and VLDL were measured in a multiethnic cohort of 630 non-diabetic adolescents. Insulin secretion, β-cell function parameters, insulin sensitivity and insulin clearance were estimated through a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. Metabolic assessments were repeated after 2 years in 239 subjects. Triglycerides and triglyceride-rich VLDL (large and medium size fractions) were associated with both basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI z-score, plasma glucose, and insulin sensitivity. Ethnicity per se had an impact on lipid profile and β-cell function, but did not modulate the effect of triglycerides/VLDL on insulin secretion. At follow-up, changes in triglyceride levels were proportional to changes in insulin secretion. These findings support the hypothesis that hypertriglyceridaemia is an important stimulus for β-cell insulin release in young people under both fasting and fed conditions.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: common questions… [^116smTsW]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher. Elevated triglyceride levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and severely elevated levels are associated with increased risk of pancreatitis. 1 This article answers commonly asked questions related to the management of hypertriglyceridemia. After hypertriglyceridemia is identified, the patient should be assessed for common and secondary causes. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. 1, 14, 15 A cohort study found that triglyceride levels of 500 mg per dL or higher are associated with increased severity of pancreatitis. 9 The risk of pancreatitis increases linearly with triglyceride levels greater than 177 mg per dL. 15 Triglyceride levels of 1, 000 to 2, 000 mg per dL or higher may be a contributing factor in 2% to 4% of acute pancreatitis cases.
14. Carbohydrates. Reducing carbohydrate intake, including sugar-sweetened beverages, and increasing fat or protein intake lower fasting triglyceride levels. 2, 3, 17 Meta-analyses demonstrate higher triglyceride levels with increased carbohydrate and reduced fat intake. 18, 19 Eating foods low on the glycemic index limits the rise of serum glucose levels thus limiting the rise of serum triglycerides. 27 A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that lower-carbohydrate diets reduce triglyceride levels and reverse metabolic syndrome more effectively than higher-carbohydrate diets, independent of weight loss.

28 Despite these studies, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal macronutrient profile or eating pattern for patients with hypertriglyceridemia or metabolic syndrome. Overall, clinicians should recommend a lower-carbohydrate, higher-fat or higher-protein nutrition plan, especially for those with hypertriglyceridemia less than 500 mg per dL.

### Impact of menopause and diabetes on atherogenic lipid profile: is it worth to analyse lipoprotein subfractions to assess cardiovascular risk in women? [^1167YsGX]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Disturbances in lipid profile and lipoprotein subfractions in diabetes and in postmenopausal diabetic women

Type 2 DM commonly coexists with obesity and both are characterized by states of low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. Type 1 macrophages accumulated in the hypertrophic adipose tissue potentiate the pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Efflux of free fatty acids into circulation and the hepatic insulin resistance are responsible for the dyslipidemia in this condition. Molecular mechanisms of the lipid metabolism disturbances in DM involve microRNAs, that are non-coding RNA molecules which regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. When microRNAs bind to their complementary sites at the 3′-untranslated regions of the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) results in mRNA translational and repression or transcript degradation. They have been proven to play important role on insulin resistance and on the regulation of liver metabolism affecting circulating lipids (miR-122, miR-33a, miR-33b) and lipoprotein receptor. The relationship between insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia has been recognized, whereas through microRNA miR-34a, hypertriglyceridemia seems to favor the onset of DM.

### Hypertriglyceridemia [^114bw22e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a commonly encountered lipid abnormality frequently associated with other lipid and metabolic derangements. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends obtaining a fasting lipid panel in adults over the age of 20. The discovery of hypertriglyceridemia should prompt an investigation for secondary causes such as high fat diet, excessive alcohol intake, certain medications, and medical conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism). In addition, patients should be evaluated for other components of the metabolic syndrome. These include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high triglyceride, and hypertension. Hypertriglyceridemia is classified as primary hypertriglyceridemia when there are no secondary causes identified. Primary hypertriglyceridemia is the result of various genetic defects leading to disordered triglyceride metabolism. It is important to treat hypertriglyceridemia to prevent pancreatitis by reducing triglyceride levels to < 500 mg/dL. Furthermore, lowering triglycerides while treating other dyslipidemias and components of the metabolic syndrome will reduce coronary events. However, it is controversial how much isolated hypertriglyceridemia correlates directly with coronary artery disease and further studies are needed to clarify whether treatment for this condition leads to meaningful clinical outcomes. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) are the first line of treatment for hypertriglyceridemia. These changes include a low saturated fat, carbohydrate-controlled diet, combined with alcohol reduction, smoking cessation, and regular aerobic exercise. High doses of omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil supplements will lower triglyceride levels significantly. When patients do not reach their goals by TLC, drug therapy should be started. In cases of isolated hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates are initially considered. When elevated low-density lipoprotein levels accompany hypertriglyceridemia, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are preferred. In patients with low HDL levels and hypertriglyceridemia, extended release niacin can be considered. A combination of the medicines may be necessary in recalcitrant cases.

### Selective hepatic insulin resistance, VLDL overproduction, and hypertriglyceridemia [^112XQtyb]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Insulin plays a central role in regulating energy metabolism, including hepatic transport of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglyceride. Hepatic hypersecretion of VLDL and consequent hypertriglyceridemia leads to lower circulating high-density lipoprotein levels and generation of small dense low-density lipoproteins characteristic of the dyslipidemia commonly observed in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Physiological fluctuations of insulin modulate VLDL secretion, and insulin inhibition of VLDL secretion upon feeding may be the first pathway to become resistant in obesity that leads to VLDL hypersecretion. This review summarizes the role of insulin-related signaling pathways that determine hepatic VLDL production. Disruption in signaling pathways that reduce generation of the second messenger phosphatidylinositide (3,4,5) triphosphate downstream of activated phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase underlies the development of VLDL hypersecretion. As insulin resistance progresses, a number of pathways are altered that further augment VLDL hypersecretion, including hepatic inflammatory pathways. Insulin plays a complex role in regulating glucose metabolism, and it is not surprising that the role of insulin in VLDL and lipid metabolism will prove equally complex.

### Akt2 is required for hepatic lipid accumulation in models of insulin resistance [^114XQEqK]. Cell Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Insulin drives the global anabolic response to nutrient ingestion, regulating both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that Akt2/protein kinase B is critical to insulin's control of glucose metabolism, but its role in lipid metabolism has remained controversial. Here, we show that Akt2 is required for hepatic lipid accumulation in obese, insulin-resistant states induced by either leptin deficiency or high-fat diet feeding. Lep(ob/ob) mice lacking hepatic Akt2 failed to amass triglycerides in their livers, associated with and most likely due to a decrease in lipogenic gene expression and de novo lipogenesis. However, Akt2 is also required for steatotic pathways unrelated to fatty acid synthesis, as mice fed high-fat diet had reduced liver triglycerides in the absence of hepatic Akt2 but did not exhibit changes in lipogenesis. These data demonstrate that Akt2 is a requisite component of the insulin-dependent regulation of lipid metabolism during insulin resistance.

### PPAR-α agonist fenofibrate reduces insulin resistance in impaired glucose tolerance patients with hypertriglyceridemia: a cross-sectional study [^1152YKT9]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), the major risk factor correlated with the development of both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, is frequently associated with insulin resistance which is the central feature of metabolic syndrome. Hypertriglyceridemia is considered as an important risk factor for insulin resistance and islet β-cell dysfunction. Lipoprotein lipase gene knockout heterozygous mice, an animal model of genetic hypertriglyceridemia, present high insulin resistance, compensatory increase of insulin secretion, and impaired glucose tolerance, indicating that hypertriglyceridemia could contribute to disorders of glycometabolism mediated through insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction.

Fenofibrate, an important peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) agonist, is widely used in clinical as a triglyceride (TG)-lowering agent which is effective at decreasing TG levels, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and changing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particle morphology. Some large-scale clinical researches have shown that fenofibrate exerts highly beneficial effects on protecting against cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM apart from regulating lipid metabolism. Thus, PPAR-α agonists may reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through lipid-lowering-dependent and lipid-lowering-independent mechanisms. Our previous studies demonstrated that fenofibrate decreased circulating irisin levels and C–C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) levels in T2DM patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

The insulin-sensitizing effects of fenofibrate, which can improve glycometabolism and protect the cardiovascular system, have remained controversial. Most studies have indicated the insulin-sensitizing actions of fenofibrate, although the actions have been questioned by other studies. Some studies have demonstrated that fenofibrate exerted protective effects on hypertriglyceridemic patients with prediabetes, and ameliorated insulin resistance in hypertriglyceridemic patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). On the contrary, other studies have found that fenofibrate has no effects on the insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant nondiabetic subjects or in subjects with T2DM. Thus, we aimed to examine whether treatment with the PPAR-α agonist fenofibrate affected insulin resistance in patients with IGT in this study.

### Effects of hypertriglyceridemia with or without NEFA elevation on β-cell function and insulin clearance and sensitivity [^113JpWei]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

After glucose loading, both lipid infusions increased ISR and glucose levels and reduced insulin sensitivity to similar extents. This finding of triglyceride-induced deterioration of insulin sensitivity is in line with the results of Storgaard et al, who also assessed the acute effects of triglycerides increase by employing the gold standard method for the assessment of insulin sensitivity (ie, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp) and showed that Intralipid infusion decreased insulin action by ∼25% in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and in healthy controls. The effect of both lipids on inducing systemic insulin resistance was evident also during the OGTT, and is in agreement with previous studies showing fat-induced inhibition of glucose disposal, and increased intramyocellular lipid content. Of note, insulin sensitivity was not further reduced when triglycerides and NEFAs were simultaneously elevated suggesting either a null effect of mildly elevated NEFAs or a flat NEFA-insulin sensitivity dose response.

In our study, the increase in overall ISR was similar with both lipid infusions and largely driven by hyperglycemia. However, our study design and our methods allowed to reveal 2 direct and opposite effects of triglycerides on insulin secretion, namely a mild depression of β-cell glucose sensitivity and an enhanced potentiation, that were hidden by the concomitant rise in NEFAs. Rate sensitivity was not affected by either lipid, suggesting that the readily available insulin pool is not sensitive to acute changes of lipids, in line with previous reports on healthy subjects. We therefore can conclude that NEFAs simultaneously protects from the negative effects of triglycerides on β-cell glucose sensitivity, but also prevent their stimulatory effect on potentiation. Regarding a potential direct effect of triglycerides on the β-cell, studies using clonal INS-1 cells or freshly isolated normal islets have shown the role of lipolysis mediated by the hormone-sensitive lipase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. With respect to potentiation, our data agree with the evidence that NEFAs impair GLP-1 signaling in isolated β-cells, while long-chain triglycerides stimulate GIP secretion from K cells. Large prospective studies have shown that whereas elevated triglycerides increase the risk for incident T2D substantially, elevated NEFAs have only a marginal effect on predicting future dysglycemia. Our findings align with these observations, and further suggest that in acute settings NEFAs may attenuate the negative effects of the accompanying hypertriglyceridemia on β-cell glucose sensitivity.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^113NnyQF]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins metabolism in disease states

At any level of chylomicron and VLDL secretion, the efficiency of both lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated lipolysis and hepatic uptake of remnant particles will determine the circulating levels of fasting and postprandial TG. Lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis of newly secreted TRLs is a saturable process, and as secretion rates and plasma TG levels rise, lipolysis falls. In general, increased VLDL production is the commonest initiating factor for HTG. For any rate of TRL secretion, the inherited capacity of the LPL pathway will also modulate the steady-state level.

Many individuals with HTG also have insulin resistance, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, encompassed by the term 'metabolic syndrome'. This milieu drives increased VLDL secretion, which is particularly enhanced when FA and insulin are in excess. Insulin resistance with increased circulating FAs and decreased insulin signalling can also lead to increased chylomicron secretion. Furthermore, hyperglycaemia stimulates, while glucagon-like peptide 1 inhibits chylomicron secretion. Also, apo C-III inhibits removal of remnants; thus in states of increased VLDL secretion, when apo C-III is elevated, uptake of remnant particles will be reduced, compounding the dyslipidaemia.

### Acute hyperinsulinism modulates plasma apolipoprotein B-48 triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in healthy subjects during the postprandial period [^113SLDNw]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

The role of postprandial insulin in the regulation of postprandial lipid metabolism is still poorly understood. The roles of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in the alteration of postprandial lipid metabolism are not clear either. To improve knowledge in this area, we submitted healthy men to acute hyperinsulinemia in two different ways. In the first study, we compared in 10 men the effects of four isolipidic test meals that induce different degrees of hyperinsulinemia on postprandial lipid metabolism. Three different carbohydrate sources were compared according to their glycemic indexes (GIs; 35, 75, and 100 for white kidney bean, spaghetti, and white bread test meals, respectively); the fourth test meal did not contain any carbohydrates. Postprandial plasma insulin levels were proportional to the GIs (maximal plasma insulin concentrations: 113 ± 16 to 266 ± 36 pmol/l). We found a strong positive correlation during the 6-h postprandial period between apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 plasma concentration and insulin plasma concentration (r2 = 0.70; P = 0.0001). In a second study, 5 of the 10 subjects again ingested the carbohydrate-free meal, but during a 3-h hyperinsulinemic- (550 ± 145 pmol/l plasma insulin) euglycemic (5.5 ± 0.8 mmol/l plasma glucose) clamp. A biphasic response was observed with markedly reduced levels of plasma apoB-48 during insulin infusion, followed by a late accumulation of plasma apoB-48 and triglycerides. Overall, the data obtained showed that portal and peripheral hyperinsulinism delays and exacerbates postprandial accumulation of intestinally derived chylomicrons in plasma and thus is involved in the regulation of apoB-48-triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism, in the absence of insulin-resistance syndrome.

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^115KEEar]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Effects of Hypoglycemic Agents on Lipoproteins

Diabetes dyslipidemia can be partly corrected by insulin treatment and improved blood glucose control. Insulin therapy increases HDL cholesterol and reduces circulating triglyceride levels, particularly in patients with poor glycemic control. Metformin decreases serum triglycerides and improves insulin resistance but is often overlooked as a lipid-lowering agent and is generally considered only as a hypoglycemic agent in the management of diabetes. Other drugs used in the management of diabetes may also have unintended positive and negative effects on lipoproteins (see Table 1). Of particular interest is the small increase in LDL cholesterol observed following treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, suggesting that the recently reported significant improvement in cardiovascular outcomes with empagliflozin is unrelated to effects on dyslipidemia.

### Insulin secretion is increased in non-diabetic subjects with fasting hypertriglyceridaemia [^1123HhCA]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The elevation of triglycerides is strongly linked with insulin resistance, but it has not been evaluated in relationship to insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to determine whether hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with abnormal insulin secretion.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was carried out. Eligible subjects, apparently healthy men and non-pregnant women aged 20–65 years were recruited. According to the triglyceride levels, subjects were allocated in the groups with hypertriglyceridaemia and normotriglyceridaemia. Hypertriglyceridaemia was defined by serum triglyceride levels ≥ 150 mg/dL. Insulin secretion was evaluated by the first phase of insulin secretion (1st PIS) and the second phase of insulin secretion (2nd PIS). A regression linear analysis was performed to evaluate the association between hypertriglyceridaemia (independent variable) and the first and second phase insulin secretion (dependent variables).

Results

A total of 247 apparently healthy subjects were enrolled; 113 (45.7%) with hypertriglyceridaemia and 134 (54.3%) in the control group. The simple regression linear analysis showed a significant association between hypertriglyceridaemia and the 1st PIS [B = 207.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.5–380.5, p = 0.02] and the 2nd PIS (B = 48.7; 95% CI 9.2–88.2, p = 0.01). A multiple regression linear analysis adjusted by age, sex, body mass index and waist circumference was performed showing that fasting hypertriglyceridaemia remained significantly associated with the 1st PIS (B = 184.3; 95% CI 13.0–355.7, p = 0.03) and the 2nd PIS (B = 43.1; 95% CI 4.2–81.9, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

The results of this study show that hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with the increase of the 1st PIS and the 2nd PIS in apparently healthy subjects.

### Mendelian randomization studies do not support a role for raised circulating triglyceride levels influencing type 2 diabetes, glucose levels, or insulin resistance [^114LoPgv]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The causal nature of associations between circulating triglycerides, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes is unclear. We aimed to use Mendelian randomization to test the hypothesis that raised circulating triglyceride levels causally influence the risk of type 2 diabetes and raise normal fasting glucose levels and hepatic insulin resistance.

Research Design and Methods

We tested 10 common genetic variants robustly associated with circulating triglyceride levels against the type 2 diabetes status in 5,637 case and 6,860 control subjects and four continuous outcomes (reflecting glycemia and hepatic insulin resistance) in 8,271 nondiabetic individuals from four studies.

Results

Individuals carrying greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles had increased circulating triglyceride levels (SD 0.59 [95% CI 0.52–0.65] difference between the 20% of individuals with the most alleles and the 20% with the fewest alleles). There was no evidence that the carriers of greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles were at increased risk of type 2 diabetes (per weighted allele odds ratio [OR] 0.99 [95% CI 0.97–1.01]; P = 0.26). In nondiabetic individuals, there was no evidence that carriers of greater numbers of triglyceride-raising alleles had increased fasting insulin levels (SD 0.00 per weighted allele [95% CI -0.01 to 0.02]; P = 0.72) or increased fasting glucose levels (0.00 [-0.01 to 0.01]; P = 0.88). Instrumental variable analyses confirmed that genetically raised circulating triglyceride levels were not associated with increased diabetes risk, fasting glucose, or fasting insulin and, for diabetes, showed a trend toward a protective association (OR per 1-SD increase in log(10) triglycerides: 0.61 [95% CI 0.45–0.83]; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Genetically raised circulating triglyceride levels do not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or raise fasting glucose or fasting insulin levels in nondiabetic individuals. One explanation for our results is that raised circulating triglycerides are predominantly secondary to the diabetes disease process rather than causal.

### Hypertension, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome [^115VwYFo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Impaired glucose homeostasis, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high blood pressure, and central obesity tend to cluster in patients to generate a syndrome, the metabolic syndrome. In the adult population, the metabolic syndrome prevalence ranges between 15% and 25%. Poor fibrinolysis and low-grade inflammation also are associated with the metabolic syndrome, and they contribute to make it a condition that predisposes to cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance and attendant hyperinsulinemia are the characteristic features of the metabolic syndrome and probably are responsible for impairment in glucose homeostasis, dyslipidemia, and higher blood pressure through cause-and-effect relationships. While awaiting the results of clinical trials with cardiovascular endpoints, we should treat the metabolic syndrome with aggressive lifestyle intervention and consider drugs that improve the whole cardiovascular risk profile.

### Effects of hypertriglyceridemia with or without NEFA elevation on β-cell function and insulin clearance and sensitivity [^112KXTqJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and might contribute to its pathogenesis either directly or through elevation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs).

Objective

This study aimed at comparing the glucometabolic effects of acute hypertriglyceridemia alone or combined with NEFA elevation in subjects without diabetes.

Methods

Twenty-two healthy lean volunteers underwent 5-hour intravenous infusions of either saline or Intralipid, without (n = 12) or with heparin (I + H; n = 10) to activate the release of NEFAs. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed during the last 3 hours of infusion. Insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion rate (ISR), model-derived β-cell function, and insulin clearance were measured after 2 hours of lipid infusion and during the OGTTs.

Results

In fasting conditions, both lipid infusions increased plasma insulin and ISR and reduced insulin clearance without affecting plasma glucose and insulin sensitivity. These effects on insulin and ISR were more pronounced for I + H than Intralipid alone. During the OGTT, the lipid infusions markedly impaired glucose tolerance, increased plasma insulin and ISR, and decreased insulin sensitivity and clearance, without significant group differences. Intralipid alone inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (ie, β-cell glucose sensitivity) and increased β-cell potentiation, whereas I + H had neutral effects on these β-cell functions.

Conclusion

In healthy nonobese subjects, mild acute hypertriglyceridemia directly reduces glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and clearance, and has selective and opposite effects on β-cell function that are neutralized by NEFAs. These findings provide new insight into plausible biological signals that generate and sustain insulin resistance and chronic hyperinsulinemia in the development of T2D.

### Approach to the patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117BhF6u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder encountered in clinical practice. Plasma triglycerides are a marker for the concentration of triglycerides carried in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles. A fasting triglyceride level < 150 mg/dL is accepted widely as the upper limit of normal range. Guidelines for hypertriglyceridemia are variable without a global consensus on classification and goals for triglyceride levels. A general classification of hypertriglyceridemia is mild < 200 mg/dL, moderate = 200 to 500 mg/dL, moderate to severe = 500 to 1000 mg/dL, and severe > 1000 mg/dL. Because moderate hypertriglyceridemia does increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, it is important to determine the underlying etiology to guide appropriate and timely management. This article provides stepwise recommendations on the diagnosis and management of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, based on 3 common scenarios encountered in clinical practice. Initial steps in management include evaluating for secondary contributors, especially diabetes mellitus. Based on patient characteristics, appropriate management decisions include lifestyle adjustments aimed at weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption and use of statin and nonstatin therapies.

### PPAR-α agonist fenofibrate reduces insulin resistance in impaired glucose tolerance patients with hypertriglyceridemia: a cross-sectional study [^113y7Ydt]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence accumulated has shown that hypertriglyceridemia causes an excess of FFA, which could increase insulin resistance and the secreting load of β-cells, with "lipotoxicity" that is an important pathogenetic factor directly associated with peripheral tissue insulin resistance and islet β-cell dysfunction. On the other hand, hyperinsulinemia increases triglycerides and closes the vicious circle eventually. When insulin secretion is insufficient and blood glucose levels rise, prediabetes become overt. Therefore, insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction might be the result of chronic exposure to hypertriglyceridemia. PPAR-α agonists might increase insulin sensitivity and protect β-cell function through decreasing hypertriglyceridemia. PPAR-α agonists significantly attenuate muscle TG, total liver TG content, and visceral fat weight, indicating that PPAR-α agonists ameliorate insulin resistance and the secreting load of islet β-cells through reducing ectopic lipid storage. In addition, PPAR-α agonists reduce the levels of FFA, especially when TG levels are markedly increased, which has been identified by our study. Therefore, PPAR-α agonists could promote insulin sensitivity in IGT patients with hypertriglyceridemia through inhibiting "lipotoxicity".

Additionally, HDL-C, an anti-atherogenic lipoprotein, decreases insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. HDL-C may activate the phosphorylation of adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase to induce glucose uptake. Moreover, HDL-C removes cholesterol from β-cells, which regulates islet β-cell function. Low HDL-C has been documented to promote the progression of diabetes. In our study, the fenofibrate treatment significantly increased HDL-C levels, which might exert favorable effects on alleviating insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction.

Furthermore, our finding that BMI is positively related to HOMA2-%B and HOMA2-IR and negatively associated with HOMA2-%S and McA is consistent with the previous study showing that a reduction in BMI was associated with a decrease in HOMA-β and an improvement in insulin sensitivity in obese individuals. Thus, the reduction of BMI may lead to improving β-cell function, reducing insulin resistance, and decreasing the needs for compensatory hyperinsulinemia. PPAR-α agonists have been reported to elicit brown adipocytes and to induce weight loss in diet-induced obese mice, which might cause the protection of insulin sensitivity and islet β-cell function. However, no significant change was observed in BMI after 12 weeks of fenofibrate treatment compared with the baseline in the HTG group in our study, since observation time might not be long enough.

Hypertriglyceridemia pathophysiology — production, clearance, and lipoproteins: Plasma triglyceride level reflects the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (VLDL and chylomicrons), and the concentration of VLDL cholesterol and apoB is at least 10 times higher than the corresponding chylomicron concentration, even after consumption of a large amount of fat. Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased triglyceride production, or reduced triglyceride catabolism, or both, and clearance of VLDL from the circulation is reduced in many patients with hypertriglyceridemia, in part due to saturation of triglyceride clearance. Defective lipolysis is linked to genetic defects in LpL or apoC-II, impaired association of LpL with the vascular wall, or defective intracellular LpL processing, and severe hyperchylomicronemia also occurs when a secondary cause such as diabetes or pregnancy is superimposed on an underlying genetic defect. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL particles are heterogeneous and often have a high apoC-III/apoE ratio, causing reduced clearance and increased conversion to LDL. The common forms of hypertriglyceridemia emerge as adults get older and become overweight and sedentary and develop insulin resistance.

### Mechanisms of disease: lessons from ethnicity in the role of triglyceride metabolism in ischemic heart disease [^111hzZiJ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Mean risk factor levels in various ethnic groups illustrate the potential importance of triglyceride metabolism in the risk for ischemic heart disease (IHD). Serum triglyceride concentrations are a surrogate for a range of potentially atherogenic disturbances in lipoprotein species, including increased concentrations of remnants of VLDL and chylomicron metabolism, increased small, dense LDL concentrations and reduced HDL concentrations. Differences between at-risk groups in lipoprotein profiles reflect alterations in the metabolism of triglycerides that might be greater than differences observed when only circulating triglyceride concentrations are measured. This atherogenic lipoprotein profile is typically found in association with increased visceral fat, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and might be a characteristic of Asian Indian ethnicity. By contrast, despite being relatively insulin resistant, Afro-Caribbean men in the UK have a low risk of IHD and lack the adverse lipoprotein profile. This could result from secretion of relatively large proportions of their VLDL as small, triglyceride-poor particles, levels of which are not augmented in response to loss of insulin action. These considerations re-endorse the potential importance of triglyceride metabolism in IHD and present opportunities for identifying useful areas in which drug targets for reducing IHD risk can be sought.

### Extreme hypertriglyceridemia managed with insulin [^112z52Dg]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Extreme hypertriglyceridemia can lead to acute pancreatitis and rapid lowering of serum triglycerides (TG) is necessary for preventing such life-threatening complications. However, there is no established consensus on the acute management of extreme hypertriglyceridemia. We retrospectively reviewed 10 cases of extreme hypertriglyceridemia with mean serum TG on presentation of 101.5 ± 23.4 mmol/L (8982 ± 2070 mg/dL) managed with insulin. Serum TG decreased by 87 ± 4% in 24 hours in those patients managed with intravenous insulin and fasting and 40 ± 8.4% in those managed with intravenous insulin alone (P = 0.0003). The clinical course was uncomplicated in all except 1 patient who subsequently developed a pancreatic pseudocyst. Thus, combination of intravenous insulin with fasting appears to be an effective, simple, and safe treatment strategy in immediate management of extreme hypertriglyceridemia.

Insulin resistance and lipoproteins profile alterations

VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein, is assembled and produced in the liver, which depends on the availability of substrates and is tightly regulated by insulin. Hepatic VLDL production is induced in the fasting state, which results in increased levels of VLDL in the blood. The increase of lipids from different sources, such as circulating FFA, endocytosis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and de novo lipogenesis, allows for the posttranslational stabilization of apoB and enhances the assembly and secretion of VLDL particles. This leads to VLDL and FFA production, which carries energy between the liver and the adipose tissue. In response to insulin secretion, VLDL synthesis is inhibited to limit the level of plasma triglycerides. Normally, insulin, through PI3K activation, promotes the degradation of apoB, but under insulin resistance this degradation is impaired. Thus, facing a combination of: (1) an excess of fatty acids available, (2) a limited degradation of apoB, and (3) greater stabilization of apoB; an increase in VLDL synthesis is produced, which explains the hypertriglyceridemia observed under insulin resistance.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^1178AxCX]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

An increase in TG-rich lipoproteins is commonly associated with a reduction in HDL and an increase in small dense LDL levels. Hypertriglyceridemia stimulates the enzymatic activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which facilitates the transfer of TG from TG -rich lipoproteins to HDL and LDL in exchange for cholesteryl esters. This leads to an increase in TG content of HDL and LDL. TG -enriched HDL particles are subject to increased catabolism; consequently, they have a short plasma half-life. TG-enriched LDL particles undergo subsequent hydrolysis via LpL or hepatic lipase, thereby reducing LDL particle size. In addition, the difference in metabolic fate between VLDL1 and VLDL2 may also account for the increased formation of small dense LDL. Kinetic data show that large TG -rich VLDL1 particles yield small dense LDL whereas smaller and denser VLDL2 particles are metabolized to normal sized LDL.

TG may also stimulate atherogenesis by other mechanisms, which include the production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen and coagulation factors and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therefore, their roles in atherogenesis have a basic biological plausibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia as a major component of atherogenic dyslipidemia related to insulin resistance, MS and T2DM

Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased TG production, or reduced TG catabolism, or both. Drugs such as bile acid resins, estrogens, isotretinoin and steroids; marked alcohol and fat ingestion in a susceptible patient; or conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes or pregnancy can result in high triglyceride levels.

One of the reason for hypertriglyceridemia is alcohol consumption. Alcohol intake increases hepatic fatty acid synthesis and decreases fatty acid oxidation, with a net effect to stimulate hepatic VLDL TG secretion. The effects of alcohol are dose-dependent. However the most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to overweight and sedentary life style which leads to insulin resistance. This setting of hypertriglyceridemia is typical for MS and T2DM. The increase in TG production may be due to excess FFA returning to the liver, particularly in the setting of visceral obesity and insulin resistance, and increased de novo TG production due to hyperinsulinemia. In hypertriglyceridemia, more VLDL particles, as measured by apoB, and larger and more TG- and apoC-III-enriched lipoproteins are found. Hepatic insulin resistance may contribute to a high production rate of VLDL because insulin reduces apoB synthesis and VLDL secretion in the liver. Although insulin resistance is associated with high triglycerides, VLDL and TG concentrations can be similar in patients with widely divergent insulin sensitivity.

Decision tree for hypertriglyceridemia in T2D — For individuals with T2D and triglyceride level above goal ≤ 150 mg/dL, optimize glycemic control and consult with a registered dietitian for diet education and decreased calorie intake to achieve healthy weight; under the TRIGLYCERIDES < 500 mg/dL branch, initiate a low-carbohydrate diet with reduced fat (30% to 35% of total calories), consider insulin as needed for glycemic control, and if TG remain > 200 mg/dL and lipids are not at goal with maximal statin, measure Apo B and use fibrates to achieve goal Apo B < 90 mg/dL, adding icosapent ethyl (IPE) if not at lipid goal and ASCVD risk is very high (T2D with ≥ 2 additional ASCVD traditional risk factors); under the TRIGLYCERIDES ≥ 500 mg/dL branch, initiate a low-fat (≤ 20% to 25% total calories), no-added-sugar diet, use insulin as needed, ensure statin use aligned with ASCVD risk with lipid monitoring, use fibrates and as needed a high-grade omega-3 fatty acid (EPA or IPE) to lower triglycerides, and add niacin only if triglycerides remain > 1000 mg/dL to decrease risk of pancreatitis; footnotes advise, as possible, to use diabetes agents promoting weight loss or weight neutrality and note that over-the-counter fish-oil dietary supplements are not Food and Drug Administration–approved for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.

### Increased VLDL-triglyceride secretion precedes impaired control of endogenous glucose production in obese, normoglycemic men [^112b5XrA]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Insulin-resistant conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, are associated with plasma lipid abnormalities comprising hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol concentrations, small and dense LDL particles, and excessive postprandial lipemia. These atherogenic lipid abnormalities often precede both impaired glycemic control and overt type 2 diabetes by several years, indicating that altered lipoprotein metabolism is an early event in the development of insulin resistance. Evidence suggests that increased secretion of VLDL–triglycerides (TGs), primarily in the subfraction of large, TG-rich VLDL particles (VLDL 1), is an early feature of insulin-resistant dyslipidemia, as reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The impact of male obesity on VLDL-TG and VLDL–apolipoprotein B (apoB) kinetics has been examined in relatively few studies. In studies by Mittendorfer et al. basal VLDL-TG secretion rates into plasma were increased by > 150% in obese compared with lean men, with no significant difference in clearance rates, resulting in ~150% greater VLDL-TG concentrations. Correspondingly, in studies by Chan et al. VLDL-apoB secretion rates were increased in obese men. To our knowledge, the suppressive effect of acute hyperinsulinemia on hepatic VLDL-TG secretion has not been studied previously in obese men. In nonobese men, acute hyperinsulinemia significantly decreased hepatic secretion of VLDL-TG and VLDL-apoB. Moreover, Mittendorfer et al. explored physiological insulin surges during glucose infusion and found that increased glucose levels acutely decrease VLDL-TG secretion into plasma by ~50% and VLDL-TG clearance by ~30% in both obese and lean men. However, with this design, it is not possible to distinguish between the separate effects of hyperglycemia and concomitant hyperinsulinemia on VLDL-TG kinetics.

Hypertriglyceridemia severity thresholds and clinical implications: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, i.e., 200–999 mg/dl, is due to excess circulating VLDL. In patients with severe or very severe triglyceride levels (≥ 1000 mg/dl), the LpL removal system is saturated, and triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl can rapidly increase after a fat-rich meal. Very severe triglyceride levels (> 2000 mg/dl) are associated with lipemic serum and risk of pancreatitis in the chylomicronemia syndrome. Foods that contain potent substrates for triglyceride production such as simple sugars, fructose, and alcohol can substantially increase triglyceride levels in susceptible people.

### Elevated triglyceride-glucose index is a risk factor for cardiovascular events in adults with type 1 diabetes: a cohort study [^1148f4qS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Insulin normally enhances lipid storage in adipose tissue and suppresses lipolysis. Insulin resistance disrupts this suppression and leads to increased lipolysis, resulting in increased levels of fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines. Elevated free fatty levels stimulate VLDL secretion of VLDL which can contribute to hypertriglyceridemia. This is a potential mechanism by which the TyG index, which encompasses both triglycerides and glucose, can serve as a biomarker of insulin resistance.

Type 1 diabetes is primarily caused by absolute insulin deficiency however, insulin resistance can also occur and is influenced by factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and hypertension. This condition, known as 'double diabetes', may lead to increased insulin requirements and make it difficult to control blood glucose levels. The increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome among patients with T1DM highlights the importance of assessing the degree of insulin resistance in patients with T1DM. In our study, higher TyG quartile group showed higher proportions of individuals with metabolic dysfunction. This finding indicates that the TyG index, despite being composed of triglycerides and fasting glucose, has the potential to identify metabolic syndromes in patients with T1DM. Furthermore, in our subgroup analysis, a higher TyG index was associated with increased risk of CVD especially in patients under 50 years of age, female, with a BMI below 23, without HTN, and who have higher fasting glucose. This finding underscores the importance of screening using the TyG index to reduce the cardiovascular risk in these patients. One possible explanation for the stronger association observed in younger individuals, those with lower BMI, and those without HTN is that insulin resistance, as reflected by the TyG index, may play a more central role in driving cardiovascular risk in these groups before other metabolic risk factors develop, while the absence of traditional risk factors may make the impact of the TyG index more pronounced. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.
