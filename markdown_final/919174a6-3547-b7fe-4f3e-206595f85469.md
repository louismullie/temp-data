## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tirzepatide. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the regulatory indications and dosing. Next, I will review glycemic efficacy in type 2 diabetes, followed by weight loss outcomes in obesity. After that, I need to check cardiovascular and renal data, safety and tolerability, special populations, and practical prescribing considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line clinical take and highlight uncertainties and ongoing research, making sure I anchor each claim to high-quality sources and correct any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the identity and mechanism. Tirzepatide is a once-weekly, subcutaneous dual incretin receptor agonist targeting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, designed as a 39–amino acid peptide with a C20 fatty diacid moiety that prolongs half-life to about 5 days, enabling weekly dosing; its GLP-1 receptor affinity is lower than native GLP-1, while GIP receptor affinity is comparable to native GIP, which may contribute to distinct pharmacodynamics and tolerability profiles [^112J2cK5] [^113din4m].

> I need to verify the regulatory status and labeled dosing. In the United States, tirzepatide is FDA-approved as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and as Zepbound for chronic weight management; dosing starts at 2.5 mg once weekly and is titrated by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to 5, 10, or 15 mg based on glycemic or weight-loss response and tolerability, with a maximum of 15 mg weekly [^113f3NeX] [^114sqLaq].

> Next, I should review glycemic efficacy in type 2 diabetes. Across the SURPASS phase 3 program, tirzepatide produced dose-dependent HbA1c reductions of about 1.9–2.6% versus placebo and outperformed active comparators including semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine; importantly, a substantial proportion achieved normoglycemia (HbA1c < 5.7%) without excess hypoglycemia, and time-in-range and glycemic variability improved as well [^1159HT6X] [^112gL1iv] [^1162jnPT] [^111iqBD1] [^113SwQUp].

> Hold on, I should verify weight outcomes in obesity. In SURMOUNT-1, tirzepatide achieved mean weight loss of 15.0%, 19.5%, and 20.9% at 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively, versus 3.1% with placebo over 72 weeks, with high proportions achieving ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss; SURMOUNT-2 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes showed 12.8% and 14.7% mean weight loss at 10 and 15 mg versus 3.2% with placebo, alongside significant HbA1c reductions [^115qC5gV] [^111XbLk3] [^1128YgBB] [^111XbLk3] [^11198zw8].

> I will now examine cardiovascular and renal signals. A pre-specified meta-analysis of SURPASS trials showed no excess major adverse cardiovascular events versus comparators, meeting conventional cardiovascular safety criteria; observational data suggest lower all-cause mortality and fewer adverse cardiovascular or kidney events versus GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SURPASS-4 post hoc analyses indicated slower eGFR decline and greater albuminuria reduction versus insulin glargine; critically, SUMMIT demonstrated reduced risk of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure in HFpEF with obesity, marking a disease-modifying outcome in that population [^114SEjot] [^116NPjhX] [^112pgMPA] [^111yV6ax] [^111FHq7j].

> Wait, let me verify the safety and tolerability profile. Gastrointestinal adverse effects predominate and are dose-related but generally mild to moderate and diminish over time; hypoglycemia risk is low unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas; rare events include pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, and acute kidney injury with severe GI losses; importantly, tirzepatide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 due to rodent C-cell tumor signals, and pregnancy should prompt discontinuation given insufficient human data and animal findings [^116dVEeu] [^114GPyAp] [^113f3NeX] [^114L5VQJ].

> Let me consider special populations. In older adults, efficacy and safety appear comparable overall, though slower titration and vigilance for GI intolerance and weight loss are prudent; in renal or hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is required, but renal function should be monitored with significant GI adverse effects; pediatric type 2 diabetes data are emerging, with SURPASS-PEDS showing robust HbA1c and BMI reductions in adolescents, though pediatric approval remains investigational in many regions [^1134EnJ1] [^112Z6Mkf] [^115oGW6y].

> I should double-check practical prescribing details. Start at 2.5 mg weekly, increase by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to 5, 10, or 15 mg based on response and tolerability; administer subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, rotating sites; counsel on GI effects, hydration, and when to seek care for persistent vomiting or abdominal pain; coordinate with insulin or sulfonylurea regimens to mitigate hypoglycemia risk during titration [^114sqLaq] [^113f3NeX].

> But wait, what about comparative effectiveness and uncertainties. Head-to-head data versus semaglutide 2.4 mg in obesity (SURMOUNT-5) show greater weight loss with tirzepatide, and indirect comparisons in type 2 diabetes suggest larger HbA1c and weight effects versus semaglutide 2.4 mg; however, definitive cardiovascular outcomes are pending with SURPASS-CVOT, and mechanistic distinctions attributable to GIP co-agonism — including effects on insulin sensitivity and adipose biology — remain active areas of inquiry [^1131JNcQ] [^117M4RJf] [^117DWbjH] [^112uLMbx].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line. Tirzepatide is a first-in-class dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist with unprecedented glycemic and weight-loss efficacy, a favorable cardiometabolic risk profile, and acceptable tolerability when titrated thoughtfully; it is a preferred option for patients with type 2 diabetes who need robust A1c lowering and weight loss, and for adults with obesity or overweight with comorbidities pursuing chronic weight management, while ongoing trials will clarify long-term cardiovascular outcomes and broader disease-modifying potential [^114hCMpb] [^113f3NeX] [^111FHq7j].

---

Tirzepatide is a **once-weekly dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist** [^112J2cK5] that delivers **superior glycemic control and weight loss** in type 2 diabetes and obesity, with dose-dependent HbA1c reductions of 1.8–2.6% and weight loss of 12–20% in trials [^1159HT6X] [^111XbLk3] [^1128YgBB]. It is **FDA-approved for T2D (Mounjaro)** [^113f3NeX] and **chronic weight management (Zepbound)** [^113f3NeX], and is generally well tolerated with gastrointestinal side effects and low hypoglycemia risk [^116dVEeu]. Cardiovascular outcomes are under evaluation [^117DWbjH], with early data suggesting neutral or favorable effects [^114SEjot] [^116NPjhX].

---

## Mechanism of action

Tirzepatide **co-activates GIP and GLP-1 receptors** [^112J2cK5], enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying, and reducing appetite [^111PxW4W] [^112FUxfo]. This dual incretin action yields greater glycemic and weight effects than GLP-1 agonists alone [^112gL1iv] [^1131JNcQ].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

- **HbA1c reduction**: 1.8–2.6% across 5–15 mg doses; superior to semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine [^111FhHLD] [^112gL1iv] [^1162jnPT].
- **Weight loss**: 6–12 kg; greater than semaglutide 1 mg and basal insulins [^113SwQUp] [^1162jnPT].
- **Normoglycemia**: 23–62% achieved HbA1c < 5.7% without excess hypoglycemia [^111iqBD1].

---

### Obesity

- **Weight loss**: 15–20% at 72 weeks in SURMOUNT-1; 12–15% in SURMOUNT-2 (T2DM with obesity) [^115qC5gV] [^111KHr1A] [^111XbLk3] [^11198zw8].
- **Dose-response**: Higher doses yield greater weight loss and cardiometabolic improvements [^115qC5gV] [^1128YgBB].
- **Maintenance**: Continued therapy sustains weight loss and prevents regain [^115JoLWw] [^115QX75f].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation; mild-to-moderate and transient [^116dVEeu].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low risk unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^114GPyAp].
- **Serious adverse events**: Pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, acute kidney injury, and retinopathy exacerbation are rare but reported [^113f3NeX].

---

## Cardiovascular outcomes

A pre-specified meta-analysis showed **no excess MACE versus comparators** [^114SEjot], meeting cardiovascular safety criteria. Observational data suggest **lower all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular or kidney events versus GLP-1 RAs** [^116NPjhX] [^112pgMPA]. Dedicated outcomes trials, including **SURPASS-CVOT**, are ongoing [^117DWbjH].

---

## Regulatory status and clinical guidelines

Tirzepatide is **FDA-approved for T2D (Mounjaro)** [^113f3NeX] and **chronic weight management (Zepbound)** [^113f3NeX]. Guidelines endorse its use in T2D, especially when weight loss is prioritized, and recognize its **superior efficacy** [^114hCMpb].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

- **Cardiovascular outcomes**: SURPASS-CVOT will clarify MACE effects [^117DWbjH].
- **Heart failure**: SUMMIT is evaluating HFpEF outcomes [^111FHq7j].
- **Pediatrics**: SURPASS-PEDS supports adolescent T2D efficacy and safety [^115oGW6y].
- **Real-world data**: Studies are assessing long-term effectiveness and safety [^113ANKQQ].

---

Tirzepatide is a **dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist** with **superior glycemic and weight effects**, a favorable safety profile, and expanding indications; ongoing trials will define cardiovascular and broader metabolic benefits.

### The importance of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor activation for the effects of tirzepatide [^112uLMbx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a unimolecular co-agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors recently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Tirzepatide treatment results in an unprecedented improvement of glycaemic control and lowering of body weight, but the contribution of the GIP receptor-activating component of tirzepatide to these effects is uncertain. In this review, we present the current knowledge about the physiological roles of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP, their receptors, and previous results of co-targeting the two incretin hormone receptors in humans. We also analyse the molecular pharmacological, preclinical and clinical effects of tirzepatide to discuss the role of GIP receptor activation for the clinical effects of tirzepatide. Based on the available literature on the combination of GLP-1 and GIP receptor activation, tirzepatide does not seem to have a classical co-activating mode of action in humans. Rather, in vitro studies of the human GLP-1 and GIP receptors reveal a biased GLP-1 receptor activation profile and GIP receptor downregulation. Therefore, we propose three hypotheses for the mode of action of tirzepatide, which can be addressed in future, elaborate clinical trials.

### Effects of tirzepatide on weight management in patients with and without diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pCqxb]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing tirzepatide versus placebo for weight management, with analyses stratified by diabetes status to precisely assess its efficacy and safety in individuals with and without diabetes.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing once-weekly tirzepatide (5-15mg) versus placebo in adults with or without diabetes for at least 26 weeks. For each subpopulation analysis, the random-effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs), with their 95% confidence intervals, for dichotomous and continuous endpoints, respectively. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05.

Results

We included five trials (n = 2,174) in patients with diabetes (BMI ≥ 23kg/m 2) and five (n = 4,467) in patients without diabetes (BMI ≥ 27 [≥ 24 in Asia] kg/m 2). Compared with placebo, tirzepatide led to significantly greater relative and absolute weight reductions in patients with (RR -9.54%, p < 0.01; MD -9.06kg, p < 0.01) and without diabetes (RR -17.15%, p < 0.01; MD -18.11kg, p < 0.01). In both subpopulations, tirzepatide also significantly increased the probability of achieving weight reductions of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15%, as well as improved BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid levels. Notably, weight-related benefits with tirzepatide were significantly greater in patients without diabetes, whereas its safety was similar across subpopulations and predominantly consisted of mild to moderate, well-tolerated adverse events.

Conclusions

Compared with placebo, tirzepatide resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight reduction, especially in patients without diabetes (with overweight/obesity), with an acceptable safety profile.

### Tirzepatide cardiovascular event risk assessment: a pre-specified meta-analysis [^114SEjot]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Despite favorable effects of tirzepatide on a range of cardiovascular risk factors, to date its cardiovascular safety has been reported from results of only a single trial, SURPASS-4. This trial, which compared tirzepatide treatment to insulin glargine 100 U mL −1 treatment in people with T2D at increased cardiovascular risk, suggested no significant difference in the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

As required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) –, and to extend the safety evaluation in a broader population with T2D, the tirzepatide clinical development program for treatment of T2D (SURPASS) was also designed to evaluate the drug's cardiovascular safety in people with T2D at low, medium and high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, a cardiovascular safety meta-analysis of data, from all phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials with planned treatment duration of at least 26 weeks and at least one randomized comparator arm among adults with T2D, was conducted to assess the safety of tirzepatide with regard to major cardiovascular events relative to various randomized comparators.

Here we present the results of these pre-specified cardiovascular safety meta-analyses and selected post hoc exploratory analyses of interest, based on prospectively collected and centrally adjudicated MACE events.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-PEDS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^115oGW6y]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current treatment options for youth-onset type 2 diabetes are limited and have demonstrated lower glycaemic efficacy than those for adult-onset type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared with placebo in youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (39 sites), multinational (eight countries) trial over 30 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for 22 weeks in which all participants received tirzepatide. Participants aged 10 to < 18 years with youth-onset type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin and/or basal insulin were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo administered by subcutaneous injection with a single-dose pen. Randomisation was stratified by age group (≤ 14 years or > 14 years) and antihyperglycaemic medication use (metformin, basal insulin, or both). All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment during the 30-week double-blind period. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) from baseline to week 30. Data from all participants who received at least one dose of study drug were used to analyse efficacy and safety. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05260021).

Findings

Between April 12, 2022, and Dec 27, 2023, 146 participants were screened, of whom 99 (60 [61%] female, 39 [39%] male; mean age 14.7 years [SD 1.8]; mean baseline HbA 1c 8.04% [1.23]) were randomly assigned to tirzepatide 5 mg (n = 32), tirzepatide 10 mg (n = 33), or placebo (n = 34). At week 30, tirzepatide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA 1c, with a mean reduction of 2.23% in the pooled tirzepatide group versus an increase of 0.05% in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference -2.28%; 95% CI -2.87 to -1.69; p < 0.0001). Glycaemic efficacy was sustained up to 52 weeks with tirzepatide treatment. Tirzepatide also resulted in significant reductions in BMI of 7.4% and 11.2% for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared with 0.4% in the placebo group at 30 weeks. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide treatment were gastrointestinal, all mild to moderate in severity, and decreased over time. Two (6%) patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg group discontinued study drug due to an adverse event. The safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with that reported in adults. No deaths were reported during the study period.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control and BMI compared with placebo. These effects were sustained over 1 year.

Funding

Eli Lilly and Company.

### Continued treatment with tirzepatide for maintenance of weight reduction in adults with obesity: the SURMOUNT-4 randomized clinical trial [^115JoLWw]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-4 was published by Louis J Aronne and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of continued treatment with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight? In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the population was: 670 patients (473 female, 197 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² and a weight-related complication. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; prior or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication that promotes weight loss within 3 months prior to enrollment. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the interventions were: n = 335 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10–15 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 52 weeks after a lead-in 36-week period of receiving tirzepatide) n = 335 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 52 weeks after a lead-in 36-week period of receiving tirzepatide). In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in weight from week 36 to 88 (5.5% vs. -14%; ARD 19.4, 95% CI 17.7 to 21.2). In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in body weight from week 36 to 88 (4.7 kg vs. -11.1 kg; AD 15.8 kg, 95% CI 14.3 to 17.3) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference from week 36 to 88 (4.3 cm vs. -7.8 cm; AD 12.1 cm, 95% CI 10.6 to 13.5) Significant increase in maintenance of ≥ 80% body weight reduction during 36-week lead-in at week 88 (89.5% vs. 16.6%; AD 44%, 95% CI 24.9 to 77.5). In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the conclusion was: in adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² and a weight-related complication, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to mean reduction in weight from week 36 to 88.

### Tirzepatide once weekly for the treatment of obesity [^111KHr1A]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) was published by Ania M Jastreboff and colleagues in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of mid-dose tirzepatide in adults with obesity? In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the population was: 1279 patients (863 female, 416 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m², or > 27 kg/m² and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; a change in body weight > 5 kg within 90 days before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication that promotes weight loss within 90 days before screening. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 636 mid-dose tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10 mg once weekly for a total of 72 weeks) n = 643 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (19.5% vs. 3.1%; AD 16.4%, 95% CI 14.8 to 17.9). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (88.9% vs. 34.5%; AD 54.4%, 95% CI 22.12 to 86.68) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (78.1% vs. 18.8%; AD 59.3%, 95% CI 24.11 to 94.49) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference (17.7 cm vs. 4 cm; AD 13.8 cm, 95% CI 12.3 to 15.2). In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-1 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adults with a BMI > 30 kg/m², or > 27 kg/m² and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, mid-dose tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### Use of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: scientific evidence and practical aspects [^112dpbX2]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel antidiabetic medication a single-molecule, agonist to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors. It is approved in the USA and EU for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Due to the potential novelty represented by incorporating tirzepatide to clinical practice, we aim to review practical aspects of tirzepatide use in T2DM and the supporting scientific evidence. A group of ten endocrinologists involved as investigators in the phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program followed a nominal group technique, a qualitative research methodology designed as a semi-structured group discussion to reach a consensus on the selection of a set of practical aspects. The scientific evidence for tirzepatide has been reviewed with respect to a number of patients' clinical profiles and care goals. Information of interest related to adverse events, special warnings and precautions, and other considerations for tirzepatide use has been included. Finally, information provided to the patients has been summarized. The practical aspects reported herein may be helpful in guiding physicians in the use of tirzepatide and contribute to optimizing the management of T2DM.

### Effect of tirzepatide on blood pressure and lipids: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113aoJVH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To perform a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of tirzepatide on blood pressure and lipids.

Methods

PubMed, Ovid/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library and CINAHL databases were screened and the randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of tirzepatide on either blood pressure or lipid profiles were included.

Results

Seven randomized controlled trials have investigated the effects of tirzepatide on blood pressure and lipid profiles. Regardless of the dose administered, tirzepatide resulted in significant decreases in systolic blood pressure of median -4.20(95% confidence interval [CI] -5.17 to -3.23)mmHg for 5mg, -5.34(-6.31 to -4.37)mmHg for 10mg, and -5.77(-6.73to -4.81)mmHg for 15mg. At all three once-weekly doses, tirzepatide treatment resulted in significant decreases in total cholesterol levels: median -3.76% (95% CI -5.20% to -2.31%) for 5mg; -4.63% (-6.07% to -3.19%) for 10mg; and -5.93% (-7.36% to -4.49%) for 15mg. Additionally, tirzepatide treatment led to increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide induced clinically meaningful reductions in the levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, along with increases in the level of HDL cholesterol.

### FDA's concerns with unapproved GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss… [^116bmyfd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Compounding and the FDA: Questions and Answers Understanding unapproved versions of these drugs FDA is aware that some patients and health care professionals may look to unapproved versions of GLP-1 receptor agonists) drugs, including semaglutide and tirzepatide, as an option for weight loss. This can be risky for patients, as unapproved versions do not undergo FDA's review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed. FDA is aware of one reported adverse event associated with a product labeled as compounded tirzepatide from a pharmacy that did not actually compound the product. The adverse event report included symptoms such as redness, site swelling, pain, and a red lump at the injection site. Additionally, the agency has received adverse event reports that may be related to patients prescribed compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide products in doses beyond what is in the FDA-approved drug label.

This could mean using more product in a single dose, taking doses more frequently or increasing the amount more quickly. Some of the adverse events are serious and some patients reported seeking medical attention for their symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and constipation. Adverse events related to compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide FDA has received reports of adverse events related to compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide. However, federal law does not require state-licensed pharmacies that are not outsourcing facilities to submit adverse events to FDA so it is likely that adverse events from compounded versions of these drugs are underreported. Many of the adverse events reported for compounded products appear to be consistent with adverse events related to the FDA-approved versions of these products.

Illegal online sales of these drugs FDA monitors the internet for fraudulent or unapproved drugs and has issued warning letters to stop the distribution of illegally marketed semaglutide and tirzepatide. These illegally marketed drugs:

- may be counterfeit
- could contain the wrong ingredients or harmful ingredients
- could contain too little, too much or no active ingredient at all The agency urges consumers to be vigilant when purchasing drugs online and only purchase from state-licensed pharmacies.

The study SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) was published by W Timothy Garvey and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of once-weekly tirzepatide in patients with obesity and T2DM? In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the population was: 627 patients (317 female, 310 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and HbA1c 7–10%. The key exclusion criteria were change in bodyweight > 5 kg within 3 months before screening; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with anti-obesity medications, DPP4 inhibitors, oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, or any injectable therapy for T2DM within 3 months before screening. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 312 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 72 weeks) n = 315 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in least-squares mean reduction in body weight at week 72 (12.8% vs. 3.2%; ETD 9.6, 95% CI 8.1 to 11.1). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (79% vs. 32%; OR 8.3, 95% CI 5.6 to 12.3) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (61% vs. 9%; OR 16.1, 95% CI 9.9 to 26.1) Significant increase in reduction in HbA1c at week 72 (2.07% vs. 0.51%; ETD 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.74). In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse events or serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-2 (tirzepatide 10 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² and HbA1c 7–10%, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to a least-squares mean reduction in body weight at week 72.

### Bridging the gap between GLP1-receptor agonists and cardiovascular outcomes: evidence for the role of tirzepatide [^1151Txq2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a new drug targeting glucagon-like peptide 1(GLP1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptors. This drug has demonstrated great potential in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes. It can lead to weight loss, better glycemic control, and reduced cardiometabolic risk factors. GLP1 receptor agonists have been proven effective antidiabetic medications with possible cardiovascular benefits. Even though they have been proven to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, their effectiveness in treating heart failure is unknown. Unlike traditional GLP1 receptor agonists, tirzepatide is more selective for the GIP receptor, resulting in a more balanced activation of these receptors. This review article discusses the possible mechanisms tirzepatide may use to improve cardiovascular health. That includes the anti-inflammatory effect, the ability to reduce cell death and promote autophagy, and also its indirect effects through blood pressure, obesity, and glucose/lipid metabolism. Additionally, tirzepatide may benefit atherosclerosis and lower the risk of major adverse cardiac events. Currently, clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in patients with heart failure. Overall, tirzepatide's dual agonism of GLP1 and GIP receptors appears to provide encouraging cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control, offering a potential new therapeutic option for treating cardiovascular diseases and heart failure.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for treatment of overweight or obesity. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152PVaq]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies suggest that tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic-peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), has significant weight loss effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight loss in patients with overweight or obesity.

Methods

Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on tirzepatide's weight loss efficacy for these patients. A single arm meta-analysis of proportions estimated primary outcomes, ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss, and adverse events (AEs); while meta-analysis of means estimated secondary outcomes. Comparative meta-analysis was conducted between tirzepatide and control arms where mean differences and odds ratios were estimated for continuous and dichotomous outcomes respectively.

Results

RCTs included in this study revealed that among 5800 patients, 78.22% (95% CI: 72.15% to 83.73%), 55.60% (95% CI: 46.54% to 64.47%), 32.28% (95% CI: 23.17% to 42.12%) achieved ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss, respectively. Tirzepatide 5mg demonstrated weight loss superiority relative to placebo (MD: -12.47kg, 95% CI: -13.94kg to -11.00kg) and semaglutide (n = 1409, MD: -1.90kg, 95% CI: -2.97kg to -0.83kg) with dose-dependent increase for 10mg and 15mg doses. The comparison between tirzepatide and semaglutide was examined in the SURPASS-2 trial that was included in this systematic review. For AEs, there was increase odds of experiencing gastrointestinal AEs with tirzepatide compared to placebo, but no significant difference with semaglutide.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide has significant potential as a weight loss drug in patients with overweight and obesity, with little increase in AEs compared to other weight loss drugs. With its ability to concurrently target multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome, it should be considered as the next helm of weight loss therapies.

### Achieving normoglycemia with tirzepatide: analysis of SURPASS 1–4 trials [^111iqBD1]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tirzepatide is a novel single-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, which demonstrated unprecedented improvements in glycemic control and body weight reduction, in the SURPASS phase 3 program. In this exploratory analysis, we aimed to characterize tirzepatide-treated participants who achieved HbA1c < 5.7% and evaluate changes in clinical markers associated with long-term cardiometabolic health.

Research Design and Methods

Baseline characteristics and change from baseline to week 40 for several efficacy and safety parameters were analyzed according to HbA1c attainment category (< 5.7%, 5.7–6.5%, and > 6.5%) using descriptive statistics in participants taking ≥ 75% of treatment doses, without rescue medication, in the SURPASS 1–4 trials (N = 3,229). Logistic regression models with tirzepatide doses adjusted as a covariate were used to obtain odds ratios and assess the impact of patient characteristics achieving an HbA1c < 5.7%.

Results

Tirzepatide-treated participants who achieved HbA1c < 5.7% were slightly younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower HbA1c value at baseline compared with those who did not achieve HbA1c < 5.7%. In addition, they showed greater improvements in HbA1c, body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, liver enzymes, and lipid parameters without increasing hypoglycemia risk.

Conclusions

Normoglycemia was unprecedently achieved in a significant proportion of participants in the SURPASS clinical program, without increasing hypoglycemia risk, and was associated with an overall improvement in metabolic health.

### Challenging clinical perspectives in type 2 diabetes with tirzepatide, a first-in-class twincretin [^115MiFMz]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a first-in-class GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist ('twincretin')-a single molecule that acts as an agonist at both glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. In the SURPASS clinical trial program in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), tirzepatide was associated with unprecedented reductions in HbA1c, clinically significant weight loss and other metabolic benefits, combined with low rates of hypoglycaemia across a wide range of patient characteristics. The safety and adverse event rate for tirzepatide appears comparable to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Although results from dedicated cardiovascular (CV) and kidney trials are currently not available, information to date suggests that tirzepatide may have CV and kidney benefits in people with T2D. Tirzepatide has been approved for the treatment of T2D in the USA, United Arab Emirates, European Union, Japan and Australia. Here, we review how tirzepatide will fit into the T2D treatment continuum. We also consider future directions with tirzepatide in T2D, including its potential for targeting cardio-renal-metabolic disease in T2D, and discuss how tirzepatide-and other co-agonists in development-may challenge current approaches for management of T2D.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of obesity: rationale and design of the SURMOUNT clinical development program [^113din4m]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a 39‐amino acid synthetic peptide with agonist activity at the glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP‐1 receptors. Preclinical data demonstrated that tirzepatide had equal affinity for GIP receptors compared with native GIP while it bound GLP‐1 receptors with approximately fivefold weaker affinity than native GLP‐1. As a GIP and GLP‐1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide could result in weight reduction beyond that achieved with selective GLP‐1 receptor agonists by affecting tissues not targeted by these mono‐agonist agents and integrating the activation signals of both GIP and GLP‐1 receptor pathways in the brain. In two clinical trials comparing tirzepatide with semaglutide 1 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg in people with T2D, tirzepatide 5 to 15 mg doses were associated with dose‐dependent weight reduction, significantly greater than the weight reduction observed with the selective GLP‐1 receptor agonists. Tirzepatide was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D.

The SURMOUNT clinical development program is evaluating tirzepatide administered subcutaneously once weekly for CWM in people with obesity. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tirzepatide and to support regulatory approval of tirzepatide for CWM. Overall, the program seeks to determine whether tirzepatide results in clinically meaningful weight reduction for people with obesity and improves obesity‐related cardiometabolic risk factors and physical function. It further aims to determine the degree to which treatment with tirzepatide adds to the weight reduction achieved through intensive lifestyle therapy and maintains weight reduction over time. This article presents the trial designs, objectives, end points, and baseline characteristics of the global SURMOUNT clinical development program.

### Once-weekly tirzepatide versus once-daily insulin degludec as add-on to metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-3): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial [^1162jnPT]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus titrated insulin degludec in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

In this open-label, parallel-group, multicentre (122 sites), multinational (13 countries), phase 3 study, eligible participants (aged ≥ 18 years) had a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) of 7.0–10.5%, body-mass index of at least 25 kg/m 2, stable weight, and were insulin-naive and treated with metformin alone or in combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using an interactive web-response system, to once-weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or once-daily subcutaneous injection of titrated insulin degludec, and were stratified by country, HbA 1c, and concomitant use of oral antihyperglycaemic medications. Tirzepatide was initially given at 2.5 mg and the dose was escalated by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. Insulin degludec was initially given at 10 U per day and was titrated once weekly to a fasting self-monitored blood glucose of less than 5.0 mmol/L (< 90 mg/dL), following a treat-to-target algorithm, for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 52. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were non-inferiority of tirzepatide 5 mg versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 52, superiority of all doses of tirzepatide versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c and bodyweight, and the proportion of participants achieving HbA 1c of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 52. We used a boundary of 0.3% to establish non-inferiority in HbA 1c difference between treatments. Efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all participants who received at least one dose of study drug). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03882970, and is complete.

Findings

Between April 1 and Nov 15, 2019, we assessed 1947 participants for eligibility, 1444 of whom were randomly assigned to treatment. The modified intention-to-treat population was 1437 participants from the tirzepatide 5 mg (n = 358), tirzepatide 10 mg (n = 360), tirzepatide 15 mg (n = 359), and insulin degludec (n = 360) groups. From a mean baseline HbA 1c of 8.17% (SD 0.91), the reductions in HbA 1c at week 52 were 1.93% (SE 0.05) for tirzepatide 5 mg, 2.20% (0.05) for tirzepatide 10 mg, and 2.37% (0.05) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and 1.34% (0.05) for insulin degludec. The non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was met. The estimated treatment difference (ETD) versus insulin degludec ranged from -0.59% to -1.04% for tirzepatide (p < 0.0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The proportion of participants achieving a HbA 1c of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 52 was greater (p < 0.0001) in all three tirzepatide groups (82%-93%) versus insulin degludec (61%). At week 52, from a baseline of 94.3 kg (SD 20.1), all three tirzepatide doses decreased bodyweight (-7.5 kg to -12.9 kg), whereas insulin degludec increased bodyweight by 2.3 kg. The ETD versus insulin degludec ranged from -9.8 kg to -15.2 kg for tirzepatide (p < 0.0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The most common adverse events in tirzepatide-treated participants were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events that decreased over time. A higher incidence of nausea (12–24%), diarrhoea (15–17%), decreased appetite (6–12%), and vomiting (6–10%) was reported in participants treated with tirzepatide than in those treated with insulin degludec (2%, 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively). Hypoglycaemia (< 54 mg/dL or severe) was reported in five (1%), four (1%), and eight (2%) participants on tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively, versus 26 (7%) on insulin degludec. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was more common in the tirzepatide groups than in the insulin degludec group. Five participants died during the study; none of the deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the study treatment.

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) was superior to titrated insulin degludec, with greater reductions in HbA 1c and bodyweight at week 52 and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Tirzepatide showed a similar safety profile to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Efficacy and safety of a novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-1): a double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial [^111FhHLD]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite advancements in care, many people with type 2 diabetes do not meet treatment goals; thus, development of new therapies is needed. We aimed to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide monotherapy versus placebo in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone.

Methods

We did a 40-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (SURPASS-1), at 52 medical research centres and hospitals in India, Japan, Mexico, and the USA. Adult participants (≥ 18 years) were included if they had type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and if they were naive to injectable diabetes therapy. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) via computer-generated random sequence to once a week tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg), or placebo. All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the mean change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) from baseline at 40 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03954834.

Findings

From June 3, 2019, to Oct 28, 2020, of 705 individuals assessed for eligibility, 478 (mean baseline HbA 1c 7.9% [63 mmol/mol], age 54.1 years [SD 11.9], 231 [48%] women, diabetes duration 4.7 years, and body-mass index 31.9 kg/m 2) were randomly assigned to tirzepatide 5 mg (n = 121 [25%]), tirzepatide 10 mg (n = 121 [25%]), tirzepatide 15 mg (n = 121 [25%]), or placebo (n = 115 [24%]). 66 (14%) participants discontinued the study drug and 50 (10%) discontinued the study prematurely. At 40 weeks, all tirzepatide doses were superior to placebo for changes from baseline in HbA 1c, fasting serum glucose, bodyweight, and HbA 1c targets of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) and less than 5.7% (< 39 mmol/mol). Mean HbA 1c decreased from baseline by 1.87% (20 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 5 mg, 1.89% (21 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 10 mg, and 2.07% (23 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 15 mg versus +0.04% with placebo (+0.4 mmol/mol), resulting in estimated treatment differences versus placebo of -1.91% (-21 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 5 mg, -1.93% (-21 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 10 mg, and -2.11% (-23 mmol/mol) with tirzepatide 15 mg (all p < 0.0001). More participants on tirzepatide than on placebo met HbA 1c targets of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol; 87–92% vs 20%) and 6.5% or less (≤ 48 mmol/mol; 81–86% vs 10%) and 31–52% of patients on tirzepatide versus 1% on placebo reached an HbA 1c of less than 5.7% (< 39 mmol/mol). Tirzepatide induced a dose-dependent bodyweight loss ranging from 7.0 to 9.5 kg. The most frequent adverse events with tirzepatide were mild to moderate and transient gastrointestinal events, including nausea (12–18% vs 6%), diarrhoea (12–14% vs 8%), and vomiting (2–6% vs 2%). No clinically significant (< 54 mg/dL [< 3 mmol/L]) or severe hypoglycaemia were reported with tirzepatide. One death occurred in the placebo group.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide showed robust improvements in glycaemic control and bodyweight, without increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The safety profile was consistent with GLP-1 receptor agonists, indicating a potential monotherapy use of tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes treatment.

### Designing GLP-1 delivery: structural perspectives and formulation approaches for optimized therapy [^1146ExqZ]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide is a novel, synthetic peptide engineered to achieve dual agonism of both the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor and GLP-1. This 39-amino-acid molecule incorporates structural elements derived from both native GIP and GLP-1, with targeted amino acid substitutions that optimize receptor binding and functional activity. Tirzepatide exhibits C-terminal homology to exenatide and is conjugated to a C20 fatty diacid moiety via a Lys-linked hydrophilic spacer, a modification strategy similar to that employed in semaglutide. These modifications confer an extended elimination half-life of approximately 116.7 h, facilitating once-weekly dosing. Furthermore, tirzepatide demonstrates enhanced affinity for GLP-1R relative to native GLP-1, while simultaneously engaging the GIP receptor, thereby amplifying its therapeutic efficacy in glycemic control and weight reduction (Fig. 5G).

Tirzepatide's mechanism of action combines the effects of two incretin hormones: GIP and GLP-1. Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes downregulates GIP receptor (GIPR) expression and impairs GIP-mediated insulin secretion, rendering high-doses of GIP infusions ineffective. Tirzepatide addresses the limitations of standalone GIP therapy in diabetes by combining GIPR and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonism, leveraging their complementary mechanisms. Its GLP-1 activity reduces blood glucose levels, creating an environment that restores GIPR sensitivity.

Tirzepatide exerts its therapeutic effects through dual agonism of two key incretin receptors: the GIPR and the GLP-1R. In individuals with T2DM, chronic hyperglycemia is known to downregulate GIPR expression and impair GIP-stimulated insulinotropic activity, thereby limiting the efficacy of GIP monotherapy. Consequently, even high-dose GIP infusions have demonstrated minimal glucose-lowering effects in this population. Tirzepatide overcomes these limitations by simultaneously activating both GIPR and GLP-1R, thereby harnessing their complementary mechanisms of action. In parallel, the reduction in glycemic burden induced by GLP-1 activity creates a metabolic milieu that may restore GIPR sensitivity and functionality. This synergistic interaction enhances overall insulinotropic and glucoregulatory efficacy, positioning tirzepatide as a first-in-class dual incretin receptor agonist with superior metabolic outcomes.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112gL1iv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) was published by Juan P Frías and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM? In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the population was: 939 patients (509 female, 430 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; history of pancreatitis; history of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy warranting urgent treatment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic maculopathy. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 470 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 5 mg once weekly, continued for a total of 40 weeks) n = 469 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly, titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 1 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 40 weeks). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40 (2.01% vs. 1.86%; ARD 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in body weight at week 40 (7.6 kg vs. 5.7 kg; ARD 1.9, 95% CI 1 to 2.8) Borderline significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 7.0% (82% vs. 79%; AD 3%, 95% CI -0.01 to 6.01) Significant increase in reduction in HbA1c level < 5.7% (27% vs. 19%; AD 8%, 95% CI 3.25 to 12.75). In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hypoglycemia, ≥ 1 adverse event. In the SURPASS-2 (tirzepatide 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with T2DM, tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide with respect to mean reduction in HbA1c level at week 40.

### Tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^1131JNcQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-5 was published by Louis J Aronne and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tirzepatide compared to semaglutide in patients with obesity? In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the population was: 750 patients (485 female, 265 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with obesity without T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; previous or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication for weight reduction or a GLP-1 receptor agonist in the past 90 days; change in body weight of > 5 kg in the past 90 days. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the interventions were: n = 374 tirzepatide (at a dose of 10 mg or 15 mg SC once weekly for 72 weeks) n = 376 semaglutide (at a dose of 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg SC once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (20.2% vs. 13.7%; MD 6.5, 95% CI 4.9 to 8.1). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in waist circumference at week 72 (18.4 cm vs. 13 cm; MD 5.4, 95% CI 3.6 to 7.1) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (81.6% vs. 60.5%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 25% (31.6% vs. 16.1%; RR 2, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.6). In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-5 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with obesity without T2DM, tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists, in the management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113k3ESu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 are the main incretin hormones, and be responsible for the insulinotropic incretin effect. The addition of a GIP agonist to a GLP-1agonist has been hypothesized to significantly potentiate the weight-losing and glycemia control effect, which might offer a new therapeutic option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The current meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence of primary efficacy and safety outcomes through clinically randomized controlled trials to evaluate integrated potency and signaling properties.

Method

We conducted comprehensive literature searches in Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed for relevant literatures investigating the efficacy and/or safety of Tirzepatide published in the English as of May 30, 2023 was retrieved. We synthesized results using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95 CIs) for continuous outcomes, and odds ratios (ORs) along with 95 Cis for dichotomous outcomes. All analyses were done using Revman version 5.3, STATA version 15.1 and the statistical package 'meta'.

Results

Participants treated with weekly Tirzepatide achieved HbA1c and body weight target values significantly lower than any other comparator without clinically significant increase in the incidence of hypoglycemic events, serious and all-cause fatal adverse events. However, gastrointestinal adverse events and decreased appetite events were reported more frequently with Tirzepatide treatment than with placebo/controls.

Conclusion

The Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, for diabetes therapy has opened a new era on personalized glycemia control and weight loss in a safe manner with broad and promising clinical implications.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^115yHGJT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose-escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose-escalation regimens were: 12mg (4mgweeks 0–3; 8mgweeks 4–7; 12mgweeks 8–11), 15mg-1 (2.5mgweeks 0–1; 5mgweeks 2–3; 10mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11) and 15mg-2 (2.5mgweeks 0–3; 7.5mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12weeks.

Results

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12mg, 29; tirzepatide 15mg-1, 28; tirzepatide 15mg-2, 28. The mean age was 57.4years, HbA1c 8.4% and body mass index 31.9kg/m 2. At week 12, absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo, +0.2% [0.21]; 12mg, -1.7% [0.19]; 15mg-1, -2.0% [0.20]; 15mg-2, -1.8% [0.19]). The incidence of nausea was: placebo, 7.7%; 12mg group, 24.1%; 15mg-1 group, 39.3%; 15mg-2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12mg and 15mg-1 groups.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide treatment for 12weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favourable side effect profile.

### Comparison of dose escalation versus switching to tirzepatide among people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on lower doses of dulaglutide: a randomized clinical trial [^111Ak6Cu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes or obesity, showed clinically meaningful reductions in hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) and body weight in the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trial program.

Objective

To compare efficacy and safety of escalation of dulaglutide dose versus switching to tirzepatide in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 4 trial (SURPASS-SWITCH [A Phase 4, Randomized, Open-Label, Active-Controlled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Switching from Weekly Dulaglutide to Weekly Tirzepatide in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes], ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05564039).

Setting

38 sites across 5 countries.

Participants

Adults with HbA 1c 7.0% or greater to 9.5% or less, stable body weight, body mass index of 25 kg/m 2 or greater, receiving a stable dose of dulaglutide (0.75 or 1.5 mg) for at least 6 months and 0 to 3 oral antihyperglycemic medications for at least 3 months.

Intervention

Escalation of dulaglutide to 4.5 mg or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or switching to tirzepatide.

Measurements

The primary end point was change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 40. The key secondary end point was change from baseline in weight at week 40.

Results

A total of 282 adults were randomly assigned to tirzepatide (n = 139) or dulaglutide (n = 143). Change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 40 was -1.44% (SE, 0.07) with tirzepatide, 15 mg or MTD, and -0.67% (SE, 0.08) with dulaglutide, 4.5 mg or MTD (estimated treatment difference, -0.77% [95% CI, -0.98% to -0.56%; P < 0.001]). Change from baseline in weight at week 40 was -10.5 kg (SE, 0.5) with tirzepatide and -3.6 kg (SE, 0.5) with dulaglutide (estimated treatment difference, -6.9 kg [CI, -8.3 to -5.5 kg; P < 0.001]). Serious adverse events were reported by 10 (7.2%) tirzepatide and 10 (7.0%) dulaglutide participants. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea and diarrhea.

Limitation

Open-label design.

Conclusion

In SURPASS-SWITCH, switching treatment to tirzepatide provided additional HbA 1c reduction and weight loss compared with escalating treatment with dulaglutide.

### Real-world evaluation of the effects of tirzepatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113ANKQQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Tirzepatide is a first-in-class combination glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) approved for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic weight management. The aim of this analysis was to assess the real-world efficacy of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM.

Methods

This retrospective observational study evaluated patients with T2DM from a large urban academic medical centre who received at least 3 months of continuous tirzepatide treatment. The primary outcome was change in A1C from following tirzepatide treatment. Secondary outcomes included change in body weight and body mass index (BMI) after tirzepatide was initiated.

Results

A total of 1896 patient charts were reviewed, and 612 patients were evaluated for the primary outcome. Over a median time period of 10.4months, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a mean A1C reduction of 1.02 ± 1.48% (p < 0.001). A total of 570 patients were evaluated for the secondary outcomes. Tirzepatide was associated with a mean reduction in body weight of 7.3 ± 9.3kg (p < 0.001) and a mean reduction in BMI of 2.5kg/m 2. Greater A1C lowering and weight loss was observed in patients without prior GLP1-RA treatment compared to those switched to tirzepatide from GLP1-RA.

Conclusions

In a real-world population of US patients with T2DM, tirzepatide was associated with clinically and statistically significant reductions in A1C and body weight. Greater reductions in both A1C and body weight were observed among patients who were GLP1-RA naïve compared to patients switched from GLP1-RA to tirzepatide.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide as novel treatment for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111ysRaz]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Methods

Using specific keywords, we comprehensively go through the potential articles on Europe PMC, Scopus, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov sources until July 12th, 2022. We collected all clinical trials that compare tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg once-weekly with placebo or other glucose lowering agents in adult patients with T2D.

Results

Nine clinical trials were included. Our pooled analysis revealed the dose-dependent superiority of tirzepatide in reducing HbA 1c, ranging from -1.50% with 5 mg to -1.80% with 15 mg when compared with placebo, -0.61% with 5 mg to -0.95% with 15 mg when compared with GLP-1 receptor agonist, and -0.70% with 5 mg to 1.09% with 15 mg when compared with basal insulin. The dose-dependent superiority of tirzepatide was also seen in the bodyweight reduction effect with all comparators. These superiorities were not accompanied by increased odds of hypoglycemia, but there is an increase in gastrointestinal adverse events incidence.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide has shown superiority in glycemic control and bodyweight reduction with a good safety profile in patients with T2D. Tirzepatide may become a future potential drug in the management of T2D.

### Tirzepatide, the newest medication for type 2 diabetes: a review of the literature and implications for clinical practice [^111JsVvS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article was to review pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and place in therapy of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through September 7, 2022, using the keyword "tirzepatide".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with available results were included.

Data Synthesis

Seven published phase 3, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trials investigated efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. Studies included adults with uncontrolled T2DM and body mass index above 23 or 25 kg/m 2. Hemoglobin A1c reduction from baseline was greater with tirzepatide across all studies with absolute reductions up to 3.02% and relative reductions ranging 0.44% (vs semaglutide) to 2.11% (vs placebo). Weight loss was significant. Incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects (AE) was similar to semaglutide, and major cardiovascular events was similar to insulin glargine.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Studies demonstrated greater A1c lowering and weight reduction versus placebo and active comparators with AE similar to semaglutide, suggesting tirzepatide will be a valuable addition to the growing list of antidiabetic medications. Although tirzepatide's effects on major cardiovascular events was not increased when compared with insulin glargine, further evidence is needed to assess long-term implications on cardiovascular outcomes compared with agents with proven cardiovascular benefits.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide has the potential to significantly impact the clinical management of T2DM, and results of ongoing clinical trials will help to fully determine its place in therapy.

### A phase 1 multiple-ascending dose study of tirzepatide in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes [^116XZznZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of tirzepatide in Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Methods

This phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose, multiple-ascending dose study randomized participants to once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide treatment groups were: 5 mg (5 mg, weeks 1–8), 10 mg (2.5 mg, weeks 1–2; 5 mg, weeks 3–4; 10 mg, weeks 5–8), and 15mg (5 mg, weeks 1–2; 10 mg, weeks 3–6; 15mg, weeks 7–8). The primary outcome was tirzepatide safety and tolerability.

Results

Forty-eight participants were randomized. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were decreased appetite and gastrointestinal AEs, which were generally dose-dependent and mild in severity. The plasma tirzepatide concentration half-life was approximately 5days. After 8weeks of treatment, fasting plasma glucose decreased from baseline with tirzepatide versus placebo; the least squares (LS) mean decrease compared with placebo (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 52.7 (35.9–69.6), 69.1 (52.3–85.9), and 68.9 (53.2–84.6) mg/dL in the 5-, 10-, and 15-mg treatment groups, respectively (P < .0001 for all treatment groups). Tirzepatide also resulted in LS mean decreases from baseline versus placebo at 8weeks in HbA1c up to 1.6% (95% CI 1.2%-1.9%; P < .0001 for all treatment groups) and body weight up to 6.6 kg (95% CI 5.3–7.9; P < .0001 for all treatment groups).

Conclusions

All tirzepatide doses were well tolerated. The safety, tolerability, PK, and PD profiles of tirzepatide support further evaluation of once-weekly dosing in Japanese people with T2D.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^116gY3dv]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide has demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control compared with placebo for managing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and its efficacy has been shown to depend on both GIP and GLP-1 receptor-mediated actions. Several phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for tirzepatide (SURPASS trials) investigated the clinical effectiveness and safety of tirzepatide as a treatment for T2DM. The SURPASS trials compared three doses of tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) with a range of comparators and background antihyperglycaemic agents. In the SURPASS trials, all three doses of tirzepatide demonstrated superior HbA1c reductions and weight loss in comparison with placebo, a GLP-1 RA, and insulin. A long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, SURPASS-CVOT, is currently ongoing to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in people with T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk. While the SURPASS trials provided direct comparative evidence on the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus a wide range of comparators, it was not feasible to conduct RCTs versus all relevant comparators in all clinical settings, including all GLP-1 RAs. For this reason, comparative data on the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus GLP-1 RAs in basal insulin population is sparse, and consequently, a network meta-analysis (NMA) approach has been employed to assess the relative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus additional standard-of-care treatments. An NMA is a method for comparing multiple treatments at the same time in a single analysis by using direct and indirect evidence within a network of RCTs. NMAs can help in evaluating the comparative effectiveness of different treatments used in clinical practice. The objective of this NMA was to compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide with GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM receiving treatment with basal insulin.

### Post hoc analysis of SURPASS-1 to-5: efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes are independent of baseline characteristics [^114GPyAp]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide was generally well tolerated in all five SURPASS trials. The most common TEAEs within the gastrointestinal system organ class were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. No pattern of elevated hypoglycemia risk was observed with respect to body weight subgroups or tirzepatide dose even in participants with longer duration of diabetes > 10 years, or BMI < 30 kg/m 2 who may have less insulin resistance. However, a tendency toward hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycemia was observed among participants enrolled in SURPASS-4 among whom concomitant sulfonylurea use was permitted or among participants taking insulin in SURPASS-5. Otherwise, tirzepatide treatment was generally associated with low rates of hypoglycemia.

This analysis should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The SURPASS trials were neither designed nor powered to assess the differential efficacy of tirzepatide between these subgroups of participants. This was a post hoc analysis of five different SURPASS trials and the analysis used unpooled data with several differences in trial characteristics and assessed a composite that was not controlled for multiplicity. Moreover, in some cases, the numbers in the subgroups were small. The analysis also does not account for social determinants of health, which may impact the glycemic and weight outcomes in this population. However, the large percentage of participants from SURPASS-1 through -5 included in the current analysis and in previously published studies provides reassurance that the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide are consistent regardless of T2D duration, sex, HbA1c, age, or BMI at baseline. Additionally, both ADA/EASD and AACE guidelines stress the importance of treating cardiovascular risk factors; the composite in this analysis did not focus on cardiovascular risk factors or endpoints because the completed SURPASS program was not designed to assess cardiovascular outcomes. The potential clinical relevance of reaching and maintaining near normoglycemia with accompanying clinically relevant weight loss in the context of T2D management and the effect of tirzepatide on cardiovascular outcomes remain to be elucidated.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^113BezeJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

While the SLR search was originally conducted in September 2021 and updated in October 2021, the searches were further updated in June 2022, January 2023, and February 2024, but no eligible publications for the NMA were found. Data availability for some endpoints (e.g. change from baseline in HbA1c at week 40) was limited, meaning that comparisons between all treatments of interest could not be made for all comparators and endpoints. Although BMI is an important endpoint, this could not be fully analysed because of limited data availability across trials. Heterogeneity across studies in follow-up time was another limitation of the analyses, with data input for tirzepatide based on week 40 contrasting with the week 26 (± 4 weeks) data of the comparator trials. The duration of dose escalation employed to reach the target dose of tirzepatide in the SURPASS trial was longer (0–20 weeks) than the corresponding durations used for the comparators in the comparator studies (0–8 weeks), contributing to a source of heterogeneity between trials. This is not expected to impact HbA1c as the maximum effect in comparators was generally around 26 weeks while the tirzepatide dose was still being escalated. Follow-up time may have impacted weight; however, the sensitivity analysis conducted provides confidence in the analysis. Additionally, the exclusion of semaglutide from the NMA, due to differences in insulin titration scheme not comparable to SURPASS-5, limits the comparative scope of the study, potentially making the findings less generalizable to all GLP-1 RAs. Lastly, the authors acknowledge that head-to-head results from RCTs should be generally preferred but considering that they are not available for several treatment comparisons, the results of this analysis are from mixed treatment comparisons consisting of both direct and indirect evidence.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^116NqAq7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose‐escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once‐weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose‐escalation regimens were: 12 mg (4 mg weeks 0–3; 8 mg weeks 4–7; 12 mg weeks 8–11), 15 mg‐1 (2.5 mg weeks 0–1; 5 mg weeks 2–3; 10 mg weeks 4–7; 15 mg weeks 8–11) and 15 mg‐2 (2.5 mg weeks 0–3; 7.5 mg weeks 4–7; 15 mg weeks 8–11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12 weeks.

Results

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12 mg, 29; tirzepatide 15 mg‐1, 28; tirzepatide 15 mg‐2, 28. The mean age was 57.4 years, HbA1c 8.4% and body mass index 31.9 kg/m 2. At week 12, absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo, +0.2% [0.21]; 12 mg, −1.7% [0.19]; 15 mg‐1, −2.0% [0.20]; 15 mg‐2, −1.8% [0.19]). The incidence of nausea was: placebo, 7.7%; 12 mg group, 24.1%; 15 mg‐1 group, 39.3%; 15 mg‐2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12 mg and 15 mg‐1 groups.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide treatment for 12 weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favourable side effect profile.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide added to basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes in China (SURPASS-CN-INS): a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^1138LnD5]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Data on tirzepatide added to basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes in China are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide added to basal insulin in this population.

Methods

SURPASS-CN-INS was a 40-week, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done in 26 hospitals in China. Participants aged 18 years or older with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes receiving once-daily insulin glargine alone or in combination with metformin with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to once-weekly tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg, or placebo by subcutaneous injection for 40 weeks, stratified by HbA 1c (≤ 8.0% [≤ 64 mmol/mol] vs > 8.0% [> 64 mmol/mol]) and SGLT2 inhibitor use using an interactive web response system. Treatment assignment was masked from the study sponsor, investigators, site staff, clinical monitors, and patients until the end of the study by using identical packaging and injection devices for tirzepatide and placebo. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 40 for tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg versus placebo in all randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of treatment, excluding those who were enrolled inadvertently. Safety was evaluated in all randomly assigned patients receiving at least one dose of treatment. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05691712, and has been completed.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2023, and July 1, 2024, 331 patients were screened, of whom 257 were randomly assigned to and received tirzepatide 5 mg (n = 65), 10 mg (n = 65), or 15 mg (n = 63), or placebo (n = 64). One patient in the tirzepatide 5 mg group and one in the placebo group were inadvertently enrolled and excluded from efficacy analyses. The mean age of 255 patients in the efficacy analysis set was 56.7 years (SD 10.5). 98 (38%) patients were female, and 157 (62%) patients were male. Patients receiving tirzepatide had greater reductions in HbA 1c from baseline at week 40 than those receiving placebo (-2.39% [SE 0.13] in the 10 mg group, and -2.37% [0.13] in the 15 mg group vs -0.91% [0.12] in the placebo group; difference vs placebo -1.48% [97.5% CI -1.87 to -1.08; p < 0.0001] for the 10 mg group and -1.45% [-1.85 to -1.06; p < 0.0001] for the 15 mg group). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving tirzepatide were diarrhoea (17 [26%; 95% CI 17–38] of 65 in the tirzepatide 5 mg group, 24 [37%; 26–49] of 65 in the tirzepatide 10 mg group, and 23 [37%; 26–49] of 63 in the tirzepatide 15 mg group vs five [8%; 3–17] of 64 in the placebo group), decreased appetite (19 [29%; 20–41], 16 [25%; 16–36], and 20 [32%; 22–44] vs none [0%; 0–6]), and upper respiratory tract infection (13 [20%; 12–31], 11 [17%; 10–28], and 11 [18%; 10–29] vs ten [16%; 9–26]). Gastrointestinal adverse events commonly reported in other trials in the SURPASS programme, including diarrhoea, nausea (three [5%; 95% CI 2–13] in the tirzepatide 5 mg group, seven [11%; 5–21] in the tirzepatide 10 mg group, and seven [11%; 5–21] in the tirzepatide 15 mg group vs two [3%; 1–11] in the placebo group), and vomiting (four [6%; 2–15], six [9%; 4–19], and four [6%; 3–15] vs none [0%; 0–6]), were predominantly mild or moderate in severity.

Interpretation

Tirzepatide added to basal insulin improved glycaemic control and was generally well tolerated, providing evidence to support its potential therapeutic use in patients with type 2 diabetes in China.

### Indirect comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2.4 mg for the management of obesity and overweight in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117M4RJf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This indirect treatment comparison (ITC) compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide with semaglutide for managing obesity or overweight in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D), informed by the pivotal trials SURMOUNT-2 and STEP 2.

Materials and Methods

Participants had body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27kg/m 2, with ≥ 1 unsuccessful prior dietary weight reduction effort and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7%-10% on stable therapy. A heterogeneity assessment confirmed that study and patient baseline characteristics were similar. Bucher ITCs compared tirzepatide 10 and 15mg once-weekly (QW) to semaglutide 2.4mg QW via placebo, all adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.

Results

Tirzepatide 10 and 15mg were associated with statistically significant greater reductions in weight, BMI and HbA1c versus semaglutide. Tirzepatide 15mg was associated with statistically significant greater odds versus semaglutide of ≥ 5% and ≥ 15% weight reduction and statistically significant improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors, including waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides. Both tirzepatide doses showed non-significant trends of greater improvements in high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure versus semaglutide as well as a generally comparable safety profile to semaglutide.

Conclusions

In this ITC versus semaglutide 2.4mg, tirzepatide 10 and 15mg were associated with statistically significant greater weight, BMI and HbA1c reduction and tirzepatide 15mg with statistically significant improvements in multiple cardiometabolic risk factors crucial in managing obesity or overweight among patients with T2D. Both tirzepatide doses also had a generally similar safety profile to semaglutide.

Plain Language Summary

What is the context and purpose of this research study? Excess weight and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are strongly connected, where most patients with T2D have obesity or overweight. Weight management is crucial for improving T2D outcomes and preventing its progression. Weight management comprises behavioural interventions, psychological support, dietary changes and physical activity programmes. Medications may also be prescribed or surgical options may also be considered. Two such medications for weight management are tirzepatide (up to 15mg) and semaglutide (up to 2.4mg), which are injected subcutaneously once per week to help control appetite by prolonging patients' feeling of fullness. These medications are also used at different doses to treat T2D. Because there were no clinical trials directly comparing tirzepatide and semaglutide, particularly in patients with both T2D and either obesity or overweight, this study aimed to indirectly compare the effectiveness and safety of tirzepatide and semaglutide for weight management in patients with overweight or obesity and T2D. What was done? We indirectly compared the efficacy and safety of two doses of tirzepatide (10 and 15mg per week) versus semaglutide 2.4mg per week for weight management in adults with both T2D and either obesity or overweight. We used data from two large clinical trials, SURMOUNT-2 and STEP 2, which tested tirzepatide and semaglutide, respectively, against a placebo, all adjunct to diet and exercise. An indirect treatment comparison of tirzepatide and semaglutide was then possible via the placebo arm acting as the common comparator. The similarity of study design and patient populations in the two trials was evaluated and found to be sufficiently close to allow meaningful comparisons. Appropriate statistical methodology was used to facilitate comparisons of the two trials. What were the main results? Compared to semaglutide 2.4mg, the higher dose of tirzepatide (15mg) was associated with a statistically significant improvement in several outcomes such as weight reduction, glycaemic outcomes and triglycerides, while the lower dose of tirzepatide (10mg) was associated with some statistically significant improvements (e.g., weight reduction and HbA1c) and had otherwise comparable outcomes to semaglutide. However, both doses of tirzepatide were associated with statistically significant greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to semaglutide, which is a key target of T2D treatment. Both doses of tirzepatide had a generally similar safety profile compared to semaglutide. What is the originality and relevance of this study? Currently, there are no clinical trials that compare tirzepatide and semaglutide directly for the management of obesity and overweight in patients with T2D. Previous studies have compared tirzepatide and semaglutide results from different clinical trials for weight management in patients without T2D, not specifically focusing on patients with T2D. This is the first study to indirectly compare tirzepatide and semaglutide for weight management in people with T2D who also have obesity or overweight. The findings of this study suggest that higher doses of tirzepatide may be more effective than semaglutide for weight reduction and improving other health-related outcomes in these patients.

### Characteristics and dosing patterns of tirzepatide users with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^11356z4B]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) approved in the USA for treatment of T2D (May 2022) and obesity (November 2023). The phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) alone or in combination with commonly prescribed antihyperglycemic medications (metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and insulin glargine) in patients with T2D. Tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and body weight versus placebo (SURPASS-1, SURPASS-5), and active comparators including semaglutide 1 mg (SURPASS-2), titrated insulin degludec (SURPASS-3), and titrated insulin glargine (SURPASS-4). Treatment with tirzepatide also resulted in significant improvements in health- and weight-related quality of life across the five SURPASS studies. In the phase 3 SURMOUNT-2 trial in patients with obesity and T2D, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in clinically meaningful reduction in body weight and substantial reduction in HbA1c levels.

Evidence from meta-analyses and secondary analyses of clinical trials suggests that tirzepatide may improve other outcomes of interest for patients with T2D. Tirzepatide may reduce urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and maintain renal function, improve levels of hepatic transaminases, and reduce liver fat content versus placebo or active comparators. Preliminary evidence suggests no increased risk of cancer. In a post hoc mediation analysis of the SURPASS program, tirzepatide was associated with reductions in systolic blood pressure across doses, while in a pre-specified meta-analysis of the SURPASS program, tirzepatide showed cardiovascular safety compared to controls.

Although tirzepatide has demonstrated efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials, real-world data on utilization of tirzepatide in T2D are limited given its relatively recent availability. The overall objective of this real-world retrospective study was to characterize the cohort initiating tirzepatide for T2D and to describe utilization patterns of tirzepatide in these patients using a large claims database in the USA.

### The new dual gastric inhibitory peptide / glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes: is the future bright? [^112X3TUk]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a dual gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide, based on the native GIP sequence. It has a prolonged half-life of 5 days, which enables once-weekly dosing. Studies have hitherto demonstrated its superiority in achieving optimal glycaemic control and body weight management, as compared with various agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including GLP-1 receptor agonists. Thus, it is expected to enrich our therapeutic armamentarium in T2DM. However, further experience, notably longer follow-up data and information on cardiovascular effects, is still needed.

### Tirzepatide: a novel, first-in-class, dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonist [^112E6rv2]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide and discuss its potential role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide is a novel once-weekly dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist which has been studied in the SURPASS clinical trials in doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg. Tirzepatide phase III clinical trials, SURPASS-1 through SURPASS-5, demonstrate that this medication is safe and effective in treating type 2 diabetes both with and without a variety of background medications versus placebo, semaglutide, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine in different patient populations. Most adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature, with a relatively low withdrawal rate in the active treatment arms. It seems likely that tirzepatide will be recommended as a preferred option in the American Diabetes Association treatment algorithm for high glucose lowering effects in patients with a compelling need for low hypoglycemia risk and weight loss. However, the positioning of tirzepatide in the treatment algorithm will ultimately be dependent on the results of the cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) or other outcome-based trials. Tirzepatide is effective for treating type 2 diabetes by lowering glycated hemoglobin and contributing to significant weight loss.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^112uK3CQ]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist approved in the US for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, has demonstrated significant improvements in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and clinically meaningful weight loss in the SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials. This post hoc analysis examined the safety and efficacy results for tirzepatide in older participants with T2D who do not have obesity.

Methods

A post hoc analysis was conducted on a subgroup of participants aged ≥ 65 years with a body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m 2 amongst the pooled SURPASS-1 through -5 clinical trial populations. Primary efficacy endpoints and safety were assessed for both this subgroup and overall pooled populations.

Results

Participants aged ≥ 65 years with BMI < 30 kg/m 2 treated with tirzepatide experienced clinically meaningful HbA1c reduction (-1.97 to -2.10%) regardless of the assigned randomized maintenance dose. In contrast, a dose-proportional HbA1c decrease was observed in the overall population. Weight reduction in this subgroup was dose-proportional but numerically lower than in the overall population. Older participants without obesity were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events (AEs), although the overall incidence of AEs was low in this subgroup. The incidence of hypoglycemia in this group was consistent with that of the overall cohort, regardless of concurrent insulin or sulfonylurea use.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide may be an effective treatment for older adults without obesity, and in this post hoc analysis, it was associated with clinically relevant HbA1c reduction and dose-proportional weight loss without increasing hypoglycemic risk.

### Patient-reported outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes receiving tirzepatide in the SURPASS clinical trial programme [^11361WcP]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, is approved for glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The SURPASS-1 to -5 clinical trials assessed the efficacy of once weekly tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15 mg) versus placebo or active comparators (semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec and insulin glargine) in T2D. We evaluated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that measured overall quality of life (QoL), treatment satisfaction and weight-related attributes across the five SURPASS studies.

Methods

PRO instruments utilised at baseline and primary timepoint (40 weeks for SURPASS-1, -2 and -5; 52 weeks for SURPASS-3 and -4) or early termination visit were EQ-5D-5L (SURPASS-1 to -5); Impact of Weight on Self-Perceptions (SURPASS-1 to -5); Ability to Perform Physical Activities of Daily Living (SURPASS-1 to -5); Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (SURPASS-2 to -5); and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Clinical Trials Version (SURPASS-2 only).

Results

Across all five studies at week 40/52, tirzepatide improved patients' QoL measured by general health and weight-related PROs over the comparator. Generally, higher doses of tirzepatide resulted in greater increases in PRO scores.

Conclusion

Overall, tirzepatide produced significant health and weight-related QoL improvements versus comparators in the five SURPASS studies.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in Asians and non-Asians with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wxt2G]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide is a novel hypoglycemic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the pathophysiology of T2DM in Asians is different from that in non-Asians, and there is no evidence to explain the differences in the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide between different races.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, and Embase databases for clinical studies of tirzepatide for T2DM. The data extraction process was done independently by two authors. All analyses were performed using STATA 14.0 software and Review Manager 5.3 software.

Results

A total of 2118 patients with T2DM from 6 studies were involved, with doses of tirzepatide ranging from 5 to 15 mg administered subcutaneously once weekly. The results showed that compared with control/placebo, tirzepatide was more effective in decreasing fasting blood glucose (FBG) in non-Asians than in Asians, and 10 mg rather than 15 mg was the optimal dose to decrease FBG. Similarly, non-Asians were more effective than Asians in improving glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Asians were significantly more effective than non-Asians in reducing body weight and ≥ 5% weight loss. In terms of adverse events, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher in Asians than in non-Asians at the same dose, while the incidence of metabolic and nutrition disorders was higher in non-Asians than in Asians.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide is a novel agent for the treatment of diabetes and has different efficacy in Asians and non-Asians. Asians were more likely to experience weight loss and gastrointestinal adverse events, whereas non-Asians were more likely to have better glycemic control and more metabolic and nutritional disorders.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^113uk3C3]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Significance of the SURPASS Clinical Trials

Diabetes care has evolved over the last two decades, shifting from a glucocentric approach to multifactorial intervention with the aim of minimising CV morbidity and mortality. International guidelines recommend the choice of anti-hyperglycaemic therapy based not only on the degree of hyperglycaemia but also on the presence or absence of CV disease, renal disease and obesity. GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors have gained popularity due to their clinical efficacy and favourable CV outcomes. Despite these developments, there are still unmet needs for people living with diabetes, especially those with obesity. Tirzepatide has demonstrated greater HbA1c reduction (− 2.4% with 15 mg tirzepatide) and superior weight loss (− 11.3 kg with tirzepatide 15 mg) with comparable adverse effects versus the GLP-1 RA dulaglutide in phase 2 trials. Of note, semaglutide, currently regarded as the most potent GLP-1 RA, demonstrated 1.5–1.8% HbA1c reduction and 4.5–6.5 kg weight reduction. It is not possible to compare the efficacy of tirzepatide and semaglutide with available data from phase 2 trials; however, the SURPASS-2 trial will directly compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus semaglutide with the potential for superiority of tirzepatide, particularly with respect to weight reduction. Since the prevalence of diabesity is increasing, diabetes medications with potent weight loss will be increasingly attractive in modern diabetes care. Amongst available GLP-1 RAs, liraglutide 3.0 mg daily subcutaneous injection (Saxenda®) has approval for chronic weight management in patients with obesity or with a weight-related comorbidity and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2; however, for the management of T2DM, the approval licence remains at the once daily dose of 1.8 mg. In the SCALE trial which compared liraglutide 3 mg versus 1.8 mg versus placebo, there was a small but significant reduction in weight and HbA1c in the liraglutide 3 mg group compared to liraglutide 1.8 mg group. However, the SCALE study was not designed to compare the efficacy of liraglutide 3 mg versus 1.8 mg. In the SCALE insulin trial, liraglutide 3 mg was associated with a HbA1c reduction of 1.1% compared to placebo (0.6%). Of interest, a higher dose of dulaglutide for glucose lowering was recently approved by the FDA following the AWARD-11 trial which demonstrated HbA1c reduction of 1.9% and 1.7% and weight reduction of 5 kg and 4.3 kg with dulaglutide 4.5 mg and 3 mg QW respectively.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^115P9p9z]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This 12‐week, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 2 study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of tirzepatide (12 and 15 mg [two groups]) using three different dose‐escalation regimens. The dose‐escalation regimens evaluated different starting doses and magnitudes of each dose escalation. Tirzepatide treatment doses were escalated over an 8‐week period to a final dose of 12 or 15 mg, which was administered during the remaining 4 weeks of the treatment period. Although the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on changes in HbA1c at 12 weeks, a key secondary objective was to evaluate the tolerability of tirzepatide within each of the dose‐escalation regimens.

### Clinical outcomes of tirzepatide or GLP-1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^112pgMPA]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this cohort study provided evidence supporting the association of tirzepatide treatment, compared to GLP-1 RAs, with lower hazards of all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular or kidney events through a head-to-head comparison in patients with type 2 diabetes. These insights advocate for the integration of tirzepatide into therapeutic strategies for managing type 2 diabetes and highlight its potential to enhance current clinical practice.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^114hCMpb]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

AACE 2022 diabetes — tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes: Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is recently approved by the FDA for improvement in glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes. A systematic analysis of several completed trials with a total of 6609 participants confirmed dose-dependent superiority on glycemic efficacy at 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly subcutaneous administration, with reduction in body weight versus placebo, GLP-1 RAs, and basal insulin. Tirzepatide was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events but no increase in risk of hypoglycemia, appears useful for those already on metformin therapy, and based on early data and ongoing trials (including a cardiovascular outcomes trial) additional clinical indications for weight loss and/or cardiovascular risk reduction may be sought.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^1159HT6X]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved in the United States as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and under investigation for use in chronic weight management, major adverse cardiovascular events and the management of other conditions, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity and non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The Phase 3 SURPASS 1–5 clinical trial programme was designed to assess efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneously injected tirzepatide (5, 10 and 15mg), as monotherapy or combination therapy, across a broad spectrum of people with type 2 diabetes. Use of tirzepatide in clinical studies was associated with marked reductions of glycated haemoglobin (-1.87 to -2.59%, -20 to -28mmol/mol) and body weight (-6.2 to -12.9 kg), as well as reductions in parameters commonly associated with heightened cardiometabolic risk such as blood pressure, visceral adiposity and circulating triglycerides. In SUPRASS-2, these reductions were greater than with the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1 mg. Tirzepatide was well tolerated, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia when used without insulin or insulin secretagogues and showed a generally similar safety profile to the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Accordingly, evidence from these clinical trials suggests that tirzepatide offers a new opportunity for the effective lowering of glycated haemoglobin and body weight in adults with type 2 diabetes.

### Tirzepatide did not impact metabolic adaptation in people with obesity, but increased fat oxidation [^113VoX6h]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, promoted significant body weight reduction in the phase 3 clinical trials. We conducted a preclinical study and a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04081337) to understand potential mechanisms mediating tirzepatide-induced weight loss in mice and people with obesity. In calorie-restricted, obese mice, chronic treatment with tirzepatide reduced the drop in energy expenditure that occurred in vehicle-treated and pair-fed mice, indicating that tirzepatide attenuated metabolic adaptation. Respiratory exchange ratio also decreased in tirzepatide-treated mice, indicating increased fat oxidation. In the clinical trial, tirzepatide appeared to have no impact on metabolic adaptation but led to increased fat oxidation and reductions in appetite and calorie intake during an ad libitum test meal (vs. placebo). This is the first study to provide insights into the mechanisms of action of tirzepatide on weight loss with respect to calorie intake, energy expenditure, and macronutrient utilization.

### Tirzepatide reduces appetite, energy intake, and fat mass in people with type 2 diabetes [^112FUxfo]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of tirzepatide on body composition, appetite, and energy intake to address the potential mechanisms involved in body weight loss with tirzepatide.

Research Design and Methods

In a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm study, the effects of tirzepatide 15 mg (N = 45), semaglutide 1 mg (N = 44), and placebo (N = 28) on body weight and composition, appetite, and energy intake were assessed at baseline and week 28.

Results

Tirzepatide treatment demonstrated significant reductions in body weight compared with placebo and semaglutide, resulting in greater fat mass reduction. Tirzepatide and semaglutide significantly reduced appetite versus placebo. Appetite scores and energy intake reductions did not differ between tirzepatide and semaglutide.

Conclusions

Differences in energy intake during ad libitum lunch were not sufficient to explain the different weight outcomes. Further evaluation is needed to assess mechanistic differences related to tirzepatide actions on 24-h energy intake, substrate utilization, and energy expenditure.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^116bJt9r]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of action of tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist), with particular emphasis of differences to selective GLP-1 receptor agonists

Given the impressive results of the tirzepatide clinical trials, understanding pharmacologic mechanisms of action is likely to provide insight into the pathogenesis and correction of diabetes and obesity. Moreover, differentiating a GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist from a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist has implications for the broader scope of multi-receptor targeting in metabolic disease. Are there footprints of GIP receptor agonism in the studies to date? An experiment based on the general protocol of the SURPASS-2 study, but including physiological outcomes, was recently reported. At baseline and after 28 weeks of treatment, Heise et al. performed a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp experiment to estimate insulin sensitivity, followed by a hyperglycaemic clamp (216 mg/dl;12.0 mmol/l) to estimate insulin secretory responses. On a second day of study, plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon responses were recorded following a mixed meal test with concurrent assessment of ratings (visual analogue scales) of hunger, satiety, prospective food consumption, and fullness; energy intake was measured on the occasion of an ad libitum meal. The clinical results of this trial mimicked the primary findings of SURPASS-2 with comparable HbA 1c reduction and loss of body weight. Insulin sensitivity as measured by the glucose infusion rate needed to maintain euglycaemia rose by 65.7% with tirzepatide (as compared to 37.5% with semaglutide 1.0 mg). Thus, the rise in insulin sensitivity was 20.5% greater with tirzepatide as compared to semaglutide. Some of this effect is likely due to the difference in body weight reduction (average 11.2 kg with tirzepatide vs. 6.9 kg with semaglutide), and in fact, the improvement in insulin sensitivity was related to the individual degree of body weight reduction. However, the slope of the regression line relating insulin sensitivity to amount of weight loss was significantly steeper for tirzepatide compared to semaglutide. These results suggest that there may be weight-dependent and weight-independent components to the improvement in insulin sensitivity accompanying tirzepatide treatment, and that there is a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity per unit weight loss with tirzepatide as compared to semaglutide.

### Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetes-how far have we come? [^114xeWxw]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In the completed SURPASS trials, treatment with tirzepatide at all doses (5, 10, 15 mg) demonstrated greater reductions in HbA1c (and achievement of HbA1c < 7.0%) compared with placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludecand insulin glargine, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Similarly, treatment with tirzepatide has been associated with greater weight loss and high achievement of weight loss goals (Table 3). In the SURPASS‐2 trial, tirzepatide at all doses was associated with a significantly higher proportion of patients achieving weight loss goals of > 5% (65%, 76%, 80% with tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, respectively, vs. 54% with semaglutide 1 mg), > 10% (34%, 47%, 57% with tirzepatide vs. 24% with semaglutide 1 mg) and > 15% (15%, 24%, 36% with tirzepatide vs. 8% with semaglutide 1 mg). Moreover, compared with semaglutide 1 mg treatment with tirzepatide was associated with greater reductions in HbA1c, body weight and blood pressure, as well as greater improvement in triglycerides and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL‐C). The reduction in low‐density lipoproteins (LDL‐C) was significant but similar to semaglutide. In combination with basal insulin, tirzepatide showed a strong reduction in HbA1c and weight. GI side effects were comparable to those of GLP‐1 RAs but were numerically greater at 15 mg compared with semaglutide 1 mg.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1134EnJ1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and tirzepatide — use in older adults with diabetes includes tolerability and monitoring considerations as well as efficacy data. These drugs are injectable agents (with the exception of oral semaglutide (124)), which require visual, motor, and cognitive skills for appropriate administration, although most of them have a weekly dosing schedule, and GLP-1 RAs may also be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation and should be titrated slowly. Given the gastrointestinal side effects of this class, GLP-1 RAs are not preferred in older adults experiencing unexplained weight loss or undernutrition or in those who have recurrent gastrointestinal problems, and individuals should be monitored regularly for excessive weight loss. Tirzepatide is a novel dual-acting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 RA administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection; in phase 3 trials, tirzepatide decreased A1C and weight — generally to a greater extent than other glucose-lowering drugs including semaglutide and insulin — with no significant differences in the safety or efficacy in older compared with younger individuals (125), and as the adverse effect profile of tirzepatide is similar to that for GLP-1 RAs, the same precautions for older adults apply. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are administered orally, which may be convenient for older adults with diabetes, and in those with established ASCVD these agents have shown cardiovascular benefits.

### FDA approves new medication for chronic weight… [^113f3NeX]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Zepbound injection for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or greater) or overweight with at least one weight-related condition for use, in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, is already approved under the trade name Mounjaro to be used along with diet and exercise to help improve blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Zepbound activates receptors of hormones secreted from the intestine and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) to reduce appetite and food intake.

Zepbound is administered by injection under the skin once weekly, and the dosage must be increased over four to 20 weeks to achieve the target dosages of 5 milligram, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly. The maximum dosage of Zepbound is 15 mg once weekly. Zepbound can cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal discomfort and pain, injection site reactions, fatigue, hypersensitivity reactions, burping, hair loss and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Zepbound causes thyroid C-cell tumors in rats. It is unknown whether Zepbound causes such tumors, including medullary thyroid cancer, in humans. Zepbound should not be used in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2.

Zepbound should not be used in patients with a history of severe allergic reaction to tirzepatide or to any of its other ingredients. Patients should stop Zepbound immediately and seek medical help if a severe allergic reaction is suspected. Zepbound also contains warnings for inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and suicidal behavior or thinking.

### Continued treatment with tirzepatide for maintenance of… [^115QX75f]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Does once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide with diet and physical activity affect maintenance of body weight reduction in individuals with obesity or overweight. Findings After 36 weeks of open-label maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide, adults with obesity or overweight experienced a mean weight reduction of 20. 9%. From randomization, those switched to placebo experienced a 14% weight regain and those continuing tirzepatide experienced an additional 5. 5% weight reduction during the 52-week double-blind period. Tirzepatide is a single molecule that combines glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonism13 resulting in synergistic effects on appetite, food intake, and metabolic function. 14–16 Tirzepatide is approved in many countries, including the US, EU., and Japan, as a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable for type 2 diabetes and for the treatment of obesity in the US and UK.

16–18 In a placebo-controlled trial of participants with obesity or overweight without diabetes, tirzepatide led to mean reductions in body weight up to 20. 9% after 72 weeks of treatment. 17, 18. Consistent results were observed when using the efficacy estimand. Relative to placebo, tirzepatide was associated with significant improvements from randomization at week 36 to week 88 in BMI, hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, insulin, lipid levels, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with placebo, tirzepatide was associated with improvements throughout the entire study in body weight, BMI, cardiometabolic parameters, and patient-reported outcomes.

### Tirzepatide after intensive lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity: the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 trial [^1147vAtJ]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-3 was published by Thomas A Wadden and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in adult patients with overweight or obesity who underwent intensive lifestyle intervention? In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the population was: 579 patients (364 female, 215 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² and at least one obesity-related complication, who achieved ≥ 5.0% weight reduction after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM, T2DM, ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar state/coma; self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg within 3 months before screening; previous planned surgical treatment for obesity; history of chronic or acute pancreatitis. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the interventions were: n = 287 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maximum tolerated dose of 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 72 weeks) n = 292 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 72 weeks). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in weight at week 72 (18.4% vs. -2.5%; ARD 20.8, 95% CI 18.5 to 23.2). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 5% at week 72 (87.5% vs. 16.5%; OR 34.6, 95% CI 19.2 to 62.6) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 72 (76.7% vs. 8.9%; OR 34.7, 95% CI 17.6 to 68.3) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference (14.6 cm vs. -0.2 cm; AD 14.8 cm, 95% CI 12.5 to 17.2). In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-3 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² and at least one obesity-related complication, who achieved ≥ 5.0% weight reduction after a 12-week intensive lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in weight at week 72.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^115oh8ff]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the USA, Europe, and the UAE. Tirzepatide is an acylated peptide engineered to activate the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, key mediators of insulin secretion that are also expressed in regions of the brain that regulate food intake. Five clinical trials in type 2-diabetic subjects (SURPASS 1–5) have shown that tirzepatide at 5–15 mg per week reduces both HbA 1c (1.24 to 2.58%) and body weight (5.4–11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent. A sizable proportion of patients (23.0 to 62.4%) reached an HbA 1c of < 5.7% (which is the upper limit of the normal range indicating normoglycaemia), and 20.7 to 68.4% lost more than 10% of their baseline body weight. Tirzepatide was significantly more effective in reducing HbA 1c and body weight than the selective GLP-1 RA semaglutide (1.0 mg per week), and titrated basal insulin. Adverse events related to tirzepatide were similar to what has been reported for selective GLP-1RA, mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation, that were more common at higher doses. Cardiovascular events have been adjudicated across the whole study program, and MACE-4 (nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death and hospital admission for angina) events tended to be reduced over up to a 2 year-period, albeit with low numbers of events. For none of the cardiovascular events analysed (MACE-4, or its components) was a hazard ratio > 1.0 vs. pooled comparators found in a meta-analysis covering the whole clinical trial program, and the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for MACE were < 1.3, fulfilling conventional definitions of cardiovascular safety. Tirzepatide was found to improve insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory responses to a greater extent than semaglutide, and this was associated with lower prandial insulin and glucagon concentrations. Both drugs caused similar reductions in appetite, although tirzepatide caused greater weight loss. While the clinical effects of tirzepatide have been very encouraging, important questions remain as to the mechanism of action. While GIP reduces food intake and body weight in rodents, these effects have not been demonstrated in humans. Moreover, it remains to be shown that GIPR agonism can improve insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients who have been noted in previous studies to be unresponsive to GIP. Certainly, the apparent advantage of tirzepatide, a dual incretin agonist, over GLP-1RA will spark renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of GIP in type 2 diabetes, obesity and related co-morbidities.

### An observational study of cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide vs glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^116yp7vx]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

While cardiovascular benefits of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and its comparative effectiveness vs glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) is studied in randomized controlled trials, real-world outcomes may provide critical insights.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the cardiovascular benefits of tirzepatide vs GLP-1RA in people living with overweight or obesity, with T2DM, age ≥ 40 years, and pre-existing ischemic heart disease (IHD).

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis of de-identified, aggregate patient data from the TriNetX research network was conducted. People with T2DM, age ≥ 40 years, pre-existing IHD, and body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2 receiving either tirzepatide or GLP-1RA were identified and divided into 2 groups (tirzepatide vs GLP-1RA). After propensity score matching, Cox-proportional HRs were used to compare efficacy and safety outcomes during 1-year follow-up.

Results

Among 47,719 adults, 753 received tirzepatide, and 46,966 were on GLP-1RA. After propensity score matching, each group had 751 adults (mean age 59.9 ± 8.9 years, 46.5% females, 74.8% White adults in the tirzepatide group). Treatment with tirzepatide was associated with lower primary composite outcomes of acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43–0.84, P < 0.001). Individually, acute myocardial infarction (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38–0.91) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14–0.88, P = 0.001) were also found to be favorable in the tirzepatide group.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide use is associated with better outcomes in adults aged 40 years or older with T2DM, body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2, and pre-existing IHD.

### The dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide: a novel cardiometabolic therapeutic prospect [^111CWCvJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

A dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist

An ideal antidiabetic medication should present proven efficacy in lowering elevated glucose levels, promote weight loss, have low risk of hypoglycemia and offer cardiovascular benefits. The idea of simultaneously activating both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors seems appealing for treatment of T2DM since it may significantly boost insulin secretion and improve insulin sensitivity. The main physiological actions of such compound are depicted in Fig. 1; the rationale is based on the fact that improved glycemia restores sensitivity to GIP and peptide engineering enables the design of hybrid ligands exhibiting dual agonism, as proved in experimental studies.

Fig. 1
Main physiological actions of the dual GIP and GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide. GIP — glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; GLP-1 — glucagon-like peptide-1. Despite the similarities between the two incretins, it should be pinpointed that while GIP activity is mainly pancreatic, GLP-1 activity is systemic

Tirzepatide, the first dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is in keeping with these conceptions. Its chemical formula is based on the GIP amino acid sequence and its half-life of approximately 5 days is compatible with a once-weekly subcutaneous administration. Chemically, tirzepatide is a synthetic linear peptide containing 39 aminoacids based on the native GIP sequence. This basic structure is accompanied by a 20-carbon fatty diacid moiety that prolongs its half-life. The mechanism of action is very imbalanced, since while it has a comparable GIP receptor binding affinity to native GIP, the affinity to the native GLP-1 receptor is five times lower. So, it is a bireceptor agonist, product of the above mentioned peptide engineering, created as a single agent possessing activity at more than one pharmacological target.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^113hZTpy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This was a 12‐week phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three different 8‐week dose‐escalation regimens followed by 4‐week dosing of 12 or 15 mg of the dual GIP and GLP‐1 RA, tirzepatide. The escalation regimens investigated in this study, along with results from the previously published primary phase 2b study, 20 which used a shorter dose‐escalation regimen, were designed to support collection of data for selection of therapeutic doses and dose‐escalation steps for investigation within the phase 3 studies of tirzepatide. The escalation regimens were designed to evaluate the differences in efficacy and tolerability between the doses used at the initiation of therapy (2.5 or 4 mg), the differences across different escalation steps (2.5, 4, 5 or 7.5 mg), and the differences between the groups during the entire 12‐week treatment period.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^117V1ZpH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Alternative dosing of tirzepatide

Figure 3 predicts the efficacy of tirzepatide under alternative dosing regimens (decreasing dose frequency and potentially increasing dose size). In Figure 3A, we plot the steady‐state percent change in body weight as a function of the time between doses for 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide. Analogous to Figure 2A, decreasing the dose frequency does not commensurately decrease weight loss efficacy. For instance, for the standard q1wk dosing, the model predicts steady‐state body weight reductions of 17%, 21%, and 23% for tirzepatide at 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively (which is in good agreement with clinical data). For q2wk dosing, the model predicts steady‐state body weight reductions of 12%, 16%, and 18% for tirzepatide at 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively. Hence, similar to semaglutide, the model predicts that patients retain roughly 75% of their weight loss when merely switching from q1wk to q2wk dosing.

FIGURE 3

The markers highlight weight loss for once‐weekly dosing (q1wk) versus once every other week dosing (q2wk). (B) How a patient currently on 5 mg q1wk can decrease costs and maintain (or improve) efficacy. The markers indicate that switching to q2wk decreases costs by 50% and maintains (i) 70% of their weight loss if the dose size is kept at 5 mg, (ii) 95% of their weight loss if the dose size is doubled to 10 mg, and (iii) 111% of their weight loss if the dose size is tripled to 15 mg. Analogously, panels (C) and (D) concern patients currently on 10 mg q1wk and 15 mg q1wk, respectively.

### Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide improves beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes [^114p8gw9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a 39 amino acid synthetic peptide with agonist activity at both the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, with a greater affinity to GIP receptors. Its structure, which is primarily based on the GIP amino acid sequence, includes a C20 fatty di-acid moiety that prolongs the duration of action, thus allowing once-weekly subcutaneous administration. In a 26-week, randomized, double-blind Phase 2b trial in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D), treatment with tirzepatide (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) resulted in significant, dose-dependent reductions in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (up to –2.4%) at 26 weeks compared with placebo (+0.1%) and selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, dulaglutide (–1.1%), and dose-dependent reductions in body weight (ranging from –4.8 to –11.3 kg with the 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg doses) compared with –0.4 kg with placebo and –2.7 kg with dulaglutide. Impairment in insulin production from pancreatic beta cells and in insulin action both contribute to hyperglycemia in T2D, and distinct mechanisms by which dual agonism of both GLP-1 and GIP receptors may improve glycemic control warrant additional study. To explore mechanisms by which tirzepatide resulted in greater reductions of hyperglycemia than a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, we conducted post hoc exploratory analyses of biomarkers associated with pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity.

### Comparison of tirzepatide and dulaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events in participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: SURPASS-CVOT design and baseline characteristics [^117DWbjH]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide, a once-weekly GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces blood glucose and body weight in people with type 2 diabetes. The cardiovascular (CV) safety and efficacy of tirzepatide have not been definitively assessed in a cardiovascular outcomes trial.

Methods

Tirzepatide is being studied in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled CV outcomes trial. People with type 2 diabetes aged ≥ 40 years, with established atherosclerotic CV disease, HbA1c ≥ 7% to ≤ 10.5%, and body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2 were randomized 1:1 to once weekly subcutaneous injection of either tirzepatide up to 15 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg. The primary outcome is time to first occurrence of any major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The trial is event-driven and planned to continue until ≥ 1,615 participants experience an adjudication-confirmed component of MACE. The primary analysis is noninferiority for time to first MACE of tirzepatide vs dulaglutide by demonstrating an upper confidence limit < 1.05, which will also confirm superiority vs a putative placebo, and also to determine whether tirzepatide produces a greater CV benefit than dulaglutide (superiority analysis).

Results

Over 2 years, 13,299 people at 640 sites in 30 countries across all world regions were randomized. The mean age of randomized participants at baseline was 64.1 years, diabetes duration 14.7 years, HbA1c 8.4%, and BMI 32.6 kg/m 2. Overall, 65.0% had coronary disease, of whom 47.3% reported prior myocardial infarction and 57.4% had prior coronary revascularization. 19.1% of participants had a prior stroke and 25.3% had peripheral artery disease. The trial is fully recruited and ongoing.

Conclusion

SURPASS-CVOT will provide definitive evidence as to the CV safety and efficacy of tirzepatide as compared with dulaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist with established CV benefit.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of MOUNJARO have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pool of seven clinical trials, 1539 (30.1%) MOUNJARO-treated patients were 65 years of age or older, and 212 (4.1%) MOUNJARO-treated patients were 75 years of age or older at baseline.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with renal impairment. In subjects with renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), no change in tirzepatide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In a clinical pharmacology study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, no change in tirzepatide PK was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Tirzepatide (Zepbound) [^114L5VQJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There will be a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ZEPBOUND (tirzepatide) during pregnancy. Pregnant patients exposed to ZEPBOUND and healthcare providers are encouraged to contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979).

Risk Summary

Weight loss offers no benefit to a pregnant patient and may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant patients that weight loss is not recommended during pregnancy and to discontinue ZEPBOUND when a pregnancy is recognized (see Clinical Considerations). Available data with tirzepatide in pregnant patients are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-related risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to tirzepatide during pregnancy.

In pregnant rats administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions and fetal abnormalities occurred at clinical exposure in maternal rats based on AUC. In rabbits administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions were observed at clinically relevant exposures based on AUC. These adverse embryo/fetal effects in animals coincided with pharmacological effects on maternal weight and food consumption (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is increased when compared to the general population. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Appropriate weight gain based on pre-pregnancy weight is currently recommended for all pregnant patients, including those with obesity or overweight, due to the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy.

The study SURPASS-6 was published by Julio Rosenstock and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of tirzepatide in patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin? In the SURPASS-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-6 study, the population was: 1425 patients (822 female, 603 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin. The key exclusion criteria were diagnosis of T1DM; history of pancreatitis; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; diabetic macular edema; non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring immediate treatment; severe hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness. In the SURPASS-6 study, the interventions were: n = 717 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 52 weeks) n = 708 insulin lispro (prandial dose of 100 IU/mL TID for 52 weeks). In the SURPASS-6 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in HbA1c at week 52 (2.11% vs. 1.13%; AD 0.98%, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17). In the SURPASS-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving HbA1c target < 7.0% at week 52 (68% vs. 36%; OR 4.2, 95% CI 3.2 to 5.5) Significant increase in reduction in body weight at week 52 (9 kg vs. -3.2 kg; AD 12.2 kg, 95% CI 10.9 to 13.4). In the SURPASS-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in ≥ 1 serious adverse event, death. significant difference in severe hypoglycemia (0.4% vs. 4.2%). In the SURPASS-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with poorly controlled T2DM treated with basal insulin, tirzepatide was superior to insulin lispro with respect to reduction in HbA1c at week 52.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^115mvwEZ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as an efficacious treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and have demonstrated substantial weight loss effects. This systematic review compares two prevalent GLP-1RAs, tirzepatide and semaglutide, with their weight loss effects and rates of adverse events (AEs).

Methods

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library for direct comparative studies between tirzepatide and semaglutide. A meta-analysis was conducted via a random-effects model to analyse the differences in weight loss outcomes between study cohorts.

Results

Four studies, with 28,827 patients (14,870 tirzepatide/13,928 semaglutide), mean age of 55.7years (52.0 to 63.7) and mean follow-up of 35.9weeks (23.6 to 44.6), were included in this study. Mean weight change across four studies for tirzepatide and semaglutide was -11.4% (-15.3% to -8.27%) and -7.3% (-8.3% to -6.08%), respectively. The meta-analysis supports these findings with a mean difference of -4.84kg (95% CI: -6.21 to -3.47), favouring tirzepatide. The most common AEs were minor and moderate-severity gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.

Conclusion

Current literature supports tirzepatide demonstrating a higher impact on weight loss than semaglutide, with both demonstrating high rates of minimal- to moderate-severity AEs. Further research with comparative head-to-head trials will better elucidate these weight loss effects and safety profiles.

### Semaglutide and tirzepatide prescribing for obesity… [^113pVYCV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recent approvals of semaglutide and tirzepatide for chronic weight management by the US Food and Drug Administration have transformed care, providing effective obesity treatments that improve health outcomes across patient subgroups. 1, 2 The prescription of these medications may vary by nonclinical factors, raising concerns about the potential for exacerbating health disparities in obesity, which disproportionately affects low-income populations. 3–5 This study leverages nationwide electronic health records to examine prescriptions for semaglutide and tirzepatide, focusing on differences across race, ethnicity, social vulnerability, and urbanicity. By evaluating potential gaps, this study aims to assess the need for strategies to promote equitable access to these therapies. Kim C, Ross JS, Jastreboff AM, et al.

### Efficacy of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes: an adjusted indirect treatment comparison [^113ntc83]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In the SURPASS‐2 study, all doses of tirzepatide were superior to semaglutide 1 mg in both HbA1c and body weight change from baseline at week 40 in patients with T2D and elevated glucose levels (HbA1c 8%‐10%) with metformin. With the investigation and availability of semaglutide 2 mg, data on comparative efficacy between tirzepatide and this higher dose of semaglutide may be relevant to make clinical decisions. Indirect treatment comparisons of glucose‐lowering agents have previously been reported in the literature in the absence of head‐to‐head trials.,

This is the first comparison of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus injectable semaglutide 2 mg on the change from baseline in HbA1c and body weight in patients with T2D and elevated glucose levels (HbA1c 8%‐10%) with metformin. An aITC method was used based on the results of two phase 3 multinational trials, SURPASS‐2 and SUSTAIN FORTE, with the common comparator arm semaglutide 1 mg. The primary analysis showed that the effects of tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg on the reduction of HbA1c and body weight were statistically significant and clinically meaningful compared with semaglutide 2 mg. The lowest dose of tirzepatide (5 mg) offered similar reductions from baseline in HbA1c and body weight versus the highest dose of semaglutide (2 mg). The American Diabetes Association recommends an HbA1c target of less than 7% and body weight loss of at least 5% for the majority of patients with T2D. In SUSTAIN FORTE, semaglutide 2 mg showed superiority over semaglutide 1 mg in HbA1c and weight change at 40 weeks; however, 32% and 41% of patients in the semaglutide 2‐mg arm did not achieve an HbA1c target of less than 7% and weight loss of at least 5%, respectively. The higher efficacy of tirzepatide, as shown here, comparing it with the highest approved dose of selective GLP‐1 RA semaglutide for the management of T2D, is probably a result of the additional GIP RA activity associated with tirzepatide. The incremental HbA1c reduction of 0.4% with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg and greater body weight reduction of 3.2 kg with tirzepatide 10 mg and 5.2 kg with tirzepatide 15 mg compared with semaglutide 2 mg reported in this analysis may help more patients reach these clinically relevant goals.

### The novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide transiently delays gastric emptying similarly to selective long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists [^111PxW4W]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are the two known incretins that enhance glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion after nutrient ingestion. GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) affect glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying (GE), and enhancing satiety to reduce food intake. 1 The magnitude of effect on GE, unlike the effects on glycaemic control or appetite, is attenuated with prolonged GLP‐1 exposure. 2, 3, 4 While GIP is the main incretin that stimulates glucose‐dependent insulin secretion and affects postprandial fat metabolism, it has no known impact on GE. 2, 3, 4

The novel dual GIP and GLP‐1RA tirzepatide has a mean half‐life of ~5 days, supporting once‐weekly dosing. 5 In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), tirzepatide demonstrated potent effects on both fasting and postprandial glycaemia and insulin response during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 5 In patients with T2DM from a phase 2b study, tirzepatide showed superior efficacy in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight reduction compared with dulaglutide (up to −25.4 mmol/mol vs. −13.7 mmol/mol and − 11.3 vs. −2.7 kg, respectively). 6

The GE rate is a major determinant of postprandial glycaemic excursions in both healthy participants and in participants with T2DM 7, 8 and has been linked to suppression of food intake and weight loss. 9 Potentially, the robust glycaemic‐lowering observed with tirzepatide could be partially attributable to its prolonged inhibitory effect on GE. 6

We investigated the GE effect of the long‐acting dual GIP and GLP‐1RA tirzepatide versus selective GLP‐1RAs in non‐clinical and clinical studies and the potential consequences for its glycaemic efficacy.

### Tirzepatide for older adults with type 2 diabetes and without obesity: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trials [^117K1aN3]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this post hoc analysis suggest that tirzepatide may offer glycemic and weight management benefits in older adults without obesity, with a safety profile supporting individualized treatment. Dose adjustments may help optimize the balance between efficacy and tolerability, particularly in patients at higher risk of adverse events. For a population at increased risk of cognitive decline and comorbidities, the low hypoglycemia risk associated with tirzepatide may be particularly noteworthy.

Further research is warranted to explore the physiological differences influencing glycemic responses across subgroups and to assess outcomes in older, frail populations.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^1116rkYt]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — Tirzepatide outcomes and regulatory status: Tirzepatide, a co‑agonist of glucagon‑like peptide‑1 (GLP‑1) and glucose‑dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors, was approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with mean weight loss results of 5.5 kg greater than semaglutide 1.0 mg at 40 weeks of treatment in subjects with T2DM, and although not yet approved for obesity, in participants without T2DM the highest dose of tirzepatide 15 mg weekly demonstrated mean weight loss of 21% after 72 weeks of treatment, with nearly 40% achieving ≥ 25% total body weight loss (TBWL).

### Comparative efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide 5–15 mg in obesity with or without type 2 diabetes: a systematic review of phase 3 clinical trials [^115NZo1x]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Both semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide have been recently approved for chronic use in obesity. There is a lack of literature comparing the efficacy and safety of both these agents in people with obesity/overweight with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). We systematically reviewed Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with two agents to synthesize the comparative efficacy and safety outcomes.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed electronic databases until December 15, 2024, using selected keywords and Boolean "AND". Subsequently, we compared the most closely matched trials conducted with semaglutide 2.4 mg and tirzepatide through an adjusted (if baseline imbalance in treatment outcome modifiers present) or unadjusted (in the absence of baseline imbalance) indirect treatment comparison method.

Results

We identified one trial each of semaglutide 2.4 mg (STEP-1) and tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg (SURMOUNT-1) in obese or overweight people without T2D and one trial each of semaglutide 2.4 mg (STEP-2) and tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg (SURMOUNT-2) in overweight people with T2D that were almost entirely comparable concerning baseline outcome modifier characteristics. Our unadjusted analysis without individual patients' data found relatively higher (4 and 5.4% additional) weight loss, HbA1c (-0.4% additional) reduction, and fewer gastrointestinal side effects (GI S/E) with tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg, respectively, than with semaglutide 2.4 mg, in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg are more effective and have fewer GI S/E than semaglutide 2.4 mg. A well-powered head-to-head RCT is currently needed to confirm these findings.

### Real world use of tirzepatide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in an arab population [^1133JpBG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Tirzepatide is a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) dual receptor agonist (RA) that reduces glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. We assessed the effectiveness of tirzepatide in real-world use in an Arab population.

Methods

Review of clinical data from a specialist outpatient diabetes centre; study time points and outcome measures were pre-specified.

Results

Tirzepatide was initiated in 8945 patients between 24 October 2022 and 31 December 2023. Of these, 3686 individuals reached 40weeks of follow-up. At initiation, the mean ± SD age was 54.1 ± 11.5years, body mass index 34.6 ± 6.0kg/m 2 and HbA1c 7.3 ± 1.5% (56 ± 17mmol/mol); 2296 (62%) were switched to tirzepatide from another GLP-RA and 317 (8.6%) reported previous bariatric surgery. The maximum dose dispensed was ≥ 12.5mg/week in 1087, 7.5–10.0mg/week in 1688 and 2.5–5.0mg/week in 911. The mean 40-week reduction in HbA1c was 0.6 ± 1.2% (8 ± 13mmol/mol) and the reduction in weight was 4.5 ± 6.9kg (4.8 ± 7.3%). GLP-RA-naïve patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c [1.0 ± 1.3% (11 ± 14mmol/mol) versus 0.5 ± 1.2% (6 ± 13mmol/mol), p < .0001] and weight (7.2 ± 8.6 vs. 4.2 ± 6.6kg, p < .0001) compared with previously exposed individuals. Post-metabolic bariatric surgery patients lost significantly more weight (7.8 ± 9.4 vs. 4.5 ± 7.0kg, p < .0001). Improvements in blood pressure, lipid profile, and liver transaminases were noted at 40weeks. Tirzepatide was well tolerated, with 288 (7.8%) of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse effects, predominantly gastrointestinal.

Conclusion

In real-world use, tirzepatide significantly reduced HbA1c levels and weight and was well tolerated. Previous GLP-RA use was associated with significantly lesser HbA1c and weight reduction, and previous metabolic bariatric surgery was associated with greater weight loss.

### Characteristics and treatment patterns of people without type 2 diabetes diagnoses who use tirzepatide in the United States [^112pvp3f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to understand real-world use of Tirzepatide among people without type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnoses in the United States in the Merative TM MarketScan® Commercial (MarketScan) and Optum Clinformatics Claims (CDM) databases.

Methods

This retrospective, observational, descriptive study used data from the MarketScan and Optum CDM databases (index date: first-observed Tirzepatide claim) from May 2021 to September 2023. Key eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years, ≥ 1 Tirzepatide claim, no baseline T2D diagnosis codes or antihyperglycemic medication use (except metformin), and continuous medical and pharmacy enrollment for ≥ 12 months pre-index. Demographic characteristics were assessed at the index date, while clinical characteristics and treatment-related data were identified during the 12-month pre-index period. Tirzepatide persistence and utilization (6 months post index) were assessed for individuals with ≥ 6 months of follow-up after initiation of Tirzepatide treatment (index date). Data were analyzed separately for each database.

Findings

Overall, 15,534 eligible adults were identified in the MarketScan database and 6800 in the Optum CDM database; mean age was 46.2 years and 55.9 years, respectively, and in both databases, > 70% were female. A total of 70.6% (MarketScan) and 81.0% (Optum CDM) of individuals had at least one obesity-related complication, with the most prevalent being hypertension, dyslipidemia, and pre-diabetes. There were 8709 individuals in the MarketScan database and 3384 in the Optum CDM database with ≥ 6 months of follow-up. In both databases, approximately two-thirds of people were started on 2.5 mg and, by the sixth prescription fill, the most common doses of Tirzepatide were 5 mg and 7.5 mg. Tirzepatide persistence ranged from 60.6% to 75.7% across both databases, with an allowed gap between prescriptions of 45 days or 60 days. Of individuals who discontinued tirzepatide, 10.2–19.5% restarted Tirzepatide during the 6-month follow-up.

Implications

In both databases, most people initiating Tirzepatide without T2D diagnoses had ≥ 1 obesity-related complication, indicating that Tirzepatide is being used in people with multimorbidity. A high proportion of people who initiated Tirzepatide were persistent on treatment at 6 months, which is higher than that previously reported for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

### Bridging the gap between GLP1-receptor agonists and cardiovascular outcomes: evidence for the role of tirzepatide [^113Wohdp]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tirzepatide (LY3298176) is the first peptide dual agonist for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which targets both GIPR and GLP1R. According to primary trials in T2DM, tirzepatide significantly reduces clinical outcomes like body weight, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, and glucose-adjusted glucagon secretion compared to typical glucagon-like peptide1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs). Additionally, new research indicates that tirzepatide potentially has some advantages over traditional metabolic regulation, such as insulin sensitivity improvement and anti-inflammatory effect. The dual mechanism of tirzepatide has a synergistic impact that is strong enough to significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular events. Studies suggest tirzepatide may help improve cardiometabolic risk factors and reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). These risk factors include blood pressure, cholesterol, and chronic inflammation. In SURPASS 4 The risk of suffering from any major adverse cardiovascular event MACE-4 and MACE-3 (including myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for angina, and all-cause death) with the highest dose of tirzepatide (15 mg per week) has been estimated at 0.50 (0.26–0.95), which was intended to provide initial proof of the cardiovascular safety of tirzepatide. The FIGHT trial specifically evaluated using the GLP-1RAs, liraglutide, in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Although the trial did not show a significant advantage in reducing cardiovascular events, or hospitalizations, it provided insights into liraglutide's safety and tolerability in this patient population. Ongoing research, such as the SUMMIT trial, is presently assessing the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in HF patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, comprehensive data on the direct effects of HF are still being developed (NCT04847557). Additionally, the positive outcomes of ongoing trials SURPASS-CVOT and SURMOUNT-MMO will provide definitive evidence regarding the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of tirzepatide compared to dulaglutide and reduction in morbiditiy and mortality in adults with obesity respectively. CVOT trial will help determine if tirzepatide can demonstrate superior cardiovascular safety and potential additional cardiovascular benefits compared to the currently approved GLP-1RA dulaglutide. the data from these two large, well-powered clinical trials will provide robust evidence on the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of tirzepatide, potentially expanding the treatment options for adults with T2DM, obesity, and related cardiovascular complications (Clinical Traials.gov). SURMOUNT-1 trial suggests that tirzepatide may have a promising future as a therapy for obesity, HF, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous meta-analyses have indicated that tirzepatide might potentially decrease the risk of cardiovascular events by affecting cardiac cells, the pancreas, and other tissues directly and indirectly. Also, the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide may have a wider perspective for its use beyond patients with T2DM or obesity. This review will discuss the limitation of GLP1RAs in patients with HF, along with ongoing trials assessing the safety and effectiveness of tirzepatide, look into the existing data, and elucidate tirzepatides potential impact on cardiovascular disease.

### The incretin co-agonist tirzepatide requires GIPR for hormone secretion from human islets [^111NFSTD]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

A second important observation is that tirzepatide has weaker activity relative to mGIP at the mGIPR. In our studies, antagonizing the GIPR did not affect tirzepatide-stimulated insulin secretion or glycemic control during an IPGTT at doses of 3 nmol kg –1, which we identified as maximal for glucose lowering in mice. However, in keeping with our data on receptor pharmacology, increasing the dose to 30 nmol kg –1, tenfold higher than maximal doses from our studies, shows that tirzepatide does have insulinotropic activity in Glp1r -/- mice or in the presence of a GLP-1R antagonist, demonstrating that tirzepatide can engage the GIPR in mouse beta cells at sufficiently high concentrations. Moreover, tirzepatide enhances insulin sensitivity in Glp1r -/- mice in a manner that is phenocopied by GIPR monoagonism, supporting the activity of tirzepatide at the mGIPR. Therefore, it is not a question of whether tirzepatide can activate the mGIPR, but rather what doses of tirzepatide are required to do so. One important consideration is that the expression patterns of the incretin receptors may determine the dose–response relationship to tirzepatide. In beta cells, which express both incretin receptors, tirzepatide is more potent at the GLP-1R, limiting the activity at the GIPR with lower doses. Higher doses of tirzepatide may allow for engagement of the mGIPR, but it remains unclear whether these high doses alter the effect of the ratio of GLP-1R:GIPR activity, potentially confounding the interpretation of results. Conversely, it may be that cell types that express only one receptor (such as adipose tissue, which only makes GIPR) or certain neuronal populations are less affected by higher doses of tirzepatide. Overall, our results in mice highlight the limitations of using mouse models to study tirzepatide, requiring careful experimental design and interpretation of data in this species.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^112J2cK5]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide (LY3298176) developed by Eli Lilly is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide containing 39 amino acids, based on the native GIP sequence. It is attached to a 20-carbon fatty diacid moiety, which binds to albumin, prolonging its half-life to 5 days and thus enabling once weekly dosing. Tirzepatide has a comparable GIP receptor binding affinity to native GIP and five times lower GLP-1 receptor affinity than that of native GLP-1. Similar to the GLP-1 RA tirzepatide is administered subcutaneously. The clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of tirzepatide has been reported in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials (Table 2).

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and / or sulfonylurea: post-hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 [^112NTJGe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety data at 104weeks in tirzepatide-treated participants with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and/or sulfonylurea.

Materials and Methods

This post-hoc analysis was based on the SURPASS-4 data (NCT03730662), a multicenter, Phase III trial. Participants were randomised to receive tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15mg) or insulin glargine. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 104weeks. Key secondary endpoints were changes in body weight and the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c < 7.0%. Safety endpoints included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia.

Results

This post-hoc analysis included 1,500 participants. At Week 104, participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater mean reduction in HbA1c (5mg: -2.3%, 10mg: -2.5%, 15mg: -2.6%) compared with the insulin glargine group (-1.0%) (p < 0.001). Participants in the tirzepatide groups had significantly greater reduction in body weight (5mg: -7.6kg, 10mg: -10.0kg, 15mg: -11.4kg) compared with the insulin glargine group (2.1kg) (p < 0.001). Significantly more participants in the tirzepatide group achieved HbA1c < 7.0% compared with the insulin glargine group (p < 0.001). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the tirzepatide groups, and gastrointestinal AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide significantly improved glycaemic control and body weight reduction compared to insulin glargine over 104weeks in participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and/or sulfonylurea. The safety profile of tirzepatide was acceptable, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than insulin glargine.

### Once-weekly tirzepatide versus once-daily basal insulin in managing type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112AJj6]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

No meta-analysis has been published comparing the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide vs once-daily basal insulins in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs. This meta-analysis was conducted to address this knowledge gap.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials involving subjects with T2D inadequately controlled with oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs and receiving tirzepatide in intervention arm and basal insulins in control arm as add-on therapy were searched throughout the electronic databases. The primary outcome assessed was the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving 4339 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Compared to basal insulins, tirzepatide arms achieved greater reductions from the baseline in HbA1c (tirzepatide 5 mg: mean difference (MD) -0.89% [95% CI: -1.23, -0.54]; tirzepatide 10 mg: MD -1.11% [95% CI: -1.42, -0.79]; and tirzepatide 15 mg: MD -1.23% [95% CI: -1.48, -0.97]; P < .00001 for all). Additionally, the proportions of patients achieving HbA1c levels below 7.0%, 6.5%, and 5.7% were significantly greater in the tirzepatide groups than in the basal insulin group. Greater body weight and blood pressure reductions were observed with tirzepatide than with basal insulins. Moreover, tirzepatide had a more favorable impact on lipid profile. Hypoglycemia was less frequent with tirzepatide. Gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) were more frequent with tirzepatide (all doses) than basal insulin, although serious AEs were comparable between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide outperformed basal insulins in controlling blood glucose, body weight, blood pressure, and lipids in subjects with T2D and is generally well-tolerated except for its higher gastrointestinal AEs.

### Bridging the gap between GLP1-receptor agonists and cardiovascular outcomes: evidence for the role of tirzepatide [^114zGqGQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A new drug named tirzepatide has been approved to treat T2DM, and it is expected to be approved for weight loss by activating both GLP-1 and GIP receptors through a unique mechanism. Currently, there are other dual GIPR/GLP-1R agonists available, such as GLP-1R/GR (glucagon receptor), GLP-1R/AR (amylin receptor), and GLP-1R/NPYR (peptide YY binds to neuropeptide Y receptors) and even triple agonists that can activate GIPR to treat obesity and T2DM. This has led to renewed interest in understanding the safety of GIP/GIPR in humans. It is essential to gain a deeper understanding of GIP safety to guide future research projects and develop GIP-based treatments. The post hoc analysis found that tirzepatide at all doses investigated reduced the prevalence of metabolic syndrome related to cardiovascular risk factors more than placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine. Comparing tirzepatide to GLP1RAs using the results of prior comparison trials is challenging. However, the added agonism of GIPR seems to have a more positive impact on weight loss. It is important to develop a single pharmacological medication with multiple functions, such as tirzepatide. This medication can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease weight, and treat dyslipidemia at an early clinical stage, while also dramatically lowering blood sugar levels. Therefore, it seems that tirzepatide is more than just a new antidiabetic drug. The development of further dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists seems to be a promising next step in managing various cardiovascular disease. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term impacts of these substances. The role of tirzepatide in therapy will become more evident as more research is conducted.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists, in the management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11777kHh]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, tirzepatide, for diabetes therapy has opened a new era on personalized glycemia control and weight loss in a safe manner with broad and promising clinical implications. Specifically, we reviewed the multiple functions of GIP/GLP-1RAs in regulating metabolism and energy balance in the context of up-to-date findings in T2DM indicating that dual GIP/GLP-1As therapy produced profound weight loss, glycemic and BFG control, and lipid lowering. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate it is possible to achieve well established, but stringent, individualizing the glycemic and BW targets for diabesity patients in a safe manner. More clinical practices are warranted to further integrate long-term efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness with country-specific cost-utility analysis comparing tirzepatide with various anti-hyperglycaemic agents or independent of this, based on health technology assessments.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^116qrVpP]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety Outcomes

The safety outcomes assessed in the NMA included the proportion of patients with T2DM with ≥ 1 episode of hypoglycaemia with blood glucose (BG) < 54 mg/dL (with or without severe hypoglycaemia), the proportion of patients with T2DM experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea, and the proportion of patients with treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs).

The definitions for hypoglycaemia varied between trials, including with or without severe hypoglycaemia, BG value of < 54/56 mg/dL, or symptomatic hypoglycaemia. In order to ensure consistency and to facilitate understanding, it was opted to define an episode of hypoglycaemia as "with BG < 54 mg/dL (with or without severe hypoglycaemia)".

The analysis of AEs allowed for the inclusion of comparator studies with safety windows that ended outside the analysis window (26 ± 4 weeks).

Dose Escalation

The duration of dose escalation employed to reach the target dose of tirzepatide in the SURPASS-5 trial was 0 to 24 weeks. The escalation period for tirzepatide 15 mg was 24 weeks to allow 20 weeks to escalate to 15 mg and an additional 4 weeks to reach a steady state, defined as achieving a stable concentration of the drug (tirzepatide) in the blood. Since most comparator studies had a duration between 22 and 30 weeks (and all comparator studies reported on at least one outcome of interest between 20 and 28 weeks), the endpoints were analysed at 26 ± 4 weeks (weeks 22–30) for comparator data, compared to tirzepatide data at week 40. The time window of 26 ± 4 weeks allowed a balanced approach between data obtained from the dose escalation of tirzepatide and data available from the comparators.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^113SwQUp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall daily mean, premeal daily mean and 2‐h postmeal daily mean measured during 7‐point self‐monitored blood glucose profiles indicate that tirzepatide enabled participants to maintain a significantly lower blood glucose level throughout the day in all five studies at 40 or 52 weeks.,

In addition to the significant reductions in HbA1c and FSG, tirzepatide treatment significantly increased (to 73%) the proportion of a 24‐h period spent within a tight target glucose range (71‐140 mg/dl, 3.9‐7.8 mmol/L) compared with insulin degludec treatment (48%) at 52 weeks. This time spent in tight target glucose range was also accompanied with a smaller within‐day glucose coefficient of variation (CV %) and significant reduction in CV% compared with insulin degludec, indicating low glycaemic variability with tirzepatide.

2.2 Weight loss

Across the five SURPASS studies and the spectrum of people with type 2 diabetes represented in them, the mean baseline body weight ranged from 86 to 95 kg. Tirzepatide showed clinically meaningful reductions in body weight and a significantly higher proportion of participants achieving 5%, 10% and 15% body weight loss targets versus placebo and active comparators.,

The average weight loss ranged from 6.2 to 12.9 kg across the three dose groups for all five studies. Weight loss followed an approximately dose proportional pattern where tirzepatide 5 mg was associated with 6.2 to 7.8 kg loss, 10 mg with 7.8 to 10.7 kg loss and for 15 mg 9.5 to 12.9 kg loss (Figure 4A). All tirzepatide doses significantly reduced body weight compared with semaglutide 1 mg, and weight loss with tirzepatide 15 mg (−12.4 kg) was double that with semaglutide 1 mg (−6.2 kg). Body weight reductions were also evident when tirzepatide was combined with therapies associated with weight gain, such as insulin or sulphonylureas.

The safety profile of tirzepatide was generally similar to that of the GLP‐1 receptor agonist class and tirzepatide‐related safety findings were consistent across SURPASS 1‐5. Tirzepatide was generally well tolerated. However, discontinuation because of adverse events varied between tirzepatide and comparators in some studies (Table S1). Overall, 3% to 11% of participants who received tirzepatide reported treatment discontinuation because of adverse events, in comparison with placebo (3%), semaglutide 1 mg (4%), basal insulins (1%‐5%) and placebo with background insulin (3%). Considering SURPASS‐2 specifically, adverse events were the most common reason for treatment discontinuation with tirzepatide and semaglutide. This was more common with tirzepatide 10 [40 participants (9%)] and 15 mg [40 participants (9%)] than with tirzepatide 5 mg [28 participants (6%)] and semaglutide 1 mg [19 participants (4%)]. The proportion of participants experiencing ≥ 1 treatment‐emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between tirzepatide and comparator in each study (Table S1), and similar TEAEs emerged as common across the studies (Table S2).

### Tirzepatide (mounjaro) for the treatment of type 2… [^114sqLaq]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

|Titration: increase dosage by 2. 5 mg every four weeks to a maximum dosage of 15 mg once weekly if additional glycemic control is needed| Tirzepatide is labeled for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications. It is the first agonist that targets both glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors. 1 This dual effect is hypothesized to impact glycemic control and weight loss more than GLP-1 receptor agonism alone due in part to the prevalence of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors in adipose tissue and the brain. Effectiveness Tirzepatide was studied in five trials at 5-, 10-, and 15-mg doses: as monotherapy, as an add-on to metformin, sulfonylureas, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; and as an add-on to basal insulin.

Tirzepatide produced significant reductions in A1C levels compared with placebo at all three doses. 5, 6 Tirzepatide has not been directly compared with semaglutide; however, in patients on stable dosages of metformin, tirzepatide will produce a 2. 0% to
2. 3% reduction in A1C levels from base line, which is 0. 15 to
0. 5 percentage points more than 1 mg of semaglutide. 7 In addition, tirzepatide will reduce body weight by an average of 7. 6 to
11. 2 kg depending on the dose. This is 1. 9 to
5. 5 kg greater than treatment with semaglutide. Bottom Line Tirzepatide is effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. It provides a higher percentage of weight loss compared with similar agents, which may be attributed to its unique mechanism of action.

Tirzepatide does not replace first-line options for cardiorenal protection in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. It may be considered for patients whose priorities are achievement and maintenance of weight loss goals. However, the high cost may limit its use.

### Time spent in glycaemic control with sustained body weight reduction with tirzepatide: a post hoc analysis of the SURPASS clinical trial programme [^115YyJAc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This participant-level exploratory analysis assessed the continuous time spent in glycaemic control and/or with sustained weight reductions with tirzepatide treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the SURPASS programme.

Materials and Methods

Participants (N = 6246) from SURPASS 1–5 were randomized to once weekly tirzepatide (5, 10 or 15mg) or comparator (once weekly placebo, once weekly semaglutide 1mg, insulin degludec or insulin glargine). Continuous time spent with HbA1c < 7.0% (53mmol/mol), ≤ 6.5% (48mmol/mol) and ≥ 5% body weight reduction and combined HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48mmol/mol) with a ≥ 5% body weight reduction were assessed through 40weeks (SURPASS-1, -2, and -5) or 52weeks (SURPASS-3 and -4). The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the median duration of continuous time spent in control, and logistic regression was used to analyse the proportion of participants achieving glycaemic control and body weight reduction at any time points or at the end of the primary study period.

Results

Median time spent with HbA1c < 7.0% (53mmol/mol) was 80% (tirzepatide) versus 70% (semaglutide) and 0% (placebo) of the treatment duration in 40-week studies, and 77%-85% (tirzepatide) versus 62% (insulin degludec) and 23% (insulin glargine) of the treatment duration in 52-week studies (p < 0.001). Time spent with HbA1c < 7.0% (53mmol/mol) was generally similar across all tirzepatide doses in each study. Dose-dependent increases in time spent with ≥ 5% body weight reduction were observed with tirzepatide (median time spent: 20%-77% with tirzepatide versus 25% with semaglutide 1mg) (p < 0.001). Tirzepatide-treated participants experienced longer time spent with HbA1c ≤ 6.5% (48mmol/mol) and ≥ 5% body weight reduction versus semaglutide (median: 35%-60% vs. 7%) (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, people with T2D experienced substantially longer continuous time in glycaemic control and more sustained body weight reductions with tirzepatide versus placebo and active comparators.

### Tirzepatide versus insulin glargine as second-line or third-line therapy in type 2 diabetes in the Asia-Pacific region: the SURPASS-AP-combo trial [^115xYPuc]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Tirzepatide is a once-weekly GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist. In this phase 3, randomized, open-label trial, insulin-naive adults (≥ 18years of age) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled on metformin (with or without a sulphonylurea) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to weekly tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg or 15mg or daily insulin glargine at 66 hospitals in China, South Korea, Australia and India. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of mean change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 40 after treatment with 10mg and 15mg of tirzepatide. Key secondary endpoints included non-inferiority and superiority of all tirzepatide doses in HbA1c reduction, proportions of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0% and weight loss at week 40. A total of 917 patients (763 (83.2%) in China) were randomized to tirzepatide 5mg (n = 230), 10mg (n = 228) or 15mg (n = 229) or insulin glargine (n = 230). All doses of tirzepatide were non-inferior and superior to insulin glargine for least squares mean (s.e.) reduction in HbA1c from baseline to week 40: tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg and 15mg, -2.24% (0.07), -2.44% (0.07) and -2.49% (0.07), respectively, and insulin glargine, -0.95% (0.07), with a treatment difference ranging from -1.29% to -1.54% (all P < 0.001). Proportions of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0% at week 40 were greater in tirzepatide 5-mg (75.4%), 10-mg (86.0%) and 15-mg (84.4%) groups compared to insulin glargine (23.7%) (all P < 0.001). All tirzepatide doses led to superior body weight reduction at week 40: tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg and 15mg, -5.0kg (-6.5%), -7.0kg (-9.3%) and -7.2kg (-9.4%), respectively, compared to insulin glargine, 1.5kg (+2.1%) (all P < 0.001). The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were mild to moderate decreased appetite, diarrhea and nausea. No severe hypoglycemia was reported. Tirzepatide demonstrated superior reductions in HbA1c versus insulin glargine in an Asia-Pacific, predominately Chinese, population with T2D and was generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04093752.

### Effects of tirzepatide versus insulin glargine on kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes in the SURPASS-4 trial: post-hoc analysis of an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^111yV6ax]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

The study SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) was published by Hiddo J L Heerspink and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: is tirzepatide superior to insulin glargine in patients with T2DM with regard to renal outcomes? In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 1995 patients. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM mellitus, chronic or acute pancreatitis, acute or chronic hepatitis, diabetic retinopathy requiring urgent treatment, heart attack or stroke in the past 2 months. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 995 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1000 insulin glargine (titrated to 100 U/mL SC once daily). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration decline (1.4 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m²; AD -2.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -1.6 to -2.8). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in urine albumin-creatinine ratio reduction (6.8% vs. -36.9%; AD 31.9%, 95% CI 25.7 to 37.7). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine with respect to estimated glomerular filtration decline.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^114arUiH]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) based therapy is an established treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is recommended early in the treatment algorithm owing to glycaemic efficacy, weight reduction and favourable cardiovascular outcomes. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), on the other hand, was thought to have no potential as a glucose-lowering therapy because of observations showing no insulinotropic effect from supraphysiological infusion in people with T2DM. However, emerging evidence has illustrated that co-infusion of GLP-1 and GIP has a synergetic effect, resulting in significantly increased insulin response and glucagonostatic response, compared with separate administration of each hormone. These observations have led to the development of a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, known as a 'twincretin'. Tirzepatide is a novel dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic peptide containing 39 amino acids, based on the native GIP sequence. Pre-clinical trials and phase 1 and 2 clinical trials indicate that tirzepatide has potent glucose lowering and weight loss with adverse effects comparable to those of established GLP-1 receptor agonists. The long-term efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide will be investigated in the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trial programme. In this paper, we will review the pre-clinical and phase 1 and 2 trials for tirzepatide in the management of T2DM and give an overview of the SURPASS clinical trials.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a network meta-analysis [^111Lp6Xz]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The relative efficacy and safety of tirzepatide was compared with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with basal insulin using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM treated with insulin and an antihyperglycaemic drug. For the NMA, studies included trials with 100% of patients treated with basal insulin background therapy with a titration scheme comparable to the SURPASS-5 trial. The following data were extracted for efficacy and safety assessment at the primary endpoint of each study: changes from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight and the incidence of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea, hypoglycaemia, and patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. In this study, a comparative analysis of tirzepatide was performed with the GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide, exenatide, and lixisenatide in addition to placebo.

Results

A total of six studies were included across the analyses. Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed statistically significant, greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight at the primary endpoint versus all GLP-1 RA comparators and placebo. Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg showed a statistically significant, higher likelihood of experiencing nausea compared with those who received placebo or exenatide 2 mg; no statistically significant differences were observed when compared with all other GLP-1 RA comparators. No statistically significant differences were observed in the proportions of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events when tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg were compared with GLP-1 RA comparators, apart from tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg versus placebo.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide demonstrated statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight when compared with selected GLP-1 RAs and placebo in patients with T2DM treated with basal insulin. Overall, the safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to that of GLP-1RAs.

### Efficacy of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg versus semaglutide 2 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes: an adjusted indirect treatment comparison [^113GjN4G]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tirzepatide is a once‐weekly glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP‐1 RA) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg have been extensively investigated in the phase 3 SURPASS programme in various populations along the continuum of T2D management. All doses of tirzepatide have shown superior reduction from baseline at the primary endpoint in HbA1c and body weight versus placebo (in the SURPASS‐1 study as monotherapy and in the SURPASS‐5 study as add‐on to titrated basal insulin), semaglutide 1 mg (SURPASS‐2), insulin degludec (SURPASS‐3) and insulin glargine 100 units/ml (SURPASS‐4). In the SURPASS‐2 study, all doses of tirzepatide were superior to semaglutide 1 mg, a selective GLP‐1 RA, in both HbA1c and body weight change from baseline at week 40 in patients with T2D taking metformin with HbA1c above target. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide was similar to that of semaglutide. Semaglutide was first approved as a once‐weekly injection at maintenance doses of 0.5 and 1 mg by the FDA in 2017and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018. At the time of the SURPASS‐2 study design and conduct, 1 mg was the highest approved dose of semaglutide for the management of patients with T2D who had shown superiority in lowering glucose levels and reducing body weight compared with two selective GLP‐1 RAs, dulaglutide (0.75 and 1.5 mg) and exenatide (2 mg) once weekly, with a similar safety profile.

### Use of tirzepatide in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: scientific evidence and practical aspects [^115szXP7]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the novelty of this medication, we aim to review practical aspects of tirzepatide use in T2DM and the supporting scientific evidence. To do so, a scientific committee was formed with ten endocrinologist (Luis Alberto Vazquez, Esteban Jodar-Gimeno, Santiago Tofe-Povedano, Diego Bellido-Guerrero, Marta Botella-Serrano, Alfonso Soto-Gonzalez, Pedro Mezquita-Raya, Elias Delgado, Carmen Fahardo-Montanana, and Cristobal Morales-Portillo) experts in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus and who participated in the phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program as principal investigators. They reached a consensus on the set of practical aspects to be addressed in this review using the nominal group technique, a qualitative research methodology designed as a semi-structured group discussion that secures the balanced participation of all group members, encouraging them with an equal opportunity to express their ideas. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

The expert group agreed on selecting the following practical aspects and the supporting scientific evidence:

Clinical Profiles of Patients and Tirzepatide Use

One of the approved indications for tirzepatide is the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled T2DM; notwithstanding, a consensus was reached regarding the selection of the following practical aspects related to certain patient profiles, fulfilling this indication, for the use of tirzepatide.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^111tFFYJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, is a new incretin-based therapy for type 2 diabetes. The degree of HbA1c reduction and weight reduction observed in pre-clinical, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials has not previously been observed in diabetes clinical trials. The comprehensive phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial programme will confirm comparable efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide in the management of T2DM diabetes. The SURPASS trials will also provide insight into understanding of incretin hormones, particularly the role of GIP in energy metabolism. The SURPASS-1 trial is due to be completed in October 2020 and results are eagerly awaited.

2.4 Tirzepatide

Tirzepatide and semaglutide are both potent GLP‐1 receptor agonists used to treat T2D. Like semaglutide, tirzepatide offers the convenience of a once‐weekly subcutaneous injection but has the unique advantage of being a dual GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide) and GLP1RA. This dual action allows tirzepatide to concurrently target multiple pathways involved in glucose regulation, potentially providing additional benefits in managing diabetes. Both medications have shown significant efficacy in improving glycaemic control and are generally well‐tolerated, but tirzepatide's distinct pharmacological profile holds promise in enhancing diabetes management outcomes. A 40‐week, phase 3 trial, randomized trial compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide and semaglutide in patients with T2D. The study found that tirzepatide was superior to semaglutide regarding the mean change in glycated haemoglobin level. Another study compared the effects of tirzepatide 15 mg to placebo and semaglutide on additional factors such as α and β cell function and insulin sensitivity. A study found that tirzepatide demonstrated impressive glycaemic efficacy in T2D by enhancing critical aspects of diabetes pathophysiology. Notably, it improves β‐cell function, insulin sensitivity, and glucagon secretion.

These substantial improvements contribute to the remarkable glucose‐lowering capabilities of tirzepatide. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in patients with T2D found that tirzepatide decreased HbA1c by 0.36% and fasting serum glucose by 13.00 mg/dL when compared with GLP‐1 RAs (semaglutide 1 mg and others). Another study found that tirzepatide significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight more effectively than semaglutide. While tirzepatide is primarily studied for its efficacy in treating T2D and obesity, ongoing clinical trials are investigating its potential use in other conditions, such as Wolfram syndrome — an orphan disease. Currently, trials are also ongoing to test the effects of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis in the United Arab Emirates population. The main aim of this trial is to provide insight into the impact on fat deposition in the liver after 6 months of treatment since non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant problem in T2D and obesity patients.
