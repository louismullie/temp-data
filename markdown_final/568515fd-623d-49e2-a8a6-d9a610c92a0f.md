## Question

Proteus mirabilis uti imaging

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to image patients with Proteus mirabilis urinary tract infections, including who needs imaging, which modality to choose, and how to act on results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathogen-specific risk of struvite stones and how that changes pretest probability. Then, I should verify guideline-based triggers for imaging in adults versus children. Next, I will examine the appropriate imaging modalities and their trade-offs. After that, I need to consider special populations and edge cases. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and close with a concise clinical recommendation, making sure I double-check each claim against high-credibility sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pathogen-specific risk signal. Proteus mirabilis produces urease, alkalinizes urine, and is strongly associated with struvite (infection) stones; repeated infections with urease-producing organisms should prompt consideration of imaging to exclude calculus, which meaningfully elevates the pretest probability of a surgically remediable nidus compared with E. coli cystitis [^111gnurc] [^1159CYr9] [^117UgbHH].

> Now, I should review adult guidance before jumping to imaging. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — routine upper tract imaging is not recommended for recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in otherwise healthy women, but exceptions exist when red flags are present; rapid recurrence with the same organism, especially P. mirabilis, is one such scenario where imaging to exclude stones is reasonable, and persistent hematuria or failure to respond to appropriate therapy also shift the balance toward imaging [^111LxDoB] [^111gnurc] [^111Gwyks] [^115qww6W].

> Next, I will examine pediatric guidance, and I need to be careful here. I initially thought "non–E. coli pathogens, including Proteus, mandate imaging", but wait, let me verify that against contemporary data; large cohorts show non–E. coli UTIs, including Proteus, do not have a higher yield of actionable abnormalities on renal tract imaging, and AAP-aligned strategies favor selective imaging rather than blanket rules by pathogen, reserving VCUG for those with abnormal RBUS or specific risk profiles rather than for Proteus alone [^117L5cKL] [^1125F894] [^112pbeqA] [^117W3So1].

> I will now examine the imaging modalities and their strengths. Ultrasound is first-line because it is noninvasive, detects hydronephrosis/obstruction, and can identify larger calculi, but it can miss small stones and subtle parenchymal complications; CT urography is the gold standard for detecting calculi, gas, and abscesses and is preferred when obstruction or emphysematous infection is suspected; MRI urography is a radiation-free alternative when CT is contraindicated, though it is less sensitive for small stones and gas; nuclear medicine (DMSA) is reserved for pediatric assessment of renal scarring rather than acute stone detection [^111Gwyks] [^112n9q4i] [^112n9q4i] [^117W3So1].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases. In neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, I should confirm that upper tract imaging is indicated for febrile UTIs that fail to respond or in moderate/high-risk patients not up to date with surveillance; in pregnancy, ultrasound is preferred and CT is generally avoided unless absolutely necessary; in men, even a first febrile UTI warrants imaging given the higher prevalence of structural abnormalities; in children with severe or complicated presentations, early ultrasound is appropriate to assess for obstruction or abscess, with escalation to CT/MRI if concerns persist [^115zZqwu] [^113GGCdL] [^113Hqkrc] [^116SCarT].

> I should double-check the decision algorithm before finalizing it. For adults with P. mirabilis UTI, image if there is rapid recurrence with the same organism, persistent hematuria, failure to respond to appropriate therapy, or other high-risk features; start with renal ultrasound and escalate to CT urography if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high. For children, do not image solely because the pathogen is Proteus; obtain renal and bladder ultrasound after a first febrile UTI to screen for structural abnormalities, and reserve VCUG for abnormal ultrasound or recurrent/atypical features rather than for Proteus per se. For all patients, if imaging reveals obstruction or a stone, arrange urology consultation for source control, as struvite stones require complete removal to eradicate infection [^111gnurc] [^111Gwyks] [^1125F894] [^1159CYr9].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the patient is systemically ill? I need to ensure I do not delay necessary imaging in complicated UTI or urosepsis; in those scenarios, cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI is appropriate to identify abscess, emphysematous change, or obstruction requiring urgent intervention, and ultrasound can be used to guide drainage if a collection is found [^113GGCdL] [^116bm7mh].

> Final clinical recommendation: Do not image every P. mirabilis UTI reflexively; image when the clinical context raises concern for a complicating factor — particularly rapid recurrence with the same organism suggesting a struvite nidus, persistent hematuria, treatment failure, or high-risk host features — and use a stepwise approach starting with ultrasound and escalating to CT urography when indicated; in children, avoid imaging based on pathogen alone and follow selective imaging pathways anchored to abnormal ultrasound or recurrent/atypical disease, with urology involvement for any identified stone or obstruction to secure source control [^111gnurc] [^111Gwyks] [^1125F894] [^1159CYr9].

---

Imaging is not routine for Proteus mirabilis UTIs, but **indicated when complications are suspected** or the infection is recurrent or refractory [^111Gwyks]. Use **renal ultrasound first** to detect obstruction, stones, or abscesses; if ultrasound is inconclusive or complications are suspected, proceed to CT [^113GGCdL]. MRI is an alternative when radiation must be avoided. Routine imaging is unnecessary for uncomplicated, first-time infections that respond to therapy [^1121DM8k].

---

## Indications for imaging in Proteus mirabilis UTIs

Imaging is **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated P. mirabilis UTIs; however, certain clinical scenarios necessitate imaging to identify complications or underlying structural abnormalities:

- **Complicated UTIs**: Patients with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised states, diabetes, or pregnancy [^113GGCdL].

- **Recurrent or persistent infections**: Rapid recurrence with the same organism, failure to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy, or persistent symptoms despite treatment [^111gnurc].

- **Suspected obstruction or stones**: P. mirabilis is associated with struvite stone formation due to urease production, leading to urinary alkalinization and crystallization [^1159CYr9].

- **Severe infections**: Acute pyelonephritis, suspected renal abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis, or other severe complications [^113GGCdL].

---

## Recommended imaging modalities

When imaging is indicated, the **choice of modality** depends on clinical context, patient factors, and suspected complications:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Renal ultrasound (US) | First-line imaging for suspected obstruction, hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or stones [^113kk4VW] | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Widely available | - Limited sensitivity for small stones <br/> - Operator-dependent |
| Computed tomography (CT) | Suspected complicated UTI, renal abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis, or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^116PeRgo] | - High sensitivity for stones, abscesses, and gas-forming infections <br/> - Detailed anatomical visualization | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast-related risks |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | Alternative to CT when radiation must be avoided (e.g. pregnancy, pediatric patients) [^112n9q4i] | - No radiation <br/> - Good soft-tissue contrast | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan times <br/> - Contrast-related risks |

---

## Specific imaging findings in Proteus mirabilis UTIs

P. mirabilis infections have **distinct imaging features** linked to urease activity and stone formation:

- **Struvite stones**: Radiopaque stones within the renal pelvis or calyces, often branching (staghorn calculi) [^notfound].

- **Hydronephrosis**: Dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to obstruction from stones or strictures.

- **Emphysematous pyelonephritis**: Gas within the renal parenchyma or collecting system, more common in diabetic patients [^113GGCdL].

- **Renal abscess**: Fluid-filled cavities within the renal parenchyma, often requiring drainage [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **selective imaging** based on clinical judgment and patient-specific factors:

- **Routine imaging**: Not recommended for uncomplicated, first-time P. mirabilis UTIs that respond to therapy [^113Hqkrc].

- **Imaging indicated**: For complicated infections, recurrent or persistent infections, suspected obstruction, or severe presentations [^112LEQSX].

- **Initial imaging**: Renal ultrasound is the preferred initial modality due to its safety and accessibility [^112n9q4i].

- **Secondary imaging**: CT or MRI should be reserved for cases where ultrasound is inconclusive or complications are strongly suspected [^116PeRgo].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Imaging for P. mirabilis UTIs should be **guided by clinical context**, with renal ultrasound as the first-line modality when indicated. CT or MRI is reserved for complicated cases or when ultrasound is inconclusive. Routine imaging is unnecessary for uncomplicated infections that respond to therapy, but is essential when complications or structural abnormalities are suspected.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should not perform a post-treatment test of cure urinalysis or urine culture in asymptomatic patients (Expert Opinion). The Panel does not endorse microbiological reassessment after successful UTI treatment as this may lead to overtreatment, and it should again be emphasized that symptom clearance is sufficient. The Panel recognizes certain scenarios that may prompt screening such as planned surgical intervention in which mucosal bleeding is anticipated. In patients with rapid recurrence (particularly with the same organism), clinicians may consider evaluation on and off therapy, and repeated infection with bacteria associated with struvite stone formation (e.g. P. mirabilis) may prompt consideration of imaging to rule out calculus.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem in childhood. During the last decade, published papers led to a deep revision in the use and usefulness of imaging tools in children with febrile UTIs. This new body of knowledge was partially endorsed by the guidelines published in 2007 by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and in 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nevertheless, new data continuously arise and the scientific debate always revives. Recommendations of published guidelines and strengths and weaknesses of the available biochemical and imaging tools are here critically analysed for giving to the reader a complete, up-to-date and flexible overview on this hot topic.

### Imaging in urinary tract infections: current strategies and new trends [^112Gh2k2]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) is to detect abnormalities that require appropriate treatment or findings that can be acted on to prevent development of complications (hypertension, chronic renal failure or pregnancy-related complications). Imaging protocols in pediatric urinary tract infections are evolving. From strategies based on extensive investigations in all children younger than 7 years of age, we are slowly moving to imaging strategies focused on children at risk of developing renal damage and possibly long-term complications. The article provides an overview on urinary tract infections, their complications and the use of imaging in their management. The different imaging strategies in children with UTIs (including the recommendation of excluding from imaging certain groups of patients) still needs full evaluation. It is interesting to note, however, a slow move from wide use of cystography in all children with UTI, which has been standard practice for many years but was probably not based on solid scientific evidence, toward a more focused use of cystograms in specific groups of children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Low yield from imaging after nonurine tract infections in children treated in primary care and emergency department [^117L5cKL]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Imaging is recommended for selected children following urinary tract infections (UTIs) to look for actionable structural abnormalities. Non -E. coli is considered high risk in many national guidelines, but evidence is mainly drawn from small cohorts from tertiary centres.

Objective

To ascertain imaging yield from infants and children < 12 years diagnosed with their first confirmed UTI (pure single growth > 100000cfu per ml) in primary care or an emergency department without admission stratified by bacteria type.

Design, Setting, Patients

Data were collected from an administrative database of a UK citywide direct access UTI service between 2000 and 2021. Imaging policy mandated renal tract ultrasound and Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scans in all children, plus micturating cystourethrogram in infants < 12 months.

Results

7730 children (79% girls, 16% aged < 1year, 55% 1–4 years) underwent imaging after first UTI diagnosed by primary care (81%) or emergency department without admission (13%). E. coli UTI yielded abnormal kidney imaging in 8.9% (566/6384). Enterococcus and KPP (Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas) yielded 5.6% (42/749) and 5.0% (24/483) with relative risks 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.86) and 0.56 (0.38 to 0.83)), respectively. No difference was found when stratified by age banding or imaging modality.

Conclusion

In this largest published group of infants and children diagnosed in primary and emergency care not requiring admission, non -E. coli UTI was not associated with a higher yield from renal tract imaging.

### State of the art: imaging of renal infections [^114ZS5FQ]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract are common and account for a large number of patient encounters in the ambulatory and emergency department setting. Their severity and presentation varies, and although uncomplicated infections can often be diagnosed and treated based on clinical and laboratory findings alone, diagnostic imaging may be necessary in some cases to guide appropriate medical or surgical therapy. We will briefly describe the indications for imaging known or suspected upper urinary tract infections, and the relative benefits and limitations of the different imaging modalities for a given clinical presentation. This will be followed by a discussion of various types of renal infections with a pictorial review of their imaging appearances and differential diagnoses.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^117W3So1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — diagnosis of cystitis and causative organisms: For a diagnosis of cystitis, acute-onset symptoms should occur with laboratory detection of a uropathogen from the urine, typically Escherichia coli (E. coli) (75% to 95%), but other Enterobacteriaceae (e.g. Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus are also described among rarer species.

### Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options [^111Toron]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^111PCAzk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Managing complicated urinary tract infections: the urologic view [^116buK5r]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated UTIs are a diverse group. These patients have upper UTIs and structural or functional abnormalities that reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. They are at increased risk for morbidity such as bacteremia and sepsis, perinephric abscess, renal deterioration, and emphysematous pyelonephritis. Appropriate urinary tract imaging, antimicrobials, medical and surgical therapies, and follow-up are required to avoid potentially devastating outcomes.

### Urinary tract infection: an update on imaging strategies [^113jKJKT]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause of morbidity in children. The distinction between upper and lower tract UTI is clinically difficult but important, as permanent renal damage can occur when the UTI involves the kidneys. Children with a history of UTI need investigated promptly and thoroughly. The goal of imaging in UTI is to aid in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, to identify those children who are at high risk of developing permanent renal damage, and to confirm and monitor the presence of renal scarring. This article reviews the role of radiology in each of these aims.

### Diagnosis and imaging in urinary tract infections [^1162U2kx]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in urinary tract infection is to detect conditions that must be treated in order to avoid immediate deterioration or recurrences, and probable long-term kidney damage. In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are male and the vesicoureteral reflux is of a higher grade than that detected in girls having had urinary tract infection. In children with urinary tract infection, several authors advocate a more selective policy and recommend imaging only in those children who are at risk for developing renal damage. In adult females no imaging is necessary in cystitis, whereas ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Because uncomplicated urinary tract infection in men is rare, diagnostic evaluation including imaging should be started early in order to rule out complicating factors within the urinary tract. The role of imaging in prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis is primarily to rule out abscess formation, but also to exclude testicular malignancies.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112pQR79]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) evaluation — Clinicians should obtain a complete patient history and perform a pelvic examination in women presenting with rUTIs (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). To make a diagnosis of rUTI, clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and the presence of uropathogenic bacteria in association with symptomatic episodes (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should obtain repeat urine studies when an initial urine specimen is suspect for contamination, with consideration for obtaining a catheterized specimen (Clinical Principle). Cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion). Clinicians may offer patient-initiated treatment (self-start treatment) to select rUTI patients with acute episodes while awaiting urine cultures (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Comparison of the diagnostic yield of routine versus indicated flowmetry, ultrasound and cystoscopy in women with recurrent urinary tract infections [^114gQj7U]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging

Current guidelines do not advocate routine upper tract imaging, preferring instead that it be reserved for cases with atypical presentations, suspected urinary tract obstruction, gross (or persistent microscopic) hematuria, a history of renal/bladder calculi or urea-splitting bacteria on cultures (i.e. Proteus or Yersinia). However, the guidelines do not specify the preferred imaging modality. In the present study, 101 (22.6%) abnormalities were detected by ultrasound, and of the 7 (1.6%) of these that required urgent care, 2 were potentially life-threatening (a UCC and an adnexal tumor on CT). The lack of a significant difference in the percentage of abnormalities between hospitals further demonstrated that the chances of finding an abnormality are low even when requested by indication or, alternatively, that we do not have accurate indications. In patients with recurrent UTIs, only two studies have used ultrasound results. While these described 20 abnormalities on 184 ultrasound images (12.1%), none were related to the rUTI and only 5 required urgent care. No studies have investigated the utility of CT.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^112LEQSX]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — imaging and endoscopy: There are currently no specific guidelines for imaging studies for women with rUTI; indications for imaging in women with UTI include persistent symptoms, including persistent fever after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy, rapid recurrence after appropriate treatment, suspected stone or obstruction, and higher-risk diabetes. Cystourethroscopy should be considered if a woman is at risk for suspected foreign body, although the utility of cystoscopy in evaluation of rUTI has not been well studied; one retrospective study reported that 3.8% of the 163 participants had specific findings on cystoscopy that imaging would not detect. Cystoscopy with cytology should be performed when there is clinical suspicion for premalignancy or malignancy. For suspected stones, assessment can be initiated with plain abdominal radiographs, and when a more complete assessment of the upper tracts is warranted, renal ultrasound or computed tomographic urogram should be used; in general, a computed tomographic urogram, which is with and without intravenous contrast, is the imaging modality of choice in suspected pyelonephritis and renal and perirenal abscess, and it can also identify a possible source of infection such as renal or ureteric stones.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114MB8QF]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Practice considerations — population and definition: This recommendation applies to adults 18 years and older and pregnant persons of any age without signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection and does not apply to persons who have chronic medical or urinary tract conditions, such as end-stage renal disease; have neurogenic bladders, urinary stents, or spinal cord injuries; are hospitalized; reside in an institution (e.g., a nursing home); or who are transplant recipients. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs when the urinary tract is colonized with significant amounts of pathogenic bacteria, primarily from the gastrointestinal tract, in the absence of symptoms or signs of a urinary tract infection; the most common pathogen is Escherichia coli, although other bacteria such as Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and group B streptococcus can be involved. The risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria varies by age, sex, and pregnancy status; because of the location and length of the female urethra, women are predisposed to infections of the urinary tract, in general, men are at low risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria, and persons with diabetes are also at increased risk of developing asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### High incidence of abnormal imaging findings in circumcised boys diagnosed with urinary tract infections [^116aBFWg]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend delaying voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) until the second febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Similarly, the NICE Guidelines do not recommend VCUG after the first febrile UTI in infants and children under three years of age. Currently, there is no good clinical indicator to determine which patients would benefit from an earlier cystogram. Here, we sought to identify clinical and bacteriologic findings that are associated with an increased risk of urinary tract anatomic anomalies in pediatric males presenting to the Emergency Department with a UTI.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of all urine cultures from the Emergency Department at our institution between 2006 and 2015. Males under 18 years of age with ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of Proteus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus were included. Clean catch, catheterized and suprapubic aspiration specimens were included. Bagged specimens and specimens from patients on intermittent catheterization were excluded. Ultrasound and cystogram images were reviewed when available. Univariate and multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate and compare prevalence ratios. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata software, version 15.1 MP (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).

Results

We reviewed 1585 urine cultures, of which 812 met eligibility criteria including 619 (76.2%) E. coli, 84 (10.3%) Proteus, 55 (6.8%) Klebsiella, 29 (3.6%) Staphylococcus, 13 (1.6%) Enterococcus and 12 (1.5%) Streptococcus. Median age was six months (2.4–36 months IQR). After adjusting for age, ethnicity and bacterial species, the prevalence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, defined as grades III-V) was 5.3 times higher in circumcised males compared to uncircumcised males (95% CI: 2.4–11.4, p = 0.001). Circumcised males had a 3.1 times increased prevalence of high-grade hydronephrosis (defined as SFU grades 3 and 4) compared to uncircumcised males (prevalence ratio: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.0–10.0, p = 0.05). Among bacterial pathogens, no patients with Proteus UTI had high-grade hydronephrosis or dilating VUR. In contrast, Staphylococcal infections were associated significantly with dilating VUR (prevalence ratio 10.1, 95% CI: 2.3, 44.8; p = 0.002) and high-grade hydronephrosis (prevalence ratio 8.1, 95% CI: 1.7, 39.7; p = 0.010).

Conclusions

Circumcision status is an independent predictor of structural urinary anomalies of the bladder and upper tracts in pediatric males with UTI, therefore circumcised males should be considered for early imaging, including VCUG, after their first UTI. Furthermore, Staphylococcal infections were associated with an even higher prevalence of high-grade hydronephrosis and dilating VUR and therefore warrant early investigation with VCUG. In contrast, none of the Proteus infections, which were seen almost exclusively in uncircumcised males, were associated with dilating VUR or hydronephrosis, making initial observation more appropriate in these patients.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1174SWeg]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

RBUS after initial febrile UTI — timing and evidence profile: RBUS is recommended during the first 2 days of treatment to identify serious complications when the clinical illness is unusually severe or substantial clinical improvement is not occurring; for febrile infants with UTIs who demonstrate substantial clinical improvement, imaging does not need to occur early during the acute infection. Findings on nuclear scans are not recommended as part of routine evaluation of infants with their first febrile UTI, and the radiation dose during dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning is generally low (~1 mSv). Aggregate quality of evidence is C (observational studies). Benefits state that RBUS in this population will yield abnormal results in ~15% of cases, and 1% to 2% will have abnormalities that would lead to action. Harms/risks/costs note that between 2% and 3% will be false-positive results. The benefit-harms assessment is "Preponderance of benefit over harm", and value judgments emphasize that "The seriousness of the potentially correctable abnormalities in 1% to 2%, coupled with the absence of physical harm, was judged sufficiently important to tip the scales in favor of testing". Policy level is "Recommendation".

### Urinary tract infection in children: diagnosis, treatment, imaging-comparison of current guidelines [^114435LA]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent disorder of childhood, yet the proper approach for a child with UTI is still a matter of controversy. The objective of this study was to critically compare current guidelines for the diagnosis and management of UTI in children, in light of new scientific data.

Methods

An analysis was performed of the guidelines from: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology, Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Polish Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society for Pediatric Urology (ESPU). Separate aspects of the approach for a child with UTI, including diagnosis, treatment and further imaging studies, were compared, with allowance for recent research in each field.

Conclusions

The analyzed guidelines tried to reconcile recent reports about diagnosis, treatment, and further diagnostics in pediatric UTI with prior practices and opinions, and economic capabilities. There was still a lack of sufficient data to formulate coherent, unequivocal guidelines on UTI management in children, with imaging tests remaining the main area of controversy. As a result, the authors formulated their own proposal for UTI management in children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pyelonephritis: 2022 update [^113GGCdL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) that has the potential to cause sepsis, shock, and death. In the majority of patients, uncomplicated APN is diagnosed clinically and is responsive to treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In patients who are high risk or when treatment is delayed, microabscesses may coalesce to form an acute renal abscess. High-risk patients include those with a prior history of pyelonephritis, lack of response to therapy for lower UTI or for APN, diabetes, anatomic or congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, infections by treatment-resistant organisms, nosocomial infection, urolithiasis, renal obstruction, prior renal surgery, advanced age, pregnancy, renal transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients and patients with renal transplants on immunosuppression are at an elevated risk of severe complications. Imaging studies are often requested to aid with the diagnosis, identify precipitating factors, and differentiate lower UTI from renal parenchymal involvement, particularly in high-risk individuals. Imaging is usually not appropriate for the first-time presentation of suspected APN in an uncomplicated patient. The primary imaging modalities used in high-risk patients with suspected APN are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, although CT was usually not appropriate for initial imaging in a pregnant patient with no other complications. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute pyelonephritis [^115fxkfK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis refers to infection involving the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis. In most patients, uncomplicated pyelonephritis is diagnosed clinically and responds quickly to appropriate antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, the patient is immunocompromised, or for other reasons, microabscesses that form during the acute phase of pyelonephritis may coalesce, forming a renal abscess. Patients with underlying diabetes are more vulnerable to complications, including emphysematous pyelonephritis in addition to abscess formation. Additionally, diabetics may not have the typical flank tenderness that helps to differentiate pyelonephritis from a lower urinary tract infection. Additional high-risk populations may include those with anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, pregnancy, nosocomial infection, or infection by treatment-resistant pathogens. Treatment goals include symptom relief, elimination of infection to avoid renal damage, and identification of predisposing factors to avoid future recurrences. The primary imaging modalities used in patients with pyelonephritis are CT, MRI, and ultrasound. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1159CYr9]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

ASB and struvite stones — management of urease-producing bacteriuria: Certain bacteria (most commonly P. mirabilis) produce urease and are associated with infection (struvite) stones, and when infection stones are present, complete removal of the stones is required to eradicate the associated UTI. However, there is no clear evidence that identification and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) caused by urease-producing organisms prevents struvite stone formation, and for these reasons the Panel does not recommend the routine treatment of urease-producing bacteriuria (including P. mirabilis) in the absence of UTI symptoms or documented urinary tract stones. In certain patients with recurrent struvite stones, screening for and treating urease-producing bacteriuria may be indicated if other measures have not been able to prevent stone formation.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion), supported by low diagnostic yield data: in a single-institutional cohort of 163 women, cystoscopy identified only 9 clinically significant cases and only five were uniquely identified, and intravenous urography (IVU) was normal in 91.7% with only 5.5% positive IVUs among 164 female patients without management change; cystoscopy is not necessary for gross hematuria with a positive urine culture and no risk factors for urothelial malignancy, but if any risk factors are present cystoscopy should be performed, and further evaluation for bladder cancer should be performed with gross hematuria without documented infection; higher yield may occur in "high-risk" presentations (gross or persistent microscopic hematuria, pyelonephritis, atypical presentation), and for any patient with suspicion for pyelonephritis, or history of hematuria or renal calculi, upper tract imaging is recommended.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113p1GKE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Proteus empyema as a rare complication from an infected renal cyst, a case report [^113nyYxz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

While cases of Proteus mirabilis empyema have previously been reported as a consequence of conditions such as pyelonephritis, we present, to our knowledge, the first case of a Proteus mirabilis empyema as a consequence of an infected renal cyst communicating with the pleural space. A prior case series identified Proteus mirabilis in the pleural fluid of three separate patients who had effusions secondary to either metastatic malignancy or heart failure. Despite the different etiologies, all three effusions were alkalotic with an average pH of 7.77. The alkalinity of the fluid was hypothesized to be the result of the urease producing ability of Proteus. The measurement of pleural fluid pH along with pleural ammonia levels were thought to be of diagnostic utility when considering Proteus as a causative organism. Though our patient's pleural fluid pH was 6.2, the use of procedural lidocaine may explain this discrepancy from the findings of the aforementioned study.

Our case presented an otherwise healthy female with few comorbidities who was found to have an empyema secondary to Proteus. Despite the infected chronic renal cyst, her lack of urinary symptoms or abnormal urinalysis is consistent with prior cases of Proteus -related lung infections, demonstrating the importance of considering an intra-abdominal source of infection in these cases.

This study highlights that further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging should be considered when unusual organisms are found in the pleural space. Anatomic abnormalities that become apparent on imaging may help elucidate the source of infection. In combination with laboratory markers, radiologic findings can prove to be of equal importance in guiding treatment.

Clinical overview of urinary tract infections

The commonest conditions predisposing patients to either acquiring infection or experiencing a more severe outcome are listed in Table 1, categorised with the mnemonic RENUC.

Table 1
Risk factors for acquiring urinary tract infection, developing complications, and/or failing treatment (mnemonic RENUC) [Adapted from Ref.]

C-UTIs may or may not cause symptoms. Manifestations of active infection often overlap with pre-existing chronic complaints secondary to the underlying lower urinary tract dysfunction. The severity of UTI is graded clinically as follows: a) asymptomatic; b) causing local symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, supra- or retropubic pain or bladder tenderness; c) causing general symptoms including fever, flank pain, nausea and vomiting; d) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS); and e) circulatory and organ failure. The SIRS includes fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, tachycardia and tachypnoea, and represents the first step to multi-organ failure. Urosepsis is defined by the presence of UTI plus SIRS, and warrants immediate bacteriological and imaging investigation to allow for timely treatment. Although associated with a better prognosis than other forms of sepsis, urosepsis remains a critical situation, with a 20–40% fatality rate, particularly in the elderly and immunocompromised. Mortality is considerably increased in severe sepsis (with symptoms of organ dysfunction) and septic shock (with persistent hypotension).

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Improving the care of children with urinary tract infection: use of a clinical decision proforma [^116BvaDg]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

UTI is a common and important clinical problem in children. Around 1 in 10 girls and 1 in 30 boys will have had a UTI by the age of 16 years. Early recognition and appropriate management can prevent deterioration and reduce the incidence of long-term sequelae. Aside from satisfactory resolution of the acute infection, an important consideration in the management of UTI is the use of imaging to visualise the kidneys and urinary tract. The primary purpose of this imaging is to identify anatomical abnormalities such as obstructive uropathies or vesicoureteric reflux. Early identification of such abnormalities allows management such as surgery or antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent renal damage. Preventing renal damage in these situations may reduce the subsequent development of serious conditions relating to renal scarring including hypertension and renal failure.

Due to the large numbers of children who are diagnosed with UTI, follow up imaging is not indicated in all cases in order to reduce the burden this would place on imaging services and the unnecessary radiation exposure that would be involved. Balancing the importance of identifying abnormalities against the clinical risk of imaging and economic burden is clearly a delicate task. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced a guideline to support clinicians in this area. The NICE clinical guideline 54: Urinary tract infection in children (CG54) was issued in 2007 and provides an imaging strategy which takes into account the age of the child, and defines recurrent and atypical UTI which require different imaging follow up.

### Imaging of urinary tract infection in the adult [^113Hqkrc]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the adult is primarily based on typical patient symptomatology and urinary evaluation for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Uncomplicated UTI usually does not require radiological evaluation unless it is recurrent. Imaging should, in general, be reserved for those patients in whom conventional treatment has failed or those who have recurrent or unusually severe symptoms. Patients with conditions predisposing to infection, or complications thereof, such as diabetes mellitus or immunocompromised states, may also benefit from early imaging. If pyonephrosis is suspected, early imaging and possible urgent drainage is also warranted. Intravenous urogram and ultrasound have traditionally been used in the assessment of these patients, allowing detection of calculi, obstruction and incomplete bladder emptying. These imaging techniques, while useful, have limitations in the evaluation of renal inflammation and infection in the adult. Computerised tomography has now become accepted as a more sensitive modality for diagnosis and follow-up of complicated renal tract infection. Contrast-enhanced CT allows different phases of excretion to be studied and can define extent of disease and identify significant complications or obstruction. Nuclear medicine has a limited role in the evaluation of urinary tract infection in adults. Its main role is in the assessment of renal function, often prior to surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging has a limited but increasing role. It is particularly useful in those with iodinated contrast allergies, offering an ionising radiation free alternative in the diagnosis of both medical and surgical diseases of the kidney.

Urinary infections are common. Typically, infections of the upper and lower urinary tract do not require imaging. However, in the presence of confirmed or suspected complicated urinary tract infections, imaging to assess for underlying causes and complications is required. Computed tomography imaging is useful in identifying predisposing structural abnormalities of the urinary tracts and complications of urologic infection. Ultrasonography can be used to identify hydronephrosis and may be used to guide percutaneous intervention. Recurrent chronic infections can lead to end organ damage or chronic granulomatous processes. Rarely, systemic inflammatory disorders can involve the upper and lower urinary tracts.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common of bacterial infections. Imaging studies are only required in cases of complicated UTIs. Ultrasound remains the first-line imaging method; however, CT is the gold standard for evaluation of UTIs. MR imaging's improved contrast resolution and absence of ionizing radiation may recommend its use for assessment of lower UTIs. Furthermore, MR imaging performs with diagnostic accuracy at least similar to CT in complicated UTIs, except for the identification of calculi and emphysematous pyelonephritis. In this article, the role of MR imaging for the evaluation of infectious and inflammatory disease processes of the urinary tract is reviewed.

Urodynamics

Three CPGs gave recommendations on when to perform urodynamics. One recommended routine flowmetry based on expert opinion, one recommended urodynamics in specific cases based on a flowchart, and one recommended urodynamics for suspected lower urinary tract dysfunction based on expert opinion.

Upper tract imaging

Seven CPGs advised against routine imaging of the upper urinary tract. However, one CPG advised that a single sonography should be performed based on the results of a single-center retrospective study. According to these CPGs, imaging was indicated in atypical case or for patients with persistent haematuria, impaired kidney function tests, or poor response to antibiotic treatment.

Cystoscopy

All CPGs unambiguously stated that cystoscopy should not be performed routinely for recurrent UTI, but they differed in the indications that warrant cystoscopy. Clearly gross macroscopic haematuria was considered an indication, but one CPG stated that cystoscopy could be omitted if macroscopic haematuria was only present at the time of an active infection in women aged < 40 years with no risk factors for urothelial cell carcinoma. Most CPGs advised that cystoscopy should be performed in atypical cases or when anatomical abnormalities were suspected. The EAU stated that in these cases cystoscopy should be performed without delay. The other CPGs did not specify a time frame.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

This article is focused on the controversial topic of imaging strategies in pediatric urinary tract infection. A review of the recent literature illustrates the complementary roles of ultrasound, diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine. The authors stress the key role of ultrasound which has recently been debated. The commonly associated vesicoureteric reflux has to be classified as congenital or secondary due to voiding dysfunction. A series of frequently asked questions are addressed in a second section. The proposed answers are not the product of a consensus but should rather be considered as proposals to enrich the ongoing debate concerning the evaluation of urinary tract infection in children.

Case presentation

A 40-year-old African American female presented to our institution with 5 weeks of upper respiratory tract symptoms and chest pain. Her past medical history was significant for asthma, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and sickle cell trait. Prior to admission, she was seen at urgent care centers and her symptoms were attributed to a viral illness and supportive care was recommended. Given worsening dyspnea on exertion, she presented to the emergency room for further evaluation. Initial vital signs were notable for a temperature of 100.5 ° Fahrenheit, heart rate of 107, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 126/75, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on 2 l per minute of supplemental oxygen. Physical examination on arrival was notable for diaphoresis, tachypnea, diminished breath sounds in the left lung base as well as dullness to percussion over the left lower lung field, and tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Workup with a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest did not show evidence of a pulmonary embolism but was notable for a loculated left sided pleural effusion with associated left lower lobe consolidation. She was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin empirically, and a chest tube was inserted which resulted in drainage of frank pus. Fluid analysis showed a WBC of 210,200 cells/uL, LDH of 12,915 units/L, and a pleural fluid pH of 6.2. A gram stain was positive for gram negative rods.

Intrapleural fibrinolytics with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and deoxyribonuclease (DNAse) were administered for 72 h given the presence of loculations. With no significant improvement following fibrinolytics, she was taken to the operating room for large bore chest tube placement and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decortication of the left visceral pleura. Pleural fluid cultures speciated to Proteus mirabilis (Fig. 1), so she underwent further imaging to evaluate for a primary source. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis revealed a complex cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney that communicated with the ipsilateral diaphragm (Figs. 2 and 3).

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116AYxK5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^115zZqwu]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU — urinary tract infection guidance in NLUTD advises that in asymptomatic NLUTD patients, clinicians should not perform surveillance/screening urine testing, including urine culture (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), and clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with NLUTD (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In NLUTD patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis and urine culture (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In NLUTD patients with a febrile urinary tract infection, clinicians should order upper tract imaging if the patient does not respond appropriately to antibiotic therapy or the patient is moderate- or high-risk and is not up to date with routine upper tract imaging, regardless of their response to therapy (Clinical Principle). In NLUTD patients with a suspected urinary tract infection and an indwelling catheter, clinicians should obtain the urine culture specimen after changing the catheter and after allowing for urine accumulation while plugging the catheter, and urine should not be obtained from the extension tubing or collection bag (Clinical Principle). In NLUTD patients with recurrent urinary tract infections, clinicians should evaluate the upper and lower urinary tracts with imaging and cystoscopy (Clinical Principle), and in those with an unremarkable evaluation of the upper and lower urinary tract, clinicians may perform urodynamic evaluation (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In NLUTD patients who manage their bladder with an indwelling catheter, clinicians should not use daily antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infection (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B).

Further Imaging

In post-acute infection, urinary tract USS may help define urological abnormalities (GRADE C).
USS/CT/MRI can be useful to follow a renal abscess (GRADES C and D).
Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and DMSA are now saved for specific instances where less invasive investigations do not give enough prognostic information, usually for children with severe urological abnormalities (GRADE D).

Ultrasound Scan

After the first episode of upper UTI, children under the age of 3 years should have a renal tract USS after the acute phase to detect potential structural abnormalities or parenchymal lesions. Obtaining an USS and MCUG after the first UTI in young children is, however, not strongly supported by high-grade evidence. A prospective study involving 309 children showed that the identified abnormalities, which were found in 12 percent (37/309) of the children, and obtained within 72 hours after diagnosis, did not modify management. Some guidelines recommend USS in case of atypical or recurrent UTI. Children who are older than 2–24 months who experience recurrent febrile UTIs should also be evaluated, though USS has a poor sensitivity for detecting mild-moderate VUR. Due to its rarity, there is a gap of evidence regarding recommendations of follow-up in children with suspected nephronia or abscess, but they may benefit from further imaging with MRI or CT.

Micturating Cystourethrography

Many guidelines recommend performing a MCUG after abnormal USS findings, non- E. coli causative pathogens or recurrent UTI. Combinations of unusual pathogens and pathological USS increase the probability of high-grade VUR to over 50%.

DMSA Scan

Although the specificity for detecting high-grade VUR after DMSA renal scan is low, they can detect renal scars, differences in relative renal function between the kidneys and deterioration of renal function or new scars over time.DMSA and its timing remain controversial for the evaluation of a child after cUTI, but children with high-grade VUR or recurrent UTI should undergo a DMSA scan to keep track of renal damage.DMSA should be performed 3–6 months after the acute episode so that transient inflammatory changes have resolved. In 1 study, the incidence of renal scarring was associated with the severity of renal parenchymal infection, with 22% of children with pyelonephritis having scars, 44% with nephronia and 72% with abscess.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children are common and a major source of morbidity. The incidence of UTIs in childhood is not precisely known because it is not a reportable disease, and in many cases, especially in infants, UTIs are underdiagnosed. Furthermore, the definitions and criteria for diagnosis vary considerably. This article reviews the diagnosis and work-up of UTIs in children, and presents current data reviewing the roles of radiologic imaging, surgical correction, and antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of pediatric UTIs.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis [^117Rdaxf]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an uncommon chronic destructive granulomatous process of renal parenchyma in association with long-term urinary tract obstruction and infection. It affects females more often than males, with a wide range of age, from newborn to elderly. Almost all patients are symptomatic and the most common symptoms are flank or abdominal pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, fever, palpable mass, gross hematuria, and weight loss. The common laboratory findings are leukocytosis and anemia. Urine cultures most often reveal Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Computed tomography is the mainstay of diagnostic imaging for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Imaging studies may demonstrate diffuse or focal form. Histologically, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis presents a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, xanthomatous histiocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. The differential diagnosis includes clear cell renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma, sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, malakoplakia, and megalocytic interstitial nephritis. Both antibiotics and surgery can be treatment options depending on the patient's disease status.

### Guidelines to identify abnormalities after childhood urinary tract infections: a prospective audit [^114B5foK]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

From 1991, most UK paediatricians managed urinary tract infections (UTIs) according to recommendations from the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), but these generate a high imaging burden (table 1) and were not felt to substantially improve the outcomes for children. Thus, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) drew up new guidelines(CG54) in 2007 which were designed to reduce the imaging burden by investigating higher risk children, using the selection criteria summarised in table 2. The Newcastle GPs and the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NICE Guideline Committee undertook a preimplementation audit of CG54 against their existing RCP-based guidelines because CG54 had not been trialled.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^111wiGoG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States (US), primarily affecting women. In the US, half of women experience ≥ 1 UTI by the age of 35 years, and 1 in 3 women experiences ≥ 1 UTI requiring antibiotic treatment in her lifetime, with 11% experiencing ≥ 1 UTI per year. UTI incidence in the US increased by 52% between 1998 and 2011, resulting in 400 000 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion in 2011. UTIs have also been increasing in outpatient settings and cause substantial negative impact on activity and health-related quality of life.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen causing UTIs. Escherichia coli accounts for up to 80% of uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), which typically affect otherwise healthy individuals without underlying structural abnormalities or instrumentation, and approximately a quarter of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), which occur in the presence of structural abnormalities or instrumentation compromising the urinary tract. Other gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B Streptococcus can also cause UTIs. Following an initial uUTI, subsequent UTIs are common and may be caused by the same or different pathogens.

Antibiotic treatment for UTI is often empiric without urine culture or susceptibility testing, and is usually based on national guidelines and local resistance profiles. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. UTIs also have a high recurrence rate, leading to increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has been increasing, resulting in increased risk of treatment failure, patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

Given the continued burden of UTIs, current data on repeated occurrence of UTI are needed. Also, despite global increases in multidrug resistance (MDR), recent data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens are lacking, especially antibiotic resistance patterns for those patients experiencing UTI recurrences. Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) from a cohort of individuals with uUTI at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), we described the antibiotic resistance of subsequent uUTIs and cUTIs (from 2016–2021) following an initial uUTI (from 2016–2020).

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^113kk4VW]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Indications and techniques for imaging urinary tract infections

Uncomplicated UTIs, particularly those commonly occurring in otherwise healthy young women, generally do not require further investigation apart from laboratory and microbiological studies. Conversely, nowadays, imaging is generally warranted in patients with recurrent infections or C-UTI and in those who do not respond to antibiotic therapy. The key aims of imaging in urinary infections and urosepsis are a) confirmation of urological cause, b) detection of obstruction and abscesses requiring interventional or surgical treatment, and c) detection of urolithiasis and retained foreign bodies such as catheters.

Role of ultrasound

Non-invasive, inexpensive and repeatable, ultrasound is the mainstay first-line investigation, providing a rapid overview of the entire urinary tract, with successful detection of urinary obstruction and most abnormal collections. The initial diagnostic assessment of C-UTIs affecting the lower urinary and male genital tract should rely on transabdominal urinary tract sonography. Colour Doppler ultrasound (CD-US) with high-resolution linear probes is warranted when symptoms and physical signs suggest involvement of the scrotum and perineum. Furthermore, if allowed by local pain and tenderness, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) may offer rapid assessment for the presence of abnormal masses or collections in the prostate and seminal vesicles. Finally, sonography often allows for an easier, non-invasive post-treatment follow-up of abnormalities detected at cross-sectional imaging.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^111xbJLf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Urine Culture

There are differing definitions of positive urine culture. The American Academy of Pediatrics defines the quantity of bacteria for a UTI as > 50,000 colony-forming units/mL. In young infants (≤ 90 days) with frequent urination, 1000–10,000 CFU/mL in catheter specimens may indicate UTI. Clinically relevant uropathogens include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp. P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp. Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Streptococcus agalactiae. In general, growth of ≥ 2 different bacterial species suggests contamination. Lactobacillus spp. coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Corynebacterium spp. are generally not relevant, including in the context of indwelling catheters. However, CoNS may be relevant in immunocompromised children or preterm infants (see below).

Urine culture alone should not be used to diagnose UTI (bacterial presence may just reflect bacteriuria) but should always be considered in the context of the clinical situation.

To determine whether a UTI is complicated, which subgroup a child belongs to, and which investigations are needed, elements of the medical history and clinical review should include:

primary (first) or secondary (recurring) infection, including type (febrile or non-febrile UTIs)
abnormalities of the urinary tract [on pre- or postnatal ultrasound scan (USS)]
previous medical/surgical history
voiding habits
bowel habits, including history of constipation
family history or nephrological/urological problems
neonates and infants with urosepsis may present with nonspecific symptoms (fever without source, failure to thrive, jaundice, vomiting, hyperexcitability, lethargy, hypothermia and sometimes without fever)
in older children upper urinary tract symptoms include fever, flank pain and vomiting
in older children, lower urinary tract symptoms include dysuria, frequency, urgency, incontinence, hematuria and suprapubic pain
malodorous urine may be a symptom of UTI, but it is nonspecific as other factors such as diet, hydration and medication may also cause this.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^112pbeqA]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Renal and bladder ultrasonography after initial febrile UTI — Febrile infants with UTIs should undergo renal and bladder ultrasonography (RBUS) (evidence quality: C; recommendation). The purpose of RBUS is to detect anatomic abnormalities that require further evaluation, such as additional imaging or urologic consultation, and RBUS also provides an evaluation of the renal parenchyma and an assessment of renal size that can be used to monitor renal growth. The yield of actionable findings is relatively low, and widespread application of prenatal ultrasonography clearly has reduced the prevalence of previously unsuspected obstructive uropathy in infants, but the consequences of prenatal screening with respect to the risk of renal abnormalities in infants with UTIs have not yet been well defined.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11389yui]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

Methods

We assembled a database of published and unpublished literature from systematic searches of 16 electronic databases (inception to between October 2002 and February 2003), hand searching of 12 journals, consultation with experts in the field, and screening bibliographies of included studies. Update searches were conducted in May 2004. There were no language restrictions. Full details of the search strategy will be reported elsewhere.

We included controlled trials that compared different imaging strategies and reported patient based outcomes. We also included diagnostic cohort studies that included at least 20 children, some of whom were aged five years or under, and that reported sufficient information to construct 2 × 2 tables. Table 1 presents a summary of the tests evaluated in this review and details the potential advantages that these tests have over the current reference standards. Although other tests have been evaluated, this article will focus on those offering potential advantages over the current reference standard. Studies had to compare one of the index tests listed in this table to the listed reference standard, for each of the different aims.

### Resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections [^115U9xiE]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (UTI) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. Older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence of resistant bacteria isolated from UTI. Resistant isolates are more frequent in long-term care populations than the community. Resistant isolates include common uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Providencia stuartii. Isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. The increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. Therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. Antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. In particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. Where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. This permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. Where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. Where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

### Rapid implementation of evidence-based guidelines for imaging after first urinary tract infection [^115abcPL]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The American Academy of Pediatrics published a new guideline for management of first urinary tract infection (UTI) in children aged 2 to 24 months in September 2011. The imaging evaluation changed from the previous guideline to recommend voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) only for patients with an abnormal renal and bladder ultrasound (RBUS). The objective was to decrease the proportion of guideline-eligible children with a normal RBUS who underwent VCUG from median of 92% for patients treated as inpatients and 100% for patients treated in the emergency department to 5% in both settings.

Methods

This was a quality improvement implementation study in a large academic medical center. Key drivers included: appropriate guideline knowledge, timely identification of guideline eligible patients, and effective communication with the community-based primary care provider. A multidisciplinary team developed and tested interventions. Impact was assessed with annotated run charts. Statistical comparisons were made with χ² analysis and Fisher's exact test.

Results

The proportion of children with first UTI and normal RBUS who underwent VCUG decreased from a median of 92% to 0% within 1 month of initiating the project among those hospitalized and from 100% to 40% within 4 months among those diagnosed in the emergency department. Rates have been sustained for 12 months and 8 months, respectively. Interventions using the electronic medical record and ordering system were most impactful.

Conclusions

Rapid adoption of evidence-based UTI care across multiple settings is achievable. Practice change occurred faster and to a greater magnitude in the inpatient setting compared with the outpatient setting.

### Visualization of Proteus mirabilis morphotypes in the urinary tract: the elongated swarmer cell is rarely observed in ascending urinary tract infection [^1152dRe3]. Infection and Immunity (2003). Low credibility.

Proteus mirabilis, a common cause of nosocomial and catheter-associated urinary tract infection, colonizes the bladder and ascends the ureters to the proximal tubules of the kidneys, leading to the development of acute pyelonephritis. P. mirabilis is capable of swarming, a form of multicellular behavior in which bacteria differentiate from the short rod typical of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, termed the swimmer cell, into hyperflagellated elongated bacteria capable of rapid and coordinated population migration across surfaces, called the swarmer cell. There has been considerable debate as to which morphotype predominates during urinary tract infection. P. mirabilis(pBAC001), which expresses green fluorescent protein in both swimming and swarming morphotypes, was constructed to quantify the prevalence of each morphotype in ascending urinary tract infection. Transurethral inoculation of P. mirabilis(pBAC001) resulted in ascending urinary tract infection and kidney pathology in mice examined at both 2 and 4 days postinoculation. Using confocal microscopy, we were able to investigate the morphotypes of the bacteria in the urinary tract. Of 5,087 bacteria measured in bladders, ureters, and kidneys, only 7 (0.14%) were identified as swarmers. MR/P fimbria expression, which correlates with the swimmer phenotype, is prevalent on bacteria in the ureters and bladder. We conclude that, by far, the predominant morphotype present in the urinary tract during ascending infection is the short rod-the swimmer cell.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaUrinary tract Infection-child [^116UVaz1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in young children and may cause pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Long-term complications from renal scarring are low. The role of imaging is to evaluate for underlying urologic abnormalities and guide treatment. In neonates there is increased risk for underlying urologic abnormalities. Evaluation for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) may be appropriate especially in boys because of higher prevalence of VUR and to exclude posterior urethral valve. In children older than 2 months with first episode of uncomplicated UTI, there is no clear benefit of prophylactic antibiotic. Ultrasound is the only study that is usually appropriate. After the age of 6 years, UTIs are infrequent. There is no need for routine imaging as VUR is less common. In children with recurrent or complicated UTI, in addition to ultrasound, imaging of VUR is usually appropriate. Renal cortical scintigraphy may be appropriate in children with VUR, as renal scarring may support surgical intervention. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — prior urine culture results: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding antibiotics to which the patient has had a resistant pathogen isolated from the urine previously (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks indicate that more recent urine cultures may be a better guide than more distant cultures and that the time frame for paired cultures varied, but the median was 3–6 months.

### Prostatic abscess: a rare complication of staghorn calculi [^117BVCL8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A staghorn calculus is a calculus accommodating the majority of a renal calyx extending into the renal pelvis. A conservative approach to its treatment may lead to high morbidity and mortality rates. Such morbidity usually manifests with renal failure, obstructed upper urinary tractand/or life-threatening sepsis. Prostatic abscesses have never been associated with staghorn calculi in the literature. We report a case of a 70-year-old man who presented with sepsis, which was found to originate from a complex prostatic abscess. The patient had no history of urinary tract infections or risk factors. The authors believe that the incidentally identified staghorn calculi promoted the growth of Proteus mirabilis which led to the development of the prostatic abscess. The patient underwent a transurethral resection and drainage of the abscess following a failed course of antibiotic therapy. This case also highlights the paucity of guidelines available in treating prostatic abscesses.

Diagnosis — women with frequent UTI may experience diagnostic delay if clinicians do not review the UTI history; clinicians should order pretreatment urine cultures to document rUTI (culture-proven UTI ≥ 2 in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months), and although infrequent UTI can be assessed with less rigor and treated empirically, women with frequent UTI who are being formally assessed for rUTI should have detailed symptom assessment and pretreatment urine culture and sensitivity.

### Host-pathogen interactions in urinary tract infection [^117UgbHH]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

The urinary tract is a common site of bacterial infections; nearly half of all women experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) during their lifetime. These infections are classified based on the condition of the host. Uncomplicated infections affect otherwise healthy individuals and are most commonly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, whereas complicated infections affect patients with underlying difficulties, such as a urinary tract abnormality or catheterization, and are commonly caused by species such as Proteus mirabilis. Virulence and fitness factors produced by both pathogens include fimbriae, toxins, flagella, iron acquisition systems, and proteins that function in immune evasion. Additional factors that contribute to infection include the formation of intracellular bacterial communities by E. coli and the production of urease by P. mirabilis, which can result in urinary stone formation. Innate immune responses are induced or mediated by pattern recognition receptors, antimicrobial peptides, and neutrophils. The adaptive immune response to UTI is less well understood. Host factors TLR4 and CXCR1 are implicated in disease outcome and susceptibility, respectively. Low levels of TLR4 are associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria while low levels of CXCR1 are associated with increased incidence of acute pyelonephritis. Current research is focused on the identification of additional virulence factors and therapeutic or prophylactic targets that might be used in the generation of vaccines against both uropathogens.

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^116PeRgo]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Role of CT

Multidetector CT reliably provides a panoramic visualisation of the entire abdomen and pelvis, and represents the mainstay modality for the detection of intra-abdominal and urological infections in the majority of patients and situations. CT is superior to ultrasound in its ability to consistently identify calcific stones along the entire urinary system and to identify gaseous collections, and may detect inflammatory changes in the perivisceral fat and abnormal contrast enhancement in inflamed tissues, urothelium and abscess walls.

The main indications for obtaining CT scans are suspected or confirmed urosepsis and sepsis from an unknown source: in this setting, CT offers a proven benefit in detecting the infectious focus and the possible underlying structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. In our experience, CT is generally useful, and may thus be recommended in patients with high or persistent suspicion of lower urogenital tract infection despite inconclusive ultrasound findings, and in those patients with suspected or culture-proven C-UTI with ENUC risk factors such as diabetes, immunosuppression, nephropathy, obstructive uropathy, urologic instrumentation and surgery.

Furthermore, in our experience, CT signs of clinically unsuspected C-UTIs are often detected incidentally on studies performed to investigate other conditions such as urolithiasis, renal colic, gynaecologic complaints or unspecific abdominal pain. When these abnormalities affect the scrotum, additional CD-US is indicated for diagnostic confirmation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of infected fluid collections [^116bm7mh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infected fluid collections are common and occur in a variety of clinical scenarios throughout the body. Minimally invasive image-guided management strategies for infected fluid collections are often preferred over more invasive options, given their low rate of complications and high rates of success. However, specific clinical scenarios, anatomic considerations, and prior or ongoing treatments must be considered when determining the optimal management strategy. As such, several common scenarios relating to infected fluid collections were developed using evidence-based guidelines for management. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^112Zcfp8]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Background

Worldwide, urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for hundreds of thousands of outpatient visits and emergency and hospital admissions each year. The vast majority of UTIs result from ascending infection from the urethra; alternatively, micro-organisms sometimes reach the urinary tract through haematogenous or lymphatic spread. UTIs represent the commonest (almost 40%) type of hospital-acquired infections, with bladder catheterisation and urologic instrumentation as crucial risk factors.

According to the guidelines issued by the European Association of Urology (EAU), complicated UTIs (C-UTIs) are those associated with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, or with the presence of an underlying disease that interferes with host defence mechanisms, resulting in increased risk of acquiring infection or failing therapy. Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli are the predominant causative organisms (approximately 65–70% of infections), but the spectrum of pathogens is much wider than that in uncomplicated UTI, and bacteria are more likely to be resistant to antibiotics.

Purpose

Over the last decade, technical advances in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have increasingly allowed comprehensive high-resolution assessment of genitourinary structures and disorders. As a result, cross-sectional imaging is increasingly used to investigate C-UTIs and systemic infection from an unknown cause. However, the radiological literature describing the CT and MRI features of C-UTIs affecting the lower urogenital structures is limited.

Based upon our personal experience at a tertiary care hospital focused on treatment of infectious illnesses, this pictorial essay reviews with examples the imaging findings of C-UTIs involving the lower urinary and male genital tract, aiming to provide radiologists greater familiarity with these disorders and with their differential diagnoses.

### Elucidating the genetic basis of crystalline biofilm formation in Proteus mirabilis [^116bNJ7c]. Infection and Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Proteus mirabilis forms extensive crystalline biofilms on urethral catheters that occlude urine flow and frequently complicate the management of long-term-catheterized patients. Here, using random transposon mutagenesis in conjunction with in vitro models of the catheterized urinary tract, we elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the formation of crystalline biofilms by P. mirabilis. Mutants identified as defective in blockage of urethral catheters had disruptions in genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and efflux systems but were unaffected in general growth, survival in bladder model systems, or the ability to elevate urinary pH. Imaging of biofilms directly on catheter surfaces, along with quantification of levels of encrustation and biomass, confirmed that the mutants were attenuated specifically in the ability to form crystalline biofilms compared with that of the wild type. However, the biofilm-deficient phenotype of these mutants was not due to deficiencies in attachment to catheter biomaterials, and defects in later stages of biofilm development were indicated. For one blocking-deficient mutant, the disrupted gene (encoding a putative multidrug efflux pump) was also found to be associated with susceptibility to fosfomycin, and loss of this system or general inhibition of efflux pumps increased sensitivity to this antibiotic. Furthermore, homologues of this system were found to be widely distributed among other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. Overall, our findings provide fundamental new insight into crystalline biofilm formation by P. mirabilis, including the link between biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance in this organism, and indicate a potential role for efflux pump inhibitors in the treatment or prevention of P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms.

To the Editor:… — The Proteus mirabilis has been recognized generally as a harmless strain. Some time ago, however, we performed a search for all the aerobic enteric bacteria strains found in the stools of sick infants under one year of age, who had diarrhea. In over 40 patients, each examined several times during the illness, the strain found was Proteus mirabilis. Recently, we suspected subacute bacterial endocarditis in a 70-year-old woman. Cultures from her blood, urine, and feces showed that P. mirabilis was present. No other strains were found. We believe, that this strain was the cause of the death of the woman. Weiser J.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis… [^1121DM8k]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The history is the most important tool for diagnosing acute uncomplicated cystitis, and it should be supported by a focused physical examination and urinalysis. It also is important to rule out a more serious complicated UTI. By definition, the diagnosis of acute uncomplicated cystitis implies an uncomplicated UTI in a premenopausal, nonpregnant woman with no known urologic abnormalities or comorbidities. 8 Laboratory evaluation showed that 84 percent of the urine samples showed a uropathogen, 11 percent showed sterile pyuria, and only 5 percent were negative for pyuria and bacteriuria. Another small, randomized controlled trial compared outcomes of acute uncomplicated cystitis in healthy women managed by telephone versus in the office. 9 There were no differences in symptom score or satisfaction. The authors concluded that the short-term outcomes of managing suspected UTIs by telephone were comparable with those managed by usual office care.

The convenience and cost-effectiveness of urine dipstick testing makes it a common diagnostic tool, and it is an appropriate alternative to urinalysis and urine microscopy to diagnose acute uncomplicated cystitis. 11 Nitrites and leukocyte esterase are the most accurate indicators of acute uncomplicated cystitis in symptomatic women. 11 To avoid contamination, the convention is to use a midstream, clean-catch urine specimen to diagnose UTI; however, at least two studies have shown no significant difference in number of contaminated or unreliable results between specimens collected with and without preparatory cleansing. 12, 13 Urine cultures are recommended only for patients with suspected acute pyelonephritis; patients with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after the completion of treatment; and patients who present with atypical symptoms.

11 A colony count greater than or equal to 10³ colony-forming units per mL of a uropathogen is diagnostic of acute uncomplicated cystitis. 14 However, studies have shown that more than 10² colony-forming units per mL in women with typical symptoms of a UTI represent a positive culture. 15 Routine posttreatment urinalysis or urine cultures in asymptomatic patients are not necessary. Further studies beyond urinalysis and urine cultures are rarely needed to diagnose acute uncomplicated cystitis. Patients who present with atypical symptoms of acute uncomplicated cystitis and those who do not respond to appropriate antimicrobial therapy may need imaging studies, such as computed tomography or ultrasonography, to rule out complications and other disorders.

### Urinary tract infections… [^113PFUAD]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points Pediatric urinary tract infections are associated with high morbidity and long-term complications such as renal scarring, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. Escherichia coliis the most common bacterial cause of UTIs in all pediatric age-groups, followed by gram-negative enterobacteria. Diagnosis of UTI in children can be challenging because symptoms can be vague and nonspecific in young children. An important and often overlooked factor in the pathophysiology of UTI is bladder and bowel dysfunction. A thorough clinical assessment supplemented by appropriate laboratory tests on an uncontaminated urine specimen is essential for the accurate diagnosis of UTI in children. Referral to a pediatric urologist for atypical imaging results or a pediatric nephrologist for atypical renal function results, hypertension, or proteinuria is recommended.
