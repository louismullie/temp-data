## Question

What is the treatment for COPD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for COPD, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment goals and how they guide therapy. Then, I should verify the patient assessment framework that drives pharmacologic choices. Next, I will examine pharmacologic strategies for stable disease, including escalation and de-escalation principles. After that, I need to review non-pharmacologic foundations. Then, I should confirm the approach to acute exacerbations. Finally, I will consider special populations, comorbidities, and a practical follow-up algorithm, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core treatment goals, because everything else flows from them. The aim is twofold: reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, and reduce future risk, particularly exacerbations and their consequences; critically, only smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy have consistently demonstrated survival benefit, so I need to keep those front and center while recognizing that most pharmacotherapies primarily modify symptoms and exacerbation risk rather than mortality per se [^115bpatp] [^111gcyKU].

> Wait, let me verify the assessment framework that drives therapy selection. I should not rely on FEV1 alone to choose treatment; instead, I need to integrate symptom burden using CAT or mMRC and quantify exacerbation history, including frequency and severity, while also documenting comorbidities and inhaler technique, because these factors better predict outcomes and guide escalation or de-escalation decisions [^116aRVSb] [^113pXAJB] [^1115tFXv].

> I will now examine pharmacologic therapy for stable COPD, starting with bronchodilators as the foundation. Long-acting bronchodilators improve lung function, dyspnea, and health status and reduce exacerbations; LAMAs may have a greater effect on exacerbation reduction than LABAs, and dual LABA/LAMA therapy is generally superior to monotherapy for symptomatic patients, so I should favor dual bronchodilation when symptoms persist beyond mild levels or when exacerbation risk is elevated [^113eRjda] [^1137qfa3] [^111ZMHsZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of inhaled corticosteroids and avoid overgeneralization. ICS are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD; they are most appropriate when added to LABA/LAMA in patients with a history of frequent or severe exacerbations, and blood eosinophils can help identify those more likely to benefit, though ICS increase pneumonia risk, so I need to balance benefit and harm and consider withdrawal if the patient is stable without recent exacerbations and eosinophils are low [^114v5ExK] [^111ZMHsZ] [^111hYXCp].

> Let me think about triple therapy and the mortality signal, because I should not jump to conclusions. Recent data suggest that LABA/LAMA/ICS triple therapy may reduce mortality in symptomatic patients with a history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations, which strengthens the case for escalation in high-risk phenotypes; however, I should confirm exacerbation phenotype and symptom burden before committing to triple therapy and remain vigilant for pneumonia risk [^117QicWp] [^114aHCQs].

> Next, I should review escalation and de-escalation principles to ensure I am applying a dynamic, response-guided approach. After initiating therapy, I need to reassess symptoms and exacerbation control, correct inhaler technique and adherence, and then escalate if dyspnea or exacerbations persist; conversely, if a patient on triple therapy has been stable without exacerbations for 12 months, I should consider ICS withdrawal under close supervision, especially with low eosinophil counts, and always re-review response after any change [^116wxaTc] [^1128NkZi] [^111ZMHsZ].

> I need to ensure non-pharmacologic care is integrated from the outset, because it meaningfully alters outcomes. Smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention to slow progression and improve survival; pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life across severities; vaccinations reduce respiratory infections; structured self-management and regular inhaler technique training improve adherence and outcomes, so I should embed these elements into routine care [^116UpyQX] [^115kZ16X] [^115pASXk].

> Now, I will examine acute exacerbation management, and I should double-check durations and indications. Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are first-line; systemic corticosteroids for about 5 days improve FEV1, oxygenation, and shorten recovery; antibiotics are indicated for increased dyspnea with sputum purulence or other signs of bacterial infection and should generally be given for 5 days; noninvasive ventilation reduces intubation and improves survival in acute respiratory failure; methylxanthines are not recommended due to toxicity; and early post-discharge pulmonary rehabilitation should be arranged when feasible [^1139DjP8] [^111aEzqt].

> But wait, what about special populations and comorbidities that can derail standard algorithms. In patients with overlapping asthma features or higher eosinophils, ICS therapy is more clearly indicated; in those with cardiovascular comorbidity, I should not withhold indicated beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors; in advanced disease with refractory dyspnea despite optimal inhaled therapy, carefully selected opioid therapy can be considered within shared decision-making; and in perioperative patients, optimizing the five fundamentals — smoking cessation, rehabilitation, vaccination, self-management, and comorbidity control — reduces risk [^1121BNYP] [^114uiLn6] [^113A3ncz] [^116vqVNm].

> Let me reconsider the practical follow-up cadence to ensure I am not missing opportunities to de-escalate or correct course. At each visit, I should review symptoms, exacerbation history, and blood eosinophils when relevant; assess inhaler technique and adherence; reinforce non-pharmacologic measures; and then adjust therapy accordingly, recognizing that treatment decisions are individualized by availability, cost, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and that any change warrants a subsequent review of response and side effects [^111M1CDJ] [^1115tFXv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that most pharmacotherapies improve mortality — let me verify and correct that. The consistent mortality signals in COPD are with smoking cessation and long-term oxygen for severe chronic hypoxemia; while triple therapy shows a promising mortality reduction in high-risk exacerbators, most inhaled regimens primarily improve symptoms and reduce exacerbations, so I should set expectations accordingly and prioritize risk-factor modification and oxygen eligibility screening in appropriate patients [^111gcyKU] [^117QicWp].

> Finally, I should confirm that my approach aligns with contemporary guidance emphasizing treatable traits and dynamic reassessment. GOLD's shift away from FEV1-driven treatment to symptom and exacerbation risk, coupled with the ATS emphasis on LABA/LAMA as preferred initial combination for symptomatic patients and the CTS endorsement of triple therapy in high-risk exacerbators, supports a personalized, phenotype-informed plan that evolves with the patient's course over time [^113pXAJB] [^111ZMHsZ] [^114aHCQs].

COPD management centers on **smoking cessation** [^116hLaz9] and **long-acting bronchodilators** (LABA/LAMA) [^1137qfa3] to reduce symptoms and exacerbations, with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) added for frequent exacerbations or high eosinophils [^111ZMHsZ] [^1128NkZi]. Pulmonary rehabilitation [^115pASXk], vaccinations, and oxygen for severe hypoxemia are essential; **triple therapy (LABA/LAMA/ICS)** is preferred for high-risk patients with frequent exacerbations [^117QicWp] [^114aHCQs]. Acute exacerbations require short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics when indicated [^1139DjP8]; noninvasive ventilation is used for acute respiratory failure [^1139DjP8]. Therapy is individualized by symptoms, exacerbation risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with regular follow-up to adjust treatment and optimize inhaler technique [^1115tFXv] [^111M1CDJ].

## Pharmacological management

### Bronchodilators

Bronchodilators are the cornerstone of COPD management, providing symptom relief and reducing exacerbations [^115hVTyh] [^113eRjda].

- **Short-acting bronchodilators (SABA/SAMA)**: Used as rescue therapy for acute symptom relief [^115PtjzU].

- **Long-acting bronchodilators (LABA/LAMA)**: Recommended as initial maintenance therapy for stable COPD, improving lung function, dyspnea, and quality of life, and reducing exacerbations [^113eRjda] [^1114HLTT].

- **Combination LABA/LAMA therapy**: Superior to monotherapy in reducing exacerbations and improving symptoms [^111ZMHsZ] [^1139uSTo].

---

### Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)

ICS are recommended for patients with frequent exacerbations (≥ 2/year) or high blood eosinophil counts (≥ 300 cells/μL) [^111ZMHsZ] [^113pXAJB] [^1119hVwa]. Triple therapy (**LABA/LAMA/ICS**) further reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared to dual therapy, but increases pneumonia risk [^117QicWp] [^1139uSTo].

---

### Other pharmacological agents

- **Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (e.g. roflumilast)**: Reduce exacerbations in severe COPD with chronic bronchitis [^114v5ExK].

- **Mucolytics (e.g. erdosteine, carbocysteine)**: Reduce exacerbations, particularly in frequent exacerbators [^notfound].

- **Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)**: Improves survival in patients with severe chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SpO2 ≤ 88%) [^1139uSTo].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological interventions are essential to **optimize outcomes and quality of life** [^116UpyQX].

- **Smoking cessation**: The most effective intervention to slow disease progression and improve survival [^116UpyQX].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life [^notfound].

- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines reduce respiratory infections and exacerbations [^notfound].

- **Physical activity**: Regular exercise improves lung function and overall health [^notfound].

---

## Management of acute exacerbations

Acute exacerbations require prompt management to prevent complications and recurrence [^1121mfMb].

- **Short-acting bronchodilators**: First-line therapy for acute symptom relief [^1139DjP8].

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Improve lung function, oxygenation, and shorten recovery time; duration ≤ 5 days [^1139DjP8].

- **Antibiotics**: Indicated for exacerbations with increased sputum purulence or bacterial infection suspicion; duration ≤ 5 days [^1139DjP8].

- **Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)**: Reduces intubation rates and improves survival in acute respiratory failure [^1139DjP8].

---

## Individualized treatment approach

Treatment should be tailored based on **symptom severity, exacerbation risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences** [^1115tFXv]. Regular follow-up is essential to assess control, adherence, and inhaler technique, with therapy adjusted accordingly [^111M1CDJ].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Recent advances include **biologics targeting specific inflammatory pathways**, novel bronchodilators, and digital health tools for remote monitoring and self-management. Personalized medicine approaches using biomarkers and phenotyping are being explored to optimize therapy [^1177njLN] [^112jPkaV].

---

COPD management is multifaceted, combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. The primary goals are to **reduce symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and improve quality of life**, with treatment individualized to patient needs and regularly adjusted through follow-up care.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: getting it right. does optimal management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alter disease progression and improve survival? [^111gcyKU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We live in a world where people live longer lives. The standardized mortality rate for many diseases is decreasing. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not following this trend. Over the last 10 years, interventions for COPD have been developed, but have any changed the prognosis or trajectory of this modern epidemic? We review the most recent and classical literature in order to answer this question.

Recent Findings

Recent analyses of data have clarified which interventions are effective in COPD and which are not. New studies have defined what is achievable with the current therapies. Only two interventions have been demonstrated to improve survival: smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy. Other treatments do reduce exacerbations, improve lung function and improve the patient's quality of life, but do not affect physiological disease progression or mortality.

Summary

There is much work to do, not only to improve the treatments we have for this disease, but also to diagnose it early, intervene at the right time, reduce the treatment side-effects and most importantly understand the pathophysiology better. Moreover, we are duty bound to look at each patient and review what we are trying to achieve for each one through appropriate phenotyping as well as sometimes taking a more palliative approach.

### Current concepts in targeting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pharmacotherapy: making progress towards personalised management [^1177njLN]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, complex, and heterogeneous disorder that is responsible for substantial and growing morbidity, mortality, and health-care expense worldwide. Of imperative importance to decipher the complexity of COPD is to identify groups of patients with similar clinical characteristics, prognosis, or therapeutic needs, the so-called clinical phenotypes. This strategy is logical for research but might be of little clinical value because clinical phenotypes can overlap in the same patient and the same clinical phenotype could result from different biological mechanisms. With the goal to match assessment with treatment choices, the latest iteration of guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease reorganised treatment objectives into two categories: to improve symptoms (ie, dyspnoea and health status) and to decrease future risk (as predicted by forced expiratory volume in 1 s level and exacerbations history). This change thus moves treatment closer to individualised medicine with available bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs. Yet, future treatment options are likely to include targeting endotypes that represent subtypes of patients defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Specific biomarkers of these endotypes would be particularly useful in clinical practice, especially in patients in which clinical phenotype alone is insufficient to identify the underlying endotype. A few series of potential COPD endotypes and biomarkers have been suggested. Empirical knowledge will be gained from proof-of-concept trials in COPD with emerging drugs that target specific inflammatory pathways. In every instance, specific endotype and biomarker efforts will probably be needed for the success of these trials, because the pathways are likely to be operative in only a subset of patients. Network analysis of human diseases offers the possibility to improve understanding of disease pathobiological complexity and to help with the development of new treatment alternatives and, importantly, a reclassification of complex diseases. All these developments should pave the way towards personalised treatment of patients with COPD in the clinic.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^115cUyw5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice. Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those developed through the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, with the aim of providing the basis for local care pathways. The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care. A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function, the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD and that could possibly better categorize and predict outcome in these patients, and the impact of new clinical trial findings. Large ongoing outcome studies may also have an effect on defining best practice within future guideline recommendations.

### Review of drug development guidance to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US and EU perspectives [^112jPkaV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, yet only one new drug class has been approved in the last decade. However, resurgence in COPD treatment has been recently fueled by a greater understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease, as well as a growing prevalence and an aging population. Currently, there are nearly 25 novel drug targets in development. Furthermore, the indication has undergone some fundamental changes over the last couple of years, including an updated diagnosis paradigm, validation, and approval of patient-reported outcome questionnaires for clinical trials, and drug development tools, such as a prognostic biomarker for patient selection. In the context of clinical trials, this review aims to summarize recent changes to the diagnosis and evaluation of COPD and to provide an overview of US and European regulatory guidance.

Background

The ultimate treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remain uniform across the majority of national and international COPD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and include reduced symptoms, reduced exacerbation risk and improved quality of life. To achieve these goals, CPGs require regular updates with recent and relevant state-of-the-art medical and scientific developments. Guidelines strive to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce variations in the treatment and management of COPD.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patient management based on available evidence and, in certain cases, educated opinion where there is no direct evidence available. The quality of the available evidence and the intended audience of CPGs remain core considerations for their development. In recent years, CPGs have further evolved in response to an increasing recognition of the need for more stringent, systematic approaches when recommending specific therapeutic interventions or strategies. The importance of rigorous processes to ensure that only accurate and appropriate treatment recommendations are made is now well-accepted among professional scientific societies. In fact, standards to guide the preparation of CPGs are now available. However, little attention is afforded to the challenges and pitfalls associated with the development of such documents.

A concerted effort between multiple stakeholders is needed to ensure precise, practical and up-to-date clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal management of COPD. Guidelines must be locally relevant; therefore local expert stakeholders should offer local proposals, while referring to global evidence-based documents.

This review article highlights the challenges associated with the development and implementation of national CPGs for COPD in Europe and Russia.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1126wEPi]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Progress in management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by declining prevalence and expanding therapeutic options: The age-adjusted prevalence has declined since 1999, possibly due to overall population decrease in smoking rates, and COPD is now recognized as a significant public health problem with a greater amount of research being conducted on mechanisms and treatment effectiveness. Pharmacologic therapy is improving with better understanding of the disease process and novel drugs, and non-pharmacologic therapy, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, is becoming increasingly recognized as an effective option; while these treatment methods may not be appropriate for all patients, they allow providers to intervene early with numerous effective treatment options and increasing research and effective management strategies allow optimism that COPD can be managed effectively to provide patients with an improved QoL.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1112fPxo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zy4JZ]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is there a case for early intervention? [^116tMebA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent condition that represents a significant economic burden to society. Early diagnosis of COPD offers the best opportunity to slow the progression of the disease through smoking cessation. Aggressive medical management of COPD for patients diagnosed at a moderate or severe stage is likely to be attractive from an economic standpoint, although prospective studies are needed to validate current evidence. Poor adherence to smoking cessation and pharmacologic therapy suggests that patient education is critical to successful intervention at all stages of illness. The economic value of aggressive pharmacotherapy for early-stage COPD is less certain, but the burden of illness and potential pharmacoeconomic benefits in such patients is a strong rationale for combined clinical and economic trials.

### New therapeutic drugs in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113Rgquw]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains a major health problem for which new and improved treatments are desperately needed. Recent trials strongly suggest that treatments are improving. Longer-acting bronchodilators will be more convenient and may have additional advantages. Combinations of bronchodilators may offer additive effects and, possibly, synergies. Inhaled glucocorticoids, although unable to alter the loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second when used alone, may reduce exacerbation frequency and health status deterioration and improve mortality. These clinically meaningful goals represent end points not previously targeted in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease drug development. Moreover, inhaled glucocorticoids may offer benefits in combination with long-acting beta-agonists. Finally, new classes of agents such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors are on the horizon. The prospect for better treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease looks brighter than ever. Caution is required, however. Much of the excitement has been generated by small studies, presented only in abstract form, and as yet unpublished work. Therapeutic recommendations will require publication of appropriately designed and adequately powered clinical trials.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115bpatp]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management — aims, assessment, and therapy review: The aim of COPD management is to reduce symptoms and future risk, COPD patients should have an assessment of the severity of their airflow obstruction, symptoms, history of exacerbations, exposure to risk factors and comorbidities to guide management, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy should be adjusted as necessary with further reviews undertaken.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111GpoC4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient? [^1122Przq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1137qfa3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2019 report defines COPD as a "common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway or alveolar abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases". Pharmacologic treatment for COPD aims to improve quality of life (QOL) and control symptoms while reducing the frequency of exacerbations.

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to address specific clinically important questions regarding the pharmacologic management of COPD. The expert panel, in collaboration with a team of methodologists, prioritized and developed six questions that addressed significant COPD management issues. These questions were rephrased by the methods team using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes (PICO) format, and panel members then compiled and prioritized a list of outcomes that were important for clinical decision-making and particularly important to patients. Evidence syntheses for each PICO question were focused on clinical outcomes deemed "critical" for clinical decision-making. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (see Table 1) for the following clinical questions:
1 In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, is LABA/LAMA combination therapy more effective than and as safe as LABA or LAMA monotherapy?
2 In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite use of dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, is triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA more effective than and as safe as dual therapy with LABA/LAMA?
3 In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) should the ICS be withdrawn?
4 In patients with COPD with blood eosinophilia, should treatment include an ICS in addition to a long-acting bronchodilator?
5 In patients with COPD who have a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, is maintenance oral steroid therapy more effective than and as safe as no maintenance oral steroid therapy?
6 In patients with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy, is opioid-based therapy more effective than and as safe as no additional therapy?

### Maintenance pharmacotherapy of mild and moderate COPD: what is the evidence? [^117F9DcQ]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects more than 24 million individuals in the United States, although at least half of the cases are not diagnosed. Proactive diagnosis and limitation of risk exposure from smoking or pollutants are important to improve prognosis. Pharmacologic treatments are prescribed according to COPD stage and symptoms. Mild COPD is symptomatically treated 'as needed' with short-acting bronchodilators; major guidelines recommend starting maintenance treatment at the moderate COPD stage with long-acting bronchodilators; inhaled corticosteroids may be added for patients with more severe disease and frequent exacerbations. Maintenance therapy preserves 24-h airway patency, reduces exacerbations, and improves activity tolerance and health-related quality of life. Recent post-hoc analyses of large clinical trials that contain subgroups of patients with less severe COPD suggest that, similar to those with advanced disease, patients with moderate disease benefit from long-term maintenance therapies. Studies suggest symptomatic mild patients may also benefit. This concept needs to be prospectively tested in studies specific to these COPD disease stages. Proactive identification and pharmacologic intervention in early COPD has the potential to alter clinical outcomes throughout the disease course.

### Systemic effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what we know and what we don't know (but should) [^111d6xK4]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with pulmonary and systemic inflammation. The latter is likely to contribute significantly to the pathobiology of numerous extrapulmonary effects of the disease — the so-called systemic effects of COPD. The clinical relevance of these systemic effects has been recently recognized; however, many important questions about its pathophysiology remain unanswered. This article reviews what is known about it and, more importantly, highlights what is not (but should be) known in order to stimulate research in this area, in the hope that a better understanding of this field may lead to better treatment options for patients with COPD.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Landscape

Despite being a preventable and treatable disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. 1 COPD is characterized by limited airflow due to pulmonary and alveolar abnormalities from significant exposure to noxious particles and gases resulting in chronic respiratory symptoms. 2 The majority of COPD cases are associated with cigarette smoking. However, exposure to biomass fuels or environmental pollutants can also cause COPD. There are nine approved drug categories for COPD maintenance medication. Yet, even with the plethora of treatment options for COPD, these therapies are largely iterations of bronchodilators, which open airways, with only one novel drug class having been approved in the last 25 years (Figure 1). A main barrier facing this indication is that the majority of these medications treat the symptoms of the disease and not the underlying inflammation nor disease progression. Novel investigational products in development targeting immune mediators may show promising results on this front.

### Pharmacologic therapy: novel approaches for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111AbF6t]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in the United States and throughout the world. There have been a number of advances in the treatment of this disease within the last several decades, and these improved therapies continue to become available, making the prospects for the future encouraging. Bronchodilation is the treatment of choice, and we point out in this article the potential availability of many new bronchodilators. There will be several options in the beta(2)-agonist and the anticholinergic categories for once-a-day preparations. There will also be a number of products combining these categories of bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, and the combination products will be available in once-a-day preparations. Also under development are several candidates for specific and effective antiinflammatory agents in COPD. It is likely that our ability to control the inflammation underlying COPD will be a reality in the future. Although many new cases of COPD are being diagnosed in former smokers, for patients who smoke, the most important treatment is smoking cessation. A number of new drugs are available, and more will be brought to market in the future. We have highlighted the details of this important area.

### Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the primary care setting: how can we achieve more for our patients? [^116i7scy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a debilitating and progressive disease that is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, affecting up to 1 in 10 older adults. Common symptoms, including dyspnea, productive cough, chest tightness, and fatigue, can reduce quality of life, the ability to participate in all types of activities, and overall health status in patients. Minimizing the impact of symptoms on patients' quality of life should be a key goal for physicians, and modest changes in current practice could make improvements in patients' lives. Here we review chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, its impact on patients, and how to improve symptom management.

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

Treatment or interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are summarized as follows: currently, there is no cure for COPD, and prevention of exposure to cigarette smoke and other toxic fumes is the best way to prevent COPD; interventions to prevent the initiation of tobacco use are an effective way to prevent exposure to cigarette smoke; current smokers (regardless of whether COPD is diagnosed) should receive smoking cessation counseling and be offered behavioral and pharmacologic therapies to stop smoking; pharmacologic therapies (eg, bronchodilators and antiinflammatory therapies) and nonpharmacologic therapies (eg, interventions addressing self-management of disease, diet, exercise, and immunizations) are available for disease management in persons with mild to moderate or minimally symptomatic COPD, and decisions to start or advance treatment are primarily based on symptoms and exacerbations, rather than measured obstruction.

### Clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: review of therapeutic interventions [^116UpyQX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease in which patients experience a progressive decline in lung function. Based on clinical evidence, the management of COPD should focus on (1) earlier diagnosis; (2) risk reduction through smoking cessation, decreased exposure to inhaled irritants, and immunization against respiratory pathogens; (3) symptom reduction with pharmacotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation; (4) decreasing complications by reducing exacerbations and improving pulmonary function; and (5) improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Smoking cessation has been shown to slow lung function decline and to reduce mortality — including deaths due to lung cancer, other respiratory disease (including COPD), and cardiovascular disease. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines advocate interventions according to the severity of COPD and recommend initiation of maintenance long-acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with moderate disease. However, recent evidence from a post hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials of tiotropium suggests that initiation of long-acting bronchodilator therapy at earlier stages of disease may also provide improvements in lung function and HRQOL. The results of ongoing long-term studies may soon provide evidence that in addition to relieving symptoms and improving patient HRQOL, specific pharmacologic therapies may also alter the clinical course of COPD.

Expert Opinion

From the perspective of the clinician, COPD seems to have become more challenging to manage in recent years. The increasing prevalence of the disease in an aging population with multiple comorbidities together and the reality that mortality rates are increasing at a time when death rates in other chronic diseases have stabilized or even declined are contributing factors. However, from the earliest use of the term COPD in the late 1960s, this disease was considered as one confined to the lungs, characterized by fixed or partially reversible airflow limitation, and almost exclusively found in smokers. 100 Thankfully, there is now recognition that COPD is more complicated and the oversimplified understanding of the condition is outdated. The rejection of a "one‐size‐fits‐all" approach to therapy and the move toward targeting those at risk of disease exacerbations, considering systemic manifestations of the condition and identifying specific treatable traits are welcome developments. That is not to say that the medicines prescribed for years have not been helpful. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids remain a mainstay of treatment for many patients and do control symptoms and reduce exacerbation risk. However, the degree of efficacy is variable and because current medicines do not reduce mortality or alter the rate of lung function decline there is a clear need for new and more effective pharmacological treatments.

An improved understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for COPD will help move the management of COPD to a more precision‐based approach enjoyed by other specialties. A promising pipeline of novel drug entities is encouraging, but clinicians now need to consider, as experts in treating patients with COPD, how they can become active participants with academia, industry, patient advocacies, and public bodies in realizing the goal of improved pharmacotherapy for patients with COPD.

Exacerbation prevention

In contrast to treatment of acute events, recent years have seen publication of landmark trials in COPD which inform on exacerbation prevention and we now have a wide range of options available, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce exacerbation frequency. These are listed in Table 1, which also includes interventions known to reduce COPD hospitalisation (a closely related concept). Perhaps the greatest remaining challenge is to establish which patient will benefit from which combination of approaches, though there is still the need for novel interventions as current approaches are incompletely effective.

### Pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with chronic respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115kZ16X]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Question 1) background — burden, symptoms, and unmet need: Approximately 11.7% of people worldwide have COPD, and in the United States approximately 16 million have diagnosed COPD with likely millions more undiagnosed. Dyspnea and reduced exercise capacity are cardinal features and relate to respiratory structural and functional changes, skeletal muscle dysfunction, deconditioning, cardiocirculatory limitations, and other comorbid conditions. Acute exacerbations further worsen lung function, symptoms, and disability and increase patients' mortality risk, collectively impairing HRQoL. People with COPD typically remain symptomatic despite existing pharmacotherapies; additional treatments are therefore needed to improve patients' outcomes.

### Incidence, treatment options, and outcomes of lung cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1151wDny]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An associative and mechanistic link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer has long been suspected. This review describes the current understanding of the incidence, mechanism of association, treatment options, and outcome for lung cancer with COPD.

Recent Findings

COPD patients have an increased risk of lung cancer that is independent of smoking. New evidence suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the severity of airflow obstruction and the risk of lung cancer. Chronic inflammation associated with COPD may play a role in the development of lung cancer, and targeting airway inflammation with inhaled corticosteroids has been suggested as a possible preventive strategy. Although surgical lobectomy remains the standard of care for early stage lung cancer, less invasive approaches such as sublobar resection, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation are promising techniques for patients with limited pulmonary reserve.

Summary

Progress is being made in identifying mechanistic links between COPD and lung cancer, which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for both disorders. Patients with COPD are likely to benefit from less-invasive surgical and nonsurgical treatment strategies for lung cancer, but further study is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these procedures.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines airflow obstruction as spirometry where the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity after bronchodilation is less than 0.70. The guidelines also provided graded recommendations on current therapy for COPD. Treatment can be guided based on severity of disease and severity of symptoms. We review the GOLD guidelines to provide an overview of treatment modalities aimed at improving lung function, reducing hospitalization, and reducing mortality.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^1176u5nN]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^112CENvL]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

### An update on pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114fkwqh]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread disease process with important clinical and economic implications. This review will summarize new pharmacotherapy for the treatment of COPD.

Recent Findings

Several recent clinical trials have led to the approval of new inhaler therapies for COPD. Many of these are specifically targeting combination long-acting β-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists for late stage COPD.

Summary

Several new bronchodilators are available on the market, especially in combination form. The new drug combinations have positive data though clinical relevance, and comparisons to available and well established therapies are still needed. Specifically, translating improved forced expiratory volume into meaningful clinical outcomes remains challenging.

Of those tiotropium appears to be the closest to receiving clinical approval in the United States. The risk/benefit ratio and the cost-effectiveness of the other compounds are less clear and await additional study.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111ZMHsZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort on the part of a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies that addressed the clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the panel of experts. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: After weighing the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations: 1) a strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance; 2) a conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year; 3) a conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year; 4) no recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom ICS is conditionally recommended as an additive therapy; 5) a conditional recommendation against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations; and 6) a conditional recommendation for opioid-based therapy in patients with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy. Conclusions: The task force made recommendations regarding the pharmacologic treatment of COPD based on currently available evidence. Additional research in populations that are underrepresented in clinical trials is needed, including studies in patients with COPD 80 years of age and older, those with multiple chronic health conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114QeQCT]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Recognition that the burden of this disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention has stimulated new research into the underlying mechanisms, leading to a rational basis for evaluation of existing therapies, and has suggested novel treatment approaches. Tobacco exposure remains the main but not exclusive cause of COPD. Whether the lung is injured by changes in the balance of proteases and antiproteases, tissue damage by oxidative stress, or a combination of the two is still not known. The genetic basis of susceptibility to COPD is now being studied as is the role of computed tomography in the identification of structural damage in individuals with less symptomatic disease. Clinical diagnosis still relies heavily on an appropriate history confirmed by abnormal spirometry. Smoking cessation is possible in a substantial proportion of individuals with symptoms but is most effective if withdrawal is supported by pharmacological treatment. Treatment with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators and, in more severe disease, inhaled corticosteroids reduces symptoms and exacerbation frequency and improves health status. Rehabilitation can be even more effective, at least for a year after the treatment. Recent guidelines have made practical suggestions about how to optimise these treatments and when to consider addition of oxygen, surgery, and non-invasive ventilation. Regular review of this guidance is important if future management advances are to be implemented effectively.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116aRVSb]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Introduction — global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) states that the GOLD Report provides a non-biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people with COPD, with treatment objectives organized into two groups that relieve and reduce the impact of symptoms and reduce the risk of adverse health events in the future. The original FEV1-based staging system is described, but at an individual level FEV1 alone is an unreliable marker of the severity of breathlessness, exercise limitation, health status impairment, and risk of exacerbation. The report highlights that there are simple and reliable questionnaires designed for routine clinical practice, enabling an assessment system that draws together the impact of symptoms and the patient's risk of a serious adverse health event and can be used in any clinical setting anywhere in the world to move COPD treatment toward individualized medicine.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) kills more than 3 million people worldwide every year. Despite progress in the treatment of symptoms and prevention of acute exacerbations, few advances have been made to ameliorate disease progression or affect mortality. A better understanding of the complex disease mechanisms resulting in COPD is needed. Smoking cessation programmes, increasing physical activity, and early detection and treatment of comorbidities are further key components to reduce the burden of the disease. However, without a global political and economic effort to reduce tobacco use, to regulate environmental exposure, and to find alternatives to the massive use of biomass fuel, COPD will remain a major health-care problem for decades to come.

### Medical therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2007 [^116WmRDy]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Medical treatment for patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has evolved significantly over the past 2 decades. Current World Health Organization recommendations suggest a stepwise approach to therapy depending upon disease severity. As-needed use of short-acting bronchodilators is recommended for patients with mild disease. Scheduled dosing of bronchodilators is recommended for patients with more advanced disease. Inhaled beta-agonists and anti-cholinergic agents in combination have proved to be more effective than either agent alone. Long-acting preparations are associated with better disease control and have not been associated with tachyphylaxis. Inhaled corticosteroids are useful for reducing the frequency of exacerbations in patients who experience one or more episodes per year. Oxygen therapy is clearly beneficial in patients with advanced COPD and chronic respiratory failure, and its potential benefits in less severe disease are currently being studied. Pulmonary rehabilitation benefits patients with mild-to-severe disease, although the greatest benefits have been demonstrated in those with moderate COPD. New ultra-long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and retinoids intended to promote tissue regeneration are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as future therapeutic agents.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

### Review of drug development guidance to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US and EU perspectives [^113pXAJB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the GOLD stages 1–4 are used to describe the severity of airflow limitation and represent important cutoffs for clinical study inclusion/exclusion criteria, this patient characterization based on FEV 1 alone lacks sufficient precision to predict those at risk of adverse outcomes, including disease exacerbations or mortality and to adequately guide treatment decisions. Therefore, the GOLD consortium issued a combined approach for COPD grading in 2017. 2 In this paradigm, patients undergo spirometry to determine severity of airflow limitation (which helps define prognosis) and are assessed for severity of symptoms and history of exacerbations. The best predictor of future exacerbations is a history of treated exacerbations. 14 Frequent exacerbators are defined as those reporting two or more per year or at least one requiring hospitalization or an emergency department visit. Symptoms are assessed by two main tools; the COPD Assessment Test or the modified Medical Research Council questionnaires. COPD Assessment Test is an eight‐item questionnaire with a total score of 40 that captures information regarding health status, 15 and the modified Medical Research Council is a 4‐grade scale for breathlessness. 16 Based on these outcomes, patients are categorized into four GOLD grades A−D reflecting symptom burden and exacerbation risk (Table 1). The GOLD grades are intended to guide clinician treatment decisions as well as pharmacological therapy escalation and de‐escalation if required.

### Combination bronchodilator therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113QDKrX]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

The rising number of both single-agent and combination therapies for COPD increases the number of treatment options, and, hence, makes treatment choice more complex. Further studies should be designed to provide substantial evidence for future guideline recommendations. In particular, investigation into the optimal sequencing of monotherapies and combination bronchodilators would be of use to determine where LAMA/LABA FDC therapy may be positioned in the treatment algorithm for COPD. Furthermore, examination of the benefits of using dual bronchodilation as initial maintenance therapy would be of interest, along with which groups of patients may benefit from this approach.

There is a growing appreciation of the benefits of bronchodilation beyond lung function, such as exacerbations, patient-reported outcomes, exercise tolerance and exercise capacity, and daily activities. Trials of LABA/LAMA FDCs should assess this wider range of outcomes in order to more fully understand the broader benefits of increased bronchodilation on a patient's life as a whole.

### Lung transplantation and lung volume reduction surgery versus transplantation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1122rMgB]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Lung transplantation and lung volume reduction surgery are surgical options for patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is refractory to medical treatment. In this review, we discuss the differential indications for each procedure, as well as compare their risks and benefits. We also present an algorithm for selecting the most appropriate procedure for individual patients. Finally, we discuss the feasibility and role of lung transplantation after lung volume reduction surgery in the management of selected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease activity — Activity of a disease relates to the level of activation of the biological processes that drive disease progression and Disease activity is a different concept than disease severity. Disease progression in established COPD is heterogeneous, ranging from rapid progression to stable or even improved lung function, suggesting that disease activity is also variable. We recommend: Studies that relate potential biomarkers of disease activity to patient-centered outcomes to validate the biomarkers as clinically useful measures of disease activity. We recommend: Studies that evaluate the impact of disease activity on treatment response and, conversely, the effects of treatment on disease activity.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^114KADo3]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

### The guideline approach to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: how effective? [^113PuaLq]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed to assist health care decisions in specific clinical circumstances. They first arose to improve quality of care by decreasing unexplained practice variation, controlling health care costs, fostering evidence-based decision-making, and accelerating the application of new advances in medical science to everyday practice. Unfortunately, multiple studies demonstrate incomplete and varied effectiveness of clinical practice guidelines in altering clinician behavior and improving patient outcomes. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods for guideline development, diffusion, dissemination, and implementation. Despite evidence of limited effectiveness, more than 40 clinical practice guidelines pertaining to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been published since 1985. The present article reviews those guidelines, evidence for their effectiveness, and approaches to improve their implementation.

Current Treatment Options

The majority of approved COPD medications are either bronchodilators or anti‐inflammatory therapies, and the following briefly outlines the current treatment options for COPD; there are a number of excellent reviews that summarize the safety and efficacy of these marketed COPD medications. 17, 18, 19

Bronchodilators

Bronchodilators are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of COPD. 20 Two classes of bronchodilators can be distinguished: β2‐adrenoreceptor agonists and muscarinic antagonists. The β2‐adrenoreceptor agonists stimulate airway smooth muscles to induce bronchodilation. Although their anti‐inflammatory properties have been postulated to contribute to their efficacy in COPD treatment, this has not been proven to be relevant for the clinical setting. 21, 22 Muscarinic receptors affect bronchial motor tone and mucus secretion through the cholinergic system by coupling to G‐proteins Gα q/11 (M1, M3, and M5 receptor subtypes) or Gα i/o (M2 and M4 receptor subtypes). Although M2 receptors indirectly affect airway smooth muscle contraction, M3 receptors dominantly contribute to relaxation and dilation of airway smooth muscles. M3 receptors also mediate cholinergic effects on mucus secretion. Selective M3‐muscarinic receptor inhibition improves bronchodilation as well as mucus production. 23, 24

As summarized in Table 1, GOLD class A patients are typically well managed on either a short‐acting or long‐acting bronchodilator depending upon their symptoms. GOLD class B patients may start on a single long‐acting β2‐adrenoreceptor (LABA) or long‐acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). If symptoms of breathlessness persist on monotherapy, they may be escalated to dual therapy with LABA and LAMA treatments. Patients with GOLD class C (currently defined as relatively low symptom burden but high exacerbation risk) often start on an LAMA and advance to LABA + LAMA upon further exacerbations. Combined treatment with LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can also be considered. Finally, LABA + LAMA is a recommended starting therapy for GOLD class D patients. In patients who develop further exacerbations, the guideline recommends considering escalation to triple therapy (LAMA + LABA + ICS or switching to LABA + ICS). 2 Table 2 lists the maintenance COPD medication approved in the United States and the European Union.

Table 2
COPD maintenance medication

Triple therapy has been shown to have favorable characteristics compared with single LAMA or dual LAMA + LABA or LABA + ICS therapy, and its use is currently also under consideration for patients with less severe COPD or selected phenotypes. 25, 26

### Pre-operative optimisation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a narrative review [^116vqVNm]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a condition commonly present in older people undergoing surgery and confers an increased risk of postoperative complications and mortality. Although predominantly a respiratory disease, it frequently has extra-pulmonary manifestations and typically occurs in the context of other long-term conditions. Patients experience a range of symptoms that affect their quality of life, functional ability and clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss the evidence for techniques to optimise the care of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the peri-operative period, and address potential new interventions to improve outcomes. The article centres on pulmonary rehabilitation, widely available for the treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but less often used in a peri-operative setting. Current evidence is largely at high risk of bias, however. Before surgery it is important to ensure that what have been called the 'five fundamentals' of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment are achieved: smoking cessation; pulmonary rehabilitation; vaccination; self-management; and identification and optimisation of co-morbidities. Pharmacological treatment should also be optimised, and some patients may benefit from lung volume reduction surgery. Psychological and behavioural factors are important, but are currently poorly understood in the peri-operative period. Considerations of the risk and benefits of delaying surgery to ensure the recommended measures are delivered depends on patient characteristics and the nature and urgency of the planned intervention.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1128NkZi]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological management uses a separate follow-up algorithm based on two key treatable traits — persistence of dyspnea and occurrence of exacerbations — and is designed to facilitate management of patients taking maintenance treatment(s), whether early after initial treatment or after years of follow-up; these recommendations incorporate evidence from clinical trials and the use of peripheral blood eosinophil counts as a biomarker to guide the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for exacerbation prevention.

Research needs

The studies available to date used the criterion of one or more exacerbations in the past year to define a patient with frequent exacerbations. This criterion is inadequate because there are likely different risks (and different responses to pharmacotherapy) for patients depending on both the number and severity of exacerbations. For example, a patient with less than one exacerbation per year would likely be at low risk, patients with one exacerbation per year may have a moderate risk, and patients with two or more exacerbations per year or those with at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization may be at high risk. Trials using risk stratification of exacerbation risks to more precisely target a treatment response are needed. Evidence is also lacking with regard to the subgroup with no history of exacerbations, and trials are needed to better establish the role of triple therapy in this patient population.

Adequately powered, well-designed effectiveness studies (e.g. pragmatic RCTs and nonrandomized studies of interventions), with larger sample sizes, in the area of triple therapy versus dual therapy should be conducted in real-life situations, such as those involving patients older than 80 years of age, those with multiple chronic health conditions, current smokers, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma. The results of such trials could provide much-needed robust evidence for optimal personalized clinical management.

Question 3: In Patients with COPD Who Are Receiving Triple Therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), Should the ICS Be Withdrawn?

Recommendation

In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA, we suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Subgroup analysis

The panel decided a priori that a subgroup analysis would be done for the exacerbation outcome based on patients with a history of one or more COPD exacerbations in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization versus patients with no exacerbation in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization.

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, all-cause death, ICU admissions, dyspnea, health-related QOL, and physical activity as critical outcomes.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological treatment (Figure 3.9) presents suggested escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy and safety data and can be applied to any patient already taking maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed, and when treatment modification, in particular de-escalation, is considered, patients should be under close medical supervision. The report notes that treatment escalation has not been systematically tested and that trials of de-escalation are limited and only include ICS. If response to initial treatment is appropriate, maintain it; if not, check adherence, inhaler technique and possible interfering comorbidities, evaluate whether dyspnea/activity limitation or prevention of exacerbations is the predominant treatable trait, use the exacerbation pathway if both need to be targeted, then select the corresponding algorithm and identify the box matching the current treatment to follow the suggested algorithm.

### An update on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2017 guidelines with a focus on classification and management of stable COPD [^113ec6q6]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines offer important changes to the assessment and management of stable COPD of importance to practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and nurses who care for patients with COPD. Therapies are now chosen based on the burden of symptoms and the history of COPD exacerbations, and inhaler regimens are modifiable based on continual clinical reassessment. Although identifying the degree of airway obstruction remains important for informing the clinical status of the patient with COPD, FEV 1 is no longer used to direct the therapeutic approach. Therapies and modes of inhaled medication delivery for each GOLD grouping have been modified and reflect the need for reevaluation of patient symptoms and COPD exacerbation history as an indicator to add or withdraw therapies. As the knowledge of this important disease continues to expand, exacerbation and symptom prevention in patients with stable COPD will remain as an important target of COPD therapies and research. Novel drug combinations and delivery devices are sure to positively affect the practitioner's approach to patients with stable COPD. The new 2017 GOLD guidelines represent a step toward personalized care of the patient with COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

### Optimizing treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an assessment of current therapies [^115hVTyh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Bronchodilators are the mainstay of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) therapy. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists generally have a more rapid onset of effect and shorter duration of action than short-acting anticholinergic agents, and are usually prescribed as "rescue" medication to relieve acute bronchospasm. For patients with persistent symptoms, maintenance therapy with inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists is preferable to short-acting beta2-agonists because long-acting beta2-agonists provide more predictable, longer-lasting improvements in lung function. Long-acting anticholinergic agents can provide similar prolonged improvement in lung function with once-daily dosing. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and are recommended for patients with severe COPD and frequent exacerbations. Combining different classes of bronchodilators or combining a bronchodilator with a corticosteroid provides greater improvements in lung function and symptoms than the individual agents given alone. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and surgery, can benefit patients at various stages of disease. A treatment algorithm that combines both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of COPD is presented.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up after therapy initiation — following implementation of therapy, patients should be reassessed for attainment of treatment goals and identification of any barriers for successful treatment; following review of the patient's response to treatment initiation, adjustments may be needed. This is guided by the principles of first review and assess, then adjust if necessary, including to review symptoms (dyspnea) and exacerbation risk (previous history, blood eosinophils), assess inhaler technique and adherence and the role of non-pharmacological approaches, and adjust pharmacological treatment including escalation or de-escalation; switching inhaler device or molecules within the same class may be considered as appropriate, and any change in treatment requires a subsequent review of the clinical response, including side effects.

### What have we learned from observational studies and clinical trials of mild to moderate COPD? [^111xGcnG]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by chronic airflow limitation, which is usually progressive. This disease is a major cause of morbidity and is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Although it is mostly related to exposure to tobacco smoking, patients exposed to biomass and pollution are also at risk of developing COPD.

The impact of COPD on each patient depends on the degree of airflow limitation, the severity of symptoms and comorbidities. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) staging system categorises COPD into 4 severity stages (based on post-bronchodilator FEV1): stage I or mild, FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted; stage II or moderate, FEV1 ≥ 50% and < 80% predicted; stage III or severe, FEV1 ≥ 30% and < 50% predicted; and stage IV or very severe, FEV1 < 30% predicted. As the disease progresses, there is greater restriction in daily activity with impaired quality of life and an increase of symptoms and exacerbations.

Nonetheless, the reduction in daily activity is already present in mild disease. Since COPD is progressive, it is important to identify and treat patients at early stages in order to prevent further deterioration. Patients with mild (stage I) COPD already have measurable physiological impairment with increased morbidity and a higher risk of mortality compared with healthy non-smoking controls. It is well established that patients with mild to moderate disease represent the majority of patients with COPD. However, this subpopulation is both underdiagnosed and undertreated. In addition, most clinical trials include cohorts of patients with worse lung function and worse quality of life, which are very different from those usually seen in primary care (PC).

Encouragement of smoking cessation, in conjunction with management of symptoms and treating activity limitations and exacerbations by appropriate pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management at the earliest possible stage can positively affect the impact and progression of the disease. In recent years, newer strategies and a growing number of new pharmacologic agents to treat COPD have also been introduced and show promise in improving the management of COPD. New disease lung models to predict patient-specific drug deposition are also being developed in order to individualise therapy.

The aim of this article is to review the current evidence on the epidemiology, natural history and management of mild to moderate COPD (defined as an FEV1 > 50% predicted), highlighting the importance of treatment in earlier stages of the disease to try to prevent progression.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^111KzuaQ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

### Long-term continuous oxygen treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: proper use, benefits and unresolved issues [^113zuBNj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Long-term oxygen treatment is one of the few interventions that improve survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and it is widely used even though published evidence supporting the use of this treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is scanty. In addition, some studies do not demonstrate a mortality benefit for long-term oxygen treatment in this disease. It is important that long-term oxygen treatment be administered only to those patients who will benefit and in a manner that maximizes its efficacy. New studies are urgently needed to address these questions.

Recent Findings

The published evidence for and against the use of long-term oxygen treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is summarized and problems with current guidelines and important areas for future research are discussed.

Summary

Future research will address the optimal timing and duration of oxygen therapy during rest, exercise and sleep, ways of identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients who are most likely to benefit and ways of improving patient compliance, all of which may have a profound effect on clinical practice.

### Pharmacologic interventions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: bronchodilators [^115PtjzU]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a treatable disease characterized by progressive airflow limitation. Prevention of disease progression, improvement of symptoms, exercise tolerance, health status, and decrease in exacerbations and in mortality are the main goals of the management of COPD. Bronchodilators play a pivotal role in the treatment of symptomatic patients with COPD. Inhaled short-acting bronchodilators are currently recommended for rescue of symptoms in patients with mild disease, whereas inhaled long-acting bronchodilators are recommended as first-line agents for maintenance therapy in patients with moderate and severe disease and those with daily symptoms. Long-acting bronchodilators improve symptoms, exercise tolerance, and health status, and reduce exacerbations in patients COPD. However, their effects on long-term decline in lung function and mortality are currently under investigation. When symptoms are not sufficiently controlled by the use of one bronchodilator, combining bronchodilators of different classes may be a more effective approach. In fact, recent evidence supports the regular use of a combination of a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist and a long-acting anticholinergic agent in patients with severe COPD. Combining a long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist with an inhaled corticosteroid has also been shown to be more effective than the use of either agent alone. The use of theophylline has declined in recent years because of its narrow therapeutic index, and should be reserved as a third-line option in patients with very severe disease. Several novel bronchodilators are now in different stages of development for use alone or in combination with other agents.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) group E — initial pharmacologic therapy favors dual bronchodilation, as LABA+LAMA is the preferred choice for initial therapy in group E patients provided there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side-effects. Use of LABA+ICS in COPD is not encouraged; if there is an indication for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), then LABA+LAMA+ICS has been shown to be superior to LABA+ICS and is therefore the preferred choice. Consider LABA+LAMA+ICS in group E if eos ≥ 300 cells/μL (practical recommendation); although there are no direct data on initiating triple therapy in newly diagnosed patients, available studies performed mostly in treated patients provide a rationale for considering this option for patients with a high eosinophil count (≥ 300 cells/μL).

### Interventions to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^1168yAUp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a profound effect on the patient's health status and decline in lung function; they also impose a significant burden on healthcare resource utilization. Prevention and treatment of exacerbations is listed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as among the major objectives of COPD management, and it is therefore an important outcome measure when studying any new agent. This article discusses pharmacologic therapy and other measures for preventing exacerbations and hospitalizations due to exacerbations of COPD.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITORS Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors reduce pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

Roflumilast, a PDE-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of COPD, reduces moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with severe to very severe COPD who have frequent exacerbations, especially those with a history of hospitalization for acute exacerbation. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis. Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment.

Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit. Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. LONG-TERM OXYGEN THERAPY The American Thoracic Society, U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and U. S. Department of Defense recommend long-term oxygen therapy for patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia.

Key Points for Practice
- For stable COPD, LAMAs are the most effective monotherapy.
- For continued symptoms despite LAMA monotherapy, consider adding a LABA, followed by an ICS.
- In COPD exacerbations, adding antibiotics to oral corticosteroids reduces treatment failure but does not reduce repeat exacerbations or mortality.
- Supplemental oxygen is only beneficial for patients with severe resting hypoxemia. From the AFP Editors Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a devastating disease affecting more than 16 million Americans, and the third leading cause of death globally. Mortality from COPD has increased over the past 50 years, and mortality in women has surpassed that in men. The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U. S. Department of Defense published guidelines for the primary care management of COPD.

Stable COPD Treatment Long-acting bronchodilators are the primary maintenance therapy for stable COPD because they decrease dyspnea and exacerbations while improving quality of life. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists reduce exacerbations and hospitalizations more than long-acting beta agonists, with fewer adverse events, and are the most effective monotherapy. No LAMA formulation appears to be more effective than any other. Monotherapy with an inhaled corticosteroid is less effective than either LABA or LAMA monotherapy and increases the risk of candidiasis, hoarseness, and pneumonia. Adding an ICS to LABA/LAMA combination therapy further reduces exacerbations, with a number needed to treat of 38, but increases pneumonia risk with an number needed to harm of 195. After two years of triple therapy without exacerbations, consider withdrawing the ICS if the peripheral eosinophil count is less than 300 cells per μL.

Treating Exacerbations Oral corticosteroids are standard for treating COPD exacerbations, but the benefit of antibiotic therapy is less clear. Although antibiotic therapy reduces treatment failure during the exacerbation, there is no improvement in mortality or reduction of repeat exacerbations. Antibiotic treatment increases the risks of diarrhea and antimicrobial resistance. Using C-reactive protein to guide antibiotic therapy does not improve outcomes. Supplemental Oxygen Supplemental oxygen reduces mortality in patients with chronic stable resting severe hypoxemia, which is defined as an oxygen saturation of 88% or less or partial pressure of oxygen (Pao.

Key Points for Practice
- For symptomatic COPD, combination LABA/LAMA therapy is recommended over monotherapy because of reduced exacerbations and hospitalizations and improvements in dyspnea.
- Adding an ICS to LABA/LAMA therapy further reduces exacerbations but increases pneumonia risk with no change in hospitalization rate.
- Maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy does not appear to improve outcomes in COPD, but it does increase adverse events.
- Long-term oxygen therapy reduces mortality in patients with COPD who have severe hypoxia and a resting oxygen saturation of 88% or less. From the AFP Editors Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation from airway or alveolar abnormalities. The goal of medical treatment for COPD is to reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life, and control symptoms.

The American Thoracic Society published guidelines for pharmacologic management of COPD and long-term oxygen therapy for COPD and interstitial lung disease based on systematic reviews. Baseline Therapy For patients with symptoms from COPD, the ATS recommends combination therapy with a long-acting beta agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist based on improved outcomes over monotherapy with either agent. LABA/LAMA combination therapy results in fewer exacerbations than monotherapy, with a number needed to treat of 12 to prevent one exacerbation. Adding Corticosteroid Therapy If patients with COPD are symptomatic despite combination LABA/LAMA therapy, adding an inhaled corticosteroid can be considered. Adding the ICS reduces exacerbations over LABA/LAMA therapy without changing dyspnea or health-related quality of life.

The risk of pneumonia increases with ICS/LABA/LAMA triple therapy compared with LABA/LAMA therapy, although with no increase in hospitalization rates. Patients with blood eosinophilia and COPD have greater reduction in exacerbations and a greater risk of pneumonia with ICS use. AFP COPD review. Although all three note that combination LABA/LAMA therapy is superior to monotherapy, the ATS recommends combination LABA/LAMA use by all symptomatic patients with COPD, whereas the VA/DoD recommend starting with LAMA monotherapy.
