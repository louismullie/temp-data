## Question

Treatment for dry chronic itchy cough in 90 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat a 90-year-old with a dry, chronic, itchy cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the cough truly meets the definition of chronic cough and what the "itchy" quality implies. Then, I should verify red flags and the initial diagnostic workup, including medications and chest imaging. Next, I will consider common reversible causes and when to trial targeted therapies. After that, I need to address refractory or unexplained chronic cough with the safest-first strategy in a frail nonagenarian. Finally, I should incorporate geriatric-specific risks, monitoring, and follow-up with validated tools, ensuring I cross-check each step against guidelines and correct myself if I drift from evidence-based pathways [^1139hkdW] [^115ThUt5].

> Let me first confirm the definition and phenotype signal here. Chronic cough is defined as cough persisting for more than 8 weeks, so I should verify duration before labeling it chronic, and the "dry, itchy/tickle in the throat" description makes me think about cough hypersensitivity syndrome as a leading mechanism once common causes are excluded, especially in older adults where neuronal dysregulation can dominate the phenotype [^1139hkdW] [^112NbbbN] [^116djdQt].

> Next, I should review for red flags and do a focused initial workup without delay. Hold on, I need to ensure a chest X-ray is obtained as first-line imaging in any patient with chronic cough to exclude occult malignancy, infection, or interstitial lung disease; this is particularly important at age 90, where lung cancer and ILD prevalence increase and where missing a reversible complication would be consequential [^112fGGXP] [^115JJFum].

> I will now examine medications, because drugs are a frequent and fixable cause. Wait, let me verify ACE inhibitor exposure — ACE inhibitor–induced dry cough is common and can occur anytime after initiation, resolving weeks after discontinuation; the remedy is stopping the ACE inhibitor and switching to an angiotensin receptor blocker such as losartan, recognizing that cough can rarely occur with ARBs as well, so I should reassess symptoms after the change rather than assume cure [^112BzfjR] [^114kQ7mD] [^111VZPBZ].

> Next, I should review common, treatable causes if identified by history, exam, and basic testing. For probable upper airway cough syndrome, I can consider a therapeutic trial with a first-generation antihistamine and possibly intranasal corticosteroids; for asthma or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, a short trial of inhaled corticosteroids is reasonable but I need to check for eosinophilic markers or bronchial hyperresponsiveness because those predict steroid response, and I should be cautious about ICS adverse effects in the elderly; for suspected reflux, I must remember not to start PPIs empirically in unexplained cough without clear reflux evidence given guideline recommendations to avoid routine acid suppression in chronic cough [^112aZVVt] [^111nQUwp] [^117UtaE7] [^1122coLg] [^111QAu5c].

> Hmm, wait a minute — am I about to overuse inhaled corticosteroids in someone with suspected unexplained chronic cough? I should double-check the guidance: in adults with unexplained chronic cough who test negative for eosinophilia and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, ACCP recommends avoiding ICS, so I must reserve ICS for cough with an asthma or eosinophilic phenotype and not as a blanket empiric step in UCC without supportive testing [^112d375d] [^1139hkdW].

> If the evaluation is negative and cough persists despite appropriate treatment trials, I need to consider this unexplained or refractory chronic cough and start with the safest option first. Let me think about nonpharmacologic therapy: multimodal speech pathology–based cough control therapy is recommended and has favorable risk, making it ideal for a frail 90-year-old; I should prioritize referral and reinforce hydration, laryngeal hygiene, cough suppression techniques, and breathing retraining before moving to drugs [^112Rv1yB] [^115tDYYg] [^115sJW7x].

> If nonpharmacologic therapy is insufficient, I should consider neuromodulators with extreme caution in the elderly. Hold on, I should verify dosing: gabapentin is suggested by ACCP for UCC after discussing risks and benefits; in a 90-year-old I will start very low, for example 100 mg at bedtime, and titrate slowly while monitoring for sedation, dizziness, and falls, and I must reassess the risk-benefit balance at 6 months before continuing; pregabalin is an alternative with similar cautions, and I should avoid co-prescribing other CNS depressants when possible [^112tF1bg] [^1136XdHs] [^112RevEc].

> For severe refractory symptoms after the above, I may need to consider opioids, but wait, I should verify the recommended dose and the indication. ERS suggests low-dose morphine 5–10 mg twice daily for chronic refractory cough, while oncologic and ILD guidelines support opioids for distressing cough without a treatable cause; I initially thought 2.5–5 mg twice daily would be standard, but that is lower than the ERS range — given this patient's age and frailty, I would still start at 2.5 mg twice daily off-label as a geriatric-safety adaptation, with close monitoring for delirium, constipation, and falls, and reassess within a week, then monthly to ensure benefits outweigh risks [^114P88QZ] [^113pzuWm] [^114tCVZP] [^1133DQDu].

> I should also consider emerging options and availability. Gefapixant, a P2X3 antagonist, has been approved in the EU, UK, Switzerland, and Japan for refractory chronic cough but is not FDA approved; if accessible and prior steps fail, it can reduce cough hypersensitivity and frequency, and I should counsel on expected benefit and local access pathways; other P2X3 agents like camlipixant are in development, indicating a growing therapeutic class [^112NbbbN] [^113NRogX].

> Now, I need to ensure geriatric-specific safeguards are front and center. Polypharmacy risk is high at age 90, so I must minimize new drugs, check for CNS depressant combinations, and emphasize fall prevention when using gabapentinoids or opioids; if ICS are used for a documented eosinophilic airway disease, I should mitigate bone and oral health risks; and I should keep goals of care in focus, favoring interventions with meaningful symptom relief and low harm in alignment with patient preferences [^1148Zbhq] [^111nQUwp] [^117ArKBm].

> Next, I should review how to monitor outcomes and when to stop ineffective therapies. Let me verify recommended tools: the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and the Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire are validated to track response; I should reassess within 6–8 weeks of any new therapy and discontinue if there is no clinically relevant improvement to avoid medication creep; persistent morbidity despite best practice warrants referral to a specialized cough clinic [^117E97xq] [^113Mftse] [^115BPbfD].

> Lastly, I will synthesize the practical sequence while checking for internal consistency. First, confirm chronicity and phenotype, order a chest X-ray, and stop any ACE inhibitor; second, treat identified UACS, asthma or NAEB, or reflux where truly indicated; third, if cough persists without an identified cause, prioritize speech pathology therapy; fourth, if needed, trial very-low-dose gabapentin with slow titration and strict monitoring; fifth, reserve low-dose morphine for severe refractory cough with careful reassessment; throughout, tailor to frailty and preferences and document benefits versus harms at each step so that I do not overmedicalize a symptom that may be modestly responsive at advanced age [^112fGGXP] [^112BzfjR] [^112aZVVt] [^112Rv1yB] [^112tF1bg] [^114P88QZ].

---

For a 90-year-old with a chronic, dry, itchy cough, prioritize **identifying and treating the underlying cause** (UACS, GERD, asthma, ACE inhibitors, ILD, or malignancy) and **start with nonpharmacologic measures** (humidification, hydration, speech therapy) [^116q3BMN] [^115tDYYg]. If cough persists, **consider a short trial** of low-dose morphine (2.5–5 mg BID) or gabapentin (100–300 mg at bedtime), with close monitoring for sedation, constipation, and falls [^114P88QZ] [^112tF1bg]. Avoid routine use of **PPIs, bronchodilators, or mucolytics** unless indicated by a specific diagnosis [^1122coLg] [^116y4KEW]. Reassess regularly, escalating care only if **cough significantly impairs quality of life**.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is **essential** to identify and treat underlying causes:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for GERD, UACS, asthma, ACE inhibitor use, ILD, malignancy, and medication side effects [^116q3BMN].

- **Chest radiograph**: Recommended initial imaging for chronic cough > 8 weeks [^112fGGXP].

- **Pulmonary function tests**: Evaluate for asthma, COPD, or ILD.

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, thyroid function, and ACE levels if sarcoidosis is suspected.

- **Specialist referral**: Consider pulmonology or ENT if initial evaluation is inconclusive.

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic measures are **first-line** given their safety and efficacy:

- **Humidification and hydration**: Use humidifiers and maintain adequate hydration to reduce mucosal dryness.

- **Speech therapy**: Cough control therapy is recommended for chronic refractory cough [^112Rv1yB].

- **Environmental modifications**: Avoid irritants (smoke, strong odors, allergens).

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacologic therapy should be **individualized**, starting with the safest options:

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Recommended use** | **Cautions** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antitussives (dextromethorphan, codeine) | Short-term symptomatic relief | Use cautiously; monitor for sedation, constipation, respiratory depression | Sedation, constipation, respiratory depression |
| Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) | Chronic refractory cough | Consider trial; monitor for sedation, dizziness, falls | Sedation, dizziness, falls |
| Low-dose morphine | Chronic refractory cough | 2.5–5 mg BID; monitor closely | Sedation, constipation, respiratory depression |
| Inhaled corticosteroids | Asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis | Short-term trial (2–4 weeks) | Oral thrush, dysphonia |
| Proton pump inhibitors | GERD-related cough | Only if GERD confirmed | Avoid routine use [^1122coLg] |
| Bronchodilators | Asthma, COPD | Only if airflow obstruction present | Tremor, tachycardia |

---

## Special considerations in elderly patients

Elderly patients require **careful monitoring** given their increased risk of adverse effects — including sedation and cognitive impairment — with antitussives, gabapentinoids, or opioids. Assess fall risk regularly and review medications to minimize interactions and side effects.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is **essential** to assess efficacy and safety; track cough severity, frequency, and impact on quality of life. Monitor for sedation, cognitive impairment, constipation, and respiratory depression, and titrate or discontinue medications based on response and side effects.

---

## When to escalate care

Escalate care when:

- **Persistent cough**: Despite initial interventions.

- **Severe adverse effects**: From medications.

- **Underlying disease progression**: Suspected or confirmed.

- **Significant quality of life impairment**: Due to cough.

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies such as **P2X3 receptor antagonists** (e.g. gefapixant) show promise but are not yet widely available or approved in all regions [^112NbbbN].

---

## Conclusion

Management of a chronic, dry, itchy cough in a 90-year-old requires a structured approach: start by identifying and treating underlying causes, follow with nonpharmacologic interventions, and use pharmacologic therapies cautiously. Regular monitoring and individualized care are **essential** to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects.

### Unexplained (idiopathic) cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1142fp6n]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

To review the literature on unexplained cough, previously referred to as idiopathic cough, a search was conducted using MEDLINE (through May 2004) for studies published in English since 1980. This search focused on human subjects and utilized medical subject heading terms such as "cough", "unexplained cough", and "idiopathic cough". Case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were selected, alongside pertinent references from these studies.

The diagnosis of unexplained (idiopathic) cough should only be considered after thoroughly diagnosing and treating the most common causes of cough and adequately evaluating uncommon causes. Without this, many patients with a definable cause of cough may be misdiagnosed as having "unexplained cough".

The diagnosis of unexplained cough is often made without an adequate diagnostic workup or treatment course to determine the specific cause. Nonetheless, some patients may not fit any usual explanations for cough. For these patients, the committee unanimously recommends using the diagnostic term "unexplained cough" rather than "idiopathic cough".

### Cough and ACE inhibitors: The truth beyond placebo [^114kQ7mD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are extensively used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases with a wide range of clinical recommendations. The use of ACE inhibitors can cause the onset of a dry cough, whose prevalence has probably been overestimated because of the lack of adequate control. A correct interpretation of available data requires a careful evaluation of placebo-controlled studies to definitively assess the rate of the most frequent adverse event of ACE inhibition.

### Hyzaar [^111VZPBZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Persistent dry cough has been associated with ACE-inhibitor use and can be a cause of discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Two prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients with typical ACE-inhibitor cough, when challenged with lisinopril and whose cough disappeared on placebo, were randomized to losartan 50 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, or either placebo (one study, n = 97) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n = 135). The double-blind treatment period lasted up to 8 weeks. The incidence of cough is similar across losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo therapy.

Cases of cough, including positive re-challenges, have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Hyzaar. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
	- **Digestive**: Hepatitis has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan.
	- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia.
	- **Hypersensitivity**: Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx.

### Unexplained disabling and long-lasting cough: a case report [^113jETaj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old woman was referred to our department due to a chronic dry cough lasting six years without an etiological diagnosis. The patient suffered from chronic deterioration in her quality of life due to a persistent cough that sounded like a barking seal.

- **Case presentation**: A severe form of malacia involving the inferior third of the trachea and the main bronchi was diagnosed. According to our protocol, a self-expandable prosthesis was placed in the distal portion of the trachea via rigid bronchoscopy with excellent results in cough relief. The patient was subsequently scheduled for tracheobronchoplastic surgery with a polypropylene matrix. Two and a half years after surgery, the patient had a significant improvement in quality of life with a complete resolution of her symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: This report demonstrated that tracheobronchomalacia can be difficult to diagnose with a serious impact on the patient's life. Referral to a specialized center is essential in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of this disease. Surgical treatment by tracheobronchoplasty may represent a good solution in selected patients.

### Management of chronic cough [^111BRZhf]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Cough that remains unexplained after basic clinical assessment is a common reason for referral to secondary care. Much of the evidence about the management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treating these conditions.

However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care. Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuating the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions is inhibiting research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, thereby jeopardizing the development of improved treatments.

We advocate a change in emphasis, which makes a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough. We recommend that some factors, with weak evidence of an association with cough, are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause.

We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.

### Characteristics of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-associated cough. A case-control study [^115JJFum]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Cough is the most common symptom prompting individuals worldwide to seek medical advice. Successful management of chronic cough requires the identification of underlying disorders maintaining the cough and offering effective therapy. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one potential, though rare, background disorder associated with cough. IPF is a chronic, progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) with an unknown cause. The prognosis after an IPF diagnosis is typically only 3–5 years, depending on the variable course of the disease. Due to the progression of IPF, recognizing early signs is crucial. Early diagnosis is necessary to initiate anti-fibrotic medication and slow disease progression. The first symptoms of IPF include exertional dyspnea and cough. The prevalence of cough among IPF patients ranges from 75–85%. Cough is linked to a decreased quality of life (QoL) and also predicts the time to hospitalization, death, and lung transplantation. IPF-associated cough is commonly dry or non-productive. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous controlled studies addressing this issue.

The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether cough in early-stage IPF is less productive compared to chronic cough in a community-based population. We also explored differences between these populations concerning the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) total score, domain scores, and responses to four specific questions from the LCQ: cough response to paint or fumes, and cough disturbance of sleep.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^112GCyRn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC), defined as a cough lasting more than eight weeks, is a common medical condition with a global prevalence of approximately 10% and a higher prevalence in Oceania, Europe, and the United States. The burden of CC can be severe, as patients experience substantial physical effects, such as stress urinary incontinence, sleep disturbances, and chest pain. Psychological consequences include frustration, anxiety, and depression, while social impairments involve social distress, isolation, and an inability to carry out daily activities, leading to a reduced quality of life. Moreover, the burden of CC is often long-lasting; some patients experience symptoms that persist for several years despite numerous doctor visits, empirical treatment trials, and frequent medical testing.

### Therapeutic and mechanistic advances in chronic cough [^112NbbbN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Cough is one of the most common reasons patients seek medical care in the outpatient setting. Chronic cough (CC) in adults is defined as a cough lasting more than eight weeks, with a global prevalence of approximately 10%. CC significantly impairs quality of life, affecting physical, social, and psychological well-being. In most cases, CC is attributed to one or more of the following three key conditions: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux, and asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis — assuming a normal chest x-ray result and no use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If the cough persists despite thorough guideline-based evaluation and treatment, it is classified as refractory CC (RCC). RCC is thought to arise from neuronal dysregulation involving both peripheral and central mechanisms, termed cough hypersensitivity syndrome. This is typically characterized by a tickle or itch sensation in the throat, leading to an urge to cough in response to seemingly harmless stimuli.

Treatment options for RCC include the "off-label" use of centrally acting neuromodulators and speech therapy. In addition, a new peripherally acting oral P2×3 receptor antagonist, gefapixant, has been approved in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Japan, though not in the United States or Canada. Emerging treatments hold promise for improving management in the future.

### Demographic, clinical, and patient-reported outcome data from 2 global, phase 3 trials of chronic cough [^115BPbfD]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

The characterization of patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough (RCC and UCC, respectively) primarily stems from relatively small clinical studies. This study reports the baseline medical history and clinical characteristics of individuals with RCC or UCC who were enrolled in COUGH-1 and COUGH-2, two large, global, phase 3 trials of gefapixant, a P2 × 3-receptor antagonist.

- **Objective**: To report the baseline medical history and clinical characteristics of individuals with RCC or UCC enrolled in COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 trials.

- **Methods**: Adults with a chronic cough lasting for more than one year, diagnosed with RCC or UCC, and a score greater than 40 mm on a 100-mm cough severity visual analog scale at both screening and baseline were eligible for enrollment. Demographics, medical history, and cough characteristics were collected at baseline. Cough-related measures included objective cough frequency, cough severity visual analog scale, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, and Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire. The data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Of 2044 participants, 75% were women; the mean age was 58 years, and mean cough duration was approximately 11 years. Among all participants, 73% were previously diagnosed with asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or upper airway cough syndrome. The mean Leicester Cough Questionnaire total score was 10.4, with domain scores reflecting impaired cough-specific quality of life across physical, psychological, and social domains. The mean Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire score was 39.6, with some of the most burdensome reported items being consistent with features of cough-reflex hypersensitivity. These results provide a detailed characterization of the participant demographics and cough burden.

### What causes cough in pulmonary fibrosis, and how should we treat it [^113rqQ5N]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Cough is a common and often debilitating symptom of pulmonary fibrosis. The pathophysiology of cough in pulmonary fibrosis involves a complex interplay of inflammatory, fibrotic, and possibly neurogenic mechanisms. Recent studies have highlighted the role of increased cough reflex sensitivity in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Current therapeutic approaches focus on both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to manage this symptom effectively. Pharmacological treatments include antitussive agents, while non-pharmacological strategies may involve pulmonary rehabilitation and speech therapy. Further research is needed to develop targeted treatments that address the underlying mechanisms of cough in pulmonary fibrosis.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^113P5vYx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC) is a burdensome condition characterized by the dysregulation of vagal sensory neurons that mediate cough. Several molecular targets have been investigated due to their potential roles in the pathophysiology of refractory chronic cough (RCC) and unexplained chronic cough (UCC). Although, as of the time of writing, results have varied among investigative approaches and there are currently no newly approved treatments for these conditions, some promising results have been reported for certain investigated pharmacologic treatments.

Given the heterogeneity underlying chronic cough, it is likely that the optimal therapeutic approach will vary by patient. Further multidisciplinary research is required to establish the best treatment pathways for this patient population.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFLU in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): A pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^116pRmnY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Coughing and irritation of the mucosa are mainly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. In young children, respiratory tract infections are extremely common and frequently recurrent. Pathogens often colonize the upper respiratory tract (nose or mouth) prior to causing lower respiratory infections or invasive diseases. The oral mucosa and epithelium play a protective role against the entry of microorganisms into the body. This mucosa is the main target tissue of microorganisms, such as viruses. Normally, primary infection results in viral replication at mucosal surfaces.

Upper respiratory tract infection is very frequent. Adult subjects experience 2 to 5 episodes per year, whereas school children suffer 7 to 10 episodes per year, leading to about 140 days of coughing annually. Children are almost 4 times more likely to experience upper respiratory infection-associated acute coughs than adults. In this context, coughing is the most common symptom of many inflammatory diseases.

Coughing is a physiological response to airway irritation. It has two main functions: (1) preventing the entry of food and fluids into the lower airways, and (2) favoring the removal of material that exceeds the transport capacity of the mucociliary system. Coughing can be initiated by pharyngeal stimulation or mucosal dehydration. A cough may be classified according to its duration and characteristics. It is considered to be occasional when it lasts less than 3 days. Persistent coughs that last more than 7 days are usually treated with medicinal products.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^1167P47N]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Recently, we identified in patients with chronic cough a sensory dysregulation via which the urge-to-cough (UTC) or coughing are evoked mechanically from "somatic points for cough" (SPCs) in the neck and upper trunk. We investigated the prevalence and the clinical relevance of SPCs in an unselected population of patients with chronic cough.

From 2018 to 2021, symptoms of 317 consecutive patients with chronic cough (233 females) were collected over four visits (V1–V4) at two-month intervals at the Cough Clinic of the University Hospital in Florence, Italy. Participants rated the disturbance caused by the cough on a 0–9 modified Borg Scale. We attempted to evoke coughing and/or UTC using mechanical actions in all participants who were subsequently categorized as responsive (somatic point for cough positive, SPC+) or unresponsive (SPC−) to these actions. An association was established between chronic cough and its common causes; treatments were administered accordingly.

The findings indicated that 169 patients were SPC+ and had a higher baseline cough score (p < 0.01). In most patients, treatments significantly reduced (p < 0.01) cough-associated symptoms. All patients reported a decrease (p < 0.01) in cough score at V2 (from 5.70 ± 1.4 to 3.43 ± 1.9 and from 5.01 ± 1.5 to 2.74 ± 1.7 for SPC+ and SPC− patients, respectively). However, while in SPC− patients the cough score continued to decrease, indicating virtually complete cough disappearance at V4 (0.97 ± 0.8), in SPC+ patients, this variable remained close to V2 values throughout the entire follow-up.

### Understanding the economic burden of chronic cough: A systematic literature review [^111uip1s]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Chronic cough (CC) is typically defined as a cough persisting for more than eight weeks. Although cough is a common reflex mechanism, excessive and prolonged cough can be highly burdensome to patients, disrupting daily activities for the individual and those around them. In severe cases, patients with CC may experience complications such as stress urinary incontinence, interference with speech, depression, and syncope, which can have a substantial negative impact on quality of life (QoL) and on activities of daily living.

Many patients with CC are believed to have cough reflex hypersensitivity, in which the reflex response occurs in response to low levels of stimulation from thermal, chemical, or mechanical sources. In some cases, CC is associated with an underlying comorbid condition, such as asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). When cough persists despite treatment of the associated condition, it is defined as refractory chronic cough (RCC). Conversely, unexplained chronic cough (UCC) may be diagnosed when all other aetiologies have been excluded through a thorough clinical evaluation and work-up. In both RCC and UCC, cough reflex hypersensitivity has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of CC. This review focuses on CC, inclusive of RCC and UCC.

### Unexplained disabling and long-lasting cough: A case report [^114irTxi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old woman was referred to our department due to a chronic dry cough lasting six years without an etiological diagnosis. The patient suffered from a chronic deterioration in her quality of life due to a persistent cough that sounded like a barking seal.

- **Case presentation**: A severe form of malacia involving the inferior third of the trachea and the main bronchi was diagnosed. According to our protocol, a self-expandable prosthesis was placed in the distal portion of the trachea via rigid bronchoscopy, with excellent results in cough relief. The patient was subsequently scheduled for tracheobronchoplastic surgery with a polypropylene matrix. Two and a half years after surgery, the patient had a significant improvement in quality of life with a complete resolution of her symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: This report demonstrated that tracheobronchomalacia can be difficult to diagnose, with a serious impact on the patient's life. Referral to a specialized center is essential in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of this disease. Surgical treatment by tracheobronchoplasty may represent a good solution in selected patients.

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^117EKXxC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics, such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion. With the emergence of the new clinical and mechanistic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^1118t5rV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation.

In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent, and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

### Management of chronic refractory cough [^115pU6u8]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic refractory cough (CRC) is defined as a cough that persists despite guideline-based treatment. It is observed in 20–46% of patients presenting to specialist cough clinics and significantly impacts quality of life and healthcare utilization. Several terms have been used to describe this condition, including the recently introduced term "cough hypersensitivity syndrome". Key symptoms include a dry, irritated cough localized around the laryngeal region. Symptoms are not restricted to cough and can include globus, dyspnea, and dysphonia.

Chronic refractory cough shares factors with laryngeal hypersensitivity syndromes and chronic pain syndromes, and these similarities help to illuminate the pathophysiology of the condition. Its pathophysiology is complex and includes cough reflex sensitivity, central sensitization, peripheral sensitization, and paradoxical vocal fold movement. Chronic refractory cough often occurs following a viral infection. The diagnosis is made once the main diseases that cause chronic cough have been excluded (or treated) and cough remains refractory to medical treatment.

Several treatments have been developed over the past decade. These include speech pathology interventions using techniques adapted from the treatment of hyperfunctional voice disorders, as well as the use of centrally acting neuromodulators such as gabapentin and pregabalin. Potential new treatments in development also show promise.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting longer than three weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no more than eight weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

- **Results**: The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known.

### Cough hypersensitivity and chronic cough [^111iNfDa]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is globally prevalent across all age groups. This disorder is challenging to treat because many pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions can present with chronic cough, and cough can also be present without any identifiable underlying cause or be refractory to therapies that improve associated conditions. Most patients with chronic cough have cough hypersensitivity, characterized by increased neural responsivity to a range of stimuli that affect the airways and lungs, as well as other tissues innervated by common nerve supplies. Cough hypersensitivity presents as excessive coughing, often in response to relatively innocuous stimuli, causing significant psychophysical morbidity and affecting patients' quality of life. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to cough hypersensitivity and excessive coughing in different patient populations and across the lifespan is advancing and has contributed to the development of new therapies for chronic cough in adults. Owing to differences in pathology, the organs involved, and individual patient factors, treatment of chronic cough is progressing towards a personalized approach. In the future, novel ways to endotype patients with cough may prove valuable in management.

### Long-term prognosis of chronic cough: A prospective, observational cohort study [^116NcWDa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cough is a clinically important symptom. It is the most common reason why people seek medical attention and has a significant negative effect on the quality of life (QoL). This is especially true for chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting longer than eight weeks. Knowledge about the long-term prognosis of chronic cough and its determinants is valuable for guiding the management of individuals with this condition.

To the best of our knowledge, there is only one study on the long-term prognosis of chronic cough. This study included 42 subjects with unexplained (idiopathic) chronic cough who had attended a specialist cough clinic seven years earlier. At the time of re-assessment, the cough was unchanged or had worsened in 60% of the patients. The population of that study can be considered selected as one or more treatable causes of chronic cough can usually be identified. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the long-term prognosis and its determinants in a more representative group of subjects with chronic cough.

### Methods of cough assessment [^113RoK2m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

The accurate and consistent assessment of cough is essential not only for optimum standards of clinical care but also to drive forward advances in our understanding of cough. A range of tools for the subjective and objective measurement of cough exists, and their ongoing development has coincided with growth in clinical and preclinical research in cough, resulting in novel findings and promising new treatments. The most widely used and most fruitful approaches to assessing cough are discussed, along with some newer and preliminary techniques and directions for the future. These include methods for measuring cough-specific quality of life, subjective severity, cough frequency, intensity, and sensitivity of the underlying cough reflex.

Ongoing development and more widespread adoption of cough assessment tools should help describe the heterogeneity of cough phenotypes and may better guide treatment by enabling the prediction of responses to pharmacological and nonpharmacological antitussive therapies. More detailed assessments of cough may also bring benefits in measuring the transmission of respiratory infections or in managing reduced airway protection in neuromuscular disease. Population-wide assessments should also help in understanding the epidemiology of cough and assist in screening for disease.

### Camlipixant in refractory chronic cough: A phase 2a, randomized controlled trial (RELIEF) [^113NRogX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Eligible patients were aged 18–80 years, had refractory chronic cough (RCC) for one year or more, and an awake cough frequency of at least 10 coughs per hour at screening, measured by ambulatory cough recording. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive camlipixant or placebo for 16 days (see study design). After a 10- to 14-day washout period, patients crossed over to the alternative 16-day treatment period. Escalating camlipixant doses were orally administered at levels of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg, all taken twice daily, each over four days. Matched placebo tablets were administered twice daily during the placebo treatment period.

The study assessed the placebo-adjusted change from baseline in awake cough frequency. Patients were treated twice daily for four days at each dose level. ✱ p < 0.05. A mixed model for repeated measures was used to compare camlipixant with placebo for all cough frequency endpoints; data were analyzed on a natural log scale. Sensitivity analyses assessed the primary efficacy endpoint in the per-protocol and completers groups, through worst-case imputation, and in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the placebo-adjusted change from baseline in awake cough frequency at each dose. Prespecified analyses also investigated the interaction between baseline awake cough frequency and treatment effect.

Since the publication of the 2006 American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) cough guidelines, a variety of tools have been developed or further refined for assessing cough. The purpose of the present committee was to evaluate instruments used by investigators performing clinical research on chronic cough. The specific aims were to assess the performance of tools designed to measure cough frequency, severity, and impact in adults, adolescents, and children with chronic cough and make recommendations or suggestions related to these findings.

- **Methods**: By following the CHEST methodologic guidelines, the CHEST Expert Cough Panel based its recommendations and suggestions on a recently published comparative effectiveness review commissioned by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a corresponding summary published in CHEST, and an updated systematic review through November 2013. Recommendations or suggestions based on these data were discussed, graded, and voted on during a meeting of the Expert Cough Panel.

- **Results**: We recommend for adults, adolescents (≥ 14 years of age), and children complaining of chronic cough that validated and reliable health-related quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires be used as the measurement of choice to assess the impact of cough, such as the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and the Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire in adult and adolescent patients, and the Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire in children. We recommend acoustic cough counting to assess cough frequency but not cough severity.

### A register-based study: Cough - a frequent phenomenon in the adult population [^116MZuen]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Over a period of 10 years (2008–2017), 203,688 patients redeemed ≥ 2 relevant prescriptions within 90 days, of which 99,472 were ineligible and 104,216 were included in the prescription registry population (group 1) (Fig. 1a). During the same period, 57,754 patients were given a diagnosis of cough in the patient registry, of whom 23,494 were ineligible and 34,260 were included (group 2) (Fig. 1b). A total of 4004 (6.9%) patients were excluded due to ACE inhibitors initiated less than 12 weeks prior to the diagnosis of cough. In the combined prescription and patient registry population, 11,209 patients were registered to have both ≥ 2 redeemed prescriptions as well as the diagnosis of cough. Of these, 8024 were ineligible and 3185 were included (group 3).

All patients included are sorted in Table 1 using the definitions for UCC (no relevant co-morbidity ± 12 months from diagnosis) and RCC (cough-relevant co-morbidity related to diagnosis) and divided into three groups: prescription registry, patient registry, and the combination of the two. Of the 104,216 patients from the prescription registry group, 52,727 were classified as having UCC (primary outcome) and 51,489 were classified with RCC (secondary outcome). Of the 32,260 patients from the patient registry, 12,278 were classified as having UCC (primary outcome) and 21,982 were classified as having RCC. There were 3185 patients present in both the prescription registry and the patient registry, where 529 were classified as having UCC and 2656 as having RCC.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1131Cxg4]. Chest (2014). High credibility.

This series of guidance documents on cough, which will be published over time, is a hybrid of two processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines and (2) trustworthy consensus statements based on a robust and transparent process.

- **Methods**: The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee selected a nonconflicted Panel Chair and jointly assembled an international panel of experts in each clinical area with few, if any, conflicts of interest. PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome)-based key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for each clinical topic to inform the comprehensive literature search. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data elements were extracted into evidence tables and synthesized to provide summary statistics. These, in turn, are presented to support the evidence-based graded recommendations. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. Transparency of process was documented.

- **Results**: Evidence-based guideline recommendations and consensus-based suggestions were carefully crafted to provide direction to healthcare providers and investigators who treat and/or study patients with cough. Manuscripts and tables summarize the evidence in each clinical area supporting the recommendations and suggestions.

- **Conclusions**: The resulting guidance statements are based on a rigorous methodology and transparency of process.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111hYXCp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically in relation to combination therapy, the ATS 2020 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia. However, ICSs may be considered for patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year that required antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, or hospitalization.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112eykiT]. Chest (2006). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bronchitis, more specifically with respect to symptomatic therapy, the ACCP 2006 guidelines recommend not using β-2 agonist bronchodilators routinely to alleviate cough in most patients with acute bronchitis. Consider offering β-2 agonist bronchodilators in selected adult patients with acute bronchitis and wheezing accompanying the cough.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112BzfjR]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

A dry, persistent cough is a well-described class effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor medications. The mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough remains unresolved, but it likely involves the protussive mediators bradykinin and substance P, which are degraded by ACE. When the enzyme is inhibited, these agents accumulate in the upper respiratory tract or lung. Additionally, prostaglandins, whose production may be stimulated by bradykinin, could be involved.

- **Methods**: Data for this review were obtained from a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search, performed in May 2004, of literature published in English from 1985 to 2004. The search terms used were "angiotensin-converting enzyme", "angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors", and "cough".

- **Results**: The incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough has been reported to range from 5% to 35% among patients treated with these agents. However, a much lower incidence has been described in studies of patients presenting for the evaluation of chronic cough. The onset of ACE inhibitor-induced cough can occur within hours of the first dose or months after the initiation of therapy. Resolution typically occurs within 1 to 4 weeks after cessation of therapy, but the cough may persist for up to 3 months. The only uniformly effective treatment for ACE inhibitor-induced cough is the cessation of treatment with the offending agent. The incidence of cough associated with therapy using angiotensin-receptor blockers appears to be similar to that of the control drug. In a minority of patients, cough may persist even after stopping the medication.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: Part 1: Cough phenomenology - CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116djdQt]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to update the American College of Chest Physicians 2006 guideline on the global physiology and pathophysiology of cough. A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019 with prespecified search terms. We describe the basic phenomenology of cough patterns, behaviors, and morphological features. We update the understanding of mechanical and physiological characteristics of cough, adding a contemporary view of the types of cough and their associated behaviors and sensations. New information about acoustic characteristics is presented, and recent insights into cough triggers and the patient cough hypersensitivity phenotype are explored.

Lastly, because the clinical assessment of patients largely focuses on the duration rather than morphological features of cough, we review the morphological features of cough that can be measured in the clinic. This is the first of a two-part update to the American College of Chest Physicians 2006 cough guideline; it provides a more global consideration of cough phenomenology, beyond simply the mechanical aspects of a cough. A greater understanding of the typical features of cough, and their variations, may allow a more informed interpretation of cough measurements and their clinical relevance for patients.

### Chronic cough: State-of-the-art review [^112gKJvB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is the most common presenting complaint in adults seeking medical treatment in an ambulatory setting. Chronic cough, persisting for more than three weeks, can be associated with myriad diseases that may overlap multiple medical specialties. For this reason, a thorough assessment of the patient with chronic cough relies on a multidisciplinary approach and close cooperation between pulmonary medicine, gastroenterology, and otolaryngology. Despite this daunting task, success can be achieved in up to 90% of patients with chronic cough if a systematic and thorough approach is used. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state of the art in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough for the practicing otolaryngologist.

### The heterogeneity of chronic cough: A case for endotypes of cough hypersensitivity [^1132ANRb]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cough is a troublesome and difficult-to-treat symptom that accompanies a diverse range of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. Although considerable advances have been made over recent years in basic cough biology, this has not translated into improved clinical management. A major challenge has been in understanding the heterogeneity underlying the development and persistence of chronic cough in different patients. Evidence suggests that this heterogeneity begins with the multiple peripheral and central neural pathways capable of eliciting cough and associated respiratory behaviours. It extends to incorporate the diversity of diseases that underlie cough and the clinical phenotypic and pathological endotypic presentations that can vary substantially between individual patients with cough.

A better understanding of how these sources of heterogeneity are expressed across individual patients with chronic cough is needed to better predict the efficacy of clinical management strategies and specifically targeted therapies. This understanding will facilitate the development of more personalised clinical approaches to treat patients with chronic cough.
