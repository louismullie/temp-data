## Question

How does estradiol-only supplementation compare to bi-est?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how estradiol-only supplementation compares to compounded Bi-Est, including pharmacology, regulatory status, efficacy, safety, dosing, monitoring, counseling, and a final recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clear definitions and regulatory status of each option. Then, I should verify pharmacologic differences that could plausibly affect efficacy and safety. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for efficacy, followed by a careful assessment of safety signals, including breast, endometrial, and thrombotic risks. After that, I will examine dosing and monitoring practices, address patient counseling and misconceptions, and finally synthesize a practical recommendation tailored to clinical reality, while double-checking that each claim is supported by guidelines or primary data where possible.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and regulatory context, because conclusions hinge on them. Estradiol-only therapy refers to FDA-approved 17β-estradiol products available in standardized oral, transdermal, and other formulations, with labeled indications, quality controls, and known pharmacokinetics, whereas Bi-Est is a custom-compounded mixture most commonly described as 20% estradiol and 80% estriol, not FDA-approved, and dispensed under compounding provisions without the same premarket efficacy or safety evaluation; the FDA has specifically noted that estriol is not in any FDA-approved drug and warned against its routine compounding without an NDA, which is a crucial distinction I need to keep in mind [^111zJXXs] [^113vr1dj] [^114M88ap].

> Now, I should review pharmacology to understand whether estriol adds meaningful clinical effect. Estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent at estrogen receptors than estrone or estriol, which means the estrogenic efficacy of menopausal therapy is typically driven by estradiol's receptor activity and tissue distribution, so I need to be cautious about attributing benefit to estriol in mixed products [^111zJXXs] [^115kuLDK]. Estriol, by contrast, has low receptor affinity and undergoes rapid conjugation with limited oral bioavailability, so at usual compounded doses its contribution to systemic estrogenic effects is expected to be small, which makes me suspect that any perceived benefit of Bi-Est is likely due to the estradiol fraction rather than estriol's weak activity [^111pVQBk].

> Hold on, I should verify the regulatory and quality differences because they impact both safety and efficacy. FDA-approved estradiol products undergo rigorous manufacturing controls, dose standardization, and postmarketing surveillance, whereas compounded bioidentical hormone therapy has variable potency, purity, and stability, coupled with unsubstantiated marketing claims and an absence of robust clinical trials, all of which introduce uncertainty in exposure and outcomes that we cannot reliably quantify in routine practice [^114M88ap] [^114zRpJy] [^1135dTur].

> Next, I will examine the evidence base for efficacy, and I need to be careful not to over-extrapolate. Estradiol-based menopausal hormone therapy has extensive randomized evidence demonstrating efficacy for vasomotor symptoms and urogenital atrophy, including large trials and guideline endorsements, although much RCT data historically used conjugated estrogens; nonetheless, 17β-estradiol itself has RCT support for symptom relief, and guideline bodies recommend estrogen therapy appropriately selected by route and patient characteristics [^111Um91k] [^113vZrLa] [^112WKKiD]. Wait, let me verify whether Bi-Est has comparable evidence; the Cochrane review of bioidentical hormones primarily evaluated 17β-estradiol versus comparators and did not isolate Bi-Est, and to my knowledge there are no RCTs establishing superiority or even equivalence for Bi-Est mixtures over approved estradiol, which means claims of added benefit from estriol remain unsubstantiated [^1152kigv].

> I will now examine breast safety, and I should be precise about the nuance because this is commonly misunderstood. The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported no increased risk of invasive breast cancer with conjugated estrogens over about 7 years, which at first glance might suggest neutrality; however, observational syntheses and longer-term analyses indicate that with sufficient duration there is still a smaller increase in breast cancer risk for estrogen-alone versus a larger increase for combined estrogen-progestin, which corrects the overly simplistic interpretation that estrogen-alone is categorically risk-free for the breast over time [^113vZrLa] [^113FsXXF] [^113gYZXi]. But wait, what about Bi-Est; there are no specific breast safety data for that mixture, and since systemic exposure to estradiol primarily drives risk, an unstandardized compounded product with variable estradiol delivery offers no evidence-based breast safety advantage compared to regulated estradiol formulations, and may worsen uncertainty due to dosing variability [^114M88ap] [^1135dTur].

> Next, I should review endometrial safety because that is non-negotiable. Unopposed systemic estrogen is contraindicated in women with a uterus due to the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, so adequate progestin must be included with systemic estrogen therapy; I initially wondered whether estriol in Bi-Est might confer endometrial protection, but that is not supported by evidence, and compounded regimens sometimes use nonoral progesterone without data proving endometrial protection, which is a major safety gap [^113JwhQc] [^113vr1dj] [^113PdyLb]. Therefore, whether one uses approved estradiol or a compounded mixture, any woman with an intact uterus needs adequately dosed, evidence-based progestin for endometrial protection, and relying on estriol content is not appropriate [^113JwhQc].

> I need to check thromboembolic and cerebrovascular risks, and route matters here. Oral systemic estrogen increases VTE risk, whereas transdermal estradiol may confer a lower thrombotic risk signal and avoids first-pass hepatic effects, which can be leveraged in women with higher baseline VTE risk or cardiovascular risk profiles; this route-based mitigation strategy is supported by regulatory summaries and endocrine guidance favoring transdermal estradiol when VTE risk is a concern, though individualization remains key [^117W6zEP] [^117W6zEP]. For Bi-Est, the absence of standardized pharmacokinetics means estradiol exposure may be unpredictable, which complicates risk estimation for VTE or stroke and argues against its use when safer, quality-controlled transdermal estradiol options exist [^114M88ap].

> Let me consider dosing and monitoring approaches, and I should double-check common pitfalls. FDA-approved estradiol products offer standardized dosing with known pharmacokinetics, and serum estradiol levels correlate poorly with symptom control, so routine serum level monitoring is not recommended, which helps avoid unnecessary testing; by contrast, salivary hormone testing used to "customize" compounded regimens lacks scientific validity and should not guide dosing [^111zJXXs] [^112FedeP] [^111Xcbmc]. I should confirm that bioequivalence data exist for approved oral combinations of estradiol with progesterone for women with a uterus, providing predictable exposure and endometrial protection, which strengthens the case for approved, fixed-dose combinations when suitable [^112knr5z] [^112oDMni].

> Next, I should review patient beliefs and counseling needs, because misconceptions often drive requests for Bi-Est. Many women are unaware that compounded products are not FDA-approved and often believe these mixtures are safer or more natural, a perception amplified by marketing; proactive counseling should clarify the lack of superiority data, the potential for variable content, and the equivalence of risk to conventional therapy when systemic estradiol exposure is similar [^114b5NUq] [^112MBxyh] [^112hZnEa]. Hold on, I should verify that professional societies align with this message; ACOG's 2023 Clinical Consensus explicitly recommends FDA-approved therapies over compounded bioidentical regimens for menopausal symptom management, reinforcing this counseling approach [^114M88ap].

> Let me synthesize the comparative assessment to ensure internal consistency. The therapeutic effect in Bi-Est is overwhelmingly determined by the estradiol fraction, while the estriol fraction adds little demonstrable efficacy and may increase complexity without proven benefit; combined with quality and consistency concerns inherent to compounding, Bi-Est does not offer a clinical advantage over FDA-approved estradiol products and may increase risk uncertainty [^111pVQBk] [^114M88ap]. Therefore, on balance of evidence and regulation, estradiol-only therapy using FDA-approved formulations is favored for efficacy, predictability, and safety oversight, assuming appropriate progestin use in women with a uterus and individualized route selection [^112WKKiD] [^115Dr2ZD].

> Finally, I will translate this into a practical clinical recommendation and sanity-check each element. First-line therapy for bothersome vasomotor or genitourinary symptoms should be an FDA-approved estradiol product, with route tailored to risk profile, often favoring transdermal in women with thrombotic or cardiometabolic concerns; in women with a uterus, co-prescribe an evidence-based progestin or consider an approved estradiol–progesterone combination capsule to ensure endometrial protection, and avoid compounded Bi-Est unless there is a compelling, guideline-concordant justification such as a documented excipient allergy or unavailable dose form that cannot be met by approved options [^117W6zEP] [^112EVYoW] [^114M88ap]. I need to ensure counseling addresses expectations, duration-dependent breast risk nuances, endometrial protection requirements, and the lack of validated salivary testing, while using the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration and reassessing periodically in alignment with guideline recommendations [^1148X84h] [^113JwhQc] [^111Xcbmc] [^115Dr2ZD].

Estradiol-only therapy is appropriate for **women without a uterus** and the most effective option for vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms [^112WKKiD], with a lower breast cancer risk than combined therapy [^113vZrLa] [^1148X84h]. Bi-Est (estradiol plus estriol) **is not FDA-approved** [^114M88ap] [^113vr1dj], lacks robust evidence of added benefit [^114zRpJy], and may increase endometrial cancer risk if used without adequate progestogen in women with a uterus [^113JwhQc]. In women with a uterus, estradiol must be paired with a progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia [^113JwhQc]; estriol does not provide sufficient protection [^114zRpJy] [^113vr1dj]. Estradiol-only therapy is preferred for symptom control and safety, while **Bi-Est should be avoided** due to insufficient evidence and regulatory concerns [^114M88ap] [^111DnFRy].

## Pharmacological differences

### Estradiol-only therapy

- **Potency and receptor affinity**: Estradiol is the most potent endogenous estrogen, with high affinity for estrogen receptors, providing effective symptom relief [^111zJXXs] [^112WKKiD].

- **Metabolism**: Estradiol is metabolized to estrone and estriol, but these metabolites have significantly lower estrogenic activity [^111zJXXs].

- **Clinical use**: Estradiol-only therapy is indicated for women without a uterus, as it does not require progestogen for endometrial protection [^113JwhQc].

---

### Bi-Est therapy

Composition typically includes **80% estriol and 20% estradiol**; estriol is a weaker estrogen with lower receptor affinity and rapid metabolism, resulting in limited bioavailability [^111pVQBk]. The **clinical rationale** cited by proponents is that estriol provides additional benefits, such as reduced breast cancer risk and an improved safety profile; however, these claims lack robust scientific evidence [^114zRpJy] [^114M88ap].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Symptom relief

Estradiol-only therapy effectively alleviates **vasomotor symptoms** [^114FhMrT] and vaginal atrophy [^115Dr2ZD] and helps prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [^112WKKiD]. In contrast, **Bi-Est therapy** has limited evidence of benefit; any symptom relief is primarily attributable to the estradiol component, as estriol's contribution is minimal due to its weak estrogenic activity [^111pVQBk] [^114zRpJy].

---

### Endometrial protection

In women with a uterus, **estradiol-only therapy** requires a progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer [^113JwhQc]. Similarly, **Bi-Est therapy** requires a progestogen because estriol does not provide adequate endometrial protection [^113JwhQc] [^114M88ap].

---

## Safety profiles

| **Attribute** | **Estradiol-only therapy** | **Bi-est therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Breast cancer risk | The WHI estrogen-alone trial demonstrated no significant increase in breast cancer risk with estrogen-alone therapy [^113vZrLa] [^1148X84h] | There is no robust evidence to suggest that Bi-Est therapy reduces breast cancer risk compared to estradiol-only therapy. The addition of estriol does not confer any proven protective effect [^114zRpJy] [^114M88ap] |
| Cardiovascular risk | Estradiol-only therapy has been associated with a neutral or slightly favorable cardiovascular risk profile, particularly when initiated in younger postmenopausal women [^1119rAyw] | There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of Bi-Est therapy. The addition of estriol does not have established cardiovascular benefits |
| Endometrial cancer risk | Requires progestogen addition in women with a uterus to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer [^113JwhQc] | Similarly, Bi-Est therapy requires progestogen addition, as estriol does not provide adequate endometrial protection [^113JwhQc] |

---

## Regulatory status and clinical guidelines

Estradiol-only therapy is **FDA-approved** and recommended for menopausal symptom management [^112WKKiD], whereas Bi-Est therapy is **not FDA-approved** [^114M88ap] and is not routinely recommended due to insufficient evidence regarding its safety and efficacy [^114zRpJy] [^113vr1dj].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Women without a uterus**: Estradiol-only therapy is appropriate and effective [^112WKKiD].

- **Women with a uterus**: Both estradiol-only and Bi-Est therapies require progestogen addition for endometrial protection [^113JwhQc].

- **Patient preferences**: Some patients may prefer Bi-Est therapy due to perceived naturalness or safety. However, clinicians should educate patients about the lack of evidence supporting these claims [^114M88ap] [^114zRpJy].

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Estradiol-only therapy** | **Bi-est therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Composition | Estradiol only | Estradiol + Estriol |
| FDA approval | Yes | No [^114M88ap] |
| Clinical efficacy | Proven effective [^112WKKiD] | Limited evidence |
| Breast cancer risk | No significant increase | Insufficient evidence |
| Cardiovascular risk | Neutral or favorable | Insufficient evidence |
| Endometrial protection | Requires progestogen | Requires progestogen |
| Regulatory status | Approved | Not approved |
| Clinical guidelines | Recommended [^112WKKiD] | Not recommended [^114M88ap] |

---

Estradiol-only therapy is **FDA-approved and effective** for menopausal symptom management [^112WKKiD], whereas Bi-Est therapy **lacks robust evidence** and regulatory approval [^114M88ap]. In women with a uterus, both require a progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer [^113JwhQc].

### Managing menopause [^112WKKiD]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, particularly in the context of managing vasomotor symptoms, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend initiating hormone therapy. Estrogen alone or combined with a progestin is advised as the most effective therapy for menopausal symptoms.

### Estrace [^113vZrLa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80].

Consistent with the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller but still increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to over 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-alone therapies.

- **Breast cancer risk**: Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to the risk with estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

### Combined oral hormone replacement therapy formulations [^11162wAt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Today, clinicians are challenged to address a woman's contraceptive needs during her reproductive and perimenopausal years and then provide her with a menopausal therapeutic option. This option should offer optimal symptom relief, noncontraceptive health benefits, and a good tolerability profile. The benefits of hormone replacement therapy include control of vasomotor symptoms, reduction of vulvovaginal atrophy, and protection against osteoporosis. Research also points to emerging hormone replacement therapy benefits, such as protection against cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.

One of the primary considerations in the transition from oral contraceptive use to hormone replacement therapy is the tolerability profile of the progestin component of the hormone replacement therapy. Because progestin-related side effects are among the main reasons for discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy, the selection of a formulation that contains the same well-tolerated progestin as in the woman's oral contraceptive can be particularly important to the successful use of hormone replacement therapy.

Currently, in the United States, continuous combined hormone replacement therapy is available in three formulations and one continuous estrogen/intermittent progestin formulation. Although direct comparative trials are lacking, available data suggest that the new continuous 17beta-estradiol/intermittent norgestimate hormone replacement therapy formulation may offer advantages over regimens that contain older progestins with metabolic disadvantages.

### Estradiol [^111zJXXs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. At the time of writing, two estrogen receptors have been identified; these vary in proportion from tissue to tissue. Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated concentrations of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to the estradiol transdermal system nor her risk for adverse outcomes.

### Depo-estradiol [^113FsXXF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg) alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80).

Consistent with the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller, but still increased risk, for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use.

However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider.

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^112rh8Ne]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative, a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies that have explored different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins was conducted to assess the applicability of the Women's Health Initiative results to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies published over the last 15 years (1987–2002), and to meta-analyses and reviews that may have included literature before 1987.

The increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer identified in the Women's Health Initiative trial have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies containing various estrogen and progestin products. The beneficial effects noted in the Women's Health Initiative, with respect to reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials using different estrogen/progestin combinations. However, observational trials that used a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products, and randomized clinical studies evaluating bone mineral density (an excellent predictor of fracture risk) with different estrogen/hormone replacement therapy regimens, suggest that results would be similar to those found in the Women's Health Initiative.

### Hormone-replacement therapy: Current thinking [^111ZZbUb]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studying mostly women many years after the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT.

Subsequent reanalyses of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data, and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life. In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk-benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women (< 60 years of age) other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: Clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

An estimated one-third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use the results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in four clinical situations.

Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

### Prempro [^115ff5dP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

- **Observational studies**: Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. The risk increased with the duration of use and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment. Only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

- **Abnormal mammograms**: The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

- **Results**:

Response rates and demographic information - The Harris survey invited 10,781 women aged 45 to 60 years to participate in an online survey via email between June 24 and July 10, 2013. A total of 1,099 women responded, resulting in a participation rate of 10%. Of these respondents, 855 women who had experienced or were experiencing menopausal symptoms were eligible, resulting in a qualification rate of 78%. The cooperation rate was 94%, with 801 of the 855 eligible women completing the survey.

- **Figure 1**: Survey sample and disposition for the Harris and Rose surveys.

- An invitation to take the Rose survey was emailed to 90,210 individuals during a three-week period in April 2014. A total of 17,897 invitees responded, yielding a participation rate of 20%. Seventy-two respondents were men and were excluded. Screening of the remaining 17,825 Rose respondents identified 2,369 women aged 40 years or older who were currently using or had previously used hormone therapy (HT) and were eligible to complete the survey. This resulted in a qualification rate of 13%. The cooperation rate was 86%, with 2,044 of the 2,369 eligible women completing the survey.

- Subset analysis in the Rose survey included 855 respondents aged 50 to 64 years, of whom 839 completed the survey and 714 were asked about compounded hormone therapy (CHT) use. The cooperation rates among eligible women were very high, with 94% for the Harris survey and 86% for the Rose survey. The number of drop-offs in each survey was too low to draw meaningful conclusions about differences between eligible completers and non-completers.

Most completers in the Harris and Rose surveys were white and had some postsecondary education or vocational training.

### ACOG committee opinion. Risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^114km4ep]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to critically evaluate the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestins to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proven.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and, potentially, cardiovascular disease. Postmenopausal women should be apprised of the understanding of the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits against the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Comparative estrogen exposure from compounded transdermal estradiol creams and Food and Drug Administration-approved transdermal estradiol gels and patches [^116zSM51]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

Estrogen therapy (ET) is considered the most effective treatment option for both vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause. In the wake of the Women's Health Initiative study, the use of ET initially decreased and then began to transition from oral to transdermal formulations, presumably because of a hypothesized lower risk of adverse outcomes. However, the risk difference between formulations has yet to be fully elucidated. Much of the risk (and benefit) associated with the use of ET is thought to be related to the amount and duration of estrogen exposure. Therefore, it may be prudent to focus on optimizing the amount of estrogen exposure to both achieve treatment goals and minimize risk. Quantifying these risks and risk reductions according to dose and formulation has not been thoroughly explored, potentially because no convenient tool exists to facilitate the exploration. While the amount of estrogen exposure resulting from Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved transdermal estrogen formulations is somewhat understood, almost nothing is known about estrogen exposure resulting from the use of compounded transdermal estrogen formulations.

Compounded transdermal estrogen formulations, generally included under the umbrella of compounded bioidentical hormones, are not approved by the FDA. Many organizations recommend against their use. A documented allergy to an active pharmaceutical ingredient or excipient or a clinical need for a dose unavailable in an FDA-approved formulation is the only widely accepted justification for their use.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Dr2ZD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for menopause, specifically concerning the management of vulvovaginal atrophy, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend offering low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy to patients without a history of hormone/estrogen-dependent cancers who are seeking relief from symptoms of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause. This is particularly advised for those experiencing symptoms such as vulvovaginal atrophy that persist despite the use of vaginal lubricants and moisturizers.

### Committee opinion: Number 262, December 2001. Risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^113GuvNb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to critically evaluate the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestin to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proven. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy. It also emphasizes weighing the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits against the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy [^1135dTur]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

Although improvement in long-term health is no longer an indication for menopausal hormone therapy, evidence supporting fewer adverse events in younger women, combined with its high overall effectiveness, has reinforced its usefulness for short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms. Menopausal therapy has been provided not only by commercially available products but also by compounding, or creation of an individualized preparation in response to a health care provider's prescription to create a medication tailored to the specialized needs of an individual patient.

The findings from the Women's Health Initiative, coupled with an increase in direct-to-consumer marketing and media promotion of compounded bioidentical hormonal preparations as safe and effective alternatives to conventional menopausal hormone therapy, have led to a recent increase in the popularity of compounded bioidentical hormones as well as an increase in questions about the use of these preparations. Not only is evidence lacking to support the superiority claims of compounded bioidentical hormones over conventional menopausal hormone therapy, but these claims also pose the additional risks of variable purity and potency and lack efficacy and safety data.

The Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine provide an overview of the major issues of concern surrounding compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy and offer recommendations for patient counseling.

### Sex and gender differences in clinical pharmacology: Implications for transgender medicine [^1111bth6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Estrogen treatment: Clinicians prescribe one of several 17β-estradiol preparations for transgender adults undergoing estrogen treatment, as seen in Table 2. The Endocrine Society recommends avoiding synthetic or conjugated equine estrogens due to the risk of venous thromboembolism and a lack of clinically available assays for these preparations. Before initiating hormone therapy, transgender adults generally have serum sex hormone concentrations within cisgender male laboratory reference ranges (total testosterone: 249–836 ng/dL; estradiol: 11–43 pg/mL), as shown in Table 3. In a prospective clinical cohort of transgender women taking at least 12 months of estrogen treatment in the United States (n = 93), estradiol reference ranges were numerically higher than reference limits for cisgender women (20.7–505.0 vs. 12–233 pg/mL, respectively). Clinicians may adjust estrogen dosing to achieve desired therapeutic effects during the first year of treatment or as needed thereafter.

- **Drugs that suppress androgen synthesis and activity**: During estrogen treatment, clinicians may prescribe adjunctive medications to suppress endogenous androgen activity, as referenced in Table 2. Availability of these agents differs by country, with clinicians currently prescribing cyproterone acetate in Europe, Canada, and Australia; spironolactone in the United States and Australia; or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists in the United Kingdom. Bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist, is available in certain settings. However, limited data from clinics in Sweden and Norway suggest it is used less frequently than other options.

### Risks and effectiveness of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: a case series [^117BYWNV]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

After the publication of the Women's Health Initiative, attitudes towards the management of menopausal symptoms changed dramatically. One alternative that has received much media attention is the use of bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT). The media and celebrity endorsements have promoted a number of misconceptions about the risks and benefits associated with the various forms of BHT. This article reviews the available evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of BHT in comparison to conventional hormone therapy.

We also review several cases seen in our midlife women's referral clinics, demonstrating concerns about the safety and efficacy of BHT, including unexplained endometrial cancer in otherwise healthy BHT users. Due to the lack of sufficient data to support the efficacy or safety of BHT, we recommend the use of United States Food and Drug Administration-approved regimens in the management of menopausal symptoms.

### Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: Identifying use trends and knowledge gaps among US women [^114b5NUq]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Knowledge of CHT: All Harris completers (N = 801) were asked, "Do you believe that bioidentical hormone therapies compounded at a specialty pharmacy are FDA-approved?" Only 14% correctly answered "no", whereas 10% answered "yes", and 76% stated that they were not sure. When Rose completers (N = 2,044) were asked whether their HT had been personalized or compounded for them, 27% of the women stated that they did not know.

### Bioidentical hormones for women with vasomotor symptoms [^1152kigv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Various hormone therapies (HT) are available to treat menopausal vasomotor symptoms. Bioidentical hormones are chemically identical to those produced by the human body, and several types are well-tested and available by prescription. Many women have opted for bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) on the assumption that it is safer than other forms of HT. We evaluated the evidence.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of bioidentical hormones compared to placebo or non-bioidentical hormones for the relief of vasomotor symptoms.

- **Search methods**: In July 2015, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS), registers of ongoing trials, and the reference lists of articles retrieved.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) versus placebo or non-bioidentical hormones.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome was vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats). We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria (GRADE).

- **Main results**: We included 23 RCTs (5779 participants). Most studies (20/23) included only women with moderate to severe hot flushes. All studies compared unopposed 17 beta-estradiol (beta-estradiol) versus placebo or conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). None of the studies reported night sweats as a separate endpoint.

### Changes in U.S. prescribing patterns of menopausal hormone therapy, 2001–2003 [^116Mvrqw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

In 2002, the combination estrogen-progestin hormone therapy (HT) treatment arm of the Women's Health Initiative was terminated early because cardiovascular and cancer risks were identified, while the estrogen-only therapy (ET) arm of this trial continued. We investigated hormone therapy prescription practice changes between 2001 and 2003 to explore the effects of the clinical trial results.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 2001 through 2003. These nationally representative surveys sample medical encounters in nonfederally employed physician's offices and outpatient departments of nonfederal short-stay and general hospitals. The proportion and rate of visits with ET and HT prescriptions were calculated. Logistic regression was used to estimate change over time, accounting for patient and provider characteristics.

- **Results**: Between 2001 and 2003, the number of visits with menopausal hormone prescriptions fell from 26.5 million to 16.9 million. Almost three-quarters of hormone visits were for ET prescriptions. The decrease in the rate of visits was slightly larger for HT prescription visits (44%) than ET prescription visits (35%). The rate of decline was highest among women 50 years of age and over. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in the decline by hormone type.

- **Conclusion**: These nationally representative data indicate substantial declines in menopausal hormone prescriptions coinciding with clinical trial results.

### Update on medical and regulatory issues pertaining to compounded and FDA-approved drugs, including hormone therapy [^113vr1dj]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Various compounded bioidentical hormone therapy (CBHT) formulations containing estrogens, progesterone, or testosterone are marketed to women with menopausal symptoms in nonsterile (e.g. lotions, creams, capsules, lozenges, transdermal patches, nasal or oral products, and suppositories) and sterile (e.g. injections and subdermal pellets) preparations. Some CBHT medications fall into product categories the FDA considers "not appropriate for compounding under any circumstances", including extended-release, transdermal, and liposomal drugs.

The FDA has never approved testosterone for postmenopausal women, and its use in CBHT regimens is controversial. Estriol is found in many CBHT products, including Bi-Est (20% estradiol and 80% estriol) and Tri-Est (10% estradiol, 10% estrone, and 80% estriol). Although an estriol vaginal suppository is approved to treat vaginal atrophy in some countries, estriol is not in any FDA-approved drug for human use, and the FDA has warned compounders not to use estriol without filing a New Drug Application (NDA). However, a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monograph exists for estriol, and §503A permits compounders to use active ingredients that have a USP monograph.

Randomized controlled trials have proven that progesterone inhibits estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium. Administering progesterone orally or transdermally at a high enough dose to ensure sufficient bioavailability is challenging. Many CBHT regimens incorporate nonoral progesterone, yet no adequate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established any delivery method of progesterone besides oral as effective or capable of protecting the endometrium from estrogen.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and long-term all-cause and cause-specific mortality: The Women's Health Initiative randomized trials [^111dq4zs]. JAMA (2017). Low credibility.

Health outcomes from the Women's Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin and Estrogen-Alone Trials have been reported; however, previous publications have generally not focused on all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

- **Objective**: To examine total and cause-specific cumulative mortality, including during the intervention and extended postintervention follow-up, of the two Women's Health Initiative hormone therapy trials.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Observational follow-up of US multiethnic postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years enrolled in two randomized clinical trials between 1993 and 1998, followed up through December 31, 2014.

- **Interventions**: Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, 0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 2.5 mg/d) (n = 8506) versus placebo (n = 8102) for a median of 5.6 years, or CEE alone (n = 5310) versus placebo (n = 5429) for a median of 7.2 years.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: All-cause mortality (primary outcome) and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer mortality, and other major causes of mortality) in the two trials pooled and in each trial individually, with prespecified analyses by 10-year age group based on age at time of randomization.

- **Results**: Among 27,347 women who were randomized (baseline mean [SD] age, 63.4 [7.2] years; 80.6% white), mortality follow-up was available for more than 98%. During the cumulative 18-year follow-up, 7489 deaths occurred (1088 deaths during the intervention phase and 6401 deaths during postintervention follow-up). All-cause mortality was 27.1% in the hormone therapy group vs. 27.6% in the placebo group.

### Effects of progestins in different hormone replacement therapy formulations on estrogen-induced lipid changes in postmenopausal women [^116UWnhs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), used by many women to relieve the symptoms of menopause and for the prevention of osteoporosis, is available in an increasing number of formulations. Options include various combinations of estrogen and progestin, as well as different routes of administration. For women with a uterus, who require a progestin, a convenient and commonly used option is combining the estrogen and progestin in a single pill. Such formulations have the lipid-modifying effects of estrogen, altered by the specific type and dose of progestin used. The cardioprotective increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with exogenous estrogen may be blunted or even reversed with certain HRT regimens. In addition, some progestins minimize the increase in triglycerides that occurs with exogenous estrogen, whereas others do not. Because of the importance of lipid markers as risk factors for cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women, these lipid effects should be carefully considered when selecting an HRT regimen.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^112EVYoW]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a single-capsule, bioidentical 17β-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) hormone therapy on mammograms and breasts in postmenopausal women after 1 year of use.

- **Methods**: In the 12-month, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter REPLENISH trial, postmenopausal women (ages 40–65) with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and a uterus were randomized to four active daily dose groups of E2/P4 (TX-001HR) or a placebo group. Mammograms were performed and read locally at screening (or within six months prior to the first dose) and at the study end using BI-RADS classification. The incidence of abnormal mammograms and breast adverse events was evaluated.

- **Results**: All but eight (0.4%) mammograms at screening were normal (BI-RADS 1 or 2). At 1 year, 39 (2.9%) of the 1,340 study-end mammograms were abnormal (BI-RADS 3 or 4); incidence was 1.7% to 3.7% with active doses and 3.1% with placebo. Breast cancer incidence was 0.36% with active doses and 0% with placebo. Breast tenderness was reported at frequencies of 2.4% to 10.8% with active doses versus 0.7% with placebo, leading to eight study discontinuations (1.6% of discontinuations in active groups).

In this phase 3 trial of a combined E2/P4, results of secondary outcomes suggest that E2/P4 may not be associated with an increased risk of abnormal mammograms compared to placebo, and the incidence of breast tenderness was relatively low compared to most reports in other studies using hormone therapy.

### Counseling postmenopausal women about bioidentical hormones: Ten discussion points for practicing physicians [^112hZnEa]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Bioidentical hormones are compounds that have exactly the same chemical and molecular structure as endogenous human hormones. In contrast, nonbioidentical, or synthetic, hormones are structurally dissimilar from endogenous hormones. Although available for years, bioidentical compounded hormone therapy (BCHT) has gained popularity in the United States only recently. This popularity has paralleled women's rising fears of conventional hormone therapy, especially since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials. Although BCHT offers advantages, it is not the panacea of hormone therapy. The claims that BCHT lowers the risk of breast cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke, or thromboembolism are not supported by scientific research. The goal of this review is to present an overview of the available research evidence on BCHT, dispel myths about the use of compounded hormones, and provide helpful tips to answer commonly asked questions about BCHT.

### Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: Identifying use trends and knowledge gaps among US women [^113bCN3J]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Most Harris completers (63%) recalled consulting their physician about their menopausal symptoms and treatment options. Two-thirds of women who spoke with a physician also discussed the issues with a family member or friend. Another 14% of completers stated that they had only talked to a family member or friend, and 23% never spoke with anyone about the topics.

Before starting hormone therapy (HT), only 22% of Rose completers considered themselves very familiar or extremely familiar with HT. Another 35% of Rose completers stated that they were somewhat familiar with HT, and the rest were not very familiar (26%) or not at all familiar (18%) with HT. Among women who were somewhat familiar to extremely familiar with HT before consulting a physician (n = 1,147), 42% stated that their information came from friends and family. Other sources of information included brochures at the physician's office (28%), the internet (14%), television (11%), and print publications (6%). Almost one quarter (21%) were not sure where they had obtained their information.

### Breast cancer after use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone: Analyses of data from 2 Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials [^1148X84h]. JAMA Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) continues in clinical practice; however, reports are conflicting concerning the longer-term breast cancer effects of relatively short-term use. This study aims to report the longer-term influence of menopausal HT on breast cancer incidence in the two Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials.

A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 U.S. centers from 1993 to 1998 and followed up for a median of 13 years through September 2010.

- **Interventions**: A total of 16,608 women with a uterus were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d [estrogen]) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d [progestin]) (E+P) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 5.6 years. Additionally, 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens alone (0.625 mg/d) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

The main outcomes and measures included time-specific invasive breast cancer incidence rates and exploratory analyses of breast cancer characteristics by intervention and postintervention phases in the two HT trials.

In the E+P trial, hazard ratios (HRs) for the influence of combined HT on breast cancer were lower than 1 for two years (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.08) and steadily increased throughout the intervention phase, becoming significantly increased for the entire intervention phase (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). In the early postintervention phase (within 2.75 years from intervention), there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer incidence.

### Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: Scientific review [^111BBH5m]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Although postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is widely used in the United States, new evidence about its benefits and harms requires reconsideration of its use for the primary prevention of chronic conditions.

- **Objective**: To assess the benefits and harms of HRT for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, thromboembolism, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia, and cholecystitis by reviewing the literature, conducting meta-analyses, and calculating outcome rates.

- **Data sources**: All relevant English-language studies were identified in MEDLINE (1966–2001), HealthSTAR (1975–2001), Cochrane Library databases, and reference lists of key articles. Recent results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) are included for reported outcomes.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: Published studies of HRT were used if they contained a comparison group of HRT nonusers and reported data relating to HRT use and clinical outcomes of interest. Studies were excluded if the population was selected according to prior events or the presence of conditions associated with higher risks for targeted outcomes.

- **Data synthesis**: Meta-analyses of observational studies indicated summary relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and mortality that were significantly reduced among HRT users only, although the risk for incidence was not reduced when only studies that controlled for socioeconomic status were included. The WHI reported increased CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; 95% confidence interv [missing text]

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^116woaHz]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

The FDA guidance for establishing the bioequivalence of oral estradiol calls for providing pharmacokinetic parameters for baseline-adjusted serum levels of total estrone, unconjugated estradiol, and unconjugated estrone. Total estrone consists of estrone, estrone sulfates, and estrone glucuronides. After estradiol is orally ingested, it is rapidly converted into estrone (primarily estrone sulfate) via first-pass metabolism. This reservoir of circulating estrone continuously undergoes reconversion into estradiol. Thus, total estrone levels are an important measure of estradiol bioavailability. In evaluating the bioequivalence of oral progesterone, the FDA requires pharmacokinetic parameters for baseline-adjusted serum levels of progesterone.

In this study, the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were C max, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) for progesterone, unconjugated estradiol, and total and unconjugated estrone in plasma after treatment with TX-001HR versus the reference products. Secondary endpoints were t max, K el, t 1/2, and AUC % extrap obs. Pharmacokinetic parameters for the specified analytes were determined for each participant during each period by noncompartmental analyses using baseline-adjusted concentrations.

- **The SABE method**: The SABE method for highly variable drugs was used to compare TX-001HR with the coadministered reference products in cases where the within-subject coefficient of variation for the reference product was 30% or more. A pharmacokinetic endpoint for an analyte was identified as bioequivalent when the 95% upper confidence bound on linear…

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^1164ZMnN]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Healthy postmenopausal women (N = 66) were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment sequences described in the methods. The women had a mean (SD) age of 49.5 (5.6) years, ranging from 40 to 64 years, and a mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) of 24.8 (3.1) kg/m², with a range of 18.7 to 29.9 kg/m². The mean (SD) height was 150.6 (5.4) cm, with a range from 138.0 to 162.0 cm, and the mean (SD) weight was 56.1 (7.0) kg, ranging from 42.0 to 75.0 kg.

- **Participant disposition and baseline characteristics**: 94% of participants (62 of 66) completed all three study periods. Four women did not report to the facility for Period II and/or Period III. Analyses for total estrone were conducted using data for 61 participants. Data for one woman who had a predose estrone level higher than 5% of C max were excluded, in keeping with FDA guidance for bioequivalence studies.

### Committee opinion no. 698: Hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency [^112FedeP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for amenorrhea, specifically in the context of managing primary ovarian insufficiency, the ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend achieving replacement levels of estrogen as a first-line approach for hormone therapy, either orally or transdermally. It is advised not to obtain serum estradiol level testing to monitor the effects of treatment.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^112knr5z]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

This study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of a capsule combining 17β-estradiol and progesterone in a non–peanut oil–containing formulation with those of widely used and approved separate formulations of estradiol and progesterone coadministered to healthy postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, three-period, three-sequence, cross-over, partial-replicate, reference-scaled study. Postmenopausal women (aged 40–65 years) were randomly assigned to one of three dosing sequences of test and reference products (TRR, RTR, or RRT, where T is the test drug and R is the coadministered reference product), with each of the three periods separated by a 14-day washout. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were C max, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) for the test and reference products, assessed for bioequivalence using the scaled average bioequivalence or unscaled average bioequivalence method. Safety was assessed by clinical observation, participant-reported adverse events, and laboratory data, including blood levels of hormones.

- **Results**: Sixty-six women were randomly assigned, and 62 women (94.0%) completed all three study periods. All AUC and C max parameters met bioequivalence criteria for all analytes (estradiol, progesterone, and estrone), except C max for total estrone. The extent of estradiol and progesterone absorption was similar between the test product and the reference products. Four adverse events — all considered mild and unrelated to the study drugs — were reported.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial [^111Um91k]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.

- **Design**: The estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative was a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) involving 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline. They were recruited by 40 US clinical centers between 1993–1998.

- **Interventions**: Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in one tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).

- **Main outcomes measures**: The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD), including nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the two primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

On May 31, 2002, following a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin versus placebo. This decision was made because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002.

### Approach to the patient: Management of pituitary hormone replacement through transition [^117W6zEP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

In girls, estrogens can be given orally or transdermally. The transdermal route is more physiological in the form of 17β-estradiol, which avoids first-pass liver metabolism. Additionally, it has fewer risks and may be the safest option for patients with a history of DVT. There is evidence to suggest that it leads to better outcomes for bone density and uterine development. Concentrations of genotoxic estrogens are also lower with this route, and there is no evidence to suggest an increase in breast cancer for young women on estrogen replacement. When puberty is being induced, the dosage is gradually increased over a period of 24 months. Monitoring growth, secondary sexual characteristics, uterine volume, and blood pressure is recommended. Progestogen is added once breakthrough bleeding occurs.

- **Estro-progestinic replacement options**: There are different ways of taking estro-progestinic replacement after puberty has been induced, either with combined cyclical hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens or combined oral contraceptive pill preparations. Transdermal HRT should be considered first because it is more physiological with 17β-estradiol. Oral HRT can be considered first because it can be cyclical without a 1-week break each month, and has lower doses of the synthetic ethinylestradiol. Combined oral contraceptive pills are not cyclical and contain higher doses of ethinylestradiol and progestin. However, the oral contraceptive pill is a contraceptive, and some young women may prefer this, as it can also be given continuously. It is, therefore, important to offer an individualized approach.

### Committee opinion no. 698: Hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency [^11456jZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for primary ovarian insufficiency, specifically with respect to hormone therapy, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend achieving replacement levels of estrogen as a first-line approach for hormone therapy, either orally or transdermally. It is advised not to obtain serum estradiol level testing to monitor the effects of treatment.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk [^114ceTJr]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Estrogen-based therapies have shown superior antidepressant effects compared to placebo when administered to perimenopausal women. The antidepressant effects of estrogen were observed even in the absence of concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Older, postmenopausal women, however, showed little or no response to estrogen therapy for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Taken together, these observations suggest that estrogen's antidepressant effect may have a 'critical window' or optimal timing, possibly during the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years. Moreover, the potential benefits of E2 therapy for the improvement of mood symptoms may occur independent from changes or improvement of vasomotor symptoms.

As symptomatic midlife women may endorse a wide variety of physical and emotional complaints, physicians and other health professionals have the challenging task of disentangling the biological and psychosocial aspects that could be primarily attributed to (a) the aging process per se, (b) the menopausal transition, or (c) the emergence of new onset depression.

### Progression of metabolic syndrome severity during the menopausal transition [^116Nau9g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The proportion of participants taking estrogen replacement therapy after menopause was high in this study, with higher use among white women (13.8%) compared to black women (6.6%), raising the potential that this discrepancy in hormone replacement could account for the racial differences in metabolic syndrome (MetS) progression among postmenopausal women in the study. Oral administration of estrogen (but not transdermal or vaginal) suppresses fat oxidation, contributing to increased body fat, while administration of transdermal estrogen did not change levels of body fat over time. Although we lacked data regarding the route of estrogen administration during the study, by visit 4 of ARIC, completed in 1998, over 75% of estrogen replacement was oral. Topical or vaginal estrogen replacement, which is more common currently, was found to improve lean body mass without affecting fat mass. We didn't note differences in the rate of change in MetS severity by estrogen use, although we lacked data regarding dose and adherence to estrogen use, which may have further influenced any effect. Overall, however, hormone replacement did not appear to explain the racial differences in MetS severity.

The mechanisms behind the slower rate of progression of MetS severity after menopause are unclear but could be related to changes in estrogen levels and the related action of adipocytes and hepatic function. Tepper et al. demonstrated that while there is an overall decline in estradiol levels between 6 years before and 1 year after the final menstrual period (when estradiol levels stabilize), the study suggested other potential factors contributing to this phenomenon.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^115fY4AG]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Although some individuals have a legitimate need for compounded hormone therapy (HT), the use of compounded HT greatly exceeds the scope of need. Determining the full extent to which these unregulated, largely untested compounded HT combinations are being used in the United States is difficult because sales are not tracked and some may be obtained without a prescription. However, compounded hormones are believed to make up a large and growing share of estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for menopausal symptoms, suggesting an unmet need.

An investigational oral drug, TX-001HR, which combines 2 mg of solubilized 17β-estradiol with 200 mg of progesterone in a gelatin capsule, has been developed by TherapeuticsMD Inc, Boca Raton, FL. The estradiol and progesterone ingredients used in the combination are plant-derived and chemically identical to human hormones of ovarian origin. Consistent with FDA guidelines that call for comparing the bioequivalence of any new product with the market standard, a randomized, open-label, three-period, three-sequence, two-treatment, partial-replicate, cross-over study was conducted to characterize the drug's pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in healthy postmenopausal women. The objective was to show that the bioavailability of the estradiol and progesterone compounds used in TX-001HR was equivalent to the bioavailability of the same doses of commercially available, separate formulations of oral estradiol and progesterone coadministered under fed conditions.

If the associations are largely causal, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use in Western countries has already caused about 1 million breast cancers, out of a total of about 20 million since 1990. For women of average weight in Western countries, five years of using estrogen plus daily progestogen MHT, starting at age 50, would increase 20-year breast cancer risks at ages 50–69 from 6.3% to 8.3%, an absolute increase of 2.0 per 100 women (one in every 50 users). Similarly, five years of using estrogen plus intermittent progestogen MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6.3% to 7.7%, an absolute increase of 1.4 per 100 women (one in 70 users). Finally, five years of using estrogen-only MHT would increase the 20-year risk from 6.3% to 6.8%, an absolute increase of 0.5 per 100 women (one in 200 users). This excess would be greater in lean women, but in obese women, estrogen-only MHT is associated with little excess risk. For 10 years of use, the 20-year increases in incidence would be about twice as great as for five years of use.

Most individual studies were too small to reliably assess the long-term breast cancer risk associated with just a few years of MHT use. Furthermore, some epidemiological evidence remains unpublished, and studies completed before the 2000s necessarily had limited information about the long-term effects of past use. Reliable assessment of the association between breast cancer risk and past use of MHT requires a review of the totality of worldwide evidence, with careful control of potential sources of appreciable bias and confounders.

### Compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: New recommendations from the 2020 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [^111DnFRy]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

Bioidentical hormones have the exact same chemical and molecular structure as hormones produced in the human body. These hormones are available as FDA-approved hormone formulations. However, nonapproved custom-compounded preparations are also marketed as bioidentical, despite uncertain content. The widespread use of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy is concerning, given the lack of evidence supporting its safety and efficacy. This Practice Pearl highlights the 2020 recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine regarding the use of compounded bioidentical hormones.

### Delestrogen [^115kuLDK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. At the time of writing, two estrogen receptors have been identified; these vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

- **Absorption**: Estrogens used in therapy are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is usually sufficient to cause systemic effects. When conjugated with aryl, absorption…

### Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy: ACOG clinical consensus no. 6 [^114M88ap]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Many compounding pharmacies use the phrase "bioidentical hormone" as a marketing term to imply that these preparations are natural and, thus, safer and more effective than U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved menopausal medications that use bioidentical or synthetic hormones, or both. However, evidence to support marketing claims of safety and effectiveness is lacking. Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy should not be prescribed routinely when FDA-approved formulations exist. Clinicians should counsel patients that FDA-approved menopausal hormone therapies are recommended for the management of menopausal symptoms over compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy. If a patient requests the use of compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy, clinicians should educate them on the lack of FDA approval of these preparations and their potential risks and benefits, including the risks specific to compounding. To truly understand the benefits and harms of compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy, high-quality placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up comparing custom-compounded products with FDA-approved menopausal hormone therapy are needed.

### Bioidentical hormone therapy: A review [^111Xcbmc]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

The terms "natural" or "bioidentical" hormone therapy (NHT) are used to describe hormone treatment with individually compounded recipes of specific steroids in various dosage forms, including dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone, testosterone, progesterone, estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Based on the results of a person's salivary hormone levels, the final composition of the compounded dosage form is individualized to that specific person. Proponents claim that NHT is better tolerated than manufactured products. This paper is intended to review the concept of NHT and to determine whether there is sufficient scientific evidence to support its use.

A literature search was performed in Medline using the following MeSH terms and keywords: drug combinations, progestational hormones, hormone replacement therapy, endometrium, estrogen replacement therapy, climacteric, menopause, estradiol, estrogens, progesterone, drug monitoring, and drug compounding. Additional searches were conducted in Contents, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Lexis Nexis, Google, Medscape, MD Consult, and clinicaltrials.gov with these keywords.

There are a few observational studies and clinical trials comparing conventional hormone therapy with bioidentical hormone therapy. Studies generally lacked adequate study design, including small sample sizes and the comparison of inequivalent doses, to prove safety and efficacy. Little evidence was found to support individualized hormone dosing based upon saliva hormone concentrations.

### Is there any rationale for prescribing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to prevent or to treat osteoarthritis [^113a71Gt]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2003). Low credibility.

During the last two decades of the 20th century, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was considered the sole pharmacological approach for counterbalancing or mitigating the effects of estrogen deprivation in post-menopausal women. Subsequently, HRT was widely recommended for managing chronic diseases occurring in women during the second half of their life. The overall risk/benefit ratio of estrogens has been recently reassessed in light of long-term prospective studies failing to demonstrate the expected benefit of HRT on the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the chronic conditions for which HRT has been suggested to provide beneficial outcomes.

- **Results**: The presence of estrogen receptors in human cartilage is no longer debated. However, cellular or animal models of OA do not provide an unequivocal pathway for the influence of gonadal steroids on cartilage. Similarly, studies attempting to correlate serum or urinary levels of sex steroids to the onset or progression of OA gave conflicting results. No randomized, prospective, controlled trial was designed to specifically assess the impact of hormone replacement therapy on symptomatic or structural progression of OA. Large-scale observational studies or trials, designed to assess other potential benefits of estrogens, suggest that HRT use does not provide symptomatic relief in OA but may interfere with its long-term structural progression, particularly in the lower limbs.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the recent results of the Women's Health Initiative, suggesting that HRT does not confer significant benefits in OA management, the rationale for HRT use in OA needs to be reconsidered.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^114ibQpH]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

This study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of a capsule combining 17β-estradiol and progesterone in a non-peanut oil-containing formulation with those of widely used and approved separate formulations of estradiol and progesterone coadministered to healthy postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, three-period, three-sequence, cross-over, partial-replicate, reference-scaled study. Postmenopausal women (aged 40–65 years) were randomly assigned to one of three dosing sequences of test and reference products (TRR, RTR, or RRT, where T is the test drug and R is the coadministered reference product), with each of the three periods separated by a 14-day washout. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoints were Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-inf) for the test and reference products, assessed for bioequivalence using the scaled average bioequivalence or unscaled average bioequivalence method. Safety was assessed by clinical observation, participant-reported adverse events, and laboratory data, including blood levels of hormones.

- **Results**: Sixty-six women were randomly assigned, and 62 women (94.0%) completed all three study periods. All AUC and Cmax parameters met bioequivalence criteria for all analytes (estradiol, progesterone, and estrone), except Cmax for total estrone. The extent of estradiol and progesterone absorption was similar between the test product and the reference products. Four adverse events — all considered mild and unrelated to the study drugs — were reported.

- **Conclusions**: The study suggests that the combination capsule may provide comparable pharmacokinetics to the separate formulations commonly used for menopausal hormone therapy.

### Use of bioidentical compounded hormones for menopausal concerns: Cross-sectional survey in an academic menopause center [^112MBxyh]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to assess the frequency of and experiences with the use of bioidentical compounded hormone therapy (BCH) by women seen at an academic women's health clinic and menopause center.

- **Methods**: Women seeking consultation for menopausal concerns from October 2005 to October 2006 were given a 19-item survey about their experiences with BCH and conventional hormone therapy (CHT).

- **Results**: Of 208 consecutive patients invited to take the survey, 184 consented and responded. Thirty-seven (20%) reported ever using BCH, and 25 (14%) reported current use of BCH; 59% of BCH preparations used included androgens. Twenty-four of 31 BCH users (77%) believed BCH was safer than CHT. Menopausal symptoms leading to the use of hormones were similar between BCH and CHT users. Symptom relief with the use of CHT and BCH was similar, but relief of sexual symptoms was reported significantly more frequently by BCH than CHT users (78% vs. 33%, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Women lacked knowledge of safety concerns with BCH, reporting a belief that it was safer than CHT. Menopausal symptoms prompting BCH and CHT use were similar, but sexual symptoms were more frequently relieved by BCH, possibly because of the inclusion of androgens. Visits to health care providers for menopausal symptoms are ideal for physicians to educate women that in the absence of data to the contrary, BCH should be considered to have the same risks as CHT. Our findings of reported improvements in sexual symptoms among women using BCH merit further evaluation, with better identification of constituents in the products.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114FhMrT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of menopause, specifically concerning the management of vasomotor symptoms, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a combination of conjugated equine estrogens and bazedoxifene. This combination should be considered where available and if not contraindicated, as an option for managing vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic postmenopausal patients with a uterus.

### Prescribing of FDA-approved and compounded hormone therapy differs by specialty [^111pVQBk]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Compounded estrogens (with or without progesterone), as opposed to FDA-approved versions, were proportionally more commonly prescribed by women's health practitioners (WPs) than by general practitioners (GPs) and obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs). Common compounded estrogen formulations may contain estradiol, estrone, or estriol, alone or in some combination. Estriol, a metabolite of estradiol and estrone, is a weak estrogen and has limited bioavailability because of its rapid conjugation after oral administration (up to 98% within 6 hours) and low relative binding affinities for estrogen receptors α and β.

Estriol is frequently compounded in combination with dosages of estradiol that are high enough to achieve biological effect alone, and thus any perceived efficacy may be due to the estradiol in the formulation. The high doses of estriol, however, required to achieve any biological effect might increase the risk for side effects, thus increasing the risks of endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism.

Estriol is not FDA-approved and can only be compounded provided that a new drug application is filed for use in compounding. There is a United States Pharmacopeia monograph for estriol, however, which technically allows compounders to use it as an active ingredient in compounding. Although estriol and estrone are not FDA-approved and therefore only available in compounded hormone therapy (CHT) products, estradiol is available in multiple doses and FDA-approved formulations. Why compounded estradiol would be chosen instead of the FDA-approved version is unclear, although the unique dosing available with CHT may be an important reason.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: Individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^1172ubhQ]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Published findings on breast cancer risk associated with different types of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are inconsistent, with limited information on long-term effects. This study brings together the epidemiological evidence, both published and unpublished, on these associations and reviews the relevant randomized evidence.

Principal analyses used individual participant data from all eligible prospective studies that had sought information on the type and timing of MHT use. The main analyses focused on individuals with complete information. Studies were identified by searching a variety of formal and informal sources regularly from January 1, 1992, to January 1, 2018. Users were included up to five years (mean 1.4 years) after the last reported MHT use. Logistic regression yielded adjusted risk ratios (RRs) comparing particular groups of MHT users versus never users.

During prospective follow-up, 108,647 postmenopausal women developed breast cancer at a mean age of 65 years (SD 7). Among these, 55,575 (51%) had used MHT. Among women with complete information, the mean MHT duration was 10 years (SD 6) in current users and 7 years (SD 6) in past users. The mean age at menopause and at starting MHT was 50 years (SD 5 and 6, respectively). Every MHT type, except vaginal oestrogens, was associated with excess breast cancer risks, which increased steadily with the duration of use and were greater for oestrogen-progestagen than oestrogen-only preparations. Among users, these excess risks were definite even during years 1–4 (oestrogen-progestagen RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.52–1.69).

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^112oDMni]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

One limitation of the study is that analysis of breast density changes with E2/P4 was not a prespecified endpoint in the REPLENISH study. Increased breast density is often found in women using hormone therapy containing a progestin. Greater breast density may be associated with increased breast cancer risk, although it is unknown whether the elevated breast cancer risk by combined hormone therapy is mediated through hormone-induced breast density change. Another limitation is the relatively short duration for observations of breast changes. As a longer duration of combined hormone use is associated with higher breast cancer risk, our study is likely not sufficiently powered to observe long-term breast safety of TX-001HR, in addition to the low incidence of breast cancer in women of similar age. Nevertheless, this duration is typical in evaluating menopausal hormone medications, and the study suggests short-term breast safety of TX-001HR.

The REPLENISH trial demonstrated significant reduction in the severity and frequency of vasomotor symptoms with the two highest doses of TX-001HR studied, with favorable safety profiles including endometrial protection, pharmacologically effective absorption, improved quality of life, and sleep outcomes, and no adverse effects on cardiometabolic markers. The results reported here suggest that the TX-001HR, an FDA-approved bioidentical combined hormone therapy, is potentially safe with no significant adverse impact on the breast after one year of use.

### Estradiol [^1127P875]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of the WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women, aged 65 to 79 years. In this cohort, 45% were aged 65 to 69 years, 36% were aged 70 to 74 years, and 19% were aged 75 years and older. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of daily conjugated equine estrogen (CE, 0.625 mg)-alone on the incidence of probable dementia, compared to a placebo.

After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95% CI, 0.83 to 2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. In this study, probable dementia included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed type dementia, which has features of both AD and VaD. The most common classification of probable dementia in both the treatment and placebo groups was AD. Since this ancillary study was conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years, it remains unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [see warnings and precautions (5.3) and use in specific populations (8.5)].

### Committee opinion no. 532: Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy [^1134fEjZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Although the improvement in long-term health is no longer an indication for menopausal hormone therapy, evidence supporting fewer adverse events in younger women, combined with its high overall effectiveness, has reinforced its usefulness for short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms. Menopausal therapy has been provided not only by commercially available products but also by compounding, which involves the creation of an individualized preparation in response to a health care provider's prescription to create a medication tailored to the specialized needs of an individual patient.

The Women's Health Initiative findings, coupled with an increase in direct-to-consumer marketing and media promotion of compounded bioidentical hormonal preparations as safe and effective alternatives to conventional menopausal hormone therapy, have led to a recent increase in the popularity of compounded bioidentical hormones as well as increased questions about the use of these preparations. Not only is evidence lacking to support superiority claims of compounded bioidentical hormones over conventional menopausal hormone therapy, but these claims also pose additional risks of variable purity and potency, and there is a lack of efficacy and safety data.

The Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine provide an overview of the major issues of concern surrounding compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy and offer recommendations for patient counseling.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^113PdyLb]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

The ability to combine the natural hormones 17β-estradiol (estradiol) and progesterone in a single-dose form to treat menopause symptoms while providing endometrial protection would be clinically useful. A comprehensive search suggests that no single drug combining these two hormones has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A product that combines 17β-estradiol with progesterone and offers good bioavailability of both hormones is difficult to achieve biochemically. Progesterone has poor bioavailability; it is highly lipophilic and undergoes a complex metabolic process, making it difficult to administer orally or transdermally. Administering clinically effective oral doses of estradiol and progesterone together in a formulation that does not compromise the bioavailability of either hormone is challenging because of differences in their structure and solubility.

Many compounding pharmacies manufacture products that combine estrogen and progesterone. Considering the poor bioavailability of oral and transdermal progesterone and the difficulty in determining the appropriate ratio of progesterone to estradiol, compounded hormone products should be viewed with caution. Pharmacokinetic studies of products manufactured by compounding pharmacies, with the aim to ensure adequate bioavailability, are rarely performed, and few clinical trials have appropriately evaluated the safety and efficacy of compounded hormones. For example, despite the widespread use of custom-compounded progesterone gels and creams, no evidence exists to show that any of them oppose estradi.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [^115Hy5Je]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of menopause, specifically in the context of osteoporosis management, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of a combination of conjugated equine estrogens and bazedoxifene. This recommendation is applicable where these treatments are available and not contraindicated, for the prevention of bone loss in symptomatic postmenopausal patients with a uterus.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: A cross-sectional study [^117Nv9CG]. Menopause (2025). Low credibility.

Statistical modeling revealed a positive association between dose and estradiol concentration [Supplemental Table 4]. For example, compared with women using two PE, estradiol concentration was estimated to be on average 37.6% higher in women using four PE (95% CI 19.0%-58.9%, P < 0.001) and 98.3% higher in women using eight PE (95% CI 60.4%-145.2%, P < 0.001).

- **Association with dose, age, and estradiol formulation**: However, the predicted differences in estradiol concentration between each dose pairwise comparison revealed that, while the difference in estradiol concentration between women using on-label versus off-label doses was statistically significant, there was no evidence of a difference between adjacent dose categories (2 vs 3 PE, 3 vs 4 PE, 4 vs 5 PE, 5 vs 6 PE, and 6 vs 8 PE) [Supplemental Table 5].

- **Age and formulation differences**: Serum estradiol levels were estimated to be 27.7% lower in older (≥ 50 years) versus younger women (95% CI 18.0%-36.3%, P < 0.001), and 25.7% lower in women using patches compared with women using gel (95% CI 18.4%-32.3%, P < 0.001). The predicted difference in estradiol concentration between women under 50 years versus women 50 years and older was 138.27 pmol/L (95% CI 77.84–198.71 pmol/L, P < 0.001), and between gel and patch users was 126.74 pmol/L (95% CI 85.01–168.48 pmol/L, P < 0.001) [Supplemental Tables 4 and 6].

### Estradiol [^1119rAyw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Coronary heart disease

The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Subgroup analyses**: Women aged 50 to 59 years, who were less than 10 years since menopause, showed a reduction (not statistically significant) in CHD events in those receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).

- **Estrogen plus progestin substudy**: This substudy reported an increased risk (not statistically significant) of CHD events in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Controlled clinical trial and secondary prevention**: In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), a controlled clinical trial on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS) showed that treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years.
