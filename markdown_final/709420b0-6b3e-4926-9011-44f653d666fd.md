## Question

Benzodiazepines paradoxical

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about benzodiazepine paradoxical reactions, including definitions, mechanisms, incidence, risk factors, clinical contexts, management, and prevention, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how paradoxical reactions are defined across regulatory and clinical sources. Then, I should verify mechanistic hypotheses, including GABAergic excitation and receptor subtype dynamics. Next, I will review incidence data by population and agent. After that, I need to identify patient and drug-related risk factors. Then, I will examine clinical contexts where paradoxical reactions commonly occur. Next, I should outline acute management strategies, including when to use flumazenil and when to avoid it. Finally, I will consider prevention, alternatives, and special populations, and close with a concise synthesis that reconciles any apparent contradictions in the literature.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines are characterized by agitation, irritability, aggression, disinhibition, restlessness, excitement, talkativeness, and sometimes hallucinations or psychosis, which are the opposite of the expected sedative effects and are explicitly described in FDA labeling for multiple agents including clonazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, diazepam, and alprazolam, with warnings that these reactions are more likely in children and the elderly and warrant discontinuation if they occur [^112kGLBd] [^115EjzP3] [^112K9Tdn] [^113F1Mpz] [^115QTDA7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking converging evidence. The leading hypothesis is a shift of GABAergic transmission from inhibition to excitation when chloride gradients are perturbed, particularly with immature or dysregulated chloride homeostasis, leading to GABA-mediated depolarization and excitation; this is supported by translational work linking impaired chloride extrusion to paradoxical benzodiazepine effects and by case-based reasoning that paradoxical responses to GABA-enhancing drugs may predict benefit from NKCC1 inhibition with bumetanide in neurodevelopmental disorders [^112tm3Ur] [^114JMqiE] [^116r2FDq]. I should also consider receptor subtype dynamics; zebrafish behavioral profiling suggests that positive allosteric modulators at GABA-A receptors can produce excitatory behavioral phenotypes, and TSPO ligands that modulate GABAergic tone have been implicated in excitatory responses, indicating that not all GABA-A PAMs behave identically and that subunit-specific effects may be relevant [^114Bhs7z] [^1151j7yf]. But wait, what if disinhibition is a separate phenomenon? Indeed, behavioral disinhibition is a recognized benzodiazepine adverse effect and may reflect cortical release rather than true excitation, so I need to keep both excitatory chloride-gradient failure and disinhibition in mind as overlapping but distinct mechanisms [^115EjzP3] [^111pW6Dr].

> Next, I should review incidence carefully and verify ranges. In children, pediatric procedural sedation literature and trials suggest paradoxical reactions with midazolam occur in roughly 1–15% depending on route, dose, and definition, with a randomized trial showing 3.4% after IV midazolam and a prospective pediatric endoscopy cohort showing 1.4% in adults, while an anesthesiology series reported 10.2% in older adults receiving midazolam sedation; these figures align with FDA warnings that paradoxical reactions are rare overall but more likely in children and the elderly [^116sAiPm] [^1139EUBz] [^114vc6X6] [^1137zCoT] [^112kGLBd] [^115EjzP3]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the pediatric incidence could be as high as 10% universally, but I should correct that: estimates vary widely by setting and methodology, so a pragmatic range of about 1–10% in children is reasonable, with higher rates reported in some series and lower in others [^116sAiPm] [^1139EUBz] [^112R74Pk].

> I will now examine risk factors, and I need to ensure I separate patient-related from drug-related contributors. Patient-related risks include young age, older age, neurodevelopmental disorders, baseline psychiatric illness, and a history of aggression or substance use; drug-related risks include higher doses, rapid IV administration, and agents with relatively rapid onset such as midazolam, with multiple labels emphasizing higher likelihood in children and the elderly and case series identifying male sex and higher midazolam doses as predictors in specific procedural contexts [^112kGLBd] [^115EjzP3] [^114vc6X6] [^115QTDA7]. Hold on, I should verify that dose-dependence is not universal; while many adverse effects are dose-related, paradoxical reactions can occur at therapeutic doses, so dose alone does not fully explain risk, reinforcing the role of individual susceptibility and neurobiology [^111pW6Dr] [^1137zCoT].

> Let me consider clinical contexts where paradoxical reactions are particularly salient. Procedural sedation with midazolam in children and adults, ICU care where benzodiazepines may worsen agitation or delirium, and end-of-life care where clinicians worry about disinhibition and paradoxical agitation are key settings; geriatric emergency care guidance also highlights midazolam's unfavorable safety profile in older adults, and perioperative care literature notes paradoxical reactions and delirium risk with benzodiazepine premedication in the elderly [^116sAiPm] [^1139EUBz] [^115toAnN] [^111WNEPo] [^113ttuJC] [^1161xjfW]. I should double-check that these are not just anecdotal concerns; indeed, systematic reviews and multicenter cohort data corroborate increased adverse events and delirium with benzodiazepines in older surgical patients, supporting caution and preference for alternatives when feasible [^113ttuJC].

> Now, I need to outline acute management and be precise about flumazenil. Immediate steps include stopping the benzodiazepine, ensuring safety, and using supportive measures; flumazenil can rapidly reverse paradoxical reactions in carefully selected patients, with case reports and small series demonstrating efficacy, including pediatric ED cases and procedural sedation contexts, but I must confirm contraindications and risks before recommending it [^116zz2Gj] [^1137zCoT] [^114vc6X6]. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients with benzodiazepine dependence or when benzodiazepines were used for seizure control, and it can precipitate withdrawal seizures, so it should be used as an adjunct to supportive care, not as a substitute, and avoided in mixed overdoses with pro-convulsant co-ingestants or in epilepsy unless benefits clearly outweigh risks [^117PGzk9] [^114TTnfu] [^1113ihSp]. Wait, let me verify alternatives if flumazenil is unsafe or unavailable; ketamine has RCT-level evidence for rapidly controlling midazolam-induced paradoxical agitation in children, and dexmedetomidine has supportive series for benzodiazepine-induced disinhibition during endoscopy, offering non-GABAergic pathways to restore calm without risking benzodiazepine withdrawal [^1139EUBz] [^112QGEyU] [^111wQSoH] [^114PL7NX].

> Next, I should review prevention and mitigation strategies, and I need to ensure they are practical. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid rapid IV pushes, screen for risk factors, and consider alternatives such as ketamine, dexmedetomidine, or propofol in high-risk patients or settings; in pediatrics, consider non-pharmacologic preparation and agents less associated with paradoxical activation, and in older adults, adhere to geriatric prescribing principles and deprescribing initiatives to reduce exposure and falls risk [^115EjzP3] [^113KdZS4] [^111WNEPo]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this approach; yes, anesthesia and sedation guidelines increasingly favor non-benzodiazepine strategies in older adults, and quality improvement work demonstrates feasibility of benzodiazepine dose reduction in hospitalized seniors [^113ttuJC] [^113KdZS4].

> I should also consider special populations and edge cases. In neurodevelopmental disorders, a paradoxical response to benzodiazepines may flag dysfunctional chloride homeostasis and predict responsiveness to bumetanide, though this remains investigational and requires careful monitoring; in neonates and infants, immature chloride transport can predispose to paradoxical excitation with GABAergic drugs, reinforcing caution and dose minimization; and in disorders of consciousness, rare paradoxical awakenings with zolpidem or benzodiazepines have been described, underscoring heterogeneous GABAergic neurophysiology [^114JMqiE] [^116r2FDq] [^115Hjhme] [^112F3Coh]. Let me reconsider whether these are merely anecdotal; while much of the clinical literature is case-based, the mechanistic plausibility and convergent observations across settings support incorporating these considerations into risk stratification [^112tm3Ur] [^112F3Coh].

> Finally, I will synthesize and reconcile the evidence. Benzodiazepine paradoxical reactions are uncommon but clinically important, more frequent in children and older adults, mechanistically linked to chloride-gradient shifts and possibly receptor subtype-specific effects, and variably dose-related; they demand anticipatory planning in procedural, ICU, and geriatric care, with flumazenil as a targeted reversal in carefully selected cases and ketamine or dexmedetomidine as effective alternatives when flumazenil is contraindicated or unavailable; prevention hinges on dose minimization, risk screening, and preference for non-benzodiazepine sedatives in high-risk populations, aligning with contemporary safety guidance and deprescribing frameworks [^112kGLBd] [^115EjzP3] [^1139EUBz] [^112QGEyU] [^113ttuJC] [^113KdZS4].

Benzodiazepines can cause **paradoxical reactions** — agitation, aggression, disinhibition, or excitation — especially in children, older adults, and patients with psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders [^112kGLBd] [^115QTDA7] [^114JMqiE]. The incidence is **about 1–2% in adults and higher in children**, with risk rising with higher doses, rapid IV administration, and in patients with psychiatric comorbidities or developmental disorders [^114vc6X6] [^112R74Pk] [^116sAiPm] [^115QTDA7] [^114JMqiE]. Mechanisms are incompletely understood but may involve GABAergic excitation from altered chloride gradients, receptor subtype effects, or neurodevelopmental factors [^114Bhs7z] [^112tm3Ur]. Management is to **stop the benzodiazepine**, provide supportive care, and consider flumazenil or alternative sedatives such as ketamine or dexmedetomidine [^112kGLBd] [^116zz2Gj] [^1139EUBz] [^112QGEyU]. Prevention includes careful patient selection, slow titration, and close monitoring for atypical responses [^111WNEPo] [^115fuZ2X] [^112K9Tdn].

## Clinical manifestations of paradoxical reactions

Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines present with **symptoms opposite to their expected effects**, including:

- **Agitation and restlessness**: Excessive movement, inability to stay still, and heightened anxiety [^115EjzP3].

- **Aggression and disinhibition**: Hostile behavior, irritability, and impulsive actions [^112kGLBd].

- **Excitement and talkativeness**: Increased sociability, pressured speech, and hyperactivity [^111pW6Dr].

- **Confusion and disorientation**: Cognitive impairment, disorganized thinking, and altered perception [^114TTnfu].

- **Hallucinations and psychosis**: Rarely, visual or auditory hallucinations and delusional thinking [^115QTDA7].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

The incidence of paradoxical reactions varies by population and clinical context. In adults, the incidence is approximately **1–2%**, whereas in children it is higher, particularly with midazolam [^114vc6X6] [^116sAiPm]. Risk factors include:

- **Age**: Children and older adults are more susceptible [^112kGLBd] [^115fuZ2X].

- **Psychiatric comorbidities**: Personality disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders increase risk [^115QTDA7].

- **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Autism spectrum disorder and related conditions [^114JMqiE].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history of paradoxical reactions [^115rvJBC].

- **Dose and administration**: Higher doses and rapid intravenous administration increase risk [^112K9Tdn].

---

## Proposed mechanisms

The exact mechanisms underlying paradoxical reactions are not fully understood; proposed explanations include:

- **Altered chloride homeostasis**: Immature or dysregulated chloride transport (e.g. NKCC1/KCC2 imbalance) can render GABAergic transmission excitatory rather than inhibitory, especially in children and neurodevelopmental disorders [^112tm3Ur] [^114JMqiE].

- **GABA receptor subtype differences**: Variations in GABA-A receptor subunit expression may mediate excitatory responses to benzodiazepines [^114Bhs7z].

- **Neurodevelopmental factors**: Immature brain circuitry and neurotransmitter systems in children may predispose to paradoxical excitation [^115Hjhme].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

Paradoxical reactions have been reported across diverse clinical scenarios and patient populations, including:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Patient population** | **Incidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Procedural sedation | Children undergoing medical procedures | 1–15% [^112R74Pk] |
| ICU sedation | Critically ill patients | Rare, but significant |
| Endoscopic procedures | Adults undergoing sedation | 1.4% [^114vc6X6] |
| Psychiatric patients | Individuals with personality disorders, anxiety disorders | Rare, but documented [^115QTDA7] |
| Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder | Documented case reports [^114JMqiE] |

## Management strategies

Effective management of paradoxical reactions includes:

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop the benzodiazepine promptly [^115fuZ2X].

- **Supportive care**: Provide reassurance, environmental modifications, and monitoring [^notfound].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Flumazenil (benzodiazepine antagonist) may reverse paradoxical reactions in some cases [^116zz2Gj] [^1137zCoT].

- **Alternative sedatives**: Ketamine or dexmedetomidine may be used as alternatives for sedation [^1139EUBz] [^112QGEyU].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include:

- **Careful patient selection**: Screen for risk factors and avoid benzodiazepines in high-risk patients [^113KdZS4].

- **Slow titration**: Gradual dose escalation and close monitoring [^115fuZ2X].

- **Alternative medications**: Consider non-benzodiazepine sedatives in susceptible populations [^112Koskw].

---

## Long-term consequences and complications

Paradoxical reactions can lead to **significant clinical consequences**, including:

- **Delayed procedures**: Interruption of medical procedures and increased healthcare costs [^111wQSoH].

- **Psychological distress**: Anxiety, trauma, and distrust of medical care [^111pW6Dr].

- **Legal and ethical issues**: Documentation challenges and informed consent considerations [^notfound].

### Successful flumazenil reversal of paradoxical reaction to midazolam in a child [^116zz2Gj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Greater attention to and management of anxiety and pain in pediatric patients signifies a healthy evolution in the care of children in emergency departments (EDs). Interventions to address such distress may involve unanticipated adverse effects. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine commonly administered to children for anxiolysis, may precipitate paradoxical agitation and delirium, a rare but alarming effect that warrants prompt identification and treatment.

Case Report

The case presented is that of a 4-year-old girl who received oral midazolam and developed a paradoxical reaction, which was reversed successfully with flumazenil. This is the first such case report in an ED involving a child. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians must stay abreast of the adverse and unintended effects of the treatments provided. The literature on benzodiazepine-induced paradoxical reactions is reviewed, and flumazenil as well as other treatment options and anxiolytic alternatives are presented.

### Benzodiazepine use and risk of Alzheimer's disease: case-control study [^116p4Uiy]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This case-control study based on 8980 individuals representative of elderly people living in the community in Quebec showed that the risk of Alzheimer's disease was increased by 43–51% among those who had used benzodiazepines in the past. Risk increased with density of exposure and when long acting benzodiazepines were used. Further adjustment on symptoms thought to be potential prodromes for dementia — such as depression, anxiety, or sleep disorders — did not meaningfully alter the results.

Comparison with other studies

Our findings are congruent with those of five previous studies, two of which explored the modifying effect of the dose used. In four studies, the role of a putative protopathic bias could not be ruled out because an insufficient duration of follow-up; a lack of statistical power in subgroup analyses; and no consideration of the most relevant time window for exposure and ascertainment of confounders. The most recent study found a similar 50% increased risk within the 15 years after the start of benzodiazepine use (average length of follow-up 6.2 years). This excess risk was delayed and thus not indicative of a reverse causality bias. Another study found a positive association, though lacked significance because of its limited sample size. The earliest work observed a paradoxical protective effect of benzodiazepines, which could be partly explained by the misclassification of past users as a part of the reference group.

### Zebrafish behavioural profiling identifies GABA and serotonin receptor ligands related to sedation and paradoxical excitation [^114Bhs7z]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Although these studies show that GABA A R PAMs cause paradoxical excitation, pharmacological experiments to determine which GABA A R subtypes caused eASRs were ultimately inconclusive. While the majority of GABA A Rs in the CNS are benzodiazepine-sensitive γ-containing subtypes, and multiple benzodiazepines did not cause strong eASRs (Fig. 1g), γ-containing subtypes may still be very important for eASRs. One reason is that the benzodiazepines tested in this study only represent a very small subset of benzodiazepine analogs. Another reason is that diazepam produced intermediate eASR phenotypes (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that other benzodiazepines may cause even stronger eASR phenotypes. Although etomidate, propofol, neurosteroids, and other anesthetics are PAMs at δ-subunit containing GABA A R subtypes, these ligands also modulate γ-containing subtypes. Furthermore, although THIP and DS2 are reported to have preferential activity at δ-containing GABA A Rs, these compounds also modulate γ-containing receptors, and they did not cause eASRs. One alternative explanation is that β-isoforms, could drive the presence or absence of eASRs. Another possible explanation is that whereas PAMs may produce immobilizing effects effects via some receptor subtypes, they may produce eASRs via other subtypes. In summary, although a subset of GABA A R PAMs caused eASRs, these compounds may do so via a variety of receptor subtypes. In future studies, it would be interesting to test additional benzodiazepines for such effects including midazolam, which causes paradoxical excitation in humans. The specificity of currently available pharmacological tools may be insufficient to determine which GABA A R subtypes produce eASRs. Therefore, future studies may require targeted knockouts and other genetic tools to help identify the key receptor subtypes.

### Paradoxical benzodiazepine response: a rationale for bumetanide in neurodevelopmental disorders? [^114JMqiE]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The diuretic agent bumetanide has recently been put forward as a novel, promising treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related conditions. Bumetanide can decrease neuronal chloride concentrations and may thereby reinstate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, strategies to select appropriate candidates for bumetanide treatment are lacking. We hypothesized that a paradoxical response to GABA-enforcing agents such as benzodiazepines may predict the efficacy of bumetanide treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders. We describe a case of a 10-year-old girl with ASD, epilepsy, cortical dysplasia, and a 15q11.2 duplication who had exhibited marked behavioral arousal after previous treatment with clobazam, a benzodiazepine. We hypothesized that this response indicated the presence of depolarizing excitatory GABA and started bumetanide treatment with monitoring of behavior, cognition, and EEG. The treatment resulted in a marked clinical improvement in sensory behaviors, rigidity, and memory performance, which was substantiated by questionnaires and cognitive assessments. At baseline, the girl's EEG showed a depression in absolute α power, an electrographic sign previously related to ASD, which was normalized with bumetanide treatment. The effects of bumetanide on cognition and EEG seemed to mirror the "nonparadoxical" responses to benzodiazepines in healthy subjects. In addition, temporal lobe epilepsy and cortical dysplasia have both been linked to disturbed chloride homeostasis and seem to support our assumption that the observed paradoxical response was due to GABA-mediated excitation. This case highlights that a paradoxical behavioral response to GABA-enforcing drugs may constitute a framework for targeted treatment with bumetanide.

### Lack of direct involvement of a diazepam long-term treatment in the occurrence of irreversible cognitive impairment: a pre-clinical approach [^115oHb7Z]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines, allosteric agonists of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor, are a class of psychotropic drugs commonly prescribed to treat acute anxiety and/or insomnia. The worldwide global prevalence use of benzodiazepines ranges from 2.6 to 12.5% and increases with age, with a mean or median age of use around 55 years. Adverse effects like cognitive deterioration, paradoxical response, risk of falling, misuse, and dependence have led several countries to reduce prescription duration. However, despite general warnings from drug regulatory agencies, the long-term use and overprescription of benzodiazepines persist, particularly in the aging population. The major concern arising from observational studies in this population is an increased risk of irreversible cognitive deficits leading to dementia after long-term use of benzodiazepines. According to these studies, the risk magnitude may be influenced by treatment duration, dosage used, and probably benzodiazepine half-life. However, the link between the long-term use of benzodiazepines and neurocognitive disorders remains controversial. Two hypotheses can be formulated to explain this discrepancy. First hypothesis: benzodiazepines have no influence on age-related cognitive decline and these conflicting results can simply be explained by methodological issues such as the protopathic bias, since the main indications for benzodiazepines (anxiety, insomnia) can also be prodromes of dementia.

Second hypothesis: benzodiazepines have a negative impact on brain aging processes leading to the emergence of reversible or irreversible brain changes. In the context of pathological aging, i.e. in patients with an underlying neurodegenerative disease, benzodiazepines may decrease the cognitive reserve and accelerate the onset and presentation of the disease. In the context of normal aging, i.e. in patients without any underlying disease, benzodiazepines could prime irreversible cognitive impairment and contribute to dementia through several possible mechanisms: (i) GABA/glutamate imbalance, (ii) impact on neural plasticity and survival, (iii) hypoxic mechanisms through respiratory depression. It is this latter assumption that we propose to explore in this preclinical work.

Indeed, the direct long-term effects of benzodiazepines on cognition cannot be clearly demonstrated by epidemiological studies where the temporality criterion remains uncertain. Furthermore, prospective clinical trials are not feasible due to evident ethical issues. In this context, animal models represent a relevant approach to overcome clinical limitations by a tight control of the confounding factors that may skew clinical outcomes.

### Motivational drive and alprazolam misuse: a recipe for aggression? [^116Ej1Sa]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepine-related aggression has received insufficient research attention, in particular little is known about the motivational factors which may contribute to the development of this paradoxical response. The revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory provides a theoretical framework from which to understand the relevant underlying motivational processes. The current study aimed to identify the role of approach and avoidance motivational tendencies in the occurrence of benzodiazepine-related aggression. Data regarding benzodiazepine and other substance use, approach and avoidance motivation, and general and physical aggressive behaviour were collected via self-report questionnaires. Participants were a convenience sample (n = 204) who reported using benzodiazepines in the previous year. Participants were primarily male (62.7%), aged 18–51 years old. Hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that general and physical aggression were predicted by alprazolam use and Drive, a facet of approach motivation. Overall, lower diazepam use significantly predicted higher levels of general aggression. However, when diazepam-preferring participants were examined in isolation of the larger sample (23.5% of sample), problematic (dependent) diazepam use was associated with greater aggression scores, as was dependence risk for alprazolam-preferring participants (39.7% of sample). The findings highlight the importance of motivational factors and benzodiazepine use patterns in understanding benzodiazepine-related aggression, with implications for violent offender rehabilitation.

### Association between benzodiazepine premedication and 30-day mortality rate: a propensity-score weighted analysis of the peri-interventional outcome study in the elderly (POSE) [^113ttuJC]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgery in patients aged 80 years and older is becoming more common. Risk factors, such as frailty and multimorbidity lead to enhanced mortality and morbidity. The Peri-interventional Outcome Study in the elderly (POSE) was designed to shed light on the peri-operative 30-day mortality rate in Europe. POSE was a prospective, multicentre cohort study of patients aged 80 years and older undergoing surgical or nonsurgical interventions under anaesthesia. In total, 9497 patients from 177 hospitals in 20 countries were analysed, and 388 deaths were observed. POSE revealed a postinterventional mortality rate of 4.2% (95% CI 3.8 to 4.7%). Secondary analyses of POSE assessed risk factors for mortality in the elderly, and these may open avenues for their analysis. Risk factors for 30-day mortality were analysed using a Cox regression model with 14 fixed effects and a random centre effect. Among others, the following risk factors for 30-day mortality were identified: multimorbidity, hazard ratio 1.87 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.78), frailty, hazard ratio 2.63 (95% CI 2.10 to 3.30), and limited mobility, hazard ratio 2.19 (95% CI 1.24 to 3.86).

Of note, 1521 (16%) of the POSE study cohort received benzodiazepine premedication before intervention. Whilst benzodiazepine premedication is thought to reduce preoperative anxiety, it comes with an array of serious side effects, especially in the elderly. Side effects include dose-dependent sedation to respiratory depression, paradoxical reactions and antegrade amnesia, increased pneumonia rates and postoperative delirium. – The latter is associated with an increased mortality rate. Recent guidelines suggest avoiding benzodiazepines for premedication in order to prevent postoperative delirium. Yet, these recommendations lack support from appropriate powered randomised controlled trials (Grade of Recommendation B). Of note, a recent study assessing more than 48 000 patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery in a large academic health system found that 65% of all patients aged 50 years or older received a benzodiazepine during anaesthesia care. The reason for the discrepancy between clinical practice and guidelines advising against benzodiazepine use in older surgical patients remains unanswered. A possible hypothesis for a beneficial effect of benzodiazepine premedication, offered by Jeon et al. in a randomised controlled trial, might be that midazolam premedication reduced entropy values, stabilized the cardiovascular system, and provided analgesia during the induction of anaesthesia.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^114jvSbF]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — benzodiazepines for agitation or anxiety: Benzodiazepines may have a higher likelihood of side effects and a lower likelihood of benefit than antipsychotics; their long-term use is generally to be avoided and they may be used on an occasional as-needed basis for rare agitation or procedures, with use kept to a minimum and a maximum of 1–3 mg of lorazepam (or equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines) in 24 hours. Oral lorazepam may be given on an as-needed basis in a dosage of 0.5 to 1.0 mg every 4–6 hours, with standard oral doses of 0.5–1.0 mg given from 1 to 2 times per day; oxazepam starting doses of 7.5–15.0 mg may be given 1 to 4 times per day; some clinicians prefer clonazepam starting at 0.5 mg/day with increases up to 2 mg/day. Many clinicians favor oxazepam and lorazepam because they do not require oxidative metabolism in the liver and have no active metabolites. Common adverse effects include sedation, ataxia, amnesia, confusion (even delirium), and possibly paradoxical anxiety, which can worsen cognition and behavior and increase the risk of falls; benzodiazepines also carry a risk of respiratory suppression in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders. Agents with long half-lives and long-lived metabolites can take weeks to reach steady-state levels and generally are not used in this patient population; elderly patients taking long-acting benzodiazepines are more likely to fall and to suffer hip fractures than those taking short-acting agents. If benzodiazepines are prescribed for an extended period (e.g., 1 month), they should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal.

### Clonazepam [^112kGLBd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General:

Worsening of Seizures:

When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, clonazepam may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and clonazepam may produce absence status.

Loss of Effect:

In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within 3 months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy.

Laboratory Testing During Long-Term Therapy:

Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with clonazepam.

Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions:

Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, irritability, aggression, anxiety, anger, nightmares, hallucinations, and psychoses are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric). Should this occur, the use of the drug should be discontinued gradually (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence). Paradoxical reactions are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly.

Caution in Renally Impaired Patients:

Metabolites of clonazepam are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function.

Hypersalivation:

Clonazepam may produce an increase in salivation. This should be considered before giving the drug to patients who have difficulty handling secretions.

Respiratory Depression:

Clonazepam may cause respiratory depression and should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea).

Porphyria:

Clonazepam may have a porphyrogenic effect and should be used with care in patients with porphyria.

Information for Patients:

A Clonazepam Tablets Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time clonazepam is dispensed, as required by law. Patients should be instructed to take clonazepam only as prescribed. Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe clonazepam:

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids:

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if clonazepam is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (see WARNINGS: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^117778Wt]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepine adverse effects and monitoring in SE — common complications and precautions — include central nervous system depression (sedation), respiratory depression, apnea, and hypotension, which can be reversed to some extent with flumazenil therapy, although this may be short-lived. Neuropsychiatric adverse effects include paradoxical reactions and behavioral disinhibition, which are rare in therapeutic doses but can occur with excessive dosing. In a randomized, controlled trial, respiratory depression was seen less frequently in those treated with benzodiazepines for GCSE than for those who received placebo. For other AED infusions, phenytoin and fosphenytoin should occur with cardiac monitoring due to increased risk for QT prolongation and arrhythmias. Controlled trials are not available to define optimal dosage ranges; therefore, AED doses were based on observational data and expert opinion and should be titrated according to clinical and EEG findings.

### Substitution therapy for alcoholism: time for a reappraisal? [^1155VJRo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

A number of compounds already in use as medications for various indications substitute for ethanol at clinically relevant brain pathways, in particular, at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. Nevertheless, although substitute medications have been recognized for heroin and tobacco dependence, patients with alcohol dependence are rarely offered an analogous approach. Benzodiazepines may have paradoxical effects, and abuse and dependence are known. Baclofen (GABA(B) agonist) has not been associated with dependence or misuse and has been effective in several trials in preventing relapse, although research is required to establish the optimal dosing regimen. GABA-ergic anticonvulsants, helpful in treating withdrawal, have yet to emerge as effective in relapse prevention. Clomethiazole and sodium oxybate, the latter having been shown to be effective in relapse prevention, have incurred a reputation for dependence and abuse. However, data have emerged showing that the risk of abuse of sodium oxybate is lower than many clinicians had foreseen. For a condition where existing therapies are only effective in a proportion of patients, and which has high morbidity and mortality, the time now seems right for reappraising the use of substitute prescribing for alcohol dependence.

### The midazolam-induced paradox phenomenon is reversible by flumazenil. epidemiology, patient characteristics and review of the literature [^1137zCoT]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Midazolam may occasionally precipitate hostility and violence instead of tranquility. We characterized these episodes, their rate of occurrence, the potential paradoxical responders and possible predisposing circumstances among patients undergoing lower body surgery under spinal or epidural anaesthesia and midazolam sedation.

Patients and Methods

Fifty-eight patients who fulfilled the study entry criteria and who underwent surgery within a 3-month period in a large metropolitan, university-affiliated hospital were enrolled. Sedation and restlessness in all patients were controlled by midazolam administered intravenously by the attending anaesthesiologist; these parameters were later objectively confirmed by recorded actigrams. If "paradoxical" events occurred, flumazenil 0.1 mg 10 s-1 was injected until the aberrant behaviour ceased. Patients with paradoxical reactions were later compared with matched control patients selected from the study group to identify epidemiological characteristics.

Results

The incidence of paradoxical events was 10.2% (six out of 58 patients, confidence limits 2.3–18.3%) and they occurred 45–210 min after sedation started; the only independent predictor was an age older than that of the entire study group. The mean cumulative and per weight doses of midazolam were similar for both the experimental and the study groups of patients: 7.3 ± 2.8 to 10.1 ± 3.6 mg, and 0.1 ± 0.04 to 0.12 ± 0.05 mg kg-1. Flumazenil 0.2–0.3 mg (range 0.1–0.5 mg) effectively stopped the midazolam-induced paradoxical activity within 30 s and surgery continued uneventfully.

Conclusions

Flumazenil completely reverses midazolam-induced paradoxical reactions and they are more frequent in older patients.

### Midazolam in sodium chloride [^112K9Tdn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Risk of Paradoxical Behavior

Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions. Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients.

5.5 Risk of Dependence and Withdrawal with Long-Term Use of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection

The continued use of benzodiazepines for several days to weeks may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. If used for long-term use (i.e., for several days to weeks), abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of midazolam, or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening.

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use.

After extended therapy, do not abruptly discontinue Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. When discontinuing midazolam in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage using a tapering schedule that is individualized to the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Dependence (9.3)].

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^115QTDA7]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation, rage, irritability, and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects, patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur, alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder, a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability, hostility, and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.

Post Introduction Reports: Various adverse drug reactions have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam since market introduction. The majority of these reactions were reported through the medical event voluntary reporting system. Because of the spontaneous nature of the reporting of medical events and the lack of controls, a causal relationship to the use of alprazolam cannot be readily determined. Reported events include: liver enzyme elevations, hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, gynecomastia, and galactorrhea.

### Diazepam (Valium) [^113F1Mpz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

If Valium is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed - particularly with known compounds that may potentiate the action of diazepam, such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants (see Drug Interactions).

The usual precautions are indicated for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression or anxiety associated with depression, particularly the recognition that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary.

Psychiatric and paradoxical reactions are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Should this occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. These reactions are more likely to occur in children and the elderly.

A lower dose is recommended for patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, due to the risk of respiratory depression.

Benzodiazepines should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

In debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once or twice daily, initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated).

Some loss of response to the effects of benzodiazepines may develop after repeated use of Valium for a prolonged time.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: pain control in surgical abortion part 2-moderate sedation, deep sedation, and general anesthesia [^113ppnko]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations — agent-specific adverse effects during anesthesia note that side effects range from mild to life-threatening, including common nausea and vomiting; pruritus with opioid use; and paradoxical agitation with benzodiazepines even at recommended doses. When opioids and benzodiazepines are used together their sedative effects may be additive. Older halogenated agents such as halothane or isoflurane are associated with increased blood loss due to uterine relaxation and higher transfusion risk during cesarean delivery, and RCOG recommends use of a short-acting opioid in addition to propofol for general anesthesia rather than inhalational agents.

### Lorazepam [^115EjzP3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects occurring with high doses.

In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age.

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures, tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria, slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; SIADH, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations.

Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam.

### Efficacy of oral midazolam for minimal and moderate sedation in pediatric patients: a systematic review [^116sAiPm]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

Oral midazolam is an efficacious medication with an adequate safety profile for use in minimal or moderate sedation in children from 4 months to 18 years old at doses from 0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg. The incidence of adverse events, such as paradoxical reactions and respiratory events, and the risk of over‐sedation increase with increasing doses. Oral midazolam compares well with other alternative noninvasive medications. The need to use validated scales for the evaluation of sedation in future studies is highlighted.

### Lorazepam (Ativan) [^115fuZ2X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

In patients with depression, a possibility for suicide should be borne in mind; benzodiazepines should not be used in such patients without adequate antidepressant therapy.

Lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea syndrome).

Elderly or debilitated patients may be more susceptible to the sedative effects of lorazepam. Therefore, these patients should be monitored frequently and have their dosage adjusted carefully according to patient response; the initial dosage should not exceed 2 mg.

Paradoxical reactions have been occasionally reported during benzodiazepine use. Such reactions may be more likely to occur in children and the elderly. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.

The usual precautions for treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed. As with all benzodiazepines, the use of lorazepam may worsen hepatic encephalopathy; therefore, lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency and/or encephalopathy. Dosage for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency should be adjusted carefully according to patient response; lower doses may be sufficient in such patients.

In patients where gastrointestinal or cardiovascular disorders coexist with anxiety, it should be noted that lorazepam has not been shown to be of significant benefit in treating the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular component.

Esophageal dilation occurred in rats treated with lorazepam for more than 1 year at 6 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose was 1.25 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum human therapeutic dose of 10 mg/day). The effect was reversible only when the treatment was withdrawn within 2 months of first observation of the phenomenon. The clinical significance of this is unknown. However, use of lorazepam for prolonged periods and in geriatric patients requires caution, and there should be frequent monitoring for symptoms of upper GI disease.

Safety and effectiveness of Ativan (lorazepam) in children of less than 12 years have not been established.

### Paradoxical reaction following intravenous midazolam premedication in pediatric patients-a randomized placebo controlled trial of ketamine for rapid tranquilization [^1139EUBz]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines include restlessness, violent behavior, physical assault, act of self-injury and need for restraints. These may occur at variable times after administration. This study was designed to determine the incidence of paradoxical reactions following intravenous midazolam premedication in pediatric patients and to compare the efficacy of extra doses of midazolam with low-dose intravenous ketamine to rapidly tranquillize them.

Methods

A total of 706 ASA I, II children scheduled for elective surgery were given intravenous midazolam premedication. Children who developed a paradoxical reaction were randomly divided into three equal groups to receive: (i) extra midazolam, (ii) ketamine, or (iii) placebo as the test drug for treatment of paradoxical reaction. Ease of rapid tranquillization and need for a rescue tranquillizer (i.e. ketamine; irrespective of patient group) were compared among the three groups.

Results

Twenty-four (3.4%) children developed paradoxical reaction after midazolam premedication. Those who received ketamine as the test drug responded rapidly to ketamine. But the responses of the other two groups to their test drug were poor and the majority of them required ketamine as rescue tranquillizer (six in midazolam, seven in placebo, but no patient in the ketamine group; P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The results of this study demonstrate that ketamine is an effective drug for the treatment of paradoxical reaction following intravenous midazolam premedication. The exact mechanisms of these reactions and how it is aborted by ketamine are not clear.

### Lorazepam (Loreev xr) [^1154u1HD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression

Benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, may produce CNS depression. Caution patients receiving LOREEV XR against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.

Use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR, both used alone and in combination with other CNS depressants, may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression. Alcohol should be avoided and other CNS depressant drugs used with caution during treatment with LOREEV XR [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Patients with Depression or Psychosis

LOREEV XR is not recommended for use in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis. Pre-existing depression may emerge or worsen during use of benzodiazepines, including LOREEV XR.

In patients with depression, a possibility for suicide should be borne in mind. Consequently, appropriate precautions (e.g., limiting the total prescription size and increased monitoring for suicidal ideation) should be considered in patients with depression. LOREEV XR should not be used in such patients without adequate antidepressant therapy.

5.6 Risk of Paradoxical Reactions

Paradoxical reactions (agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) have been reported during benzodiazepine use [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Such reactions may be more likely to occur in the elderly [see Adverse Reactions (8.5)]. Discontinue LOREEV XR if the patient experiences these reactions.

5.7 Allergic Reactions to FD&C Yellow No. 5 (Tartrazine)

LOREEV XR 1 mg capsules contain FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine), which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)].

### Behavioral symptoms and treatment challenges for patients living with dementia: hospice clinician and caregiver perspectives [^115PuZa4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Theme 2: Sedation is recognized as a common side effect of pharmacologic treatment, though clinicians and caregivers differed as to its desirability

Both clinicians and caregivers recognized sedation as a common side effect of treatment with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Caregivers expressed concern about this, because this sedation then limited their ability to communicate or interact with their loved one at end of life:

"I was concerned about all of the chemicals that were put in. I didn't know whether it was making him worse or making him better. Some, I noticed where it would turn him into kind of like a walking zombie, his eyes would kind of glaze over, and I didn't like that. It's like he didn't recognize me, but when he wasn't on those things it was easier to kind of bring him back".

Clinicians were less likely to report concern for sedation as a side effect of medications used; instead, they considered sedation a potentially acceptable or even desirable outcome for a patient at the end of life that improved comfort. Clinician were less worried about sedation than other side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms of antipsychotics or paradoxical disinhibition related to benzodiazepines:

"You're not really that worried about sedation in actively dying patients. Similar with antipsychotics, you're worried about extrapyramidal side effects but you're not as worried about excess sedation. Just because you're not worried about it, doesn't mean the family is not worried about it".

"I worry less about sedation because sedation can help calm the situation, and I worry more about increased delirium, agitation, or fall risk".

However, clinicians were aware of the families' concerns about sedation, recognizing the challenges of balancing what is best for the patient with what is best for supporting the family:

"Sometimes the problem is more the family than the patient really. They see a minor change and they're very upset. They may want two things that are hard to do. One, might want an alert, calm patient, which might not be possible. Because to make the patient calm, they might have to be a little sleepier than they've been; groggy from the medicine, you know".

### Paradoxical reaction to midazolam in patients undergoing endoscopy under sedation: incidence, risk factors and the effect of flumazenil [^114vc6X6]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence, risk factors and management strategy of paradoxical reaction to midazolam during endoscopy are yet to be clarified.

Methods

This single center prospective study included 4140 adult patients (2263 males, mean age of 57.7 ± 12.6) undergoing endoscopy under sedation with midazolam and pethidine between September 2011 and December 2011. The characteristics of patients with and without paradoxical reaction were compared. For patients who experienced paradoxical reaction and received flumazenil, their endoscopic images were reviewed to assess whether European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines were met as quality indicator of endoscopy.

Results

The incidence of paradoxical reaction was 1.4%. In multivariate analyses, male gender, unsuccessful sedation in previous endoscopy, upper endoscopy, higher dose of midazolam, and lower dose of pethidine were identified as independent risk factors for paradoxical reaction. Despite paradoxical reaction, endoscopic procedures were successfully completed in 93.3% of cases when flumazenil was administered. The rates of meeting quality indicator of endoscopy were 92.3% in patients receiving flumazenil for paradoxical reaction and 97.6% in patients without paradoxical reaction.

Conclusions

For patients with risk factors for paradoxical reaction, active use of pethidine with a dose reduction of midazolam might be helpful to prevent the occurrence of paradoxical reaction. Administration of flumazenil might be positively considered in cases of paradoxical reaction.

### End-of-life care in patients with cancer 16–24 years of age [^1161xjfW]. Current Oncology Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Opiates are considered the first-line medication for end-of-life dyspnea. Psychostimulants (modafinil and methylphenidate) are sometimes used and may be beneficial for end-of-life fatigue. Steroids are another viable option; however, neither class of medication has been extensively studied for this indication. Blood transfusions can also be used to increase energy levels in those with low platelets.

Psychostimulants may also be used at the end of life in order to elevate mood, counter opioid-induced sedation, increase appetite, improve cognition, and potentiate the analgesic effect of opioids.

Psychotropic medications FDA approved for mood and anxiety symptoms (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs) may be used in this setting, recognizing that some of them require weeks before reaching full efficacy. Thus, faster acting agents (such as stimulants) might be required at the end of life. Ketamine can be used for depressive symptoms as well. Not yet commercially available, psilocybin appears to have a positive impact on mood, anxiety and cancer-related psychiatric distress.

Benzodiazepines can be effectively used in patients with seizures, catatonia, air hunger, or severe treatment-resistant nausea, assuming there is no adverse reaction. Despite little data supporting the use of benzodiazepines as an anxiety treatment, they are often prescribed for this indication as well. Some individuals dislike the effects and find it difficult to use coping skills while under their influence, others report paradoxical, agitated reactions. Additional concerns include increased risk for dependence, decreased slow wave (most restorative) sleep, anterograde amnesia, delirium, and worsening of PTSD, such as medical trauma. Given these risks and lack of supporting data for their use for anxiety, benzodiazepines are not recommended for this indication unless other approaches have failed, patient prefers this medication, and/or patient is expected to survive only a few weeks or less.

### Efficacy and safety of Z-substances in the management of insomnia in older adults: a systematic review for the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^112RwTwv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Insomnia is a major healthcare problem in the Western world. It is defined as a dissatisfaction with the quantity or quality of sleep and is associated with difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep as well as with early-morning waking with an inability to return to sleep. Approximately 6 to 10% of adults experience insomnia that meets diagnostic criteria. Insomnia is more commonly experienced by older adults and can occur independently or be caused by other diseases.

Benzodiazepine-like medications (BDLM), also called Z-drugs, are a chemically heterogenous group defined by their mechanism of action: a selectivity for certain γ- aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunits that distinguishes them from Benzodiazepines (BDZ).

Over the last 5 years zolpidem has been the most frequently prescribed hypnotic worldwide. In the year of 2017, zolpidem and zopiclone were the top two prescribed BDLM in Europe. Various studies confirm the high prescription rate of Z-drugs in community-dwelling, hospitalized and nursing home patients, with prescribing rates highest for older women.

BDLM are licensed only for short-term use. This restriction entails a paradox, as the vast majority of afflicted patients is in need of long-term treatment.

The time restriction on BDLM use is attributable to their effect-risk profile, where negative impact multiplies with prolonged duration of treatment and benefits decrease or stay steady at best.

BDLM were expected to achieve the strong sedative and hypnotic effects desired, while avoiding the anxiolytic, myorelaxant, analgesic, and anticonvulsant side effects of Benzodiazepines. It was hypothesized that there was a link between receptor subtype selectivity and the reduction of side effects.

However, recent studies point to hang-over effects including impairment of cognitive and memory functions on the day after use the development of rebound insomnia after discontinuation of therapy, and most strikingly a lack of difference to BDZ in the rapid induction of tolerance, as well as a high risk of addiction resulting in an increasing proportion of chronic users and abusers.

### Enhancing neuronal chloride extrusion rescues α ₂ / α 3 GABA-mediated analgesia in neuropathic pain [^117CitoX]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Spinal disinhibition has been hypothesized to underlie pain hypersensitivity in neuropathic pain. Apparently contradictory mechanisms have been reported, raising questions on the best target to produce analgesia. Here, we show that nerve injury is associated with a reduction in the number of inhibitory synapses in the spinal dorsal horn. Paradoxically, this is accompanied by a BDNF-TrkB-mediated upregulation of synaptic GABA A Rs and by an α1-to-α2GABA A R subunit switch, providing a mechanistic rationale for the analgesic action of the α2,3GABA A R benzodiazepine-site ligand L838,417 after nerve injury. Yet, we demonstrate that impaired Cl - extrusion underlies the failure of L838,417 to induce analgesia at high doses due to a resulting collapse in Cl - gradient, dramatically limiting the benzodiazepine therapeutic window. In turn, enhancing KCC2 activity not only potentiated L838,417-induced analgesia, it rescued its analgesic potential at high doses, revealing a novel strategy for analgesia in pathological pain, by combined targeting of the appropriate GABA A R-subtypes and restoring Cl - homeostasis.

### Zebrafish behavioural profiling identifies GABA and serotonin receptor ligands related to sedation and paradoxical excitation [^1151j7yf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

A second approach to target identification was to test the binding affinity of hit compounds against a panel of 43 human and rodent neurotransmitter-related targets. Of 46 hit compounds, 33 of them bound to at least one of 19 receptors at a K i < 10 μM (Fig. 3c, d). Several hit compounds bound to multiple targets, including compound 7145248, which bound to TSPO, the benzodiazepine receptor (BZP), dopamine transporter, and the alpha 2b receptor (Fig. 3d). The most common targets (binding > 5 compounds) included BZP, sigma 2, HTR2A/B/C, HTR6, and TSPO (Fig. 3c, d). TSPO, previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) (because it was originally identified as a binding site for benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs), is a mitochondrial protein that supplies cholesterol to steroid-producing enzymes in the brain. TSPO ligands are thought to enhance GABAergic signaling by increasing neurosteroid production. However, some TSPO ligands, including benzodiazepines and zolpidem, also bind to GABA A Rs directly. We found that 14 hit compounds bound to TSPO in vitro (Fig. 3c, d), and that two TSPO reference ligands, PK 11195 and AC 5216, both caused eASRs in vivo (Fig. 3e). Of the 14 compounds that bound to TSPO in vitro, 5 compounds potentiated GABA A R in FLIPR assays (Fig. 3c; 2f, green arrowheads). These data suggest that TSPO ligands promote anesthetic-related phenotypes via direct interactions with GABA A Rs, indirect effects on neurosteroidogenesis, or both.

### Lorazepam (Ativan) [^111pW6Dr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects occurring with high doses.

In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to Ativan (lorazepam) was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age.

Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions/seizures, tremor, vertigo, eye function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations.

Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by Ativan (lorazepam).

### Non-pharmacological management of primary and secondary insomnia among older people: review of assessment tools and treatments [^117H5CGa]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Background

primary and secondary insomnia, especially among older adults, is frequently encountered by family physicians. Pharmacological interventions, although effective in some circumstances, can be detrimental in others. Non-pharmacological management of insomnia may allow the patients to self-administer the treatment.

Objectives

review of published literature of assessment tools and treatments for primary and secondary insomnia.

Results

two frequently used self-reporting methods for obtaining sleep data are sleep diaries and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. A large amount of research supports the use of non-pharmacological treatments such as stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, multi-component therapy and paradoxical intention.

Conclusion

assessing the nature of insomnia by using an effective assessment tool and providing patients with a non-pharmacological treatment should be the first intervention for insomnia. It is shown that non-pharmacological treatments for primary and secondary insomnia are feasible and effective alternatives to the use of benzodiazepines, and that family physicians should consider these when managing older patients with insomnia.

### Efficacy of combination therapy with dexmedetomidine for benzodiazepines-induced disinhibition during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^112QGEyU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam and midazolam, are often used for conscious sedation in anticipation of anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic effects during endoscopic procedures. However, cases exist in which a paradoxical response, such as excessive movement, multivalency, and aggression, has been described. The outcome of ERCP is sometimes affected by the patient being in a prone position. If a patient is likely to feel pain during ERCP, deeper sedation is required than for gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, the repeated use of benzodiazepines increases the risk of a paradoxical response, sometimes making it difficult to complete the procedure. More recently in prior studies, propofol has been widely used for sedation in endoscopic procedures. Kiriyama and colleaguesdescribed how propofol has advantages with regard to the strength of sedation and speed of waking. However, propofol increases the dose-dependent frequency of respiratory depression, and must be used carefully when for general use.

DEX exerts its effect through the alpha-2 receptor present in the locus ceruleus. Since the alpha-2 receptor is involved in sedation, analgesia, anxiety, and sympathetic nerve blockade, DEX shows a wide range of pharmacological actions, including sedation, analgesia, and anxiolytic activity. In addition, DEX has little affinity for gamma-aminobutyric receptors, characterized by almost no respiratory depression. However, sympathetic blockade may cause hypotension or bradycardia. The usefulness of DEX sedation has been reported in endoscopic submucosal dissection, but is considered controversial in ERCP. Mazanikov and colleaguesreported that DEX alone is insufficient during ERCP. Lee and colleaguesdescribed how combined DEX and midazolam maintains a good sedation level, and shows fewer adverse events. The utility of a combined regimen of DEX and midazolam during ERCP has been shown in previous studies. However, to our knowledge, reports examining the effectiveness of DEX combined with BZD-induced disinhibition as a paradoxical response have not been described.

### Benzodiazepine discontinuation and mortality among patients receiving long-term benzodiazepine therapy [^115VuM7u]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this emulated trial of benzodiazepine discontinuation among adults prescribed a stable long-term benzodiazepine regimen, there were small absolute increases in mortality and additional harms. Given the interest in reducing long-term prescribing, it will be important to conduct prospective studies or use observational approaches to replicate these findings and examine characteristics of patients and the discontinuation process that either attenuate or exacerbate this association. In addition, given questions raised about the safety of discontinuing benzodiazepine prescriptions among stable long-term users, clinicians should be judicious in initiating new prescriptions and carefully limit conversion to long-term use.

### A theory of the anxiolytic action of flumazenil in anxiety disorders [^1117Hh1T]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent affecting up to 33.7% of people over a lifetime. Although many treatment options are available, they are often associated with unacceptable side-effect profiles and approximately one in three patients are treatment resistant. Allopregnanolone, a neuroactive steroid acting as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABA A receptor, is synthesised in response to stress and acts to negatively modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Findings

After chronic exposure to and withdrawal from allopregnanolone, an increase in α 4 β 2 δ GABA A receptors results in a reduced inhibitory effect of allopregnanolone, resulting in decreased inhibition and, therefore, increased neuronal excitability. The relationship between allopregnanolone and increased α 4 β 2 δ GABA A receptors has been demonstrated in animal models during methamphetamine withdrawal and puberty, events both associated with stress. The effect of allopregnanolone during these events is anxiogenic, a paradoxical action to its usual anxiolytic effects. Flumazenil, the GABA A receptor antagonist, has been shown to cause receptor internalisation of α 4 β 2 δ GABA A receptors, which may results in anxiolysis.

Conclusion

We propose that chronic stress and chronic exposure to and withdrawal from allopregnanolone in anxiety disorders result in alterations in GABA A receptor function, which can be corrected by flumazenil. As such, flumazenil may exhibit anxiolytic properties in patients with increased α 4 β 2 δ GABA A receptor expression.

### Euphoric effect induced by zolpidem: a case study of magnetoencephalography [^1173iGvd]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent, is recommended in guidelines as a first-line treatment for insomnia: 'We suggest that clinicians use zolpidem as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance of insomnia (vs no treatment) in adults'. Compared with traditional benzodiazepines, zolpidem is a powerful selective agonist of the ω1 receptor subtype of the γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor complex. Classical benzodiazepines have a non-specific affinity for the BZ1 (ω1) and BZ2 (ω2) receptors of the GABAA receptor. Thus, zolpidem is considered to have fewer adverse reactions than benzodiazepines. However, since zolpidem was approved for medical use, an ever-increasing number of case reports describe abuse or dependence complications. To our knowledge, 80 cases of zolpidem dependence have been reported in the literature thus far; in these reports, zolpidem doses ranged from 10 to 2000 mg daily. Among the various reported effects of the drug, we were especially interested in the paradoxical 'euphoric' effect of zolpidem. This effect was also found with other benzodiazepines — occurring in less than 1% of the participants of large epidemiological studies who used this drug.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) performs non-invasive functional imaging by recording magnetic flux on the head's surface associated with electrical currents in activated sets of neurons. Since MEG uses neuromagnetic signals that penetrate the skull and scalp without distortion, it provides a method to gain evidence for understanding the neural mechanisms of the euphoric effect caused by high-dose zolpidem. This article reports the case of a female zolpidem-dependent patient whose MEG was measured periodically throughout her drug withdrawal treatment. Our aim was to explore the phenomenology of the zolpidem stimulant effect and its underlying mechanisms.

Table 3
Benzodiazepine dosing and metabolism for AWS

To treat AWS, best practice is for benzodiazepines to be used as part of an institutional protocol which guides physicians on appropriate use and dosing. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam have long half-lives as well as active metabolites and should be used with caution in patients with liver failure as the reduction in metabolism may lead to oversedation. In rare cases, benzodiazepines may cause paradoxical excitation which may mimic the symptoms of AWS. AWS refractory to benzodiazepines may be present if severe symptoms are not controlled after 50 mg of diazepam or 10 milligrams of lorazepam in the first hour of treatment, or 200 mg diazepam or 40 mg lorazepam in the first 3 hours of treatment.

Phenobarbital

Recommendation

Phenobarbital is a safe and effective pharmacologic agent for use in prevention and treatment of AWS. A fixed-dose approach is recommended due to the pharmacokinetics and long half-life of phenobarbital.

Discussion

Benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed and best studied medications in the management of AWS. However, their use can result in aspiration, respiratory depression, and worsening delirium. Patients in the surgical ICU are often already at high risk for developing delirium secondary to critical illness, traumatic brain injuries, surgical interventions, and other traumatic injuries.

Phenobarbital is an antiepileptic drug used as an alternative for the prevention of AWS. It is cross-tolerant with alcohol, upregulates GABA activity to prolong the duration of chloride channel opening, and decreases glutamate activity by binding to the 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and kainite receptors. Benefits of using phenobarbital include its availability in multiple formulations, ability to assess dosing by serum level, and long half-life (80 to 120 hours). Of note, although there has been demonstration in the literature of a dose-response in regard to serum phenobarbital levels, it is unclear whether there is a universal "therapeutic" phenobarbital dose for AWS and this treatment should be individualized at this time. Several studies have shown phenobarbital can be used safely; however, adverse events include respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. Unlike benzodiazepines, there is no reversal agent for phenobarbital.

OVERDOSAGE:

Clinical Presentation

Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.

Management of Overdose

In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway maintenance. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.

Consider contacting a poison center (1–800–222–1222), poisoncontrol.org, or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.

### Aggravation of epilepsy by anti-epileptic drugs [^115Vt3YM]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The possibility that so-called anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) may aggravate epilepsy must always be borne in mind by the clinician. Many reports of such aggravation of seizures have been published. Most such reports are anecdotal and speculative, and suggest that many such reactions are idiosyncratic. However, for some there is a sufficient body of evidence to suggest that some AEDs used in certain epilepsies may consistently cause worsening of seizures. Seizure aggravation may include increase in the frequency or severity of existing seizures, emergence of new types of seizure, or the occurrence of status epilepticus. The pathophysiology of seizure aggravation is poorly understood including non-specific effects such as those associated with sedation, drug-induced encephalopathy, and paradoxical or inverse pharmacodynamic effects. For some epilepsies the choice of AEDs may be inappropriate, and although the mechanism of seizure aggravation is not clear, its occurrence may be fairly predictable. This is best documented for the use of carbamazepine in idiopathic generalized and myoclonic epilepsies. Most other AEDs have been reported occasionally to cause seizure aggravation. The lowest risk of seizure aggravation appears to be with valproate. Risk factors for worsening of seizures are epileptic encephalopathy, polytherapy, high frequency of seizures, and cognitive impairment. Advances in pharmacogenomics may in the future enable such adverse effects to be predicted for individual patients. Meanwhile, a systematic approach to reporting AED-induced seizure aggravation should be developed.

### Lack of direct involvement of a diazepam long-term treatment in the occurrence of irreversible cognitive impairment: a pre-clinical approach [^111gRYfB]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, the measurement of anxiety levels performed a few days before mid-treatment blood sampling evidenced an increase in anxiety in groups treated with diazepam 15 and 30 mg/kg/day, shown by a lower exploration of the open arms. The anxiety levels were not correlated with nordiazepam or oxazepam plasma concentrations suggesting that this effect was not dose-dependent. The confounding influence of sedation on this result was ruled out by comparing the distances traveled by the mice during the task, which was not significantly different in the treated groups compared to the control group (data not shown). This outcome was further supported by results in the OFT performed in middle-aged mice, which, although showing a trend toward a dose-dependent decrease in the exploratory activity in the diazepam-treated animals, did not reveal any significant difference between groups. This anxiogenic-like effect may be related to a paradoxical effect of benzodiazepines as previously described for several positive GABA-A modulators, such as allopregnanolone, barbiturates, ethanol, and benzodiazepines including diazepam.

### Deprescribing benzodiazepines among hospitalised older adults: quality improvement initiative [^113KdZS4]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Problem

Benzodiazepine usage among seniors is a significant problem. Within Alberta Health Services — Edmonton zone, during the fiscal year 2015/2016, an estimated 49 000 geriatric patients 60 or older (20.7% of the total population) were taking benzodiazepines. The use of benzodiazepines among seniors is of a growing concern due to their significant side-effect profileand limited clinical indications for their use. As a consequence, these medications have been classified as being 'potentially inappropriate medications' for seniors. Commonly recognised short-term side effects include cognitive changes, delirium, dizziness, insomnia and paradoxical agitation; physical and psychological dependence, increased falls and accidents can occur with long-term use. Advancing age is a significant risk factor for developing side effects (relative risk 2.45). Despite this, benzodiazepine prescriptions are common in seniors, with the most commonly quoted reasons for prescribing benzodiazepines being for the treatment of insomnia, anxiety and delirium; an estimated 5%–33% of the elderly population receives benzodiazepine (or benzodiazepine receptor agonists) prescriptions for sleep problems.

The Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital is a tertiary rehabilitation and academic teaching hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. The hospital has two geriatric focused units (35/36 beds). Each unit has its own dedicated multidisciplinary team comprising one or more care of the elderly (COE) physicians (ie, family physicians trained in the COE). The units are served by a ward-based geriatric pharmacist who conducts structured medication reviews for all newly admitted patients and subsequent routine weekly medication reviews. In addition, the medical stability of the study patient population and the close monitoring provided by the healthcare team within this institutional setting provided an ideal environment in which to conduct this study.

The frequent usage of benzodiazepines, particularly among hospitalised seniors, was identified during routine clinical practice at the lead author's local institution and was subsequently confirmed through prospective data collection over a 1-month period. These data also revealed a trend towards inappropriate benzodiazepine prescribing and highlighted an absence of usage of any patient education material about benzodiazepine use. Although benzodiazepine deprescribing was occurring, it was incomplete by the time of discharge. We aimed to have all benzodiazepine users who are admitted to two geriatric units at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital deprescribed or to have their dosage reduced by at least 50% within a 3-month period.

### Enhancing neuronal chloride extrusion rescues α ₂ / α 3 GABA-mediated analgesia in neuropathic pain [^112tm3Ur]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

It remains that the loss of KCC2 significantly mitigates the efficacy of GABA A enhancing drugs. A prediction from this is that drugs counteracting the depolarization of E GABA subsequent to increased Cl − influx can enhance the analgesic efficacy of benzodiazepines. Consistent with this was the demonstration that the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, which causes a collapse of the depolarizing HCO 3 −, enhanced the analgesic efficacy of midazolam. The strategy remains limited however because it does not counteract the deleterious effect of the collapse in Cl − gradient resulting from KCC2 hypofunction. In contrast, our results with CLP257 indicate that enhancing KCC2 can improve benzodiazepine-induced analgesia on a dual front: enhancing their potency and extending their window of efficacy by preventing their paradoxical loss of efficacy at high doses (Fig. 8), consistent with earlier predictions. Inhibiting NKCC1, which normally imports Cl −, could appear as a potential alternative to enhancing KCC2. However, the latter has the advantage of offering i) a selective CNS target, avoiding side effect liability of targeting NKCC1 and ii) enhancing Cl − extrusion, thus directly counteracting Cl − load resulting from enhancing GABA A function. As KCC2 is absent from primary afferents and their terminals, the synergistic action between L838,417 and CLP257 selectively targets SDH neurons. Such KCC2-enhancer in combination with the proper benzodiazepine can be considered as a promising therapeutic combination. Despite the poor pharmacokinetic profile of CLP257, it was possible to significantly improve benzodiazepine-induced maximal analgesia. This is promising for future, improved versions, of KCC2 enhancers. Our recent finding that microglia-BDNF maintains KCC2 downregulation even at 3 months post-injury in rats indicates that this therapeutic strategy may be relevant to long-term chronic conditions.

### Efficacy of combination therapy with dexmedetomidine for benzodiazepines-induced disinhibition during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^111wQSoH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal endoscopy alone is uncomfortable and sometimes painful for many patients. Endoscopy under conscious sedation not only reduces pain, but may also be associated with the completion of the procedure as well as improved treatment results. In particular, the scopes used for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are thicker, and require deeper sedation than for gastrointestinal endoscopy. In addition, since ERCP includes drainage, stent placement, and stone extraction, meaning it is more invasive than other endoscopic procedures, the burden on patients is quite heavy. Deeper sedation and fewer body movements are necessary in order for patients to undergo stable treatment. However, increasing the amount of sedatives can cause airway obstruction, as well as respiratory and circulatory depression associated with deep sedation.

Therefore, benzodiazepines (BZDs; e.g. diazepam, midazolam) and analgesics are often used for conscious sedation during EUS or ERCP. Combination therapy with analgesics is known to synergize sedative effects, and allows a reduction in the amount of sedative used and frequency of adverse events. However, BZDs sometimes cause paradoxical reactions such as disinhibition (e.g. excessive movement), making it difficult to continue the endoscopic procedure. Yet reports that review the incidence of BZD-induced disinhibition during endoscopic procedures and their frequency are lacking.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a short-acting selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, with both sedative and analgesic effects, used for conscious sedation in intensive care units and treatment under local anesthesia. Since DEX can also be used in nonintubation procedures, it is reported to be useful for endoscopic procedures. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of DEX in comparison with midazolam during ERCP. – Because the administration method is somewhat complicated, DEX is not used for all cases during EUS or ERCP, and it is currently undecided what kind of case it should be used for. In addition, reports on the effect of DEX on patients with BZD-induced disinhibition are unknown.

The study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of DEX combined with BZDs in patients who had difficulty in continuing ERCP due to BZD-induced disinhibition during the procedure.

### Comparative safety of medications for severe agitation: a geriatric emergency department guidelines 2.0 systematic review [^111WNEPo]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study suggests that clinical scenarios requiring the use of parenteral medications — either intramuscular or intravenous — should be minimized and, when absolutely necessary, approached with caution. Specifically, our data do not support the co‐administration of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine to older adults. While we did not observe a significant sample of co‐administered antipsychotic‐anxiolytic for direct comparison, the excessive risk posed by midazolam alone is too high to justify its use in older adults either alone or in conjunction with an antipsychotic. Moreover, there were no additional benefits gained with midazolam administration, as redosing rates were higher. It is unclear why increased redosing was observed among such patients, though it may be potentially attributable to paradoxical worsening of agitation, which has been described with older adults given benzodiazepines. While midazolam demonstrated an unfavorable safety profile, the same pattern was not replicated with the only other benzodiazepine, lorazepam, reported in our review. Unlike midazolam, lorazepam is readily available in both oral and parenteral formulations in most EDs, and the highly prevalent use of oral formulations likely confounded our pooled analyses. Regardless, concerningly high frequencies of adverse events were seen at higher doses of lorazepam and with parenteral administrations. Additionally, there is adequate evidence from alternative clinical settings that the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria recommends against the use of benzodiazepines independent of condition/diagnosis (though such recommendations also exist for antipsychotics). However, emergency clinicians still may be confronted with patients with agitation necessitating the use of benzodiazepines, namely older adults with known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.

### Intrathecal baclofen overdose with paradoxical autonomic features mimicking withdrawal [^116L3FHV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) has become an increasingly common treatment for severe muscle spasticity associated with conditions such as cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury. Classically, withdrawal symptoms mimic symptoms of serotonin syndrome with hypertension, increased spasticity, clonus, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and possibly acute psychosis. Hypotension, muscle flaccidity, and respiratory depression are generally considered symptoms of toxicity or overdose.

Case Report

We present the case of a male with recent ITB pump revision who presented with autonomic features suggestive of Baclofen withdrawal, while the remainder of his physical examination suggested appropriate medication dosing. Interrogation of the patient's ITB pump revealed normal function, and the patient had no clinical change with intravenous benzodiazepines, but his condition ultimately improved when his Baclofen dosing was decreased, indicating toxicity instead of withdrawal. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? As Baclofen pump use increases, the importance of recognizing these potentially life-threatening complications also increases. This case presents the emergency physician with an atypical presentation and emphasizes the importance of a thorough neurologic examination to diagnose patients accurately.

### Benzodiazepines: risks and benefits. A reconsideration [^115m6BNC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there have been further developments in our knowledge of the risks and benefits of benzodiazepines, and of the risks and benefits of alternatives to benzodiazepines. Representatives drawn from the Psychopharmacology Special Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Association for Psychopharmacology together examined these developments, and have provided this joint statement with recommendations for clinical practice. The working group was mindful of widespread concerns about benzodiazepines and related anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs. The group believes that whenever benzodiazepines are prescribed, the potential for dependence or other harmful effects must be considered. However, the group also believes that the risks of dependence associated with long-term use should be balanced against the benefits that in many cases follow from the short or intermittent use of benzodiazepines and the risk of the underlying conditions for which treatment is being provided.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide capsules (not applicable) [^111zKn7x]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

In debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia, oversedation or confusion (not more than 2 Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide capsules per day initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). In general, the concomitant administration of Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide and other psychotropic agents is not recommended. If such combination therapy seems indicated, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed - particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as the MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed.

Paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, e.g., excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be watched for during Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide therapy. The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride.

Information for Patients

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride and Clidinium Bromide is used with opioids or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.

Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Clonazepam (Klonopin) [^111YVCJn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Worsening of Seizures

When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, Klonopin may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Klonopin may produce absence status.

Loss of Effect

In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within 3 months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy.

Laboratory Testing During Long-Term Therapy

Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with Klonopin.

Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions

Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, irritability, aggression, anxiety, anger, nightmares, hallucinations, and psychoses are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric). Should this occur, the use of the drug should be discontinued gradually (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence). Paradoxical reactions are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly.

Caution in Renally Impaired Patients

Metabolites of Klonopin are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function.

Hypersalivation

Klonopin may produce an increase in salivation. This should be considered before giving the drug to patients who have difficulty handling secretions.

Respiratory Depression

Klonopin may cause respiratory depression and should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea).

Porphyria

Klonopin may have a porphyrogenic effect and should be used with care in patients with porphyria.

Information for Patients

A Klonopin Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time Klonopin is dispensed, as required by law. Patients should be instructed to take Klonopin only as prescribed. Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Klonopin:

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Klonopin is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (see WARNINGS: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, e.g., excitement, stimulation and acute rage, have been reported in psychiatric patients and should be watched for during Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride/Clidinium Bromide therapy. The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride.

Information for Patients

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Chlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride/Clidinium Bromide is used with opioids or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines, patients should be informed that, since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence, it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug.

Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Triazolam [^115TWwTY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Central Nervous System Manifestations

An increase in daytime anxiety has been reported for triazolam after as few as 10 days of continuous use. In some patients this may be a manifestation of interdose withdrawal. If increased daytime anxiety is observed during treatment, discontinuation of treatment may be advisable.

A variety of abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics including triazolam. Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition, e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seem excessive, similar to that seen with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., sedative/hypnotics). Other kinds of behavioral changes have also been reported, for example, bizarre behavior, agitation, hallucinations, depersonalization. In primarily depressed patients, the worsening of depression, including suicidal thinking, has been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Some adverse reactions reported in association with the use of triazolam such as drowsiness, dizziness, light-headedness, and amnesia appear to be dose related. More serious behavioral phenomena such as confusion, bizarre or abnormal behavior, agitation, and hallucinations may also be dose related, but this evidence is inconclusive. Therapy should be initiated at the lowest effective dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.

Anterograde amnesia of varying severity and paradoxical reactions have been reported following recommended dosages of triazolam. Data from several sources suggest that anterograde amnesia may occur at a higher rate with triazolam than with other benzodiazepine hypnotics. Because triazolam can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.

Cases of "traveler's amnesia" have been reported by individuals who have taken triazolam to induce sleep while traveling, such as during an airplane flight. In some of these cases, insufficient time was allowed for the sleep period prior to awakening and before beginning activity. Also, the concomitant use of alcohol may have been a factor in some cases.

### Exacerbation of benign familial neonatal epilepsy induced by massive doses of phenobarbital and midazolam [^115Hjhme]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Barbiturates and benzodiazepines are the first-line anticonvulsants for neonatal seizures. However, in immature brains, those drugs may lead to paradoxical neuronal excitation.

Patient

A patient with benign familial neonatal epilepsy developed epileptic encephalopathy after massive doses of phenobarbital that were followed by a continuous infusion of midazolam on postnatal day 3. Electroencephalography revealed rhythmic delta activity in clusters with migrating epileptic foci. After discontinuation of both drugs, the patient's consciousness promptly improved and her electroencephalography normalized on postnatal day 5.

Results

This baby developed persistent electroencephalographic seizures due to massive doses of phenobarbital and midazolam.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be aware of this anticonvulsant-induced paradoxical neuronal excitation and the uncoupling phenomenon, especially in individuals with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, who have low seizure thresholds.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.

In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.

### Sedation methods for intra-articular corticosteroid injections in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a review [^112R74Pk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are commonly used for conscious sedation. The drug can be administered by oral, rectal, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous routes.

Midazolam is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for procedural sedation and analgesia. Time to peak effect for midazolam is brief with intravenous administration (2–3 min) and duration is short (45–60 min). Paradoxical reactions, characterized by inconsolable crying, combativeness, disorientation, agitation and restlessness, have been reported in 1–15% of children receiving midazolam. They have also been reported with intramuscular, intranasal, and rectal administration of benzodiazepines.

This method of sedation requires insertion of an intravenous cannula, which is often a distressing procedure for the children. In addition, midazolam has no analgesic property, so for painful procedures it is commonly administered together with an opioid, a practice that may decrease the safety profile of midazolam due to the possibility of respiratory depression. Due to the above, this method should only be used when adequate facilities for pediatric sedation and resuscitation are available. Midazolam can be used alone with local anesthesia as well in the cooperative child. Despite its disadvantages, it should be noted that when using standard precautions, the safety profile for midazolam is excellent and its anterograde amnestic effect is well recognized.

Ketamine

Ketamine hydrochloride is a phencyclidine that binds to NMDA receptors and promotes intense analgesia, sedation and amnesia. It induces a trancelike state in which the patient is unaware, but not necessarily asleep. It can be administered by oral, intravenous and intramuscular routes.

With intravenous administration, peak concentration is achieved within 1 minute, allowing an immediate clinical effect. This route of administration allows deep levels of sedation to be achieved with good tolerance of extremely painful procedures.

Ketamine administration results in sympathetic stimulation and may increase heart rate and blood pressure, as well as intracranial pressure. Additional side effects include increased salivation, vomiting and rarely, apnea or laryngospasm. Despite the above, its safety in sedation among children has been largely reported.

### Restoring consciousness with pharmacologic therapy: mechanisms, targets, and future directions [^112F3Coh]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methylphenidate inhibits dopamine reuptake, inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and is a weak agonist at the serotonin receptor. Few studies have examined the effectiveness of methylphenidate in promoting recovery from DoC, and evidence from randomized controlled trials is similarly lacking. Nevertheless, methylphenidate therapy continues to be reported as a pharmacologic neurostimulant utilized off-label in clinical practice in patients with DoC. Mechanistic support for this approach comes from a study of TBI patients without DoC, in whom methylphenidate administration increased connectivity between the ventral tegmental area and posteromedial complex (i.e. posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus).

Modafinil is believed to have therapeutic effects in patients with DoC through stimulation of histamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and orexin neurotransmitters and potential anti-oxidative effects. Neuroimaging studies found modafinil increased cerebral blood flow in the thalamus, locus coeruleus, limbic system, and insular cortex. However, observational reports of modafinil use in patients with DoC have revealed mixed results.

Paradoxical awakening after administration of GABA A receptor agonists zolpidem and benzodiazepines or the GABA B receptor agonist baclofen have been reported, leading to intense interest in identifying patients who are physiologically receptive to GABAergic therapy. Paradoxically increased conscious behaviors after zolpidem administration have been reported to occur in approximately 5% of patients with DoC. Zolpidem's preferential binding to the GABA A omega-1 receptor subtype in the globus pallidus interna may in part explain the paradoxical effectiveness of zolpidem in patients with DoC and supports the mesocirciut model. Baclofen has been theorized to promote emergence of consciousness either 1) through modulation of impulse transmission from spine to cortex, interfering with spasticity-induced proprioceptive outputs that may interfere with maintenance of alertness and awareness; or 2) through modulation of neurotransmission and functional restoration of cortico-thalamo-cortical connections.

### GABA induces a hormonal counter-regulatory response in subjects with long-standing type 1 diabetes [^112YjSB4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Short-term oral GABA treatment was not associated with any SAEs. AEs were registered in four subjects, but they were all mild and transient, mainly neurological sensations. In previous studies, fatigue and mild weakness have also been reported. In another study, 3 g of GABA caused mild transaminase increases in 2% of study subjects. Glucose control was maintained during the study period and the frequency of hypoglycemia did not increase.

In contrast to previous studies in which activation of the GABA-A receptor by benzodiazepines has been found to blunt the counter-regulatory response, we paradoxically found that the hormonal counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia was enhanced by GABA treatment. A tentative explanation for this difference in results is that GABA per se has limited capacity to cross the blood–brain barrier, while benzodiazepines easily cross to exert their effects in the CNS. The mechanism for the counter-regulatory failure induced by benzodiazepines has previously been shown to be lactate release in the ventromedial hypothalamus. Also, the metabolism of GABA and benzodiazepines differs, which could in turn impact the counter-regulatory response. The present study shows that if the peripheral effects of GABA are isolated, the hormonal counter-regulatory response instead become enhanced by yet unknown mechanisms. A possible explanation could be the activation of GABA-A receptors in other peripheral organs/tissues of importance for the hormonal counter-regulatory response. For instance, GABA-A receptor activation in chromaffin cells within the adrenal glands induces the secretion of catecholamines. The study period and sample size (number of subjects included) were, however, in this study too small to assess potential clinical benefits in hypoglycemia severity and frequency.

We conclude that the controlled-release formulation of GABA (Remygen) can be considered a safe treatment in T1D and that a larger, long-term clinical trial is warranted in order to further study the clinical potential of GABA as a drug for beta-cell regeneration and, in view of the findings in this study, hypoglycemia protection.

### Alprazolam, choline (gabazolamine) [^115X2cKr]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam (see WARNINGS).

To discontinue treatment in patients taking alprazolam, the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of alprazolam be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients. Therefore, the same precaution must be exercised when using doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day in treating patients with panic disorders as is exercised with the use of any psychotropic drug in treating depressed patients or those in whom there is reason to expect concealed suicidal ideation or plans.

As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation, rage, irritability, and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects, patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur, alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder, a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability, hostility, and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.

### Aggravation of epilepsy by antiepileptic drugs [^115axJCa]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs may paradoxically worsen seizure frequency or induce new seizure types in some patients with epilepsy. The mechanisms of seizure aggravation by antiepileptic drugs are mostly unknown and may be related to specific pharmacodynamic properties of these drugs. This article provides a review of the various clinical circumstances of seizure exacerbation and aggravation of epilepsy by antiepileptic drugs as well as a discussion of possible mechanisms underlying the occasional paradoxical effect of these drugs. Antiepileptic drug-induced seizure aggravation can occur virtually with all antiepileptic medications. Drugs that aggravate seizures are more likely to have only one or two mechanisms of action, either enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated transmission or blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Antiepileptic drug-induced seizure exacerbation should be considered and the accuracy of diagnosis of the seizure type should be questioned whenever there is seizure worsening or the appearance of new seizure types after the introduction of any antiepileptic medication.

### Triazolam (Halcion) [^115vR21g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6	Central Nervous System Manifestations

An increase in daytime anxiety has been reported for Halcion after as few as 10 days of continuous use. In some patients this may be a manifestation of interdose withdrawal. If increased daytime anxiety is observed during treatment, discontinuation of treatment may be advisable.

A variety of abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics including Halcion. Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition, e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seem excessive, similar to that seen with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., sedative/hypnotics). Other kinds of behavioral changes have also been reported, for example, bizarre behavior, agitation, hallucinations, depersonalization. In primarily depressed patients, the worsening of depression, including suicidal thinking, has been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Some adverse reactions reported in association with the use of Halcion such as drowsiness, dizziness, light-headedness, and amnesia appear to be dose related. More serious behavioral phenomena such as confusion, bizarre or abnormal behavior, agitation, and hallucinations may also be dose related, but this evidence is inconclusive. Therapy should be initiated at the lowest effective dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.

Anterograde amnesia of varying severity and paradoxical reactions have been reported following recommended dosages of Halcion. Data from several sources suggest that anterograde amnesia may occur at a higher rate with Halcion than with other benzodiazepine hypnotics. Because HALCION can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.

Cases of "traveler's amnesia" have been reported by individuals who have taken Halcion to induce sleep while traveling, such as during an airplane flight. In some of these cases, insufficient time was allowed for the sleep period prior to awakening and before beginning activity. Also, the concomitant use of alcohol may have been a factor in some cases.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^111YxUfb]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Sleep medications, which are sometimes prescribed for adults with insomnia, such as benzodiazepines or even antihistamines, can cause activation or agitation in some children and should be used with caution. There are no FDA-approved medications for sleep for pediatric insomnia. Antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, are frequently used by pediatricians for the management of sleep onset difficulties, although they might have a paradoxical effect in children under the age of 5 years. Since the long-term use of these medications in young children has yet to be studied, they are not recommended for long-term use for young children. Hydroxyzine can be started at a dose of 10 mg at bedtime and increased up to a maximum dose of 25 mg.

Zolpidem is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A agonist that has received FDA approval for short-term treatment of insomnia in individuals 18 years and older; it can be considered for sleep in teens and adults. Zolpidem is less useful for children who may be at risk for a paradoxical reaction from benzodiazepines. Zolpidem IR can be dosed at 5–10 mg at bedtime, and zolpidem ER can be dosed at 6.25–12.5 mg at bedtime.

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. While there is no data in the literature for children, the use of amitriptyline in low dosages is often effective for insomnia for children and adults with ASD. Start with a low dose of 5 mg at bedtime and increase weekly by 5 mg. Typically, it is effective in doses ≤ 50 mg at bedtime. Amitriptyline can cause constipation, which is common in individuals with ASD. Patients with prior heart disease will need an electrocardiogram (ECG) before they take amitriptyline, as it can prolong the time that the heart muscle takes to contract and relax (QTc cardiac interval).

For the patient who does not respond to medication for sleep disturbances, referral to a sleep specialist or psychiatrist is recommended. See Fig. 1 for pharmacological approaches to the treatment of sleep disturbances in individuals with ASD.

### Benzodiazepines revisited – will we ever learn? [^116DQKoY]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To re-examine various aspects of the benzodiazepines (BZDs), widely prescribed for 50 years, mainly to treat anxiety and insomnia. It is a descriptive review based on the Okey Lecture delivered at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, in November 2010.

Methods

A search of the literature was carried out in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Collaboration databases, using the codeword 'benzodiazepine(s)', alone and in conjunction with various terms such as 'dependence', 'abuse', etc. Further hand-searches were made based on the reference lists of key papers. As 60,000 references were found, this review is not exhaustive. It concentrates on the adverse effects, dependence and abuse.

Results

Almost from their introduction the BZDs have been controversial, with polarized opinions, advocates pointing out their efficacy, tolerability and patient acceptability, opponents deprecating their adverse effects, dependence and abuse liability. More recently, the advent of alternative and usually safer medications has opened up the debate. The review noted a series of adverse effects that continued to cause concern, such as cognitive and psychomotor impairment. In addition, dependence and abuse remain as serious problems. Despite warnings and guidelines, usage of these drugs remains at a high level. The limitations in their use both as choice of therapy and with respect to conservative dosage and duration of use are highlighted. The distinction between low-dose 'iatrogenic' dependence and high-dose abuse/misuse is emphasized.

Conclusions

The practical problems with the benzodiazepines have persisted for 50 years, but have been ignored by many practitioners and almost all official bodies. The risk-benefit ratio of the benzodiazepines remains positive in most patients in the short term (2–4 weeks) but is unestablished beyond that time, due mainly to the difficulty in preventing short-term use from extending indefinitely with the risk of dependence. Other research issues include the possibility of long-term brain changes and evaluating the role of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, in aiding withdrawal.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.

In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.

Consider contacting the Poison Help Line (1–800–222–1222), or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.

### The safety and efficacy of remimazolam, ciprofol, and propofol anesthesia in endoscopy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116zRa1A]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, remimazolam may lead to higher rates of cough and body movements. Our research indicated that when comparing the adverse effects of cough, the RR of ciprofol was 0.70 (95% CrI: 0.091–5.4) compared with propofol, with the evidence graded as high certainty. Our study was the first meta-analysis to observe that ciprofol had a lower incidence of cough compared to propofol. Due to the gastroscopy or bronchoscopy will be performed in the throat area, sudden unexpected cough may cause damage to unwanted tissues or nerves, which may be difficult to predict, it is crucial to constantly monitor any reactions of the patient during the PSA. However, propofol exhibited the highest incidence of neurological adverse effects, such as post-examination dizziness. These differences were not statistically significant, and no studies have reported serious neurological complications associated with any of the three drugs. As a benzodiazepine, greater consideration should be given to the possibility that remimazolam may induce paradoxical reactions. A study on dream induction reported that two patients experienced unpleasant dreams with remimazolam use. While this result does not significantly affect the overall comparison, attention should still be given to patient experience and neurological symptoms, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions. Reducing benzodiazepine use may improve sedation comfort in such cases.

### Euphoric effect induced by zolpidem: a case study of magnetoencephalography [^112P4Cas]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Initially, zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent, was considered to have fewer adverse reactions than traditional benzodiazepines. However, after zolpidem was approved for medical use, an increasing number of case reports have described abuse or dependence complications. We were especially interested in the cases of dependence that presented a paradoxical 'euphoric' effect of zolpidem. This article reports the case of a female zolpidem-dependent patient who presented with 6 years of daily use of 400–1400 mg of zolpidem. She reported subjective effects of euphoria, intense craving and the inability to stop drug ingestion. Her diagnoses were zolpidem dependence and a depressive episode induced by substance abuse. To explore the neural mechanisms of the euphoric effect caused by high-dose zolpidem, we performed repeated magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Before undergoing detoxification, her MEG results indicated that cerebellar electrical signal activation increased when taking high zolpidem doses. However, the prefrontal and parietal lobes' electrical signal activity showed a tendency to recover to a normal state as the withdrawal time progressed to completion. This case suggests that the cerebellum plays a role in the euphoria induced by high zolpidem doses and provides clues for further research.

### Sex-specific GABAergic microcircuits that switch vulnerability into resilience to stress and reverse the effects of chronic stress exposure [^111spz1a]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

When designing our chemogenetic stimulation protocol, we reasoned that drastically increasing GABAergic dendritic inhibition would interfere with activity-dependent plasticity at dendrites needed to increase the activity of target cells, as evidenced by the lack of antidepressant efficacy of benzodiazepines. Accordingly, we chose a low concentration of CNO (~0.2 mg/kg/h) at, if not below, the threshold required for measurable hM3Dq-induced changes in neural activity in vitro. Future experiments will need to establish the optimal level of SST neuron activation for the most effective reversal of chronic stress effects.

Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for the lack of antidepressant efficacy of benzodiazepines, which predominantly potentiate GABA A receptors underlying phasic inhibition. Benzodiazepines enhance inhibition indiscriminately at dendrites, soma, and AIS of virtually all neurons along the neuraxis, which underlies their rapid action as anxiolytics, sedatives, and myorelaxants. However, studies in mice indicate that chronically increased inhibition of PNs at the soma and AIS by PV INs has detrimental effects. On the contrary, we show that selective chronic inhibition at dendrites of PNs by SST-INs, most likely through α5-GABA A receptors (perhaps with a contribution of α2-GABA A receptors), holds promise as a target for antidepressants. Accordingly, we propose that SST INs are acutely neuro-protective during stress exposure and correspondingly high network load by limiting NMDA receptor-mediated Ca 2+ influx into dendrites via activation of postsynaptic GABA A receptors. This mechanism of GABAergic inhibition would be potentiated by benzodiazepines, which are known to be acutely neuroprotective. Subsequently, SST IN activation in between and after stressful periods facilitates the recovery of PNs through potentiation of tonic inhibition, which paradoxically increases the excitability of PNs. As a possible mechanism, tonic inhibition of dendrites through α5-GABA A receptors has been shown to lead to de-inactivation of t-type voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, which then increases dendritic excitability and pyramidal cell output. Benzodiazepine-mediated potentiation of postsynaptic GABA A receptors and corresponding strong hyperpolarization at dendrites and the soma and AIS is likely to override SST IN-mediated activation of PNs at dendrites, which explains the absence of antidepressant properties.

### The relationship of sedation to deliberate self-extubation [^115toAnN]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To evaluate the relationship between sedative therapy and self-extubation in a large medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU).

Design

Retrospective, case-controlled study.

Setting

Large teaching hospital.

Patients

All adult patients who underwent unplanned self-extubation during a 12-month period (n = 50). Each patient was matched to two control patients who did not self-extubate based on age, gender, dates in hospital and diagnosis.

Interventions

none.

Measurements

Data collected included time to self extubation, dosages and types of benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics, antipsychotics, and hypnotics. Data on the degree of agitation as assessed by nursing staff also were obtained.

Main Results

When compared to controls, patients in the self-extubation group were more likely to have received benzodiazepines (59% vs. 35%; p < 0.05), but equally likely to have received opioids and/or paralytic drugs. Patients who self-extubated were twice as likely as controls to be agitated (54% vs. 22%; p < 0.05). Use of benzodiazepines was more common in agitated patients than in nonagitated patients (62% vs. 35%; p < 0.02). Among nonagitated patients who self-extubated, increased use of benzodiazepines (57% vs. 29%; p < 0.05) was noted when compared to nonagitated controls.

Conclusions

In intubated ICU patients, benzodiazepines may not consistently treat agitation effectively or prevent self-extubation. Such an effect may be due to paradoxical excitation, disorientation during long-term administration, or differences in drug administration between ICU and operating room (OR) environments.

### Sex-specific GABAergic microcircuits that switch vulnerability into resilience to stress and reverse the effects of chronic stress exposure [^117DZp9o]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical and preclinical studies have identified somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons as critical elements that regulate the vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders. Conversely, disinhibition of SST neurons in mice results in resilience to the behavioral effects of chronic stress. Here, we established a low-dose chronic chemogenetic protocol to map these changes in positively and negatively motivated behaviors to specific brain regions. AAV-hM3Dq-mediated chronic activation of SST neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PLC) had antidepressant drug-like effects on anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behaviors in male but not female mice. Analogous manipulation of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) had such effects in female but not male mice. Moreover, the activation of SST neurons in the PLC of male mice and the vHPC of female mice resulted in stress resilience. Activation of SST neurons in the PLC reversed prior chronic stress-induced defects in motivated behavior in males but was ineffective in females. Conversely, activation of SST neurons in the vHPC reversed chronic stress-induced behavioral alterations in females but not males. Quantitation of c-Fos + and FosB + neurons in chronic stress-exposed mice revealed that chronic activation of SST neurons leads to a paradoxical increase in pyramidal cell activity. Collectively, these data demonstrate that GABAergic microcircuits driven by dendrite targeting interneurons enable sex- and brain-region-specific neural plasticity that promotes stress resilience and reverses stress-induced anxiety- and anhedonia-like motivated behavior. The data provide a rationale for the lack of antidepressant efficacy of benzodiazepines and superior efficacy of dendrite-targeting, low-potency GABA A receptor agonists, independent of sex and despite striking sex differences in the relevant brain substrates.

### Benzodiazepine use in relation to long-term dementia risk and imaging markers of neurodegeneration: a population-based study [^116PD2G2]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in developed countries, and the number of prescriptions is increasing. Approximately 10% of the adult European population is using benzodiazepines, increasing with age up to 30% in people aged 65 years or older. Guidelines discourage long-term use due to risk of psychological and physical dependence, falls, and cognitive impairment, especially in older adults. Nevertheless, approximately 30–40% of older benzodiazepine users continues use beyond the recommended period of several weeks. This increasing trend of prolonged use of benzodiazepines raises concerns about potential long-term adverse effects, in particular on cognitive ability and dementia risk.

Benzodiazepine use has well-established acute effects on cognition through GABAergic effects, which may persist long after withdrawal. Long-term effects, however, are uncertain and need not be purely detrimental. On the basis of animal studies, benzodiazepine exposure might have neuroprotective effects through reduced neuroinflammation and mitigating ApoE-induced phosphorylation and dysregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis as well as detrimental effects on dementia pathology through augmentation of tau phosphorylation, amyloid deposition, and reduction of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Several observational studies have investigated whether these observations translate also into altered dementia risk in humans. Results from two recent meta-analyses suggest that use of benzodiazepines is associated with higher dementia risk, indicating that the harmful effects of benzodiazepine might outweigh any protective effects. However, causal inference from the included studies was hampered by methodological and statistical heterogeneity. Reversed causation, confounding by indication, and residual confounding in particular raised doubt about the causal interpretation of observations. Anxiety and sleep disturbances are suggested to be independent risk factors for dementia, and consequent prescription of benzodiazepine medication against anxiety or sleep disturbances may lead to spurious associations between benzodiazepine use and dementia (i.e. confounding-by-indication). Moreover, symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbances frequently occur in the prodromal phase of dementia, in response to perceived decline in cognitive ability or as a consequence of shared neurobiological pathways between dementia, anxiety, and sleep disorders. In this context too, spurious associations can arise due to prescription of benzodiazepines in response to prodromal features of dementia, a phenomenon commonly referred to as reversed causation. Heterogeneity may be increased due to differential effects of benzodiazepines on Alzheimer's disease pathology versus other causes of neurodegeneration. Concurrent assessment of preclinical markers of dementia, notably imaging markers, could in part alleviate these concerns and provide further insight in the neurobiological mechanisms through which benzodiazepine use might increase dementia risk, but such studies are scarce. One cross-sectional study among 2323 patients attending a French memory clinic found that benzodiazepine users had larger hippocampal volumes, but no published studies have determined the long-term association between benzodiazepine use and preclinical neurodegeneration in unselected populations.

### The effects of benzodiazepines on cognition [^115hfR3T]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Initially thought to be virtually free of negative effects, benzodiazepines are now known to carry risks of dependence, withdrawal, and negative side effects. Among the most controversial of these side effects are cognitive effects. Long-term treatment with benzodiazepines has been described as causing impairment in several cognitive domains, such as visuospatial ability, speed of processing, and verbal learning. Conversely, long-term benzodiazepine use has also been described as causing no chronic cognitive impairment, with any cognitive dysfunction in patients ascribed to sedation or inattention or considered temporary and associated with peak plasma levels. Complicating the issue are whether anxiety disorders themselves are associated with cognitive deficits and the extent to which patients are aware of their own cognitive problems. In an attempt to settle this debate, meta-analyses of peer-reviewed studies were conducted and found that cognitive dysfunction did in fact occur in patients treated long term with benzodiazepines, and although cognitive dysfunction improved after benzodiazepines were withdrawn, patients did not return to levels of functioning that matched benzodiazepine-free controls. Neuroimaging studies have found transient changes in the brain after benzodiazepine administration but no brain abnormalities in patients treated long term with benzodiazepines. Such findings suggest that patients should be advised of potential cognitive effects when treated long term with benzodiazepines, although they should also be informed that the impact of such effects may be insignificant in the daily functioning of most patients.

### Positive GABAreceptor modulating steroids and their antagonists: implications for clinical treatments [^115cPd48]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and GABAergic transmission has been shown to be of importance for regulation of mood, memory and food intake. The progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone (Allo) is a positive GABA A receptor modulating steroid with potent effects. In humans, disorders such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), hepatic encephalopathy and polycystic ovarian syndrome are associated with elevated Allo levels and increased negative mood, disturbed memory and increased food intake in some individuals. This is surprising because Allo shares many properties with benzodiazepines and is mainly considered to be anxiolytic and anti-depressant. However, it is well established that, in certain individuals, GABA A receptor activating compounds could have paradoxical effects and thus be anxiogenic in low physiological plasma concentrations but anxiolytic at high levels. We have demonstrated that isoallopregnanolone (Isoallo), the 3β-OH sibling of Allo, functions as a GABA A receptor modulating steroid antagonist (GAMSA) but without any effects of its own on GABA A receptors. The antagonistic effect is noted in most GABA A subtypes investigated in vitro to date. In vivo, Isoallo can inhibit Allo-induced anaesthesia in rats, as well as sedation or saccadic eye velocity in humans. Isoallo treatment has been studied in women with PMDD. In a first phase II study, Isoallo (Sepranolone; Asarina Pharma) injections significantly ameliorated negative mood in women with PMDD compared with placebo. Several GAMSAs for oral administration have also been developed. The GAMSA, UC1011, can inhibit Allo induced memory disturbances in rats and an oral GAMSA, GR3027, has been shown to restore learning and motor coordination in rats with hepatic encephalopathy. In humans, vigilance, cognition and pathological electroencephalogram were improved in patients with hepatic encephalopathy on treatment with GR3027. In conclusion GAMSAs are a new possible treatment for disorders and symptoms caused by hyperactivity in the GABA A system.

### Paradoxical changes in brain natriuretic peptide levels and loading conditions after intravenous conscious sedation [^115CeUvr]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated filling pressure and wall stress have been proposed as stimuli for elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Narcotic and benzodiazepine sedation, such as is used for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), is known to decrease filling pressures. We hypothesized that lower filling pressure and wall stress associated with intravenous conscious sedation (IVCS) would lead to lower BNP levels.

Methods

We studied BNP levels, blood pressure, and echocardiographic indices of filling pressure and wall stress before and after IVCS and TEE.

Results

When data before and after IVCS and TEE were compared, mean blood pressure decreased (149 ± 24/83 ± 14 mm Hg vs 126 ± 29/69 ± 14; P < .01), as did mitral Doppler E wave velocity (82 ± 23 cm/s vs 76 ± 22; P < .05), right ventricular/atrial gradient (31 ± 10 mm Hg vs 29 ± 13; P < .05), and wall stress. However, BNP levels increased (195 ± 407 pg/mL vs 238 ± 458; P < .01).

Conclusions

In a series of patients undergoing clinically indicated TEE, BNP levels increase above baseline after IVCS. The increase in BNP occurs despite lower blood pressure, lower mitral Doppler E velocity, lower right ventricular/atrial gradient, and lower wall stress compared with baseline. The mechanism of the paradoxical increase in BNP is not entirely clear, but it may conceivably be a result of counterregulatory hormone release caused by acute decrease in blood pressure.

### Burning mouth syndrome after taking clonazepam [^116C8pp1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the first published case of clonazepam-induced burning mouth syndrome (BMS).

Case Summary

A 52-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with burning mouth symptoms. The patient was previously maintained on alprazolam therapy for anxiety, but was switched to clonazepam because of increased anxiety and panic. Clonazepam significantly relieved her symptoms, but after four weeks of therapy, she reported a constant, mild, oral burning sensation. An oral examination was negative for mucosal abnormalities, and laboratory tests were unremarkable. The clonazepam dose was reduced, and the symptoms decreased, but remained intolerable. Clonazepam was discontinued, and the burning mouth symptoms completely resolved. Since no other medications relieved the anxiety and panic symptoms, the patient requested clonazepam to be reinitiated, but she again developed intolerable burning mouth symptoms. As clonazepam was discontinued, the symptoms resolved.

Discussion

The clinical presentation of BMS includes burning and painful sensations of the mouth in the absence of mucosal abnormalities. Candidiasis, anemia, menopause, diabetes mellitus, medications, anxiety, and depression are some causes of this syndrome. Paradoxically, clonazepam has been studied for the treatment of BMS and has demonstrated mild to moderate improvement. In this patient, underlying causes of BMS were eliminated when possible. The association between clonazepam and BMS was highly probable according to the Naranjo probability scale.

Conclusions

This is the first published report describing BMS with a benzodiazepine. Although uncommon, clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect due to the widespread use of benzodiazepines.

### Efficacy of combination therapy with dexmedetomidine for benzodiazepines-induced disinhibition during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^114PL7NX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, sedative effects were evaluated by RSS, movement score, and the number of additional sedatives given. In particular, the combined use of DEX led to high-quality sedation and fewer excessive movements, resulting in an increase in the completion rate of the procedure (95.5% versus 63.6%). Only one patient in the DEX group had their endoscopic procedure discontinued due to excessive movement. For this patient, being in a prone position was likely the cause of movement; they subsequently underwent an endoscopic procedure when in a lateral position at the next examination. The addictive nature of BZDs for patients when used as sleeping pills and being an alcoholic can be cited as risk factors that cause paradoxical reactions. Alcoholic patients (36.4%) and those addicted to sleeping pills (13.6%) were included in our study, but better sedation was obtained when combined with DEX. In the BZD group, significant differences in the RSS score, the maximum movement score, the number of additional sedatives, and the completion rate for procedures between diazepam and midazolam were not observed. In our study, midazolam has no additional contribution over diazepam in producing the disinhibition.

### Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency [^117Brfg4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

15.2 Dystonic Crises and Other Acute Movement Disorders

Dystonic crisis characterized by sustained and severe muscle contractions carries potential risks including compromised airway and metabolic complications such as rhabdomyolysis, which may result in acute renal failure. Although there have been no reported cases of dystonic crisis in patients with THD, the potential for such crises exists as mentioned earlier. The management approach to dystonic crisis in THD aligns with the general approach, involving admission to an intensive care unit, supplementation of fluids and nutrition, sedation (typically with benzodiazepines), and respiratory support as necessary.

Other acute severe movement disorders include episodes of massive disabling dyskinesia or even choreic status. The management typically entails reducing the dosage of L‐dopa and, in patients on dopamine agonists, decreasing or discontinuing the dopamine agonist to better control the abnormal movements.

Akinetic status has been described in one patient as a paradoxical reaction to rotigotine treatment.

R#40 (GPP): Dystonic crisis in THD could be a potentially life‐threatening condition and should be treated promptly.

R#41 (GPP): Approach for status dystonicus is not THD specific. Follow the local guidelines. Dopaminergic treatment should be continued. Antidopaminergic drugs must be avoided.

R#42 (GPP): Paradoxical responses to dopaminergic agents are managed by reducing or discontinuing the offending agent.

Recommendations on the management of drug‐induced dyskinesia have been discussed earlier.

### Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide (Librax) [^1165fF1w]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Tolerance

Tolerance to Librax may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effects of Librax may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.

OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of Librax, which contains a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride) and an anticholinergic (clidinium bromide) may manifest signs and symptoms related to either of its components, although some effects such as altered levels of consciousness may be synergistic. Overdosage of benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma.

### Additional use of methotrimeprazine for treating refractory agitation in pediatric patients [^116vLnd1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

Refractory agitation (RA) is a frequent and challenging problem in patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). After exclusion of imminent hypoxia, the differential diagnosis of RA includes: (i) delirium due to the underlying critical illness, and/or (ii) withdrawal, and/or (iii) disinhibition/paradoxical arousal due to benzodiazepines. In most cases, haloperidol gives satisfactory results, although RA may persist despite this treatment. Also benzodiazepines are often given, but may be ineffective or even contraindicated to restore patient comfort. After all, many patients in a PICU already receive or have received benzodiazepines and may have developed a certain level of tolerance. In others, benzodiazepines should be avoided because of associated disinhibition, which has particularly been observed in critically and/or terminally ill children. Therefore, a rescue strategy may be needed.

A possible solution for the treatment of RA is the addition of methotrimeprazine (MTZ, also known as levomepromazine or Nozinan), an aliphatic phenothiazine neuroleptic drug with a weak antipsychotic, but strong sedative effect. This classic neuroleptic is commonly used as co-medication in emergency psychiatry in adults to treat acute psychosis or mania by reducing levels of agitation, anger, and aggressiveness, thereby improving comfort for all — the patient, family, and members of the multidisciplinary team. There is no literature to allow for advisory dosages of MTZ in children with RA; however, in palliative care 0.1 mg/kg IV/SC/8 h is suggested. In adults, maximum dosages of t.i.d. 25–50 mg/orally/24 h MTZ are common. Potential, but rare side effects of MTZ include tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and extrapyramidal and cholinergically mediated side effects; a contraindication is bone marrow depression.

### Benzodiazepines and risk of all cause mortality in adults: cohort study [^112sXZLC]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Whether there is an effect on the risk of all cause mortality associated with the use of benzodiazepines has been an area of much discussion. The biological mechanism through which benzodiazepines would lead to an increased risk of all cause mortality is unclear. Benzodiazepines confer their effects through their action on γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) type A receptors in the central nervous system, which are molecular substrates for the regulation of vigilance, anxiety, muscle tension, epileptogenic activity, and memory functions. Because of their psychotropic action, benzodiazepines have been associated with hypnotic related side effects such as daytime sleepiness, impairment of psychomotor and cognitive functioning, increased risk of motor vehicle collisions, and increased risk of falls and fractures, in particular among older patients, and with possible greater risks for benzodiazepines with a longer half life. Benzodiazepines have also been associated with an increased risk for development of dependence and misuse. However, this risk is not as substantial as with older sedatives and other recognised drugs of abuse, and overdose with a benzodiazepine rarely causes severe cardiovascular or respiratory depression and death. Yet several studies performed in adult populations have reported strong associations between benzodiazepines and all cause mortality, even for short durations of treatment, as well as associations with a wide range of causes of deaths, including cardiovascular diseaseand cancer, for which the biological mechanism leading to an increased risk remains unclear. The lack of specificity of the effect identified in these investigations coexists with several potentially important limitations at the study design and analysis level, the most important being confounding. More specifically, it has being suggested that benzodiazepine treatment could be a "marker" for unmeasured underlying conditions resulting in death, rather than being the cause of death in itself. In support of this theory, several investigations have shown that health status and a history of multiple chronic conditions are independent predictors of benzodiazepine use. In line with this theory, we observed a consistently higher prevalence of mortality risk factors among benzodiazepine initiators compared with non-initiators or SSRI initiators, and large attenuations in the point estimates after high dimensional propensity score adjustment for both comparisons. The remaining small increase in risk is likely due to residual confounding. Residual confounding rather than true effect modification may also explain the moderate discrepancy in the risk of all cause mortality between patients aged less than and more than 65 years and between those using short acting and long acting benzodiazepines. In addition, the lack of an increased risk in all cause mortality among benzodiazepine initiators aged more than 65 years and among those initiators long acting agents further suggests that the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines are likely not responsible for the increased risk observed in previous investigations.

### Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents [^117JrqZt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of therapeutic effect, and generally favorable side effect profile. In this article, we examine issues related to the long-term use of benzodiazepines, including concerns about the development of therapeutic tolerance, dose escalation, and adverse cognitive effects. We also consider currently available alternatives to benzodiazepines and novel mechanisms of action that may prove fruitful in the development of future generations of anxiolytics.

### Pentobarbital vs chloral hydrate for sedation of children undergoing MRI: efficacy and recovery characteristics [^111RNoj2]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Chloral hydrate (CH) sedation for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is associated with significant failure rates, adverse events and delayed recovery. Pentobarbital (PB), reportedly produces successful sedation in 98% of children undergoing diagnostic imaging. This study compared the efficacy, adverse events and recovery characteristics of CH vs PB in children undergoing MRI.

Methods

With Institutional Review Board approval and written consent, children were randomly assigned to receive intravenous (i.v.) PB (maximum 5 mg x kg(-1) in incremental doses) or oral CH (75 mg x kg(-1)) prior to MRI. Sedation was augmented with 0.05 mg x kg(-1) doses of i.v. midazolam (maximum 0.1 mg x kg(-1)) as necessary. Adverse effects, including hypoxaemia, failed sedation, paradoxical reactions and behavioural changes, the return of baseline activity, and parental satisfaction were documented. The quality of MRI scans was evaluated by a radiologist blinded to the sedation technique.

Results

PB facilitated an earlier onset of sedation (P = 0.001), higher sedation scores (P = 0.01), and less need for supplemental midazolam compared with CH. Severe hypoxaemia occurred in two children (6%) in the PB group. Fourteen per cent of the PB group experienced a paradoxical reaction, 9% sedation failure and 11% major motion artefact, compared with 0% (P = 0.05), 3 and 2% (P = NS), respectively, in the CH group. CH and PB were both associated with a high incidence of motor imbalance, and agitation. However, children who received PB had a slower return to baseline activity (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Although PB facilitated a quicker sedation onset and reduced the requirement for supplemental sedation, it produced a higher incidence of paradoxical reaction and prolonged recovery with a similar failure rate compared with CH.

### Future directions in the management of insomnia [^114h2Bwd]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Research on insomnia has provided a number of important new insights, but fundamental deficits in our understanding remain. In considering priorities for future research, 3 areas warrant immediate attention. First, a causal relationship between insomnia and the adverse outcomes seen in insomnia patients needs to be established. Second, currently available symptomatic therapies need to be optimized. Recent data suggest that some benzodiazepine receptor agonists produce their hypnotic effect without side effects that were presumed to be inherent to sedation. Understanding the neuropharmacology underlying this differential effect would allow substantial improvements in the risk-benefit ratio for these drugs. Finally, the mechanisms of insomnia need to be better understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that physiologic arousal is important to the clinical presentation of primary insomnia. It remains unclear, however, whether this activation is primary or secondary to the insomnia itself. If physiologic hyperarousal causes primary insomnia, it would provide new approaches to the management of this disorder.

### Paradoxical vocal cord motion – haloperidol usage in acute attack treatment [^112w81Ya]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Paradoxical vocal cord motion (PVCM) is an uncommon disease characterized by vocal cord adduction during inspiration and/or expiration. It can create shortness of breath, wheezing, respiratory stridor, or breathy dysphonia. Possible etiological factors include asthma, underlying psychologic condition, gastroesophageal acid reflux disease, respiratory irritants exposure, central neurologic diseases, viral upper airway infections, and postsurgical procedures. Many treatment modalities were performed for acute attack of PVCM, including reassurance and onsite maneuvers, benzodiazepines, heliox, and so forth. We report a patient with PVCM who had stridor and dyspnea for 10 days and responded to intravenous haloperidol treatment.

### Revisiting benzodiazepines (GABA enhancers): a transdiagnostic and precision medicine approach [^112hkCyE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the mid 1980's, there has been an increased focus on the side effects of benzodiazepines (GABA enhancers), and as a result there has been a decrease in their use. We have systematically reviewed recent studies of GABA enhancers in psychiatry, and highlight evidence of their utility which may impact their negative conceptualization in clinical practice. We propose a new perspective on the appropriate use of these medications and describeclinical reasoning underpinning the use of benzodiazepine (GABA enhancers) based on their effect on specific receptors. A translational approach, involving a more comprehensive characterization of GABA receptors and their neuroscience-based mechanisms allows for a more precise use of this medication class. By adopting a precision person-centered approach, instead of a categorical approach, supports the prescribing of GABA enhancers when a cross-cutting transdiagnostic assessment shows anxiety symptoms associated with clinical impairment.

### Psychoactive medications in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: from prevalence to effects on motor command and strength [^113w42oU]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, the peripheral muscle weakness is partly due to reduced motor command. The psychoactive medications, which are often prescribed in COPD, are mainly inhibitory and thus may contribute to motor command reduction. The aims were to characterize and quantify the use of these drugs and determine their effects on cortical excitability and inhibition and thus on motor command and muscle weakness in these patients.

Methods

First, a prevalence study was conducted on 421 COPD patients. Second, cortical excitability, inhibition and voluntary activation were assessed in 40 patients (15 under psychoactive medications vs. 25 controls) by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the rectus femoris. Quadriceps maximal isometric strength was also assessed.

Results

About 48% of the patients were taking psychoactive medication. Benzodiazepines (21%) and antidepressants (13.5%) were the most prescribed. Patients with medications tended to be younger and isolated (p < 0.05). They also showed impaired cortical inhibition and decreased cortical excitability (+36%, p = 0.02). Voluntary activation was reduced (-3.6%, p = 0.04) but quadriceps strength was comparable between groups.

Conclusions

Psychoactive medications are prevalent in COPD patients. Patients under these medications exhibited brain impairment and reduced motor command. Paradoxically, voluntary strength was unaltered.

### Behavior, motivational interviewing, eating disorders, and obesity management technologies: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^115PCD3m]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) — diagnosis and management: Patients with SRED may not score differently than night-eating syndrome (NES) on sleep questionnaires and thus diagnosis is mainly a clinical one; the treatment of SRED is dependent on the cause, with drug-induced sleep-related eating disorder best managed by stopping or altering the offending drug (e.g., benzodiazepines, psychotropic medications including clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine, mirtazapine, and zolpidem); patients with SRED should avoid drugs that may worsen the condition; nonpharmacologic measures include stress management and "sleep hygiene", such as allowing sufficient sleep time and removing dangerous items or moving hazards (i.e., furniture) from likely paths to the kitchen to avoid falling; drug treatment includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, and (perhaps paradoxically) clonazepam.

### Benzodiazepine use and risk of dementia: prospective population based study [^116q4o9J]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

In contrast to our results, two studies did not find an increased risk of dementia among elderly people using benzodiazepines. The results of one (case-control) study, however, showed a similar effect estimate to ours, but this did not reach statistical significance (adjusted odds ratio 1.5, 0.6 to 3.4), probably owing to the small sample size. The other (cohort) study, suggested a beneficial effect of benzodiazepine use on dementia (unadjusted odds ratio 0.34) but considered past users as members of the reference group, which could have biased the results. A more detailed comparison of studies that have explored the potential association between benzodiazepine use and the risk of dementia is summarised in the supplementary (web extra) table.

Our study included a markedly larger number of participants than did the previous long term study on the topic, and we incorporated a run-in time of at least three years to allow adjustment for factors associated with starting benzodiazepines, thereby reducing the possibility of reverse causation. In that sense, an excess risk observed during the early phase of exposure could be congruent with a reverse causation bias, which would not be the case if the increase in risk appeared long after the start of exposure.

Benzodiazepines could also be seen as an early risk marker for dementia that might highlight a particular at risk background in patients, but without playing any causal role in the occurrence of the disease. For example, persistent anxiety in middle age has been shown to be associated with a greater risk of dementia in elderly people. Hence, benzodiazepine use may be a marker of this scenario and might help to identify people at increased risk of, and not already on the causal pathway leading to, dementia. However, in our study, two observations argue against this hypothesis: the strength of association did not increase across the five cohorts of new users (which would be expected in the event of reverse causation, as the time from benzodiazepine use to development of dementia is shorter), and the association between new use of benzodiazepines and dementia increased after about seven years of follow-up (fig 3). However, reverse causation cannot be entirely ruled out as an alternative explanation of our findings.

### Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency [^115FbtT6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). High credibility.

Dystonic crises and other acute movement disorders in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) can be severe; dystonic crisis may lead to complications such as rhabdomyolysis requiring admission to hospital which may result in acute renal failure, and although there have been no reported cases in THD, the management approach aligns with the general approach involving admission to an intensive care unit, supplementation of fluids and nutrition, sedation (typically with benzodiazepines), and respiratory support as necessary; other acute severe movement disorders include episodes of massive disabling dyskinesias or choreic status, managed by reducing the dosage of L-dopa and, in patients on dopamine agonists, decreasing or discontinuing the dopamine agonist; akinetic status has been described in one patient as a paradoxical reaction to rotigotine treatment; guidance states R#40 (GPP) that dystonic crises in THD could be a potentially life-threatening condition and should be treated promptly, R#41 (GPP) that the approach for status dystonicus is not THD specific, to follow the local guidelines, that dopaminergic treatment should be continued and antidopaminergic drugs must be avoided, and R#42 (GPP) that paradoxical responses to dopaminergic agents are managed by reducing or discontinuing the offending agent.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112E5ihC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Physical dependence versus substance use disorder (SUD) — definitions from Box 1 — state that physical dependence is a biological phenomenon that develops in response to repeated use of a medication; in the case of BZDs, physical dependence results from downregulation of BZD receptors and/or adaptations in the response of the receptor; conversely, SUD is a chronic disease associated with functional changes to brain circuits that mediate stress, decision-making, and behavior reinforcement, and is associated with specific criteria, including impaired control over use of the substance and continued use despite adverse consequences.

### When midazolam fails [^112Koskw]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

Significant distress is experienced by patients, families, and caregivers when a symptom or disorder, such as an agitated delirium, becomes an intractable, or a catastrophic event, such as irreversible stridor. When palliative sedation is indicated for these patients, midazolam is usually the preferred drug. In some cases, however, midazolam fails to provide adequate sedation. Two cases are presented to illustrate this phenomenon and explore the possible mechanisms underlying this lack of response. These mechanisms appear to be multifaceted. The heterogeneity of the GABA(A) receptor complex and the alterations that this complex can undergo functionally can explain, to some degree, the diversity of the physiological and pharmacological outcomes. Other factors responsible for the diversity in response may include concomitant medications, age, concurrent disease, overall health status, alcohol use, liver disease, renal disease, smoking and hormonal status. Evidence-based guidelines on alternative treatment options should midazolam fail are required. In the interim, a lower threshold for adding an alternative drug, such as phenobarbital, or substituting midazolam with another drug, such as propofol, should be considered in these circumstances.

### Paradoxical benzodiazepine response: a rationale for bumetanide in neurodevelopmental disorders? [^116r2FDq]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The diuretic agent bumetanide has recently been put forward as a novel, promising treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism spectrum disorder and related conditions. Bumetanide can decrease neuronal chloride concentrations and may thereby reinstate γ-aminobutyric acid -ergic inhibition in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, strategies to select appropriate candidates for bumetanide treatment are lacking. We hypothesized that a paradoxical response to GABA-enforcing agents such as benzodiazepines may predict the efficacy of bumetanide treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders. We describe a case of a 10-year-old girl with ASD, epilepsy, cortical dysplasia, and a 15q11. 2 duplication who had exhibited marked behavioral arousal after previous treatment with clobazam, a benzodiazepine. We hypothesized that this response indicated the presence of depolarizing excitatory GABA and started bumetanide treatment with monitoring of behavior, cognition, and EEG.

The treatment resulted in a marked clinical improvement in sensory behaviors, rigidity, and memory performance, which was substantiated by questionnaires and cognitive assessments. At baseline, the girl's EEG showed a depression in absolute α power, an electrographic sign previously related to ASD, which was normalized with bumetanide treatment. The effects of bumetanide on cognition and EEG seemed to mirror the "nonparadoxical" responses to benzodiazepines in healthy subjects. In addition, temporal lobe epilepsy and cortical dysplasia have both been linked to disturbed chloride homeostasis and seem to support our assumption that the observed paradoxical response was due to GABA-mediated excitation. This case highlights that a paradoxical behavioral response to GABA-enforcing drugs may constitute a framework for targeted treatment with bumetanide.

### The incidence of paradoxical reactions in pediatric patients… [^115rvJBC]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Summary The premedication is one of the essential sides of pediatrics anesthesia. Midazolam is considered such as standard these days. Children may develope a paradoxical reaction to benzodiazepines which is one of the adverse effect. Its incidence is unknown. The hypothesis is, in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia premedicated with oral midazolam, the incidence of the paradoxical reaction is 10%. The premedication is one of the essential sides of pediatrics anesthesia. Midazolam is considered such as standard these days. Children may develope a paradoxical reaction to benzodiazepines which is one of the adverse effect. The paradoxical reaction is an abnormal stimulative reaction to benzodiazepines characterized by hallucination, disorientation, alteration in perception and recognition as well as the escalation of negative emotion- uncalming crying, agitation, restlessness, and hostility.

Risk factors for the development of the paradoxical reaction are young age, mental illness, genetic disposition, male sex, alcohol abuse, and higher midazolam doses. Primary Goal of the study is find out the incidence of the paradoxical reaction in pediatric patients premedicated with oral midazolam prior to general anesthesia and incidence of the paradoxical reactions in children of different age groups. The calculated file size is 500 patients. All eligible patients should be evaluated for pre-treatment, pre-anesthesia, immediately prior to anesthesia and anesthesia when RASS above -2. For purpose of the study we have determined the definition of paradoxical reaction as an increase in pulse and/or blood pressure of 20% over pre-premedication, RASS increase by one point or more and raising PEAD to 10 or more points.

The paradoxical reaction criteria are met if at least two points of the definition are met. Change within 45min. after premedication.
- 273/15. Exclusion Criteria:

- personal history of benzodiazepines using
- moderate or severe respiratory insufficiency
- myopathy, neuromuscular transmission disorders
- moderate or severe CNS disability, including brain tumors, uncontrolled convulsions
- age < 3 months and > 18 years
- pregnancy.

### Lamotrigine intoxication provoking status epilepticus in an adult with localization-related epilepsy… [^115d1dcq]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background Various anticonvulsant medications have been associated with paradoxical aggravation of epileptic seizures in therapeutic doses and toxic concentrations. Lamotrigine has been reported to exacerbate seizures and myoclonic seizures in generalized epilepsy in a child with localization-related epilepsy. Objective To describe lamotrigine intoxication paradoxically producing status epilepticus in an adult with localization-related epilepsy. Results The patient developed a prolonged convulsive status epilepticus, which was eventually controlled with benzodiazepines. The patient also developed transient obtundation and severe ataxia, all of which resolved completely within 96 hours. Conclusions To our knowledge, in addition to being the first case report to describe convulsive status epilepticus after lamotrigine intoxication, this is the first report of the proconvulsant effect of lamotrigine in a case of localization-related epilepsy in an adult.

The effects of accidental or suicidal ingestion of lamotrigine tablets seem to be reversible. It has been recognized for more than 40 years that anticonvulsant medications may paradoxically exacerbate seizure activity. 1 Carbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, and tiagabine have been reported to aggravate seizures in idiopathic generalized epilepsies, especially myoclonic jerks and absence seizures. 2–5 The mechanisms leading to a paradoxical seizure are not fully understood, but they are thought to be due to an inverse pharmacodynamic effect, the development of tolerance or an acute idiosyncratic adverse effect, or poor compliance.
5. She was brought to the emergency department where seizures were ultimately controlled with benzodiazepines. The patient had significant tongue lacerations as a consequence of the prolonged seizure activity as well as multiple seizure-related orbital and body hematomas.

Various anticonvulsant medications have been observed to be paradoxically proconvulsant for epileptic patients whose intake is at toxic levels. The proconvulsant effect of high doses of anticonvulsant medications was previously reported with carbamazepine3 and phenytoin. 1, 4 A comprehensive review of the paradoxical aggravation of anticonvulsant medications was previously published by Genton. 5 Aggravation of seizures with a certain medication does not necessitate discontinuation of the medication if it is used cautiously.

### Adverse reactions… [^1151mYBw]. FDA (DailyMed) (2019). Medium credibility.

LORAZEPAM
- lorazepam tablet Lake Erie Medical DBA Quality Care Products LLC ----------. Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation, followed by dizziness, weakness, and unsteadiness. The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms., convulsions/seizures tremor, vertigo, eye-function/visual disturbance, dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal. symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/oid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, alopecia; S IADH, hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur.

Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam.

### Premedication with melatonin and alprazolam combination versus alprazolam or melatonin alone… [^116n1VyG]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview Background: Benzodiazepine, a common premedicant, suppresses endogenous melatonin levels and thus paradoxically increases episodes of arousal during sleep and thus causes restlessness and hangs over effects. Adding melatonin to it may decrease nocturnal arousal and promote the perception of sound sleep in the perioperative period. Review of literature: Benzodiazepines are among the most popular drugs used for preoperative medication to produce anxiolysis, amnesia, and sedation. However, they negatively influence sleep quality by decreasing the duration of REM sleep and slow wave sleep. We designed this prospective randomized double blind placebo controlled study to assess whether addition of melatonin to alprazolam has any benefit over alprazolam, melatonin or placebo alone as a premedication agent. Rationale of the study Melatonin facilitates sleep onset and improves the quality of sleep.

On the other hand, benzodiazepines suppress endogenous melatonin levels and thus paradoxically increase episodes of arousal during sleep causing restlessness and hang over effects. Hence, the rationale of using melatonin alprazolam combination is melatonin may decrease nocturnal arousal and promote the perception of sound sleep and thus reverse this unwanted side effect of alprazolam. Melatonin does not produce amnesia and adding a benzodiazepine to it may be desirable to achieve this desirable premedication effect. The extremes of the VAS anxiety scale will be marked as 'no anxiety' at the 0 end and 'anxiety as bad as ever can be' at the 10 cm end. Sedation will be assessed with a 5 point scale and orientation, with a 3 point scale.

Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction will be used for within-group comparison of values between different time points. Kruskal Wallis tests with post hoc multiple comparisons by Mann Whitney U test will be used for the comparison of values between the groups at each time points. Parametric data will be expressed as the mean ± SD and nonparametric data as median. A p value < 0. 05 will be considered significant.
