## Question

Should antibiotic prophylaxis be used to prevent endemic diarrhea for travel to South Africa?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent endemic diarrhea for travel to South Africa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk of travelers' diarrhea in South Africa and how it varies by travel style. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about routine antibiotic prophylaxis and whether any exceptions apply. Next, I will examine the effectiveness and risks of prophylactic antibiotics, including resistance and microbiome effects. After that, I need to consider special high-risk populations where prophylaxis might be reasonable. Finally, I will integrate this into practical, risk-stratified recommendations and a bottom-line answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk in South Africa. Historically, tap water in major South African cities was considered safe, but recent nationwide electricity outages ("load shedding") have compromised water treatment and distribution, making water quality more variable and increasing the risk of enteric illness in some urban settings, while rural areas already carried higher risk. Thus, the risk is not uniform and depends on itinerary, accommodation, and food choices, with safari-style travel often carrying elevated risk for travelers' diarrhea [^561270dc] [^6cf7aa25].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on routine prophylaxis. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same message: routine antibiotic prophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea is not recommended for most travelers, including to South Africa. This includes CDC Yellow Book guidance emphasizing safe food and water precautions and advising against prophylactic antibiotics, and ISTM 2017 graded expert panels recommending against routine antimicrobial prophylaxis, reserving it for select high-risk scenarios [^ab8adb8f] [^f38e2e5f].

> I need to check the rationale for avoiding routine prophylaxis. Effectiveness must be weighed against harms: antibiotics can reduce incidence but carry risks of adverse effects, C. difficile, and, importantly, promotion of antimicrobial resistance and colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms. Travel itself increases acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing Enterobacteriaceae, and antibiotic exposure during travel amplifies that risk, which is a key reason stewardship principles discourage prophylaxis in average-risk travelers [^a4e2a9e5] [^d0131239] [^76597cac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether any high-risk subgroups warrant exceptions. Guidelines allow consideration of short-term prophylaxis for travelers at high risk of severe complications from diarrhea, such as those with significant immunocompromise, inflammatory bowel disease with active disease, advanced liver disease, or other conditions where a diarrheal illness could precipitate major morbidity. In these rare cases, if prophylaxis is used, rifaximin is generally preferred due to its favorable safety profile, and fluoroquinolones are discouraged for prophylaxis given toxicity and resistance concerns [^3a5af758] [^2be17c7d] [^012cc223] [^30235c1e].

> Let me consider non-antibiotic prevention options. Bismuth subsalicylate has moderate effectiveness for prevention and can be considered in travelers who can adhere to frequent dosing and have no contraindications, whereas probiotics are not recommended for TD prevention given inconsistent benefit. Hand hygiene is useful in specific contexts but has limited impact against most bacterial causes of travelers' diarrhea, so it should not be relied upon as primary prevention [^de8a2ac8] [^303f56f8] [^6d7119e9].

> I should double-check treatment versus prophylaxis distinctions. Even when prophylaxis is not advised, travelers should carry agents for self-treatment of moderate to severe travelers' diarrhea, with rifaximin for noninvasive disease and azithromycin preferred in regions with high fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter or when dysentery is suspected. This treatment-only approach mitigates risks of unnecessary antibiotic exposure while ensuring prompt therapy when indicated [^f9f2b904] [^593834c0] [^3314444e].

> But wait, what if the traveler is already taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis? Does that change the calculus? Observational data suggest doxycycline may reduce travelers' diarrhea incidence, likely via anti-inflammatory effects and activity against common enteric pathogens; however, this is not an approved indication, and given stewardship and resistance concerns, doxycycline should not be started solely for TD prevention, even though incidental benefit may occur when used for malaria [^33f8bb6b] [^2d89138f].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation. For most travelers to South Africa, prioritize safe food and water precautions, hand hygiene at key moments, and provide a self-treatment kit for moderate to severe diarrhea. Do not prescribe routine antibiotic prophylaxis. For high-risk travelers with conditions where TD could cause severe complications, consider short-course rifaximin prophylaxis after discussing risks, benefits, and stewardship principles, and avoid fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. Reassess itinerary specifics such as rural exposure, safari travel, and current water infrastructure concerns when tailoring advice [^ab8adb8f] [^3a5af758] [^2be17c7d] [^561270dc].

> Bottom line, after verifying the evidence and guidelines, I should conclude clearly: No, antibiotic prophylaxis should not be used routinely to prevent endemic diarrhea for travel to South Africa. Reserve prophylaxis for rare, high-risk travelers after individualized risk assessment, and otherwise emphasize non-antibiotic prevention and prompt self-treatment if illness occurs [^ab8adb8f] [^f38e2e5f] [^3a5af758].

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for travelers to South Africa because the risk of travelers' diarrhea is moderate and most cases are mild and self-limited [^561270dc]. Prophylaxis is only considered for **high-risk travelers** (e.g. immunocompromised, chronic GI disease, or those for whom a brief illness would have major consequences) [^3a5af758] [^7e7232f1]. If prophylaxis is indicated, rifaximin is preferred [^2be17c7d]; fluoroquinolones are not recommended due to resistance and safety concerns [^012cc223]. All travelers should use safe food and water precautions and carry medications for self-treatment [^ab8adb8f] [^5c3a972b].

## Epidemiology of travelers' diarrhea in South Africa

- **Incidence**: Travelers' diarrhea is common in South Africa, with risk varying by travel style and food choices [^561270dc].
- **Risk factors**: Poor food hygiene, unsafe water, and street food increase risk; recent load shedding has made urban tap water quality variable, so bottled or treated water is advised [^561270dc] [^6cf7aa25].
- **Etiology**: Bacterial pathogens predominate (ETEC, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella), with viral and parasitic causes less common [^2c9db6b1].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines (CDC, ACG, ISTM) **do not recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis** for travelers' diarrhea, including for South Africa [^ab8adb8f] [^7e7232f1] [^f38e2e5f]. Prophylaxis is reserved for **high-risk travelers** — those with immunocompromise, chronic GI disease, or for whom a brief illness would have major consequences [^3a5af758] [^7e7232f1].

---

## Effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis

- **Effectiveness**: Rifaximin 200 mg twice daily reduces TD incidence by ~48% (NNT ≈ 6) [^9662371e]; fluoroquinolones are effective but not recommended for prophylaxis due to resistance and safety concerns [^012cc223] [^ae99d991].
- **Safety**: Rifaximin is minimally absorbed and generally well tolerated; fluoroquinolones carry risks of CNS effects, tendinopathy, and C. difficile [^72aa115c] [^3314444e].
- **Resistance**: Antibiotic use increases colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms, including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae [^a4e2a9e5] [^d0131239].

---

## Potential risks and drawbacks of antibiotic prophylaxis

- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, rash, and rare serious reactions (e.g. C. difficile) [^3314444e] [^57054794].
- **Resistance**: Prophylaxis contributes to antimicrobial resistance, a global public health concern [^d0131239] [^76597cac].
- **Cost and access**: Rifaximin is expensive and may not be available in all settings.

---

## Alternative preventive strategies

- **Food and water precautions**: Avoid high-risk foods (raw, undercooked, street food), drink bottled or treated water, and use hand hygiene [^561270dc] [^6cf7aa25].
- **Bismuth subsalicylate**: Moderately effective (40–60% reduction) for short-term use in those who can adhere to dosing [^de8a2ac8] [^d2fbc8b7].
- **Probiotics**: Not recommended due to inconsistent evidence [^838e2396] [^f498824a].

---

## Special considerations for high-risk travelers

For immunocompromised travelers, **rifaximin or azithromycin** may be considered case-by-case, balancing risks and benefits [^ff9416f4] [^30235c1e]. For pregnant travelers, **azithromycin is preferred** if prophylaxis is indicated [^30235c1e]. For travelers with chronic GI disease, **individualized decisions** are advised given the potential for severe outcomes [^3a5af758].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is **not recommended** for travelers to South Africa; use is reserved for high-risk travelers, with rifaximin preferred if prophylaxis is indicated [^ab8adb8f] [^2be17c7d]. All travelers should prioritize safe food and water practices and carry medications for self-treatment [^5c3a972b].

Individuals should undergo pretravel counseling regarding high-risk food/beverage avoidance to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Frequent and effective hand washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers are of limited value in preventing most forms of traveler's diarrhea but may be useful where low-dose pathogens are responsible for the illness as for example during a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus infection, institutional outbreak, or in endemic diarrhea prevention. Bismuth subsalicylates have moderate effectiveness and may be considered for travelers who do not have any contraindications to use and can adhere to the frequent dosing requirements. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for prevention of TD are not recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has moderate to good effectiveness and may be considered in high-risk groups for short-term use.

### Drug prophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea [^d5476105]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea is the most common health impairment in persons visiting developing countries, affecting 20% to > 50% of tourists. Although it is usually benign, travelers' diarrhea represents a considerable socioeconomic burden for both the traveler and the host country. The most common enteropathogens are enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. Travelers' compliance with dietary precautionary measures is poor. Despite the excellent protection rates provided by antibiotics, routine administration of prophylaxis is currently not recommended because of potential adverse reactions. Of the various antibiotics that have been tested, quinolones are considered to be the first choice worldwide; however, quinolone-resistant pathogens are increasingly being isolated. Because it is frequently administered and provides only moderate protection, bismuth subsalicylate is not considered a recommendable option for prophylaxis in Europe, where it is rarely available anyhow. To date, no probiotic has been able to demonstrate clinically relevant protection worldwide. In conclusion, there is no satisfactory prophylactic option, and worldwide monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the search for novel antimicrobial agents, such as nonabsorbed antibiotics, and nonantibiotic medications should continue.

### Travelers' diarrhea [^2b7a409d]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Travelers' diarrhea affects 20–60% of travelers to low-income regions of the world. Much of the evidence for the clinical description and management of travelers' diarrhea was generated years ago, however, there is new information on geographic and host risk, etiology, and prevention strategies.

Recent Findings

Travel to South Asia, followed by sub-Saharan Africa and South America, carries the highest risk for diarrheal syndromes in returned travelers. Women are more susceptible to travel-related diarrhea than men. Host genetic studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lactoferrin, osteoprotegerin, and IL-10 genes are associated with small but increased risks for diarrhea and enteric pathogens. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is likely to be a new agent identified as causing travelers' diarrhea, and heat-stable toxin-producing Escherichia coli appears to be more common than heat-labile toxin E. coli. Overall levels of sanitation at the travel destination, including individual eating establishments, are strong predictors for acquisition of travelers' diarrhea. A new transdermal LT vaccine shows promise in modifying the severity of travelers' diarrhea. It remains uncertain whether prophylaxis or prompt self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea will prevent late-onset irritable bowel syndrome. For self-treatment, azithromycin is the drug of choice in travelers to areas where there is a high risk of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp., such as South and Southeast Asia and possibly North Africa, Central and South America.

Summary

There is increased understanding of the determinants of travelers' diarrhea. Despite this travelers' diarrhea remains one of the most common illnesses in travelers. Continued focus on intervention strategies may ultimately lead to decreased incidence.

The prevention of traveler's diarrhea by use of pharmacologic agents has been of great interest since the early 1960s. It was not until the discovery of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli as the dominant causative organism of travelers' diarrhea, however, that rational antimicrobial therapy could be studied. Selected antimicrobials have proven to be highly efficacious, but, by consensus, are not widely used.

Importance

Acute diarrhea is the most common illness that affects travelers to low-income regions of the world. Although improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea in many destinations, the risk remains high in others.

Objective

To review the current state of knowledge on the etiology, risk factors, prevention, and management of traveler's diarrhea.

Evidence Review

A search of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases for the period 2012-April 2014 was performed for articles on traveler's diarrhea. The database search yielded 2976 articles, of which 37 were included in this review. These were added to 85 articles previously identified by the authors.

Findings

Improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea from 20% or more (for a 2-week stay) to between 8% and 20% in some parts of the world. Acquiring traveler's diarrhea causes 12% to 46% of travelers to change their travel plans. Returning travelers seeking medical care have a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disturbance in approximately one-third of all cases. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome may occur in 3% to 17% of patients who have had traveler's diarrhea. Prevention of traveler's diarrhea by dietary avoidance measures is often not successful. Chemoprophylaxis should be restricted to travelers who are at risk of severe complications of diarrhea. Ciprofloxacin is the standard treatment in self-therapy of traveler's diarrhea except when patients are in South or Southeast Asia, where azithromycin is preferred.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diarrhea remains a common problem for international travelers. Persons intending to travel to at-risk countries should be counseled regarding prevention measures and may be given a travel pack that includes medications for self-treatment should they become ill.

### An update on travelers' diarrhea [^6f5f6304]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Travelers' diarrhea, affecting millions of travelers every year globally, continues to be a leading cause of morbidity despite advances in vaccination, prevention, and treatment. Complications of travelers' diarrhea often present to gastroenterologists and some patients followed by gastroenterologists are at higher risk of developing travelers' diarrhea. This review will provide an update on recent progress made in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

Recent Findings

Most causes of travelers' diarrhea remain bacterial, but newly recognized pathogens are emerging. Patient-related and travel-related factors affect disease development risk and should guide prophylaxis and treatment. Although specific vaccines are being developed, they have not yet had a major impact on travelers' diarrhea, and understanding their roles and limitations is especially important. Prophylaxis and treatment of populations at risk (children, chronically ill patients, and those on immunosuppressive medications) remain challenging and require a tailored approach.

Summary

Travelers' diarrhea will continue to challenge patients and physicians despite the use of sanitation advice, prophylactic vaccines, and treatment with antibiotics. Effects may extend beyond the time of travel, such as postinfectious complications and exacerbation of preexisting disease. Future research should focus on novel strategies for reducing exposure to pathogens, vaccine development, early detection, and targeted treatments.

### Effectiveness of rifaximin in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to south and southeast Asia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^9662371e]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Travellers' diarrhoea causes substantial acute and long-term morbidity. Chemoprophylaxis with fluoroquinolones or rifaximin is effective in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to Latin America and Africa. Little evidence is available to support the protective effect of antimicrobial drugs in south and southeast Asia, where enteroinvasive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause a substantial proportion of diarrhoeal episodes. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of rifaximin in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to south and southeast Asia.

Methods

We did this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, parallel-group, clinical trial in Tübingen, Germany, between Nov 12, 2009, and Sept 3, 2012. Individuals aged 18–64 years who were planning a 6–28 day journey to south and southeast Asia were randomly assigned (1:1), according to a randomisation list (permuted block size of eight) generated by an independent statistician, to receive placebo or rifaximin 200 mg tablets twice daily. All members of the study team, including investigators, those assessing outcomes, and data analysts, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was time to the first episode of classic travellers' diarrhoea, defined as three or more loose stools in 24 h, accompanied by one or more enteric symptoms. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol.

Findings

We randomly assigned 258 participants to rifaximin (n = 129) or placebo (n = 129), of whom 239 (93%) returned a completed diary and were included in the primary effectiveness analysis. 48 (41%) of 117 participants in the placebo group and 30 (25%) of 122 in the rifaximin group reported classic episodes of travellers' diarrhoea. From departure to 7 days after return, rifaximin provided 48% protection (95% CI 16–68) by lowering the incidence of travellers' diarrhoea from 1.99 (1.50–2.64) per 100 person-days in the placebo group to 1.04 (0.72–1.48) in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.32–0.84; p = 0.005). The number needed to treat was 5.70 (95% CI 3.44–16.69) to prevent one case of classic travellers' diarrhoea during the first 3 weeks of follow-up. The per-protocol analysis essentially corroborated the findings from the intention-to-treat analysis. We recorded one serious adverse event in a participant in the rifaximin group who had grade 3 right lower quadrant abdominal pain 72 h after the last intake of study drug. The complaints were considered unlikely to be related to use of the drug.

Interpretation

Rifaximin is moderately effective in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to south and southeast Asia. Similar studies are needed to inform travellers and practitioners about the effectiveness of this drug at other popular destinations.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^33f8bb6b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

International travelers are frequently at risk for travelers' diarrhea (TD) and malaria. Doxycycline was one of the earliest antibiotics shown to have efficacy in TD prevention. With increasing resistance and recommendations against antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, doxycycline fell out of use. We evaluated TD incidence and risk factors in a prospective cohort of travelers, specifically in regard to malaria prophylaxis. Travelers' diarrhea was defined as ≥ 3 loose stools in 24 hours or two loose stools in 24 hours associated with other gastrointestinal symptoms. The Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used to estimate the RR of TD. Three thousand two hundred twenty-seven trips were enrolled: 62.1% of participants were male, with a median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59) and a median travel duration of 19 days (IQR 12,49); 17.4% developed TD; 32% traveled to Africa, 40% to Asia, and 27% to the Caribbean and Latin America; and 20% took doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis, 50% took other antimalarials, and 30% took none. Decreased RR of TD was associated with doxycycline (RR 0.62 [0.47–0.82], P < 0.01) and military travel (RR 0.57 [0.47–0.70], P < 0.01). Increased risk of TD was associated with female gender (RR 1.28 [1.09–1.50], P < 0.01), hotel accommodations (RR 1.30 [1.10–1.53], P < 0.01), travel to tropical South America (RR 1.34 [1.09–1.64], P < 0.01), and duration of travel (RR 1.00 [1.00–1.01], P < 0.01). The use of doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis is associated with lower TD risk, suggesting increasing bacterial enteropathogen susceptibility similar to previous observations. Doxycycline selection for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis may provide additional traveler benefit in infection prevention.

### New insights and directions in travelers' diarrhea [^f1c0297d]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Since first studied more than 5 decades ago the risk of travelers'diarrhea for persons going from industrialized regions to developing countries has remained high. Most cases of illness are caused by bacterial agents. Travelers' diarrhea is associated with temporary disability and it may progress to chronic intestinal illness and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Exercising care about food and beverage intake, the use of rifaximin prophylaxis for selective patients, and self-treatment of all resultant illness will continue to be the way in which the disease is prevented or managed best by travelers. Future approaches will be aimed at making host regions safer and providing more effective methods of treatment and prevention of enteric disease during short-term international travel.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^7e8e1756]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

International travelers are frequently at risk for travelers' diarrhea (TD) and malaria. Doxycycline was one of the earliest antibiotics shown to have efficacy in TD prevention. With increasing resistance and recommendations against antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, doxycycline fell out of use. We evaluated TD incidence and risk factors in a prospective cohort of travelers, specifically in regard to malaria prophylaxis. Travelers' diarrhea was defined as ≥ 3 loose stools in 24 hours or two loose stools in 24 hours associated with other gastrointestinal symptoms. The Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used to estimate the RR of TD. Three thousand two hundred twenty-seven trips were enrolled: 62.1% of participants were male, with a median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59) and a median travel duration of 19 days (IQR 12,49); 17.4% developed TD; 32% traveled to Africa, 40% to Asia, and 27% to the Caribbean and Latin America; and 20% took doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis, 50% took other antimalarials, and 30% took none. Decreased RR of TD was associated with doxycycline (RR 0.62 [0.47–0.82], P < 0.01) and military travel (RR 0.57 [0.47–0.70], P < 0.01). Increased risk of TD was associated with female gender (RR 1.28 [1.09–1.50], P < 0.01), hotel accommodations (RR 1.30 [1.10–1.53], P < 0.01), travel to tropical South America (RR 1.34 [1.09–1.64], P < 0.01), and duration of travel (RR 1.00 [1.00–1.01], P < 0.01). The use of doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis is associated with lower TD risk, suggesting increasing bacterial enteropathogen susceptibility similar to previous observations. Doxycycline selection for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis may provide additional traveler benefit in infection prevention.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (empiric antimicrobial therapy), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that MSM may be at increased risk for antibiotic-resistant enteric infections. Recognize that diarrhea is a common illness among international travelers, and antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside the US is common. Take into account the possibility of resistant infections when prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for travelers with HIV, particularly those traveling to South and Southeast Asia or Africa.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^f927eebd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### Traveler's diarrhea [^da549991]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most important health issue among international travelers. In high risk areas, 50–90% of travelers may experience an episode of TD. The risk of acquiring TD is influenced by factors such as the destination, duration of stay, standard of accommodation, type of travel, age of the traveler, and also by individual risk factors. Most cases of TD are caused by bacteria; treatment for TD are loperamide and antibiotics. Preventive strategies such as hygiene measures have limited impact. Prophylactic intake of antibiotics or vaccines to prevent from TD can be considered in special situations.

International travel–associated diarrhea and resistance considerations in people with HIV: Diarrhea is one of the most common illnesses affecting international travelers, and antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside the United States is an important public health problem. Traveler's diarrhea caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant C. jejuni in South and Southeast Asia or Africa is common, and clinicians should consider the possibility of a resistant infection when prescribing empiric therapy for travelers with HIV who experience diarrhea or a syndrome consistent with a systemic infection while traveling or upon returning to the United States, given reports of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae acquisition during travel.

Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea — An NIH-sponsored consensus meeting concluded that routine antibiotic chemoprophylaxis should not be used, and subsequent evaluations have recommended against prophylaxis except in high-risk groups, with standard practice unchanged for 20 years. Developments challenging this stance include recognition that postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome is an important chronic health consequence after TD and the availability of rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic that may provide a safer alternative than fluoroquinolones; however, safety concerns with antibiotic use of any class remain an important consideration.

### The pretravel consultation [^ea014f08]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients who will be traveling internationally should be advised to schedule dedicated pretravel assessments with their primary care physicians. The pretravel consultation is a vital opportunity for physicians to review preventive and risk-reduction strategies with travelers. Critical components of the patient interview include travel itinerary, anticipated high-risk activity, and medical history. This information affects subsequent recommendations for immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, personal protective measures, and risk-reduction measures. Physicians should review whether routine and seasonal immunizations, including those for COVID-19 and influenza, are up to date and determine whether location-specific immunizations are warranted. Malaria prophylaxis and counseling on personal protective measures, including minimizing skin exposure and using insect repellant, permethrin-treated clothing, bed nets, and screens, are recommended for travelers visiting endemic areas. A single dose of antibiotics may be considered for self-treatment of traveler's diarrhea without features of dysentery. Travelers with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, should carry documentation of medical issues and enough medications and supplies to last for the duration of travel. Activity-specific concerns include sunburn, motor vehicle crashes, water safety, altitude sickness, and risks associated with sexual behaviors.

### Landscape of bacterial enteric disease and traveler ´ s diarrhea in south America [^74e5601e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Diarrheal disease is a global public health threat. Cases of enteric disease caused by bacterial enteropathogens result in a significant health burden and can lead to antimicrobial resistance patterns that increase and evolve over time and geography, posing serious health challenges for local populations as well as civilian travelers and military personnel deployed to endemic regions. This review describes the prevalence of the most common bacterial agents of diarrheal disease in South America, as well as the distribution patterns of antibiotic resistance and predominant strains that are present in the region. Furthermore, the development of relevant prevention and treatment strategies are described, and United States Naval Medical Research Unit SOUTH disease surveillance and enteric disease research efforts in this regional context are highlighted.

Other considerations in bacterial enteric infections: MSM may be at increased risk for antibiotic-resistant enteric infections; diarrhea is a common illness of international travelers and antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside the United States is common, so clinicians should consider the possibility of resistant infections when prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for travelers with HIV while traveling or upon return to the United States, particularly among travelers to South and Southeast Asia or Africa; for patients with persistent diarrhea (> 14 days) but no other severe clinical signs, antibiotic therapy can be withheld until a diagnosis is confirmed and noninfectious etiologies can be considered in the differential diagnosis (BIII); azithromycin should not be used to treat bacteremia; before susceptibilities are known, empiric IV ceftriaxone is recommended, and updated outbreak information, local susceptibility patterns, and travel history should always be considered.

### Update in traveler's diarrhea [^d2fbc8b7]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

TD has not proved as preventable as hoped, despite knowing that it is transmitted mainly through food. Travelers have little ability to select restaurants based on the kitchen hygiene. The rates of TD in travelers to developing countries have not changed in the past 50 years, either because the dietary precautions they are taught are not effective or they cannot be adhered to in the course of a pleasurable vacation. Nonantibiotic prophylaxis with bismuth subsalicylate has the potential to prevent 40% to 60% of TD episodes in short-term travelers, and is probably underused. Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent up to 90% of infections, but is not routinely recommended. Empiric treatment of TD has been the best approach to dealing with this problem, but its usefulness is being undermined by growing antibiotic resistance in many parts of the world. Fluoroquinolones are still the most useful agents where Campylobacter is not a predominant pathogen. Rifaximin may prove to be a useful addition to the options for treatment and prophylaxis. If used for treatment, it may require a backup antibiotic in areas where Campylobacter and Shigella are prominent pathogens.

### Traveller's diarrhoea [^ec20fd00]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Traveller's diarrhoea affects over 50% of travellers to some destinations and can disrupt holidays and business trips. This review examines the main causes and epidemiology of the syndrome, which is associated with poor public health infrastructure and hygiene practices, particularly in warmer climates. Although travellers may be given common sense advice on avoidance of high-risk foods and other measures to prevent traveller's diarrhoea, adherence to such advice is sometimes difficult and the evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory. However, non-antimicrobial means for prevention of traveller's diarrhoea are favoured in most settings. A simple stepwise approach to the management of traveller's diarrhoea includes single doses or 3-day courses of antimicrobials, often self administered. The antibiotics of choice are currently fluoroquinolones or azithromycin, with an emerging role for rifaximin. In the long term, there will be greater benefit and effect on the health of local inhabitants and travellers from improving public health and hygiene standards at tourist destinations.

Travelers' diarrhea — South Africa: As with most destinations, the risk for travelers' diarrhea in South Africa depends on style of travel and travelers' food choices. In the past, tap water was safe to drink in most major cities; however, frequent nationwide rolling electricity blackouts ("load shedding") in recent years have affected operation of drinking water systems, and water quality is now more variable, so travelers could consider treating tap water or drinking bottled water in cities. In more rural areas, travelers should consume only bottled water. The usual spectrum of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections exists in South Africa.

CONCLUSION

The cumulative incidence of TD in international travelers who were taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis was decreased compared with those taking other or no prophylaxis. This effect may be because of increasing bacterial enteropathogen susceptibility to doxycycline against diarrheagenic E. coli, similar to observations from over 30 years ago, and potential anti-inflammatory effects. Further prospective studies should be performed to establish if there are any additional benefits of using doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis.

### The pretravel consultation [^db51a116]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Key components of the pretravel consultation include intake questions regarding the traveler's anticipated itinerary and medical history; immunizations; malaria prophylaxis; and personal protection measures against arthropod bites, traveler's diarrhea, and injury. Most vaccinations that are appropriate for international travelers are included in the routine domestic immunization schedule; only a few travel-specific vaccines must also be discussed. The most common vaccine-preventable illnesses in international travelers are influenza and hepatitis A. Malaria prophylaxis should be offered to travelers to endemic regions. Personal protection measures, such as applying an effective insect repellent to exposed skin and permethrin to clothing and using a permethrin-impregnated bed net, should be advised for travelers to the tropics. Clinicians should offer an antibiotic prescription that travelers can take with them in case of traveler's diarrhea. Additional topics to address during the pretravel consultation include the risk of injury from motor vehicle crashes and travel-specific risks such as altitude sickness, safe sex practices, and emergency medical evacuation insurance.

INTRODUCTION

Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most common illness experienced by international travelers and can occur during travel to any part of the world. Travel destination heavily influences the incidence rate of TD. Travelers to developing countries have an incidence rate of 20% per 2-week stay, whereas those traveling to low-risk areas (United States, Western Europe, and Australia) have a < 8% per 2-week stay TD incidence. Although mortality from TD is low, TD can cause significant incapacitation both during and after travel. Thirty percent of travelers to high-risk areas can become incapacitated from TD and may not be able to participate in planned activities for up to 24 hours. In addition, the evidence increasingly suggests a link between TD and the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

With the high incidence of TD among international travelers and its associated morbidity, it is important to counsel travelers on TD prevention measures. Currently, TD prevention strategies are focused on food and water restrictions and chemoprophylaxis. Currently, there is no antibiotic with an approved indication for TD prophylaxis. In the previous two decades, rifaximin, a nonabsorbable antibiotic with a favorable safety profile, has demonstrated moderate efficacy in TD prevention. In the 1970s–1980s, doxycycline was commonly prescribed as TD prophylaxis. Multiple studies showed that taking daily doxycycline during travel significantly reduced the incidence of TD. By the mid-1980s, doxycycline resistance began to emerge, especially in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). – Therefore, the 1985 National Institute of Health Consensus Statement on TD recommended early treatment strategies for TD over the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Furthermore, they did not recommend doxycycline as an early treatment strategy.

Doxycycline is still commonly used for malaria prophylaxis among international travelers. With changes in resistance patterns of enteric pathogens, it is unclear what effect doxycycline currently has on the development of TD. – We examined a cohort of travelers who received various malaria-preventive strategies, seeking to evaluate whether the use of doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis was associated with a decreased risk of TD during international travel.

HIV-associated bacterial enteric illness prevention — antimicrobial prophylaxis for travelers — states that antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent bacterial enteric illness is usually not recommended, including for travelers (AIII); in rare cases, antimicrobial prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones or rifaximin can be considered for immunosuppressed travelers depending on their level of immunosuppression, the region of travel, and the trip's duration (CIII); for pregnant women and for patients already taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), TMP-SMX may offer limited protection against travelers' diarrhea as an alternative to fluoroquinolones or rifaximin (BIII); and risk of toxicity should be considered before prophylaxis with TMP-SMX is initiated solely because of travel.

### Travelers' diarrhea: antimicrobial therapy and chemoprevention [^72aa115c]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The use of preventive measures and self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea is routine in regions where the occurrence of diarrhea is predictably high. People traveling to these areas who do not exercise care in their selection of consumed foods and beverages will suffer high rates of illness. Such diarrhea normally affects the traveler for a day, although it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Although systemic antibacterial drugs are effective in preventing diarrhea, their use is not routinely recommended because of side effects and their importance as a therapy for extra-intestinal infections. This review focuses on current and future uses of antibacterial drugs in the prevention and therapy of travelers' diarrhea. Minimally absorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin can effectively reduce the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea without side effects. Bismuth subsalicylate is a useful alternative, although it is less effective than rifaximin for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea and the required doses are less convenient. All people who travel to high-risk areas should take curative antimicrobial agents with them for self-treatment of illness: rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days, or an absorbable agent such as a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin taken in a single dose initially, with the need for a second or third dose determined by clinical response. Loperamide (up to 8 mg per day for ≤ 2 days) can be given with the antibiotic to offer rapid symptomatic improvement. In the future, the ability to evaluate the genetic risk of illness acquisition might allow person-specific recommendations to be made.

### Therapy for and prevention of traveler's diarrhea [^10ad652d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea associated with international travel is commonly caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, or noroviruses. Early studies to define these enteropathogens took place at the University of Maryland during the Theodore E. Woodward years. Although a reduction in the rate of diarrhea may be possible through avoidance of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated, a more effective preventive strategy is to administer nonabsorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin each day during trips to areas where the risk of traveler's diarrhea is high (i.e., high-risk areas). For the self-treatment of diarrhea that occurs during travel, all persons planning trips to high-risk areas should take with them medication with expected activity against the prevalent bacterial enteropathogens: rifaximin (for the treatment of common afebrile, nondysenteric diarrhea), a fluoroquinolone, or azithromycin. Further study is needed to determine whether it is possible to avoid important morbidity associated with diarrhea and the development of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome with chemoprophylaxis and/or early effective treatment.

### Emerging concepts in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of travelers' diarrhea [^76597cac]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Traveller's diarrhea, though not life-threatening. is often a vexing problem, which impacts overall function of the traveller while on holiday. Increasing data is available regarding molecular diagnostic techniques, which may help obtain an early etiologic diagnosis. Use of antibiotics for traveller's diarrhea is controversial in this era of multidrug resistance and microbiome disruption.

Recent Findings

Travel to the tropics promotes gut colonization with drug-resistant bacteria and this risk increases after treatment with antibiotics, leading to potential ecological impacts in the country of residence.

Summary

Traveller's diarrhea is common and can impact a traveller's itinerary leading to significant inconvenience, and occasional longer term sequelae. Though bacterial causes predominate, recommended treatment is conservative in mild-to-moderate cases. Molecular techniques for early diagnosis of traveller's diarrhea may help with appropriate management. Treatment with antibiotics is sometimes required but is associated with gut colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

### Antimicrobials increase travelers' risk of colonization by extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^a4e2a9e5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The colonization incidence was highest in participants who had several concomitant risk factors. In the region with greatest risk, South Asia, 23% of travelers in subgroup TD-AB–, 47% in TD+AB−, and 80% in the TD+AB+ contracted ESBL-PE. In Southeast Asia, the values were 14%, 32%, and 69%, respectively. The data suggest that most, if not all, travelers to these regions are exposed to ESBL-PE; in the best case, however, an intact barrier of intestinal microbiota will inhibit colonization.

Our research had some limitations. Although the size of our study population was the largest on this subject to date, conclusions based on results from regions with small numbers of travelers (East Asia, North Africa and Middle East, Europe, the Americas, and Australia) should be made with caution. Another limitation is that while our laboratory analysis focused on the clinically and epidemiologically important ESBL strains, we did not cover the typical low-level ampC resistance.

Therefore, to avoid colonization, the valid strategies are prevention of TD and restriction of antimicrobial use for TD while traveling. However, the current advice on how to protect oneself from TD has been insufficient. Indeed, the only effective means of combating resistant microbes would be to refrain from use of unnecessary antimicrobials for TD. In our study, antibiotics were generally taken for the treatment of TD, the disease most commonly encountered abroad. While TD with severe symptoms undoubtedly requires antimicrobial treatment, antibiotics are usually not needed for moderate and mild cases, as these usually resolve spontaneously. In reality, however, a substantial proportion of travelers with mild diarrhea do take antibiotics. Of our volunteers, 62% used antimicrobials for TD that they reported to be mild or moderate (data not shown). If travelers were instructed to be more cautious in their use of antimicrobials, the number of colonized individuals could decrease dramatically.

### Health recommendations for international travel: a review of the evidence base of travel medicine [^ce42523a]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

International travel is increasing, including travel to countries with emerging economies. Travel may pose health risks for the individual and contribute to the global spread of infectious diseases. The specialty of travel medicine is aimed at minimizing health risks associated with international travel. The field has emerged in the past 25 years, and the evidence base supporting its clinical practice is growing. This review will describe the evidence base underlying travel medicine, highlight recently updated travel medicine guidelines, and outline future research priorities.

Recent Findings

Recommendations for a number of common vaccines for travelers have been updated recently. More sophisticated detection methods are leading to the identification of a wider spectrum of pathogens associated with travelers' diarrhea, and antibiotic resistance is increasingly being identified. New treatment options for malaria are available, and a fifth Plasmodium species causing disease in humans has been identified.

Summary

An evidence base for the practice of travel medicine is emerging. Expert opinion and consensus guidelines continue to play an important role in supporting clinical practice.

### Immunocompromised travelers: demographic characteristics, travel destinations, and pretravel health care from the U.S. global travEpiNet consortium [^e805418d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

We evaluated the travel characteristics of different types of immunocompromised travelers (Table 3). Few solid-organ transplant recipients traveled to countries with low U.N. human development indices. Approximately half of HIV-positive travelers (46% of those with CD4 < 500 and 51% of those with CD4 > 500) were traveling to countries with a low U.N. human development index. African countries were the most common destinations among HIV-positive travelers, whereas India was the most common travel destination among other immunocompromised people. Leisure was the most common purpose of travel for all groups, but HIV-positive travelers and recipients of solid-organ transplants were commonly identified as VFR travelers. Of people taking TNF blockers, almost one-quarter were pursuing business travel.

Overall, 93% of immunocompromised travelers were traveling to countries where malaria is wholly or partially endemic. Significantly fewer immunocompromised travelers than immunocompetent travelers who were visiting malaria-endemic countries were prescribed malaria chemoprophylaxis (281 [62%] versus 19,432 [69%], P = 0.001). Of the 108 immunocompromised travelers visiting countries wholly endemic for malaria, 92 (85%) received malaria chemoprophylaxis. Atovaquone/proguanil was the most commonly prescribed agent for malaria chemoprophylaxis in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent travelers. Antibiotics for the presumptive self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea were prescribed at a similar rate in the immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations (79% and 78%, respectively). Only 6% of immunocompromised travelers were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, which was similar to the frequency in immunocompetent travelers (7%).

African safaris and climbing expeditions — travelers' diarrhea (TD) prevention and management states that "Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most common travel-related illness and is common on safaris", with infectious causes summarized as "Infectious causes of TD include bacteria (e.g. Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. Vibrio cholerae), viruses (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus), and protozoa (e.g. Cryptosporidium, Giardia…)". "Most TD cases are mild and self-limiting". Clinicians should "Advise travelers to carry antimotility medicine for symptomatic relief of mild TD" and "Consider prescribing antibiotic therapy to treat moderate to severe TD and providing travelers with clear written guidance about TD prevention and step-by-step instructions about how and when to use medications". "Prepare travelers by explaining the risks for TD and how best to prevent it through appropriate hand hygiene and careful selection of foods and beverages", and counsel that "No vaccines are available for most pathogens that cause TD" and "Cholera vaccine is not needed for safari-goers unless they are planning a side trip to work in a refugee camp or do humanitarian aid work in an affected country". Hygiene and water precautions include "Advise travelers to carry alcohol-based hand sanitizer with ≥ 60% alcohol" and "Travelers should avoid drinking tap water while on safari and only consume adequately disinfected (e.g., commercially bottled) water from an unopened, factory-sealed container". Additional guidance states "Travelers should carry any medications with them on safari because access to authentic drugs is not guaranteed in remote locations" and "Travelers should consult a physician for moderate, severe, or persistent TD".

Univariate analysis of characteristics and RR of TD

Table 4
Multivariate analysis of characteristics and their RR of travelers' diarrhea

A further analysis of the use of doxycycline by region and associations with TD was performed. In our study, the region with the highest overall TD rates was Latin America at 20%. When this group was further subdivided into tropical South America, and the overall TD rate was 25%. There were similar rates of TD in Africa and Asia at 17% and 16%, respectively. When Asia was further subdivided into SE Asia, the TD rate was 13%. There was a decreased RR of TD when taking doxycycline and traveling to Latin America (0.85 [0.8–0.91], P = 0.01) and SE Asia (0.89 [0.85–0.94], P < 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant decreased RR of TD in the doxycycline groups in travelers to Africa and tropical South America, possibly secondary to the limited number of travelers on doxycycline in these groups (N = 75 and N = 13).

Military subgroup analysis.

Because 82% of the doxycycline group were traveling for a military purpose, a subgroup analysis was performed (Table 5). A multivariate Poisson performed with the same variables as earlier, with the exception of travel to tropical South America because of the limited number of military travelers visiting this destination showed that doxycycline continued to have a statistically significant decreased RR of TD (0.46 [0.32–0.66], P < 0.01). Female gender (1.69 [1.25–2.3], P < 0.01), hotel accommodations (1.62 [1.25–2.3], P < 0.01), and longer duration of travel (1.01 [1.00–1.01], P < 0.01) continued to have a statistically significant increased RR of TD.

### Prevention and treatment of traveler's diarrhea… [^fc450fc5]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Prevention Traveler's diarrhea is fundamentally a sanitation failure, leading to bacterial contamination of food and water. It is best prevented through proper sewage treatment and water disinfection. In the absence of these amenities, the next best option is for the educated traveler to take precautions to prevent the disease. Preventive measures include not drinking tap water, not using ice in beverages, not eating salads and other forms of raw vegetables, not eating fruits that can't be peeled on the spot and not eating mayonnaise, pastry icing, unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked shellfish. Compared with bismuth subsalicylate, antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, in a dosage of 160 mg/800 mg daily, or doxycycline, in a dosage of 100 mg daily, has been found to provide even better results for up to three weeks.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea, always a controversial topic, is now recommended only in specific situations, such as in the seriously immunocompromised patient or the seriously ill patient who would not be able to withstand a diarrheal illness. If antibiotic prophylaxis is used, the antibiotic should only be taken for a three-week period. Other exceptions may include persons who plan short-term critical travel, such as a diplomatic mission, or persons who are unable to practice prevention. Loperamide may also be taken if the patient does not have dysentery. Before beginning antibiotic therapy, however, patients should first take a dose of loperamide to see if the antimotility agent stops the diarrhea. Antibiotic therapy should be deferred until it is clear that the diarrheal illness requires antibiotic therapy, since dietary change and stress can cause transient gastrointestinal upset.

2 A single antibiotic dose may be effective for mild traveler's diarrhea, and patients should reassess their condition in 12 hours to determine if further doses are necessary.
10. Public Health Issues Even with the emphasis now placed on pre-cautionary measures to prevent traveler's diarrhea rather than drug prophylaxis, the treatment of traveler's diarrhea will be increasingly hampered by antibiotic resistance. Multidrug-resistant Shigella and Salmonella strains are now so common that it is only a matter of time until they also become resistant to fluoroquinolones. Some respite may be provided by the most recently developed fluoroquinolones and azithromycin, but eventually a new approach will be necessary.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^2d89138f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our evaluation of the use of doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis and risk of TD among international travelers demonstrates a negative association between doxycycline used as malaria prophylaxis and incidence of TD in international travelers. Given the widespread prevalence of TD in international travelers, as well as the limitations and unclear efficacy of dietary restrictions for prevention, and limited options for chemoprophylaxis, these findings warrant consideration. Rifaximin is approved for the prevention of TD in selected populations. Meta-analysis shows that rifaximin has a decreased RR of developing TD (RR 0.41 [0.3–0.56], P < 0.01)compared with our study showing doxycycline RR of 0.62 (0.47–0.82), P < 0.01. Although these observational data do not derive from a randomized controlled trial, the findings support doxycycline effectiveness in TD prevention.

Travel is an increasingly common aspect of modern life, and the practicing obstetrician-gynecologist needs a good understanding of the health- and safety-related issues it presents for patients. This monograph examines the environmental data that support individual risk assessment and provides guidance on how to eliminate or mitigate those risks, including recommendations for immunization and chemoprophylaxis for women traveling to areas with endemic infectious disease. Management approaches for travel-related diseases, such as traveler's diarrhea, altitude sickness, and location-specific diseases, are reviewed as are special considerations for pregnant and breastfeeding women and women who are attempting pregnancy. Evaluation and management of the returned traveler also is addressed. The recommendations in this document cite resources available from the United States federal government; therefore, they are applicable to women seeking care in the United States.

### Traveler's diarrhea [^ab9109e8]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea affects millions of persons who travel to developing countries each year. Food and water contaminated with fecal matter are the main sources of infection. Bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella are common causes of traveler's diarrhea. Parasites and viruses are less common etiologies. Travel destination is the most significant risk factor for traveler's diarrhea. The efficacy of pretravel counseling and dietary precautions in reducing the incidence of diarrhea is unproven. Empiric treatment of traveler's diarrhea with antibiotics and loperamide is effective and often limits symptoms to one day. Rifaximin, a recently approved antibiotic, can be used for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in regions where noninvasive E. coli is the predominant pathogen. In areas where invasive organisms such as Campylobacter and Shigella are common, fluoroquinolones remain the drug of choice. Azithromycin is recommended in areas with quinolone-resistant Campylobacter and for the treatment of children and pregnant women.

### Regional variation in travel-related illness acquired in Africa, March 1997-may 2011 [^4c7a5c31]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study confirms that the likelihood of acquiring a specific infection or disease is not homogenous throughout the African continent. Medical practitioners examining returning febrile travelers from any region in sub-Saharan Africa must consider malaria as the first diagnosis. However, febrile patients, particularly those from Southern Africa, infrequently have malaria; other illnesses such as rickettsial infections are more common and should be strongly suspected. Concern about risk and possible damage to health is a determinant of whether a person will travel to a particular destination, so misconceptions should be corrected. However, because outbreaks reported, such as the recent reports of dengue virus in Angola and Kenya can rapidly alter exposure risk, up-to-date knowledge of patterns of disease is crucial.

During pretravel consultation, prevention of illness in travelers to different regions within Africa should be prioritized on the basis of the regional profile of diagnoses. For Northern Africa, advice should include detailed information about food hygiene and rabies prophylaxis. For countries in the Southern African region, malaria chemoprophylaxis and mosquito bite prevention measures should be used to prevent malaria acquisition during travel to regions in which malaria is endemic. The travel medicine advisor should be familiar with malaria-endemic and malaria-free areas in Africa to be able to provide suitable recommendations. Special attention should be paid to travelers VFR, who are most likely to acquire malaria, and to business travelers, whose malarial infection may be more likely to be fatal. Advice about preventing tick-borne rickettsial infections is essential for travelers to Southern Africa. Helminthic infections should be discussed. Preexposure and postexposure rabies vaccination, travelers' diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases should be discussed with travelers to destinations on the entire African continent.

### Advising travelers about immunizations and diarrhea… [^a83d52c2]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Medical Letter consultants generally do not recommend prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea. Prophylactic prescriptive agents such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin or norfloxacin can cause photosensitivity, and over-the-counter bismuth subsalicylate is less effective than an antibiotic. Rather, they suggest treatment only for severe or persistent symptoms. Loperamide hydrochloride, along with a single dose of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or ofloxacin, usually provides symptomatic relief in adults in less than 24 hours. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is safe for use in children. Oral rehydration salts help maintain fluid balance, particularly in young children and the elderly. However, only persons at "high risk" and those who may require medical or dental care in endemic areas require vaccination for hepatitis B.

Vaccination against influenza is recommended for all persons at high risk of complications and for those traveling to the tropics or to the Southern Hemisphere between April and September. Persons born after 1956 who have not received two doses of measles vaccine and have no history of infection or evidence of immunity should receive a single dose of measles or, preferably, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine before traveling. Meningococcal vaccine is recommended for persons traveling to areas in which epidemics are occurring. Travelers to tropical or developing countries who have not previously been immunized should complete a primary polio series of inactivated polio vaccine. Typhoid vaccine is recommended for travelers going outside usual tourist routes in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The vaccine for yellow fever is recommended for administration at least 10 days before travel to endemic areas.

Generally, patients who are pregnant or immunocompromised should not receive live virus vaccines, such as measles, oral polio and yellow fever. Prophylaxis for malaria includes a dose of 300 mg base of chloroquine once a week in areas with chloroquine-sensitive malaria. In areas of chloroquine-resistant malaria, 250 mg of mefloquine once a week is the drug of choice, except in the Thai-Cambodian and Thai-Myanmar border areas and western Cambodia, where mefloquine resistance is common. In these areas, doxycycline is an alternative treatment for persons older than 8 years of age who are not pregnant. Additional recommendations for malaria prophylaxis in adults and children were published in the January 2, 1998, edition of.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^3314444e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy in acute diarrheal infections (adults) — indications and comparative evidence: Antibiotics should be used for cases of dysentery and moderate-to-severe traveler's diarrhea where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence), and use of antibiotics for community-acquired diarrhea should be discouraged as most community-acquired diarrhea is viral and is not shortened by antibiotics (Strong recommendation, very low level evidence). For travelers' diarrhea, the evidence for the use of anti-microbial therapy is strongly supported, with antibiotics shortening the overall duration of moderate-to-severe TD to a little over 24h and reducing time to last unformed stool by 1–3 days compared with no therapy or placebo; combination of an antibiotic with loperamide further shortens duration of illness. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin have been the primary antibiotics of choice, but resistance — particularly among Campylobacter — means the use of macrolides such as azithromycin for treatment is recommended, and azithromycin was shown to be more effective than ciprofloxacin for all cases of TD in travelers to Thailand. For all antibiotics, either single-dose therapy or treatment for up to 3 days is usually sufficient; studies show that once daily therapy is as effective as 3-day therapies for TD due to noninvasive pathogens, and a 3-day therapy is recommended for patients presenting with fever or dysentery. Short-course fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotic use has demonstrated risks of development of Clostridium difficile infection and risks for tendinopathies and arthropathies.

### What's new in enteric infectious diseases at home and abroad [^1189bb3b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was designed to focus on the important research in the area of acute infectious diarrhea published within the past year. PubMed was reviewed for articles published in 2004 and 2005 relating to pathogen-specific diarrhea and for travelers' diarrhea to identify the newly published articles.

Recent Findings

New studies continue to show the importance of the diarrheagenic Escherichia coli as causes of acute and persistent diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli has recently been shown to be an unrecognized cause of community-acquired diarrhea in infants in the USA. Genetic factors explain an increased susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea among international travelers. Also, poorly non-absorbed rifaximin (< 0.4%) was shown to be an effective drug when used prophylactically to prevent bacterial diarrhea during high risk travel.

Summary

Studies will continue to define the etiology of diarrhea and to better understand the epidemiology and prevention of infectious diarrhea. Antibacterial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens is a growing problem, leading to the search for newer antibacterial drugs. Diarrhea due to bacterial agents in international travelers can be prevented and treated successfully by antibacterial drugs. The nonabsorbed rifamycin drug, rifaximin, appears to be ideally suited to become the important new drug in prevention and treatment of travelers' diarrhea. Studies are underway to determine the value of the drug in preventing invasive forms of diarrhea during travel to Asia and in the prevention of the commonly occurring post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

Clinical strategies and interventions

Travel-associated AMR has implications for clinical practice. Medical practitioners should be aware of travel history as a risk factor for AMR. Clinicians providing pretravel health consultation should also consider antimicrobial stewardship principles and be cautious about the prescription of broad-spectrum antimicrobials for empiric use by travelers. Recent analyses have shown that although the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea cannot be controlled for, reducing the use of empiric antimicrobial treatment for travelers' diarrhea may be useful for lowering the acquisition of travel-associated AMR bacteria.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics.

A total of 3,227 trips with 2,803 travelers were analyzed (Table 1). The majority of travelers were male (62.1%), with a median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59) and a median travel duration of 19 days (IQR 12,49). Caucasian (70.7%) was the most commonly reported race. Twenty-five percent of travelers were aged ≥ 60 years, and 27% who developed TD were aged ≥ 60 years. For malaria prophylaxis, 20% were prescribed doxycycline, 50% prescribed another form of malaria prophylaxis (89% of these were atovaquone–proguanil), and 30% were not prescribed malaria prophylaxis. Travelers' itineraries could include more than one region of travel. Forty-five percent traveled to Southeast (SE) Asia/Pacific Islands, 32% traveled to Africa, and 2% traveled to tropical South America. The cumulative incidence of TD was 17%, with an incidence rate of 53 per 1,000 travel days. Of the 406 trips where travelers developed TD and were prescribed malaria prophylaxis, the most common countries where TD occurred were Peru (n = 58, 14.3%), Vietnam (n = 38, 9.3%), India (n = 29, 7.1%), and Honduras (n = 28, 6.9%).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^30235c1e]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preventing bacterial enteric infections in adults and adolescents with HIV — travel and prophylaxis guidance emphasizes that immunizations (e.g., against Salmonella serotype Typhi) should be recommended in advance of travel (AIII), and antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent bacterial enteric illness is not routinely recommended, including for travelers (AIII). In rare cases — such as for immunosuppressed travelers, depending on level of immunosuppression, region of travel, and trip duration — antimicrobial prophylaxis with rifaximin or azithromycin should be offered (CIII), and antimicrobial prophylaxis with rifaximin or azithromycin should be considered (CIII). Because of toxicity associated with fluoroquinolone use and increasing antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside of the United States, routine use of fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis is discouraged (AIII). During pregnancy, azithromycin is the preferred agent for prophylaxis (BIII). For people with HIV already taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), TMP-SMX may offer limited protection against traveler's diarrhea.

### Antimicrobials increase travelers' risk of colonization by extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^2aa9c74e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Geographic Region as a Risk Factor

The risk of contracting ESBL-PE was highest in South Asia (46%), followed by Southeast Asia, East Asia, the region of North Africa together with the Middle East (33% in each of the 3 regions), and sub-Saharan Africa (12%). No cases were identified among visitors to Europe, Australia, or the Americas (Table 2).

Travelers' Diarrhea as a Risk Factor

Of all travelers, 67% (288/430) had TD; 26% (75/288) of the TD(+) and 11% (15/142) of the TD(−) subgroups became colonized by ESBL-PE (Table 2). Conversely, TD was contracted by 83% in the ESBL(+) and 63% in the ESBL(−) groups.

Use of Antimicrobials Against Travelers' Diarrhea as a Risk Factor

Antimicrobials were taken by 15% (66/430) of all travelers (doxycycline started as antimalarial prophylaxis not included) during their journeys. In 79% (52/66) of the cases, the drug was taken for TD (Table 2).

Antimicrobials taken to treat TD proved to be an independent risk factor (46% ESBL+) compared with those who did not take an antimicrobial (17% ESBL+; Table 2). In the study as a whole, the proportion of ESBL(+) cases was 11% in the subgroup TD−AB−, 21% in TD+AB−, and 37% in TD+AB+ (Figure 2). There were only 7 TD-AB+ travelers; none of them contracted ESBL-PE.

### The ill returning traveler [^26af0a4d]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 1.8 billion people will cross an international border by 2030, and 66% of travelers will develop a travel-related illness. Most travel-related illnesses are self-limiting and do not require significant intervention; others could cause significant morbidity or mortality. Physicians should begin with a thorough history and clinical examination to have the highest probability of making the correct diagnosis. Targeted questioning should focus on the type of trip taken, the travel itinerary, and a list of all geographic locations visited. Inquiries should also be made about pretravel preparations, such as chemoprophylactic medications, vaccinations, and any personal protective measures such as insect repellents or specialized clothing. Travelers visiting friends and relatives are at a higher risk of travel-related illnesses and more severe infections. The two most common vaccine-preventable illnesses in travelers are influenza and hepatitis A. Most travel-related illnesses become apparent soon after arriving at home because incubation periods are rarely longer than four to six weeks. The most common illnesses in travelers from resource-rich to resource-poor locations are travelers diarrhea and respiratory infections. Localizing symptoms such as fever with respiratory, gastrointestinal, or skin-related concerns may aid in identifying the underlying etiology.

### The pretravel consultation: recent updates [^35601e9d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Estimates suggest that 43%-79% of international travelers may develop travel-related illnesses. Most such illnesses are considered mild and self-limited; however, some are life-threatening. The pretravel consultation is aimed at assessing risks for a range of illnesses, communicating these risks, and then providing individualized recommendations and interventions to minimize or manage such risks. The effective consultation is predicated on a well-prepared clinician and motivated traveler, understanding the traveler's perception of, and tolerance for, risk, and providing education applicable to the actual itinerary. Integral to the clinician's preparation is regular review of up-to-date trip-specific recommendations; country-specific information and recommendations are readily available and can now be efficiently accessed. From the infectious diseases perspective, immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, insect repellent use, and travelers' diarrhea and its self-management are cornerstones of the consultation. This review focuses primarily on updating these 4 topics with recently published information relevant to adult travelers.

When indicated, the empiric antimicrobial therapy in adults should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate), and empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric antibacterial treatment should be considered in immunocompromised people with severe illness and bloody diarrhea (strong, low), and asymptomatic contacts of people with bloody diarrhea should not be offered empiric treatment but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate).

Travelers' diarrhea — safari travelers: Travelers' diarrhea is the most common travel-related illness and is common on safaris, with infectious causes including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa; most cases are mild and self-limiting, so advise travelers to carry antimotility medicine for symptomatic relief of mild illness, consider prescribing antibiotic therapy to treat moderate to severe disease with clear written guidance on use, ensure travelers carry any medications with them on safari, and instruct them to consult a physician for moderate, severe, or persistent symptoms.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^c5bd52b1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — treatment of acute disease: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral rehydration options in the elderly with severe diarrhea or any traveler with cholera-like watery diarrhea is recommended. The use of probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults is not recommended, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness. Bismuth subsalicylates can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild-to-moderate illness. In patients receiving antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea, adjunctive loperamide therapy should be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. The evidence does not support empiric anti-microbial therapy for routine acute diarrheal infection, except in cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics.

Travelers' diarrhea association analysis.

On univariate analysis of travel characteristics (Table 3), female travelers, travelers to tropical South America, and increased duration of travel were associated with increased risk of developing TD. Vacation, missionary travel, hotel accommodations, and medical support missions were also associated with increased risk of developing TD. On univariate analysis, use of doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis (compared with combined group of use of other or no prophylaxis), travel to multiple regions, military purpose of travel, and dormitory accommodations were associated with decreased risk of TD. On univariate analysis, the RR of TD taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis versus another agent for malaria prophylaxis was 0.45 (0.35–0.58), P < 0.01. The univariate RR of TD taking doxycycline versus no malaria prophylaxis was 0.59 (0.34–0.74), P < 0.01. In addition to doxycycline, gender, military purpose of travel, travel to tropical South America, hotel accommodation, and duration of travel were chosen as variables for multivariate analysis. Gender and hotel accommodation were selected because they had a strong effect on the univariate analysis, and hotel accommodations represented a large proportion of the study population. Military purpose of travel was chosen as this is one of the key populations in the TravMil group and to ensure that doxycycline use and military travel were both considered in the model simultaneously. Travel to tropical South America was chosen for multivariate analysis as it was a distinct geographic region that was significantly associated with TD on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis (Table 4), use of doxycycline (0.62 [0.47–0.82], P < 0.01) and military purpose of travel (0.57 [0.47–0.7], P < 0.01) remained significantly associated with decreased risk. On multivariate analysis (1.28 [1.09–1.5], P < 0.01), the median duration of travel (days) (1.0 [1.0–1.01], P < 0.01), travel to tropical South America (1.34 [1.09–1.64], P < 0.01), and hotel accommodations (1.3 [1.1–1.53], P < 0.01) were associated with increased risk.

Assessing and preparing children for international travel — a checklist for healthcare professionals directs clinicians to "Review routine childhood vaccinations. The pre-travel visit is an opportunity to ensure that children are up to date on their routine vaccinations. Some routine vaccines, such as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or hepatitis A, may need to be given earlier than routinely recommended", "Review the need for travel-related vaccines", "Review the need for travel-related medications (malaria chemoprophylaxis, medication to prevent altitude illness, anti-diarrheal medication)", "Assess all anticipated travel-related activities", "Provide preventive counseling and interventions tailored to specific risks, including special travel preparations and any treatment required for infants and children with underlying health conditions, chronic diseases, or immunocompromising conditions", "Discuss how to establish a plan of where and how to seek medical care while traveling and discuss the need for travel health insurance", and "Encourage caregivers to carry an adequate supply of medications for children who require medications to manage chronic health conditions".
