## Question

lumbar xray 9/11/24 - Grade 1 retrolisthesis L2 L3 L4, intervertebral disc space narrowing, large osteophyte formation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a lumbar radiograph showing grade 1 retrolisthesis at L2-L3 and L3-L4, with disc space narrowing and large osteophytes, and how to correlate this with symptoms and next steps in management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the radiographic definitions and what grade 1 retrolisthesis implies. Then, I should verify the degenerative cascade and how disc narrowing and osteophytes fit mechanistically. Next, I will correlate these imaging findings with clinical symptoms, being careful not to over-attribute pain to radiographs. After that, I need to check for red flags and indications for advanced imaging. Finally, I will outline management pathways, including when conservative care suffices and when surgery is reasonable, and I will consider special issues like adjacent segment disease and dynamic instability, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the pathology. Grade 1 retrolisthesis means posterior translation of a vertebral body by up to about 25% of the vertebral width relative to the adjacent level, which is the mildest slip grade and often reflects degenerative changes rather than acute instability, particularly in the upper lumbar spine where retrolisthesis is more common than in the lower lumbar region [^1145cEmT]. I should also verify that disc space narrowing and osteophyte formation are classic features of degenerative disc disease and spondylosis, reflecting loss of disc height and reactive bony remodeling that can stabilize but also compress neural elements depending on location and severity [^116yLmPb] [^111j9pMj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to ensure I'm framing these radiographic changes within the degenerative cascade: loss of disc height increases mechanical load on facet joints and endplates, prompting osteophyte formation and sometimes retrolisthesis as a compensatory or degenerative adaptation, which can be a stabilizing response rather than a driver of instability per se [^111j9pMj] [^116yLmPb]. But wait, what if the retrolisthesis is dynamic and clinically meaningful? Dynamic flexion-extension radiographs can detect motion that static films miss, yet high-quality evidence suggests routine dynamic films rarely change initial management when standing AP/lateral are already abnormal, so I should be selective in ordering them [^1137gtaG] [^111pFiHX].

> Next, I should review the clinical correlation, and I need to be cautious here. Large population-based cohorts show that the presence and number of segments with disc space narrowing and osteophytes correlate poorly with back pain-related disability, so imaging alone cannot determine the pain generator or dictate treatment intensity [^111bG7ni] [^116NqhcF]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought disc space narrowing at two or more levels might reliably predict worse pain, but I should double-check that nuance; while some studies suggest stronger associations of multi-level narrowing with low back pain, especially in men, others emphasize that radiographic severity does not map cleanly onto disability, so clinical correlation remains paramount [^113T6PR2] [^111bG7ni].

> I will now examine symptom patterns that would make me suspect neural compression from these degenerative changes. Neurogenic claudication with leg pain that improves with sitting or lumbar flexion, radicular pain in a dermatomal pattern, or focal neurologic deficits would raise concern for central or foraminal stenosis at L2-L3 or L3-L4, where osteophytes and disc collapse can narrow the canal or foramina and compress nerve roots or the cauda equina [^111EaGkz] [^113UA6Ko]. Let me verify the levels most commonly affected by stenosis; L3-L4 and L4-L5 are frequent, so upper lumbar involvement is plausible and clinically relevant when symptoms match the anatomy [^111EaGkz].

> I need to ensure I screen for red flags and indications for advanced imaging. Cauda equina features, progressive motor weakness, severe or worsening radiculopathy, or failure of 6–12 weeks of conservative care justify MRI to define canal and foraminal dimensions, nerve root impingement, and to distinguish central from foraminal stenosis, with CT myelography reserved for MRI contraindications or when metal artifact obscures MRI [^116qTvTr] [^116aFCro]. Hold on, I should verify guideline strength; NASS gives MRI a Grade B recommendation to confirm anatomic stenosis when clinical suspicion is high, which aligns with standard practice [^116qTvTr].

> Let me consider conservative management first, because most degenerative spondylolisthesis and stenosis presentations improve without surgery. Core strengthening, aerobic conditioning, physical therapy emphasizing flexion-based programs, weight optimization, and NSAIDs are foundational, and epidural steroid injections can be considered for persistent radicular symptoms or neurogenic claudication after a structured conservative trial, ideally guided by imaging to target the correct level [^111EaGkz]. I should confirm that guidelines support injections as part of a multimodal plan rather than as isolated therapy, which they do in carefully selected patients [^111EaGkz].

> Now, I should review surgical indications and options if conservative care fails or deficits progress. Decompression alone is reasonable for stenosis with stable alignment, whereas decompression with fusion is favored when instability is present or iatrogenic instability is anticipated, and interspinous devices or minimally invasive fusion techniques can be considered in selected patients with mild-to-moderate stenosis and dynamic symptoms [^113bAdTL] [^116sT4B3]. Wait, let me verify the role of dynamic imaging in surgical planning; while dynamic films can document motion, evidence is mixed on routine use, so I should reserve them for cases where instability will change operative strategy [^1137gtaG] [^111pFiHX].

> I should double-check the prognostic implications of grade 1 retrolisthesis specifically. Many patients with low-grade degenerative slips, including retrolisthesis, remain stable over time, and progression is less likely when discs have lost substantial height and osteophytes have formed, though symptoms may fluctuate independent of slip progression, reinforcing that imaging severity should not dictate urgency without clinical correlation [^114GjHNP]. But wait, what if the slip is dynamic and correlates with symptoms? In that subset, stabilization may confer benefit, but I need to ensure symptoms truly map to that level before committing to fusion [^114xYfMf].

> Let me think about adjacent segment disease and sagittal balance, because upper lumbar pathology can influence load transfer. Retrolisthesis at L2-L3 or L3-L4 may reflect or contribute to regional compensation for global or focal sagittal imbalance, and prior fusions can accelerate degeneration at adjacent levels, occasionally culminating in stenosis or even cauda equina compression in rare cases, so I should assess whole-spine alignment when planning interventions [^111YmB1m] [^116aFCro]. I should confirm that full-length standing radiographs are recommended in surgical planning to capture compensatory mechanisms, which they are in contemporary alignment-focused care [^114ZZF4D].

> Next, I should review special considerations unique to upper lumbar levels. Upper lumbar disc herniations and degenerative changes can present with atypical radicular patterns and may have different surgical outcomes compared with lower lumbar levels, with reports suggesting worse outcomes and higher reoperation or fusion rates at L1-L2 and L2-L3, so I need to counsel patients accordingly and set expectations [^1125kqNm]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to degenerative retrolisthesis as well; while data are strongest for herniations, the upper lumbar biomechanics and nerve root anatomy plausibly extend similar cautions to degenerative slips, which supports a conservative-first approach unless deficits mandate surgery [^1125kqNm].

> Finally, I need to ensure my documentation and communication are precise. I should explicitly state that the retrolisthesis is grade 1 and likely degenerative, quantify the number of levels with disc space narrowing and osteophytes, and emphasize that these findings are common in adults and not inherently causal of pain, anchoring decisions to the patient's specific symptom pattern, functional goals, and neurologic status rather than imaging alone [^111bG7ni] [^112YffQa]. If I initially implied that multi-level narrowing necessarily predicts worse disability, I should correct that to reflect the mixed and largely weak associations seen in high-quality cohorts, reinforcing the primacy of clinical correlation in management decisions [^111bG7ni] [^116NqhcF].

The lumbar X-ray shows **grade 1 retrolisthesis at L2-L3 and L3-L4** with **disc space narrowing and large osteophytes**, indicating **degenerative spondylolisthesis** with mild posterior vertebral displacement and advanced osteoarthritis [^112Zy5hN] [^115FixoJ]. These changes are common in older adults and may be **asymptomatic or cause axial pain**; however, they can also compress nerve roots, leading to radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication [^111EaGkz]. Management is **guided by symptoms**: use conservative care (physical therapy, NSAIDs, epidural injections) for mild symptoms, and consider MRI if neurological symptoms or red flags are present; surgery is reserved for persistent neurological deficits or refractory pain [^116qTvTr] [^111j9pMj].

---

## Radiographic findings and clinical significance

### Grade 1 retrolisthesis

By definition, **grade 1 retrolisthesis** is a posterior displacement of ≤ 25% of the vertebral body's width, indicating mild degenerative instability [^notfound]. Its **clinical significance** is that it is often asymptomatic but may cause axial pain or, when nerve roots are compressed, radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication [^113UA6Ko].

---

### Intervertebral disc space narrowing

By definition, **disc space narrowing** reflects loss of disc height from degenerative disc disease, reducing mechanical support and increasing facet joint load [^113tozSu]. Its **clinical significance** is that it is associated with back pain and stiffness and can contribute to spinal stenosis and nerve root compression [^113T6PR2].

---

### Large osteophyte formation

By definition, **osteophytes** are bony outgrowths from vertebral endplates and facet joints reflecting advanced degenerative change [^113tozSu]. Their **clinical significance** is that they can compress nerve roots or the spinal canal, causing radiculopathy or spinal stenosis [^113UA6Ko].

---

## Clinical implications and symptoms

These degenerative changes can cause a range of symptoms, including:

- **Axial back pain**: Common with degenerative disc disease and osteophytes [^113T6PR2].
- **Radiculopathy**: Nerve root compression from retrolisthesis or osteophytes causing leg pain, numbness, or weakness [^111EaGkz].
- **Neurogenic claudication**: Spinal stenosis from disc narrowing and osteophytes causing leg pain with walking, relieved by rest [^113UA6Ko].
- **Reduced mobility**: Stiffness and limited range of motion from degenerative changes [^111j9pMj].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

MRI is the **preferred modality** to assess nerve root compression, spinal stenosis, and soft-tissue involvement; obtain it if neurological symptoms or red flags are present [^116qTvTr]. CT is useful for detailed bony assessment — particularly for osteophytes and facet joint degeneration — and is often used when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive [^114nsatZ]. Dynamic flexion-extension radiographs can help assess instability if neurological symptoms persist despite conservative care [^115zFmDT].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility, and posture training to reduce pain and improve function [^notfound].
- **Medications**: NSAIDs, analgesics, and muscle relaxants for pain control.
- **Epidural steroid injections**: For radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication from nerve root compression [^115mcSo1].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, activity modification, and ergonomic adjustments [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Indications include **persistent neurological deficits**, refractory pain despite conservative therapy, or progressive instability. Common procedures are **decompression (laminectomy or foraminotomy)** to relieve nerve root compression, with fusion (posterior lumbar interbody fusion [PLIF] or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion [TLIF]) considered if instability is present [^113bAdTL].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis is **generally favorable** with conservative care; many patients improve without surgery, though degenerative changes are progressive and may worsen over time. Surgical outcomes are favorable for appropriately selected patients with persistent neurological deficits or refractory pain [^115XC314].

---

The lumbar X-ray shows **degenerative changes** with grade 1 retrolisthesis, disc narrowing, and large osteophytes at L2-L3 and L3-L4. These findings are common in older adults and may cause axial pain or nerve compression; management should be **symptom-driven**, with conservative care first and surgery reserved for refractory cases or neurological deficits.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — yield of standing flexion-extension radiographs: In a retrospective radiographic review using a minimum measurement of 2mm to define spondylolisthesis, 67 (20%) had anterolisthesis and 46 (13%) had retrolisthesis, including 54% at L4–5 and 31% at L5-S1, yet only 2/342 patients had new flexion/extension findings not seen on standard radiographs and 15 showed degree changes without Meyerding grade change. This provides Level II diagnostic evidence that standing lateral extension films are not indicated in patients without degenerative spondylolisthesis on standing radiograph.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^112kg4DF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Considering that the number of lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected and the various types of radiographic changes might be associated with the results, we generated 3 composite scores: a K-L grade–based score, an osteophyte grade–based score, and a disc space narrowing grade–based score; at each segment, a binary exposure variable of 1 (K-L grade ≥ 2, which means at least definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space are present; disc space narrowing and osteophyte grade ≥ 1, which means at least mild or definite changes are present) vs 0 (K-L grade 0 or 1; disc space narrowing and osteophyte grade 0) was used. The composite score was then calculated as the final L1-L2 score + L2-L3 score + L3-L4 score + L4-L5 score, with values ranging from 0 to 4 (where 0 indicates no lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected and 4 indicates 4 lumbar spine segments with radiographic changes detected). The K-L grade–based score was defined as the primary exposure. Osteophyte and disc space narrowing grade–based scores were set as secondary exposures.

Exposures

Lateral lumbar spine radiographs at year 9 were taken by 1 radiographer, centered on the L3 vertebra, with the participants in the left lateral recumbent position. A single trained observer (a rheumatologist) blinded to patient identity and chronologic order read all of the radiographs. Within-observer variation was assessed by test-retest analysis of 40 randomly selected radiographs from the study. Good within-observer reproducibility (κ = 0.78–0.89) was found. At each lumbar spine segment (L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5), disc space narrowing and osteophytes (both anterior and posterior) were assessed through the semiquantitative method reported by Lane et al, with grade 0 corresponding to normal, grade 1 to mild narrowing and osteophytes, grade 2 to moderate narrowing and osteophytes, and grade 3 to severe narrowing and osteophytes. The Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade was summarized as grade 0 indicating normal; grade 1 indicating doubtful narrowing of disc space and possible osteophytic lipping; grade 2 indicating definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space; grade 3 indicating moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of disc space, some sclerosis, and possible deformity of bone contour; and grade 4 indicating large osteophytes, marked narrowing of disc space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour.

### Recurrent adjacent segment disease and cauda equina syndrome [^116aFCro]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

A case of cauda equina lesion as a result of recurrent adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) after multiple lumbar fusions is reported. ASD might be a consequence of biomechanical overload or simply a normal degenerative process. The reported clinical relevance of ASD is rather low. We describe an unusual case of cauda equina compression at L1-L2 in a patient who had undergone L2-L4 fusion 8 years previously and 2 decompression-fusion surgeries 16 years before.

Materials and Methods

A 72-year-old man, who had two previous lumbar fusion-decompression procedures, underwent a third lumbar surgery in December 2000 to treat symptomatic spinal canal stenosis associated with L3-L4 pseudoarthrosis. After a symptom-free period of 8 years, the patient experienced low back pain radiating to both legs while standing, associated with saddle sensory disturbances and incontinence. Physical examination ruled out significant motor deficits. Plain radiographs showed solid fusion from L2 to L4, good spinal alignment, and low-grade L1-L2 retrolisthesis. Stainless steel pedicular instrumentation distorted magnetic resonance imaging, preventing adequate spinal canal evaluation. Electromyography demonstrated signs of cauda equina compression (bilateral L3-S2). CT myelography showed a stop at L1-L2, due to a severe spinal canal stenosis. L1-L2 decompression and fusion were performed.

Results

After an uneventful surgery with no complications, the symptoms abated and incontinence recovered.

Conclusions

Even if the reported clinical relevance of ASD is very low, fused patients with a constitutional narrow spinal canal are at risk of developing severe neural compression at the level adjacent to the fusion.

Conclusions

In this cohort of middle-aged, community-dwelling women, there was no evidence to support an association between a higher number of lumbar segments with radiographic changes (K-L grade, osteophytes, and disc space narrowing) and more severe back pain–related disability cross-sectionally or over time. The findings suggest that the changes detected on lumbar radiographs provide limited value for decision-making regarding back pain management in this population.

Key Points

Question

Are lumbar spine radiographic changes associated with severity of back pain–related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study of women from the UK, there was no evidence to support an association between a higher number of lumbar segments with radiographic changes (Kellgren-Lawrence grade, osteophytes, and disc space narrowing) and more severe back pain–related disability in cross-sectional (650 women) or longitudinal (443 women) analyses.

Meaning

The findings suggest that the changes detected on lumbar radiographs provide limited value for decision-making regarding back pain management in this population.

### Degenerative retrolisthesis: is it a compensatory mechanism for sagittal imbalance? [^1145cEmT]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2013). Low credibility.

We investigated the spinopelvic morphology and global sagittal balance of patients with a degenerative retrolisthesis or anterolisthesis. A total of 269 consecutive patients with a degenerative spondylolisthesis were included in this study. There were 95 men and 174 women with a mean age of 64.3 years (sd 10.5; 40 to 88). A total of 106 patients had a pure retrolisthesis (R group), 130 had a pure anterolisthesis (A group), and 33 had both (R+A group). A backward slip was found in the upper lumbar levels (mostly L2 or L3) with an almost equal gender distribution in both the R and R+A groups. The pelvic incidence and sacral slope of the R group were significantly lower than those of the A (both p < 0.001) and R+A groups (both p < 0.001). The lumbar lordosis of the R+A group was significantly greater than that of the R (p = 0.025) and A groups (p = 0.014). The C7 plumb line of the R group was located more posteriorly than that of the A group (p = 0.023), but was no different from than that of the R+A group (p = 0.422). The location of C7 plumb line did not differ between the three groups (p = 0.068). The spinosacral angle of the R group was significantly smaller than that of the A group (p < 0.001) and R+A group (p < 0.001). Our findings imply that there are two types of degenerative retrolisthesis: one occurs primarily as a result of degeneration in patients with low pelvic incidence, and the other occurs secondarily as a compensatory mechanism in patients with an anterolisthesis and high pelvic incidence.

### The utility of dynamic flexion-extension radiographs in the initial evaluation of the degenerative lumbar spine [^1137gtaG]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective radiographic review.

Objective

To assess the utility of lateral dynamic flexion-extension radiographs in the initial evaluation of the degenerative lumbar spine.

Summary Of Background Data

Most surgeons obtain standing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs in the initial evaluation of patients presenting with lumbar complaints. The potential role of dynamic films in this population has not been established.

Methods

Of a 390 radiograph series, 342 met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. After assessment of the AP and lateral radiographs, dynamic films were evaluated to determine if additional information was obtained.

Results

Only 2 of the 342 radiographic series had new findings seen on dynamic films not appreciated on the AP and lateral films (a L3-L4 anterolisthesis of 3 mm with flexion and a L5-S1 retrolisthesis of 4 mm with extension). Fifteen additional radiographic series were noted to have a change in the amount of anterolisthesis or retrolisthesis on the dynamic films (changes ranged from 2 to 5 mm).

Conclusion

In the population studied, dynamic radiographs did not significantly alter the initial course of clinical management beyond standing AP and lateral lumbar images.

Radiographic degenerative changes in workers — Among concrete workers (n = 216) and house painters (n = 201), graded assessment of lumbar disc space narrowing, vertebral osteophytes and endplate sclerosis showed a trend of increasing LBP with increased severity of degeneration without statistical significance; the authors concluded there was an association between moderate to severe degenerative changes and increased risk of sciatic pain, but no significant correlations with occurrence of back pain, and Level III evidence indicated degenerative changes on imaging were not associated with increased risk of the occurrence of nonspecific LBP.

### The association between lumbar disc degeneration and low back pain: the influence of age, gender, and individual radiographic features [^113T6PR2]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional open population based study (nested in a prospective cohort study).

Objective

To explore the association of the different individual radiographic features, including osteophytes and disc space narrowing, with self-reported low back pain (LBP). Different definitions of lumbar disc degeneration with self-reported LBP and disability were considered in a large open population sample. Furthermore, in order to disentangle the discrepancies in reported strength of the associations, we characterized the frequency of the different individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and definitions of lumbar disc degeneration, as well as their association with LBP status, by age, gender, and vertebral level.

Summary Of Background Data

Currently within the literature, there have been no studies that have explored different definitions of lumbar disc degeneration and their association with LBP within one study sample.

Methods

The intervertebral disc spaces (L1/2 to L5-S1) were evaluated for the presence and severity of anterior osteophytes and disc space narrowing using a semiquantitative score (grade 0–3). Logistic regression was used to determine the association between these individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and different definitions of lumbar disc degeneration for LBP.

Results

Lumbar radiographs were scored for 1204 men, and 1615 women. Osteophytes were the most frequent radiographic feature observed, with men having the greatest frequency. Disc space narrowing was more frequent in women than men. Both radiographic features increased in frequency with age. Disc space narrowing appeared more strongly associated with LBP than osteophytes, especially in men (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–2.8). Disc space narrowing at 2 or more levels appeared more strongly associated with LBP than disc space narrowing at only 1 level (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.6–3.4). After excluding level L5-S1, the strength of almost all associations increased.

Conclusion

We are the first to report different possible lumbar disc degeneration definitions and their associations with LBP. Disc space narrowing at 2 or more levels appeared more strongly associated with LBP than other radiographic features, especially after excluding level L5-S1.

### Which factors prognosticate spinal instability following lumbar laminectomy? [^116fMgy3]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Parameters

For assessment of spines, we used clinically relevant and methodologically validated parameters of lumbar spinal degeneration as recommended by the European Spine Society. Grading methods for disc degeneration with an intraclass correlation coefficient or an interobserver κ > 0.60 were included. For facet joint degeneration, grading schemes with an intraclass correlation coefficient or interobserver κ > 0.40 were used in the present study.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, Siemens© Symphony 1.5 T: Syngo MR A30, software NUMARIS/4, Berlin, Germany) of lumbar spines was performed to assess intervertebral disc degeneration according to Griffith and Pfirrmann and facet joint degeneration according to Weishaupt. Disc degeneration, (including narrowing and osteophytes, respectively Lanes 1 and 2) and facet joint degeneration of levels L2–L3 and L4–L5 were also assessed based on radiographs (Sedical© Digital Vet. DX-6, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). Furthermore, MRI was used to assess the presence of Modic changes and Schmorl's nodes and to determine intervertebral disc and pedicle geometry and facet joint angles. Disc geometry included: disc length, width, height, surface area, and volume. Disc surface area, disc volume and pedicle diameter were calculated assuming an elliptic shape (surface = [1/4]π × length × width). For pedicle diameter, an average of left and right pedicles was taken for the top (L2 or L4) and bottom (L3 or L5) of each segment. Mean facet joint angle was calculated by averaging left and right angles per segmental level (L2–L3 or L4–L5) while facet joint angle differences or tropism was determined by calculating the difference between left and right facet joint angles. Segmental frontal surface area (FA), defined in cm², bone mineral content (BMC in g) and bone mineral density (BMD in g/cm²) of lumbar spinal sections (L2–L3 and L4–L5) were measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic© QDR 4500 Delphi DXA scanner, Waltham, MA, USA) in anteroposterior direction. All assessments were performed using Osirix software (Osirix©, version 3.8.1. Pixmeo SARL, Geneva, Switzerland).

### Lumbar disc degeneration: association between osteophytes, end-plate sclerosis and disc space narrowing [^116yLmPb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar disc degeneration is characterised radiologically by the presence of osteophytes, end-plate sclerosis and disc space narrowing.

Aim

To determine the strength of the association between increasing severity of combinations of these features in a population sample of men and women.

Methods

Men and women aged ≥ 50 years were recruited from a primary care-based community health index in Aberdeen, UK. Participants had lateral spinal radiographs performed according to a standard protocol. The intervertebral disc spaces (L1/2-L4/5) were evaluated for the presence of anterior osteophytes, end-plate sclerosis and disc space narrowing using a graded semiquantitative score (grade 0–3). Log linear modelling was used to determine the associations (pairwise) between increasing severity of these features, with the results expressed as beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

There were 286 men (mean age 65.3 years) and 299 women (mean age 65.2 years) with spinal radiographs, yielding a total of 2340 assessable lumbar vertebral levels. In all, 73% of vertebral levels had evidence of osteophytes, 26% of sclerosis and 37% of disc space narrowing. Increasing severity of osteophyte grade was associated with an increasing severity both of sclerosis and of disc space narrowing, whereas the severity of sclerosis was associated with the severity of narrowing. This was true at all vertebral levels. The strongest association, however, was between osteophytes and sclerosis (beta coefficient = 2.7, 95% CI 2.4 to 3.1). For sclerosis and narrowing the beta coefficient was 1.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1), whereas for osteophytes and narrowing the beta coefficient was much weaker at 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.3). There was no important influence of vertebral level on any of these associations.

Conclusion

The association between increasing severity of osteophytes and end-plate sclerosis is stronger than for other combinations of radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration.

Fig. 22 — Degenerative disc disease superimposed on congenital lumbar stenosis is depicted in a 44 y/o male with chronic low back pain, NIC and bilateral L4 radiculopathy, with congenital lumbar stenosis and multilevel DDD including diffuse disc bulging from L2–5, endplate osteophytes and endplate reactive marrow changes; ligamenta flava hypertrophy is severe at L3/4. Axial images at L3 show the congenital trefoil appearance of the spinal canal with superimposed degenerative facet disease and severe ligamenta flava hypertrophy, with degenerative changes that further decrease the already narrowed AP dimension of the spinal canal causing grade C/D central stenosis. At L3/4 there is severe spinal canal stenosis including severe central canal grade D and bilateral lateral recess stenoses, with moderately severe facet hypertrophy and moderate ligamenta flava hypertrophy contributing and worsening the underlying congenital stenosis.

### Radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and self-reported back pain [^111vUMks]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the occurrence of radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration including the presence of osteophytes, endplate sclerosis, and disc space narrowing and to determine their relationship with self-reported back pain.

Methods

Subjects aged 50 years and over were recruited from a primary care based community health index in Aberdeen, UK. Subjects were invited to complete an interviewer administered questionnaire and to have lateral spinal radiographs performed. The questionnaire included questions concerning the occurrence of back pain, both ever and in the past year. The inter-vertebral disc spaces (L1/2 to L4/5) were evaluated for the presence and severity of anterior osteophytes, endplate sclerosis, and disc space narrowing using a semi-quantitative score (grade 0–3). Logistic regression was used to determine the association between these individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration (using for each feature, the most severely affected vertebra) and back pain, with adjustments made for age and gender.

Results

There were 286 men (mean age 65.3 years), and 299 women (mean age 65.2 years) with spinal radiographs. Osteophytes were the most frequent radiographic feature. Osteophytes and endplate sclerosis were more frequent in men than women, but there was no gender difference in the frequency of disc space narrowing. All radiographic features increased in frequency with age; for osteophytes this was true only after excluding mild (grade 1) osteophytes. Compared to those without, those with disc space narrowing were more likely to report back pain both ever, [odds ratio (OR) = 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5 to 3.0] and in the past year (OR = 1.7) with the strength of the association increasing with increasing severity of narrowing. Endplate sclerosis was not linked with back pain although moderate (grade 2) sclerosis was associated with back pain, both ever and in the past year. Compared to those without, or those with mild osteophytes, those with more severe osteophytes (grade > 1) were more likely to report back pain ever (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.5).

Conclusion

These data highlight the frequent occurrence, and the increase in frequency with age, of the individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration in population samples of men and women. Disc space narrowing appeared more strongly associated with back pain than the other radiographic features.

### Effects of spine loading in a patient with post-decompression lumbar disc herniation: observations using an open weight-bearing MRI [^112SMxAA]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our objective was to use an open weight-bearing MRI to identify the effects of different loading conditions on the inter-vertebral anatomy of the lumbar spine in a post-discectomy recurrent lumbar disc herniation patient.

Methods

A 43-year-old male with a left-sided L5-S1 post-decompression re-herniation underwent MR imaging in three spine-loading conditions: (1) supine, (2) weight-bearing on standing (WB), and (3) WB with 10% of body mass axial loading (WB + AL) (5% through each shoulder). A segmentation-based proprietary software was used to calculate and compare linear dimensions, angles and cross sections across the lumbar spine.

Results

The L5 vertebrae showed a 4.6 mm posterior shift at L5-S1 in the supine position that changed to an anterior translation > 2.0 mm on WB. The spinal canal sagittal thickness at L5-S1 reduced from supine to WB and WB + AL (13.4, 10.6, 9.5 mm) with corresponding increases of 2.4 and 3.5 mm in the L5-S1 disc protrusion with WB and WB + AL, respectively. Change from supine to WB and WB + AL altered the L5-S1 disc heights (10.2, 8.6, 7.0 mm), left L5-S1 foramen heights (12.9, 11.8, 10.9 mm), L5-S1 segmental angles (10.3°, 2.8°, 4.3°), sacral angles (38.5°, 38.3°, 40.3°), L1-L3-L5 angles (161.4°, 157.1°, 155.1°), and the dural sac cross sectional areas (149, 130, 131 mm²). Notably, the adjacent L4-L5 segment demonstrated a retro-listhesis > 2.3 mm on WB.

Conclusion

We observed that with weight-bearing, measurements indicative of spinal canal narrowing could be detected. These findings suggest that further research is warranted to determine the potential utility of weight-bearing MRI in clinical decision-making.

### Decompression alone or decompression with fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized clinical trial with two-year MRI follow-up [^111vvH3k]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a new spinal stenosis on two-year MRI, either restenosis at the operated level(s), a proximal adjacent level stenosis, or both. Stenosis was defined as a dural sac cross-sectional area of ≤ 75 mm². The cut-off of ≤ 75 mm², which was also used as an inclusion criteria, is commonly used for preoperative evaluation and based on experimental studies. Secondary outcomes from MRI for stenosis were dural sac morphology according to Schizas (grades C-D regarded as stenosis)and absolute dural sac area (mm²). Disc degeneration at the proximal adjacent level was also assessed on MRI (Pfirrmann grade I to V, V being worst). The grade of vertebral slip (mm), was assessed for operated level(s) using conventional lateral radiographs. Negative spondylolisthesis ('retrolisthesis') was considered equal to no spondylolisthesis and registered as 0 mm. Using negative values would have underestimated the spondylolisthesis on a group level.

Patient-reported outcome measures included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Euro-Qol five-dimension health questionnaire (EQ-5D), and visual analogue scales (VAS) for leg and back pain. The ODI (range 0 to 100, with 100 being worst) measures the degree of disability and quality in life in patients with low back pain. The EQ-5D (range 0 to 1, with 0 being worst) measures quality of life. The VAS ranged from 0 to 100, with 100 being worst. ODI, EQ-5D, and VAS scores were patient-reported data obtained from validated questionnaires collected from Swespine.

OA assessment

A musculoskeletal radiologist (blinded to group and chronological order of scans) with 5 yr of imaging experience graded each scan on the following spinal OA parameters at lumbar spine levels L1 to L5: endplate sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and face joint OA. Four grades of endplate sclerosis were defined (0–3) per the method of Wilke et al.

Osteophyte formation was graded 0 through 3 using a classification system also defined by Wilke et al.based on the measurement of the largest osteophyte on each vertebra.

The lumbar facet joints were graded at each lumbar spine level, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5/sacral base (S1) for OA changes. Four grades of facet joint OA (0–3) were defined using criteria developed by Kalichman et al.and Pathria et al.which is based on joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and hypertrophy and other changes of the articular process of the facet joint.

A summary index score for each participant at baseline and follow-up was created by simply summing the grades of facet joint OA, endplate sclerosis, and osteophyte formation (possible summary index range: 0–45). A summary of the OA grading scheme (Table 1) and examples of grading schemes can be found in the supplementary material (Figures S1 and S2).

5.1.2 Lumbar spinal stenosis — definition, affected levels, causes, symptoms, and surgical prevalence: Spinal stenosis is the result of abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal, lateral recess or the intervertebral foramina, resulting in pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. The two lower motion segments (L3-L4 and L4-L5) are the most commonly affected. Common causes include disc-related degeneration, osteophyte formation, herniated discs, arthritis, ligament or facet joint hypertrophy, epidural fat deposition, spinal tumors, and traumas. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common source of back and leg pain, and often involves weakness and numbness; more severe cases may present with neurological symptoms such as radiculopathy, myelopathy or cauda equina syndrome, and permanent numbness or paralysis can result from a long-term compression. Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common cause of spinal surgery in patients over 65 years old.

Radiographic parameters

The following lesions were scored on radiographs. Disc height loss is defined as the narrowing of the disc space relative to two adjacent (healthy) discs. By definition, the lumbar disc spaces should increase in height in the cranial to caudal direction, except disc L5–S1, which normally is smaller than disc L4–L5. Osteophytes are characterised by reactive bone hypertrophy, seen as bony spurs arising from the vertebral body close to the vertebral endplate in a horizontal configuration. Sclerosis is defined as an increased bone density adjacent to the vertebral endplates. Facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA) is defined as sclerotic joint surfaces and osteophyte formation. Schmorl's nodes are characterised by a radiolucent contour defect of the vertebral endplate with sclerotic margins. Spondylolisthesis is a condition that occurs when a vertebral body slips relative to the adjacent vertebral body because of spondylolysis (a congenital defect) or FJOA. It is graded according to the percentage of anterior translation with respect to the adjacent level on a three-point scale (grade I: a slip of less than one-third, grade II: a slip of up to two-thirds, grade III: a slip of more than two-thirds).

### Sagittal alignment in the degenerative lumbar spine: surgical planning [^114ZZF4D]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Example

Brief History

A 73-year-old patient presented with progressive low back pain, unresponsive to conservative measures, and bilateral lower-extremity radiculopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed moderate central and neuroforaminal stenosis bilaterally at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. The preoperative patient-reported outcome measures were an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) of 40, EuroQol Index Score (estimated health utility) of 0.60, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Mental Health (GMH) of 50.80 and Global Physical Health (GPH) of 37.40, and Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA), determined from the Exercise Vital Sign (EVS), of 90.00.

Preoperative Radiographic Alignment

Obtaining imaging that captures the entire spine and the lower extremities is preferred to assess any compensatory changes that have occurred. Lumbar and full-body lateral free-standing radiographs revealed L4-L5 and L5-S1 grade-2 spondylolisthesis, dynamic in nature when compared between flexion and extension radiographs. In addition, compensatory L3-L4 lordosis and L2-L3 hyperlordosis were noted. The patient had an L1-L4 lordosis of 38.1° and an L4-S1 lordosis of 18.3°, indicating a maldistribution of lordosis (Fig. 5). The PT was 28°, indicating compensatory pelvic retroversion.

The aim of this study was to examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between lumbar radiographic changes and the severity of back pain–related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women using composite scores that combined the number of segments and type of changes in terms of K-L grade, disc space narrowing, and osteophytes. We hypothesized that a higher number of segments with lumbar radiographic changes would be associated with more severe back pain–related disability.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^115zFmDT]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging classification of facet joint osteoarthritis

Two classifications of FJ degeneration are recommended for clinical use. Radiographically, Pathria's classification classifies FJ arthropathy as well: Facets with joint space narrowing are classified as grade 1, facets with narrowing and sclerosis or hypertrophy as grade 2, and facets with severe degenerative disease encompassing narrowing, sclerosis, and osteophytes as grade 3. Standard radiographs (Meyerding or Taillard classification) also evaluate motion-related abnormalities in flexion or extension, and assess instability in cases of spondylolisthesis, thanks to dynamic studies. In the setting of degenerative spondylolisthesis, a weight-bearing lateral flexion-extension radiograph is most effective for grading spondylolisthesis and may be needed in addition to MRI and CT imaging. Anteroposterior translation of more than a few millimetres is suggestive of lumbar spine instability in the sagittal plane, which in the appropriate clinical setting may require surgical arthrodesis. In addition to Pathria's classification, Weishaupt's grading scheme, based on the agreement between MRI and CT imaging, has been proposed. Facets were again graded from 0 to 3 depending on the degree of joint space narrowing, hypertrophy, sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. The authors recommended against the routine use of CT imaging in the presence of an adequate MRI scan. Fujiwara et al. is credited with developing the standard MRI-based classification system for lumbar FJ osteoarthritis. An additional grading system for foramen stenosis, caused by disc and FJ degeneration can be used as well, based on the depiction of the foraminal components: nerve, vessels and fat. First stage, the non stenotic stage: no modifications depicted. Second stage corresponds to stenosis without evidence of root compression. Third stage, compression of the spinal nerve in the intervertebral foramen caused by either intervertebral disc, flaval ligament or osseous stenosis. In this stage, the content of the foramen is not well identified. A grading scale has also been proposed for lumbar canal stenosis as follows: A) cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) is clearly visible inside the thecal sac, but its distribution is inhomogeneous. B) Some CSF is still present, giving a grainy appearance to the thecal sac. The rootlets occupy the whole of the dural sac, but they can still be individualized. C) the dural sac demonstrates a homogeneous grey signal with no CSF. No rootlets can be recognized. D) In addition to no rootlets being recognizable, there is no epidural fat posteriorly.

Radiographic degeneration and low back pain (LBP) in community adults — Cho et al conducted a cross-sectional study in the Korean Health and Genome cohort (aged 40–79 years) with lumbar spine radiographs available for 1,772 subjects; a single rheumatologist graded anterior osteophytes, endplate sclerosis, and joint space narrowing using the Kellgren–Lawrence (K–L) system, and participants reported LBP (current, past 6 months, lifetime) using the 7-item Guttman scale. Risk factors associated with either current or lifetime LBP included advanced age, female sex, time spent squatting, presence of osteophytes, joint space narrowing and advanced K–L grading; there was no association between presence of endplate sclerosis and LBP. This study provides Level III evidence that presence of disc space narrowing and osteophytes, but not presence of endplate sclerosis, correlates with LBP.

### Disk degeneration of the upper lumbar disks is associated with hip pain [^116TKS5Z]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

A possible cause of hip pain is the presence of radiating pain from the higher lumbar spine. Identification of factors associated with hip pain arising from the lumbar spine would aid the physician. The first step in identifying possible factors is to look at the association between hip pain and osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine.

Methods

In an open population based study of people 55 years and older (Rotterdam study), 2,819 lumbar radiographs were scored for the presence and severity of individual radiographic features of disk degeneration. Hip osteoarthritis was scored on anteroposterior pelvic radiographs, and questionnaires including self-reported hip pain were taken. Logistic regression adjusted for possible confounders was used to determine the association between self-reported hip pain and the individual radiographic features of lumbar disk degeneration.

Results

The presence of dis space narrowing grade ≥ 1 at level L1/L2 was significantly associated with hip pain in the last month (men OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.8 and women OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.1–2.5). The presence of disk space narrowing grade ≥ 1 at level L2/L3 was only significantly associated with hip pain in women. The strength of the associations increased for self-reported chronic hip pain, especially in men (L1/L2 OR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.3–5.0). The presence of disk space narrowing at the lower levels (L3/L4/L5/S1) was not significantly associated with hip pain.

Conclusion

Our data provide evidence for an association between hip pain and disk space narrowing at disk level L1/L2 and L2/L3. In case of uncertainty of the cause of hip pain, evaluation of lumbar radiographs may help to identify those hip pain patients who might have pain arising from the lumbar spine.

Results

Quantitative analysis

In total, the cross-sectional area of the neural foramina decreased significantly at nearly all levels for both readers from the supine (e.g. reader 1; all right lumbar segments with normal intervertebral height: 1.25 ± 0.32 cm²) to upright (1.12 ± 0.34 cm²) position for all grades of intervertebral height changes (Fig. 2 and Table 1). In detailed observation of all levels separately, there were only exceptions for L4 left reader 1 (normal intervertebral height; Fig. 2a) and L4 left reader 2 (< 50% intervertebral height preserved; Fig. 2c). The cranio-caudal (e.g. reader 1; all right lumbar segments with normal intervertebral height: supine 1.84 ± 0.24 cm²; upright 1.78 ± 0.24 cm²) and ventro-dorsal (e.g. reader 1; all right lumbar segments with normal intervertebral height: supine 0.88 ± 0.16 cm²; upright 0.83 ± 0.16 cm²) diameters of the neural foramina also decreased significantly at nearly all levels for both readers from the supine to upright position (Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1). Exceptions for detailed observation are shown in Fig. 3 for cranio-caudal and Fig. 4 for ventro-dorsal diameter changes. An example of the influence of intervertebral disc height changes on the neuroforaminal size is depicted in Fig. 5.

### Biomechanics and mechanism of action of indirect lumbar decompression and the evolution of a stand-alone spinous process spacer [^112BRhkT]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spine stenosis (LSS) specifically refers to a narrowing of the neural foramina and/or the spinal canal, which compresses the nerve(s) and surrounding structures. Symptoms of LSS result from direct compression or ischemia of neural elements. Patients may present with symptoms of neurogenic claudication (pain in the buttocks or legs on walking or standing that resolves with sitting down or lumbar flexion), radicular pain, axial pain, or a combination of any of the manifestations.

Spinal stenosis is commonly classified by descriptive elements, such as etiology (i.e. degenerative or congenital), location (i.e. central, lateral, recess, foraminal, extraforaminal), and severity of the narrowing on advanced imaging (i.e. mild, moderate or severe). Degenerative lumbar stenosis results from changes in the spine that occur with aging, including facet joint hypertrophy, loss of intervertebral disc height, disc bulging, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum; alternatively, stenosis can be caused by congenital narrowing of the spinal canal. Most cases of LSS are degenerative, resulting from changes in the spine with aging.

### Radiographic and clinical outcomes after stand-alone anterior lumbar interbody fusion for symptomatic L5-S1 retrolisthesis [^111B6iZb]. Operative Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is associated with significant pain and disability. The literature on the treatment options and clinical outcomes for lumbar anterolisthesis is robust, but very few reports specifically evaluate lumbar retrolisthesis. This study investigated surgical outcomes for symptomatic L5-S1 retrolisthesis treated with stand-alone L5-S1 anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF).

Methods

All patients with symptomatic L5-S1 retrolisthesis treated with stand-alone L5-S1 ALIF at a single institution over a 7-year period were identified. Exhaustive nonoperative management had failed for all patients. Patients with previous lumbar fusion were excluded. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic images and patient-reported outcome measures for 20 patients (14 males and 6 females; mean [SD] age, 50.3 [13.7] years) were analyzed.

Results

The mean (SD) follow-up was 43.0 (23.7) months (range, 12.1–102.5 months). Patients experienced postoperative improvements in L5-S1 retrolisthesis (P = 0.048), L5-S1 disk height and angle (P < .001), L5 foraminal height (P < .001), L5-S1 lordosis (P < .001), and lumbar lordosis (P = 0.01). There were no significant changes in spinopelvic parameters. At the most recent follow-up, minimal clinically important differences in Oswestry Disability Index score, 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36), and numerical rating scale score for leg pain were achieved in 11 of 20 (55%), 7 of 14 (50%), and 7 of 13 (54%) patients, respectively. All patients demonstrated fusion with no graft subsidence at up to 32 months. No patient experienced intraoperative complications, was readmitted, or required a subsequent posterior decompression or fusion because of refractory symptoms.

Conclusion

In our cohort, stand-alone L5-S1 ALIF was associated with radiographic and clinical improvement in patients with symptomatic L5-S1 retrolisthesis.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^114GjHNP]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Natural history of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — prior consensus stated that the majority of patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and an absence of neurologic deficits will do well with conservative care, that patients who present with sensory changes, muscle weakness or cauda equina syndrome are more likely to develop progressive functional decline without surgery, that progression of slip correlates with jobs that require repetitive anterior flexion of the spine, and that slip progression is less likely to occur when the disc has lost over 80% of its native height and intervertebral osteophytes have formed while progression of clinical symptoms does not correlate with progression of the slip; the current guideline reports this topic is not addressed due to limited literature and that natural history questions have been eliminated from this guideline.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^117CCQTE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Possible explanations for the unwarranted prevalence of imaging referrals for LBP are (1) the patient's expectation that imaging results could provide valuable information on the cause and, consequently, the appropriate management of her or his condition and (2) the clinician's desire to reassure the patient of the absence of any underlying pathologic condition. Previous studies have confirmed that imaging does not improve clinical outcomes for patients with LBP. However, the definition of normal or abnormal imaging diagnostic findings is still debatable. Currently, the presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing are the most frequent changes detected on radiographs (hereafter referred to as radiographic changes) that may be indicative of spinal pathologic conditions, and the Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade is the tool commonly used to assess the severity of osteoarthritis. A study including elderly women who lived in rural South Korea showed a positive association of the presence of osteophytes (grade ≥ 2), disc space narrowing (grade ≥ 2), and K-L grade (grade ≥ 2) with the severity of disability, measured by a validated Korean version of the Oswestry Disability Index. However, a study conducted in Sri Lanka including patients with LBP concluded that neither disc space narrowing nor the presence of osteophytes was associated with the severity of disability (also measured with the Modified Oswestry Disability Index). Both studies are cross-sectional and failed to adjust their analyses for important confounders, including smoking status, level of participation in physical activity, and medication use. Past studies have also failed to identify whether the number of affected lumbar segments is associated with the severity of back pain–related disability. Therefore, the role of radiographic findings as a potential prognostic factor of the clinical course of LBP is still unclear and needs to be fully explored in population-based cohort studies. Previous studies of radiographic changes in knee osteoarthritis have indicated that the presence of osteophytes may be used to diagnose the condition and that the presence of joint space narrowing may be used to assess both the diagnosis and the progression of osteoarthritis. This is still to be elucidated among patients with LBP.

### A radiographic analysis of degenerative spondylolisthesis at the L4–5 level [^113fiHtb]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS) is common and has generally been characterized as a homogeneous disease entity in the literature and in clinical practice. Because disease variability has not been carefully characterized, stratification of treatment recommendations based on scientific evidence is currently lacking. In this study, the authors analyzed radiographic parameters of patients with LDS at the L4–5 level to better characterize this entity.

Methods

Demographic data were collected from 304 patients (200 women and 104 men) with LDS at the L4–5 level. Plain radiographs including anteroposterior, lateral, and flexion-extension lateral radiographs were analyzed for disc height, segmental angulation, segmental translation, and osteophyte formation. Correlations were sought between the variables of age, sex, disc height, segmental angulation, segmental translation, and osteophyte formation.

Results

The mean patient age was 63.8 years (range 40–86 years). The mean mid-disc height was 7 mm (range 0–14 mm) on the neutral lateral view. The mean angulation between the superior endplate of L-5 and the inferior endplate of L-4 was 6° of lordosis (range 13° of kyphosis to 23° lordosis) on the neutral lateral view. The mean angular change between flexion and extension lateral radiographs was 5° (range 0°-17°). The mean translation on the neutral lateral view was 6 mm (range 0–15 mm). The mean change in translational between flexion and extension was 2 mm (range 0–11 mm). Twenty patients (7%) exhibited spondylolisthesis only on the flexion view. A significant positive correlation was found between the change in angulation and the change in translation on flexion and extension views (ρ = 0.18, p = 0.001). No significant correlation was found between anterior osteophyte size and mobility with flexion-extension radiographs.

Conclusions

The wide range in all radiographic parameters for LDS confirms the heterogeneous nature of this condition and suggests that a grading system to subclassify LDS may be clinically useful. On flexion and extension radiographs, increased translational motion correlated with increased angular motion. Anterior osteophyte size was not found to be predictive of segmental stability. This data set should prove beneficial to those seeking to subcategorize LDS in the future.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women [^116NqhcF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Previous studies, using mostly cross-sectional data, provide conflicting evidence of an association between lumbar spine radiographic changes and the severity of back pain-related disability. Such conflicting evidence may be associated with widely unnecessary diagnostic imaging of the lumbar spine.

Objective

To examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between lumbar spine radiographic changes and the severity of back pain-related disability among middle-aged, community-dwelling women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based prospective cohort study used data from the Chingford 1000 Women Study. Analyses included data collected from year 6 (1994–1996; physical activity was measured), year 9 (1997–1999; treated as baseline), and year 15 (2003–2005), with a total length of follow-up for longitudinal analyses of 6 years. Data were analyzed from April 17 to November 3, 2020.

Exposures

Primary exposure was lumbar spine radiographic changes, defined using the Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade. Secondary exposures were defined using presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing. The composite score combined the number of lumbar spine segments with definite changes detected on radiographic images (ie, radiographic changes) (K-L grade ≥ 2, which means at least definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space are present; osteophyte and disc space narrowing grade ≥ 1, which means at least mild or definite changes are present).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported back pain-related disability measured in years 9 and 15 assessed by the St Thomas disability questionnaire.

Results

Among 650 women (mean [SD] age, 61.3 [5.9] years) in cross-sectional analyses and 443 women (mean [SD] age, 60.6 [6.0] years) in longitudinal analyses, there was no evidence to support an association between higher number of lumbar segments with radiographic changes (K-L grade, osteophytes, and disc space narrowing) and more severe back pain-related disability (eg, cross-sectional analyses using the K-L grade; 1 segment vs 0 segment: adjusted odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.76–1.96]). No interactions were found of an association between lumbar spine radiographic changes and the severity of back pain-specific disability with age, body mass index, or smoking status.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort of middle-aged, community-dwelling women, there was no evidence to support an association between a higher number of lumbar segments with radiographic changes (K-L grade, osteophytes, and disc space narrowing) and more severe back pain-related disability cross-sectionally or over time. These findings provide further evidence against routinely using diagnostic imaging of the lumbar spine.

### Lumbar apex position as an independent risk factor for adjacent segment diseases in patients undergoing short-level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion [^111YmB1m]. Spine (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast, the majority of patients in the caudal group were diagnosed as lumbar stenosis or disc herniation which did not significantly change the shape of DL. Because of high PI values, the location of apex of these patients was more proximal than patients with low PI. Meanwhile, patients with high PI values had a good capacity to compensate for sagittal imbalance through pelvis retroversion. Thus, when degenerative diseases involved the lower lumbar spine, the apex of these patients tended to migrate and locate within the DL. Sagittal balance improved after the symptoms and stenosis were alleviated through surgery, but a low lumbar apex could lead to the posterior displacement of the axis of gravity. Our results showed that caudal group had lowest PL, suggesting that proximal levels were recruited to decrease lordosis to compensate for backward trunk. Distal migration of apex and reduction of PL made DL represent the major part of LL, resulting in an abnormally high LDI (Fig. 5). A well-balanced LL could convert to a longer but flat LL or a nonharmonious back with thoracolumbar kyphosis and short hyperlordosis. At the transition zone from thoracolumbar kyphosis to lumbar lordosis, the discs are significantly angled, leading to a higher likelihood of degeneration and retrolisthesis. Furthermore, when the back is flat, the pressure on the disc is at its peak, increasing the likelihood of early disc degeneration or herniation.

A and B, A 71-year-old man with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis and disc herniation at L3–4 and L4–5, the ideal location of lumbar apex was L3–4 based on the PI of 61°. C, He underwent pedicle screw fixation from L3 to L5, and TLIF at L3–4 and L4–5. The upright lateral radiograph showed that PT was 18°, SS was 43°, LL was 62°, DL was 45°, LDI was 73%, and lumbar apex was L4–5, indicating the distal migration of apex. D and E, At 3 years of follow-up, he complained of recurrent low back pain, and leg pain and numbness. The upright lateral radiograph showed disc collapse at the adjacent segment, and MRI detected occurrence of L2–3 spinal stenosis.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^114nsatZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 6)

MRI is a noninvasive and nonionizing modality that provides excellent soft tissue resolution. The role of MRI in the evaluation of FJ degeneration is not proven. Osteoarthritis may be present in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (from 8 to 14%). Superior sensitivity of MRI compared to CT imaging is controversial. CT and MRI are equally useful in demonstrating morphological changes in FJ. One of the two examinations is thus sufficient for assessing degenerative changes. MRI, however, clearly presents advantages of better assessing the immediate consequences of FJ degeneration, such as surrounding neural structure impingement. Chronic degenerative osteoarthritis processes in these structures involve active synovial inflammation or adjacent bone edema, which can be detected using MRI with a fat saturation technique. Exaggerated fluid in the facets and FJ synovial cysts seen on axial MRI seems to be significantly suggestive of spondylolisthesis and its instability, but is not specific of FJ origin of pain. Recent studies using fat-suppressed MRI sequences have demonstrated that subchondral bone edema is present in the lumbar FJ articular processes in 14 to 41% of patients with back pain. Enhancement of the FJ rim after gadolinium administration will establish a diagnosis of synovitis. Fujiwara et al. proposed a four-grade classification from 1 to 4: grade 1, normal; grade 2, joint space narrowing or mild osteophyte; grade 3, sclerosis or moderate osteophyte; and grade 4, marked osteophyte. They additionally described the wraparound bumper osteophyte formations which provides an additional stabilizing effect in segmental degenerative disease. An important observation from the Fujiwara study is that MRI tends to underestimate the severity of osteoarthritis of the FJs as compared to CT. The fluid-sensitive sequences on MRI are generally preferred over CT for imaging FJ effusions and juxta-facet cysts; however, they are less sensitive in depicting the joints' bony cortices and are less accurate in quantifying the amount of sclerosis present. An additional limitation of MRI is that it cannot accurately measure cartilage thinning secondary to the partial volume effect and chemical-shift artefact inherent in this type of imaging. CT is better able to demonstrate the degenerative changes of the FJs because of the high contrast between bony structures and the surrounding soft tissues. However, some authors suggest that TSE T2 fat saturation sequences and, when indicated, gadolinium administration with T1 fat saturation sequences enhance the sensitivity and diagnostic specificity of MR scans. In particular, gadolinium will disclose the active inflammatory stage of a degenerative process thereby identifying new therapeutic targets for percutaneous treatment.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adult isthmic spondylolisthesis [^114jWhcB]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Isthmic spondylolisthesis — discography in adult patients: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of discography to evaluate adult patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis. Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence). In a small series, fourteen consecutive patients with Grade I or II isthmic spondylolisthesis underwent 4-level provocative discography using fluoroscopy, with half of the patients (7/14) showing concordant pain at a level adjacent to the slip and 2 patients having no pain at the slip level; the level of the spondylolisthesis was positive in 12 out of 14 patients. No patients had provocation at L2–3 or L3–4, and among 11 patients with L5-S1 slips, 4 had a single positive level at L5-S1, one was limited to L4-L5, and 6 had positive levels at both L4-L5 and L5-S1. This study provides Level IV diagnostic evidence that spondylolisthesis may or may not be the sole cause of back pain as diagnosed by discography in workers compensation patients planned for surgery.

### The importance of level stratification for quantitative MR studies of lumbar intervertebral discs: a cross-sectional analysis in 101 healthy adults [^112oFtVL]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate whether quantitative T2-times depend on lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) level.

Methods

The lumbar spine (Th12/L1-L5/S1) of 101 participants (53.5% female, 30.0[± 3.6]years, 173.5[± 9.6]cm and 69.9[± 13.4]kg), without history of back pain, was examined on a 3T scanner with sagittal T2-mapping. All IVDs were stratified according to Pfirrmann grade and lumbar level, with mean T2-time determined for the entire IVD volume and in five subregions of interests.

Results

Significant level-dependent T2-time differences were detected, both for the entire IVD volume and its subregions. For the entire IVD volume, Pfirrmann grade 2 IVDs displayed 9–18% higher T2-times in Th12/L1 IVDs compared to L2/L3-L5/S1 IVDs (0.001 > p < 0.004) and significantly different T2-times in L1/L2-L2/L3 IVDs compared to most of the IVDs in the lower lumbar spine. In Pfirrmann grades 1, 3 and 4 IVDs, no significant level-dependent T2-time differences were observed for the entire IVD. More pronounced results were observed when comparing IVD subregions, with significant level-dependent differences also within Pfirrmann grade 1 and grade 3 IVDs. For example, in posterior IVD subregions mean T2-time was 80–82% higher in Th12/L1 compared to L3/L4-L4/L5 Pfirrmann grade 1 IVDs (p < 0.05) and 10–14% higher in L5/S1 compared to L3/L4-L4/L5 Pfirrmann grade 3 IVDs (0.02 > p < 0.001).

Discussion

Significant level-dependent T2-time differences within several Pfirrmann grades, both for the entire IVD volume and for multiple IVD subregions, were shown in this large cohort study. The T2-time differences between levels existed in both non-degenerated and degenerated IVDs. These findings show the importance of stratifying for lumbar level when quantitative IVD studies are performed using T2-mapping.

### Redefining lumbar spinal stenosis as a developmental syndrome: does age matter? [^112BLt16]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Age is commonly thought to be a risk factor in defining lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) degenerative or developmental subtypes. This article is a follow-up to a previous article ("Redefining Lumbar Spinal Stenosis as a Developmental Syndrome: An MRI-Based Multivariate Analysis of Findings in 709 Patients Throughout the 16- to 82-Year Age Spectrum") that describes the radiological differences between developmental and degenerative types of LSS. MRI-based analysis of "degeneration" variables and spinal canal morphometric characteristics of LSS segments have been thought to correlate with age at presentation.

Methods

The authors performed a re-analysis of data from their previously reported prospective MRI-based study, stratifying data from the 709 cases into 3 age categories of equal size (instead of the original < 60 vs ≥ 60 years). Relative spinal canal dimensions, as well as radiological degenerative variables from L1 to S1, were analyzed across age groups in a multivariate mode. The total degenerative scale score (TDSS) for each lumbar segment from L1 to S1 was calculated for each patient. The relationships between age and qualitative stenosis grades, TDSS, disc degeneration, and facet degeneration were analyzed using Pearson's product-moment correlation and multiple regression.

Results

Multivariate analysis of TDSS and spinal canal dimensions revealed highly significant differences across the 3 age groups at L2–3 and L3–4 and a weaker, but still significant, association with changes at L5-S1. Age helped to explain only 9.6% and 12.2% of the variance in TDSS at L1–2 and L2–3, respectively, with a moderate positive correlation, and 7.8%, 1.2%, and 1.9% of the variance in TDSS at L3–4, L4–5, and L5-S1, respectively, with weak positive correlation. Age explained 24%, 26%, and 18.4% of the variance in lumbar intervertebral disc (LID) degeneration at L1–2, L2–3, and L3–4, respectively, while it explained only 6.2% and 7.2% of the variance of LID degeneration at L4–5 and L5-S1, respectively. Age explained only 2.5%, 4.0%, 1.2%, 0.8%, and 0.8% of the variance in facet degeneration at L1–2, L2–3, L3–4, L4–5, and L5-S1, respectively.

Conclusions

Age at presentation correlated weakly with degeneration variables and spinal canal morphometries in LSS segments. Age correlated with upper lumbar segment (L1–4) degeneration more than with lower segment (L4-S1) degeneration. The actual chronological age of the patients did not significantly correlate with the extent of degenerative pathology of the lumbar stenosis segments. These study results lend support for a developmental contribution to LSS.

### Radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and bone mineral density in men and women [^117SCXye]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the association between individual radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration and bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine and hip.

Subjects

were recruited from a population register for a screening survey of vertebral osteoporosis. BMD was assessed at the spine and hip using dual energy x ray absorptiometry. Lateral spinal radiographs were evaluated for features of lumbar disc degeneration. Each vertebral level from L1/2 to L4/5 was assessed for the presence and severity of osteophytes, end plate sclerosis, and disc space narrowing. Linear regression was used to determine the association between each of these features and BMD at the spine and hip, with adjustments for age, body mass index, and levels of physical activity. Analyses were done separately in men and women.

Results

250 women and 256 men (mean age around 65 years) were studied. At the lumbar spine, after age adjustment there was an increase in BMD with increasing grade for all radiographic features of disc degeneration in both men and women. At the femoral neck, after age adjustment there was an increase in BMD with increasing osteophyte and end plate sclerosis grade though not disc space narrowing. Adjusting for body mass index and physical activity did not influence the strength of the associations.

Conclusions

Radiographic features of lumbar disc degeneration are associated with an increase in BMD at the spine. Osteophytes and end plate sclerosis, but not disc space narrowing, are associated with an increase in BMD at the hip.

### Grade three disc degeneration is a critical stage for anterior spondylolisthesis in lumbar spine [^116hyGE2]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Little is known about when and how progressive spondylolisthesis occurs. In this report segmental motion related to age and disc degeneration at L4/5 disc was investigated.

Materials and Methods

637 patients with low back and/or leg pain underwent radiologic and MRI examinations simultaneously. Because 190 patients with conditions which might impede accurate measurement were excluded, 447 patients, comprising 268 men and 179 women, were included; age range, was 10–86 (mean: 53) years. Three radiologic parameters slip in neutral position (mm), sagittal translation (mm), and segmental angulation (degrees) were examined at the L4/5 segment. On T2-weighted MRI, severity of disc degeneration at L4/5 was classified by Pfirrmann's criteria, grade 1–5.

Results

Results showed stage of disc degeneration that progressed according to aging with significant differences except for between grades 4 and 5. Amount of anterior slip was small among grades 1 to 3; however, it greatly increased between grades 3 and 4 and between grades 4 and 5, suggesting that grade 3 disc degeneration has a potential risk of future progression of anterior slip. This finding may also suggest that once significant slip occurs, it will progress to the final grade. Furthermore, the grade 3 degeneration group exhibited large amounts of motion in both angulation and translation, suggesting it was the most unstable group.

Conclusion

Our results with radiography and MRI indicate that grade 3 disc degeneration is a critical stage for the progression of lumbar spondylolisthesis at L4/5 segment.

### Quality-of-life outcomes with minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion based on long-term analysis of 304 consecutive patients [^115XC314]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients and Selection Process

A total of 318 MITLIF procedures were performed using a paramedian, muscle-sparing approach on 304 consecutive patients, spanning 7 years from 2003 to 2010. The study population included 120 men and 184 women with a mean age of 62.4 years (range, 19–93 yr) at the time of surgery. All participants were recruited from an outpatient neurosurgical spine clinic, and all 318 MITLIF procedures were performed by the senior author. Diagnosis was established through thorough clinical history, physical examination, and radiographical evaluations of the lumbar spine including plain dynamic radiograph films, computed tomography, myelography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Spondylolisthesis and retrolisthesis were graded using the Meyerding classification (I–IV). All patients were evaluated in an outpatient setting.

Patient comorbidities are summarized in Table 1. Clinical diagnosis at presentation included spondylolisthesis (66%), central spinal stenosis (47%), foraminal stenosis (34%), degenerative disc disease (23%), retrolisthesis (1%), and other diagnosis (10%). Refractory chronic debilitating low back pain, neurogenic claudication, and signs of radiculopathy were the predominant clinical findings. The average length of symptoms prior to surgery was 68.6 months. Prior lumbar surgical procedures were performed in 70 patients (23%). The distribution of MITLIF procedures performed at each spinal level is detailed in Table 2.

TABLE 1.
Common Comorbidities

The values are given as the number of patients affected with the percentage in parenthesis.

TABLE 2.
Spinal Levels Undergoing MITLIF

MITLIF indicates minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion.

Patients with a concordance of findings on clinical examination and imaging, and symptoms lasting greater than 6 months unresponsive to nonoperative treatment were deemed candidates for MITLIF. A total of 210 patients underwent conservative, nonoperative treatment, which is detailed in Table 3. Surgical treatment was initiated earlier than 6 months if a neurological deficit was worsening, or if the patient presented with severe, incapacitating pain with good correlation between clinical and radiographical findings. Surgical treatment was indicated as a last resort to failed nonoperative therapy. Patients were excluded if they were medically unfit to undergo a surgical procedure, had a history of ongoing or recent bleeding diathesis, ongoing infection, or had incongruent clinical and radiographical findings.

### Clinical application of a novel assessment for lumbosacral stability [^115o5Hfv]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Object

To evaluate the grade of lumbosacral stability, shape analysis was conducted on plain radiographs of the lumbar spine.

Methods

One hundred twenty-six patients were classified into 2 groups: those with a single-segment disc space narrowing at L5-S1 or at L4–5. Stability was evaluated using the discriminant function (z score) derived from the analysis of radiographic parameters-that is, relative thickness of transverse process of L-5 and the sacral table angle.

Results

In patients with a space narrowing at L5-S1, the author observed a significantly slender L-5 transverse process and acute obliquity of the sacral endplate; accordingly, the z score was negative. In patients with a broad transverse process and a positive z score, the segment associated with disc height loss was L4–5. Thus, a close correlation was found between the site of the disc height loss and the bony characteristics of L-5 and S-1. Furthermore, it could be expected with a high degree reliability that when young adult patients had a z score less than -2 or -3, their L-5 vertebra would develop degenerative spondylolisthesis after middle age and the L5-S1 segment could be saved from age-related alterations as long as the z score was greater than 2.5. The constitutional characteristics of the lumbosacral junction may exert a major influence on the site of disc degeneration.

Conclusions

Stability at the lumbosacral junction was thought to be quantitatively represented by the z score, with z being designated the lumbosacral stability score.

### Atlas for the CT syndesmophyte score (CTSS) in patients with axial spondyloarthritis [^114iwEc8]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 10
Sagittal view of the lumbar spine from L1 to S1. To identify abnormalities, repetitive scrolling through multiple slices is needed. The reader should be focused on one vertebral unit (VU) at a time, and the highest score should be reported for each quadrant. This example focusses on VU20 (L2–L3). The arrow shows a syndesmophyte at the upper anterior corner (quadrant 1), not reaching 50% of the intervertebral disc space (IDS; grade 1) in A and B. However, on image C, the syndesmophyte reaches over 50% of the IDS, yet not bridging (grade 2). In this example, a grade 2 should be reported for quadrant 1. The arrowhead points to a syndesmophyte in the lower anterior corner (quadrant 4) not reaching 50% of the IDS from A to C. Therefore, a grade 1 should be reported in quadrant 4. No abnormalities are present in quadrants 2 and 3 (posterior quadrants) of VU20 (L2–L3) in which the sloped vertebral corners (asterisks) must not be mistaken as syndesmophytes, and thus a grade 0 should be scored here. The total CTSS score for the VU20 is 2+0+0+1 = 3.

Figure 11
Coronal (A) and sagittal (B) views of the thoracic spine focused on vertebral unit 19 (L1–L2). Syndesmophytes are assessed in both coronal and sagittal planes. Therefore, it is possible that syndesmophytes of different grades are observed in different planes. In this example, a syndesmophyte of grade 2 (white arrow) should be reported in quadrant 3 on the coronal plane (A), while a syndesmophyte of grade 1 (black arrows) should be reported in quadrant 3 on the sagittal plane (B).

### Active discopathy: a clinical reality [^11198s6i]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

What is active discopathy?

Degenerative disc disease

To understand active discopathy, we first describe 'non-active' disc disease, or DDD. At the macroscopic level, DDD affects the intervertebral disc and also the whole discovertebral complex. It is characterised by a fibrillar structure of the annulus fibrosus, cracks of the nucleus pulposus, thinning and erosions of the cartilaginous vertebral endplates, marginal osteophytosis and loss of disc height.DDD results from an imbalance in intervertebral disc homeostasis with quantitative and qualitative changes affecting intervertebral disc cells and extracellular matrix as well as decreased water content that impair the biomechanics of the intervertebral disc. At the molecular level, DDD is associated with local inflammatory processes characterised by immunological stimulation, neovascularisation and neoinnervation, accelerated cartilaginous and bone remodelling, and changes in lipid and oxidative metabolism. At the MRI level, the most consistently reported signs of DDD are nucleus pulposus dehydration, decreased disc height, disc bulging or hernia. Pfirrmann and colleagues described five MRI grades of DDD. The first grade corresponds to a normal intervertebral disc, and higher grades correspond to DDD and have in common a hypointense signal in T2-weighted sequences of a homogenous nucleus pulposus, with no distinction between the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, and loss of intervertebral disc height. However, no consistent anatomoclinical correlation between DDD and LBP has been described.

### Responsible, safe, and effective use of biologics in the management of low back pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines [^113UA6Ko]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

Spinal stenosis — definition, prevalence, types, mechanisms, and presentation — is defined as narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in symptoms and signs from neural and vascular compression, with varying degrees shown to be present in 27.2% of the elderly population. Congenital or acquired spinal stenosis may be central, foraminal, or both, and disc bulging, protrusion, and extrusion with osteophytes, facet arthritic changes, and hypertrophy of the ligamenta flava can narrow the canal and compress dural sac contents. Foraminal stenosis is largely secondary to degenerative facet disease, potentially with a significant disc component, producing compression or distortion of the exiting nerve root. In central stenosis, symptoms are secondary to direct compression of the cauda equina, altered arterial flow, venous congestion producing increased epidural pressure, and nerve root excitation by local inflammation. Clinical presentation varies from focal radiculopathy to neurogenic claudication with buttocks or leg pain when walking that disappears with sitting or lumbar flexion; foraminal stenosis presents with radicular pain, and combined central and foraminal stenoses generally present with neurogenic claudication as well as radicular pain. In addition to congenital and acquired causes, acute trauma may also produce central and/or foraminal stenoses due to retropulsion of the vertebral body middle column into the canal, with or without a significant epidural hematoma, and distortion of the neural foramina.

### Modic type I change may predict rapid progressive, deforming disc degeneration: a prospective 1-year follow-up study [^114u182o]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

This prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in chronic low-back pain (CLBP) patients evaluated the natural course of degenerative lumbar spine changes in relation to Modic 1 type changes (M1) within 1 year.

Materials and Methods

From 3,811 consecutive CLBP patients referred to lumbar spine MRI 54 patients with a large M1 were selected using strict exclusion criteria to exclude specific back disorders. Follow-up MRI was obtained within 11–18 months.

Results

At baseline M1 was associated with an adjacent endplate lesion in 96% of the cases. In follow-up, an unstable M1 was associated both with an increase of endplate lesions, decrease of disc height and change in disc signal intensity, most found at L4/5 or L5/S1. In disc spaces without M1, progression of degenerative changes was rare.

Conclusion

Endplate deformation, decreasing disc height and change of disc signal intensity appear essential features of accelerated degenerative process associated with M1.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^112YffQa]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

Treatment

Conservative treatment is considered a first-line treatment for the majority of patients with degenerative spine disease, unless the disease presents with acute neurological symptoms such as myelopathy or cauda equine syndrome. When medical therapy fails, imaging and spinal surgery are considered as the next step of management. Depending on the prevalent degenerative pattern, different surgical approaches can be utilised. Patients with symptomatic disc herniations can benefit from microdiscectomy. If a degenerative process results in destabilisation and abnormal spinal motion, different types of surgical fusion can be used to stabilise the spine. Interbody fusion implants are widely used to restore disc height and support the anterior column. Spondylotic changes usually do not require surgery (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
Surgical treatment options for degenerative changes. (a) Herniations. Herniations are often associated with pain and neurological symptoms and most commonly occur on the lumbar spine. Treatment options include conservative treatment if the herniation does not compress the nerves and surgical removal of the herniation if neural compression exists. (b) Spondylosis. Chronic longstanding disc degeneration results in slowly progressive mild-to-moderate disc space narrowing and gradual osteophyte formation without apparent disc displacement. Spondylosis is considered an adaptive reaction to stabilise motion in the presence of instability or a compensatory mechanism to limit the range of motion and prevent further degeneration. Altered disc biomechanics and narrowed intervertebral disc space subsequently lead to facet joint degeneration. This is probably the most favourable type of degeneration as it is essentially asymptomatic, may be seen at all levels of the spine and typically does not require treatment. (c) Disc collapse. Disc collapse leads to annular folding, anterior bulging of the flaval ligaments and posterior bulging of the posterior longitudinal ligament, with consequential narrowing of the central spinal canal. The decreasing disc height of the involved spinal segment leads to increased stiffness and may cause vertical degeneration of the adjacent vertebral segments. (d) Progressive structural failure of the disc to maintain the integrity of the functional spinal unit leads to segmental instability. This may progress to degenerative spondylolysthesis and require spinal instrumentation

### Association between clinical findings and the presence of lumbar spine osteoarthritis imaging features: a systematic review [^116WYuSq]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Spinal osteoarthritis is difficult to study and diagnose, partly due to the lack of agreed diagnostic criteria. This systematic review aims to give an overview of the associations between clinical and imaging findings suggestive of spinal osteoarthritis in patients with low back pain to make a step towards agreed diagnostic criteria.

Design

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 29, 2021 to identify observational studies in adults that assessed the association between selected clinical and imaging findings suggestive of spinal osteoarthritis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the quality of evidence was graded using an adaptation of the GRADE approach.

Results

After screening 7902 studies, 30 met the inclusion criteria. High-quality evidence was found for the longitudinal association between low back pain (LBP) intensity, and both disc space narrowing and osteophytes, as well as for the association between LBP-related physical functioning and lumbar disc degeneration, the presence of spinal morning stiffness and disc space narrowing and for the lack of association between physical functioning and Schmorl's nodes.

Conclusions

There is high- and moderate-quality evidence of associations between clinical and imaging findings suggestive of spinal osteoarthritis. However, the majority of the studied outcomes had low or very low-quality of evidence. Furthermore, clinical and methodological heterogeneity was a serious limitation, adding to the need and importance of agreed criteria for spinal osteoarthritis, which should be the scope of future research.

### Inverse relation between osteoporosis and spondylosis in postmenopausal women as evaluated by bone mineral density and semiquantitative scoring of spinal degeneration [^113Lh9M8]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

The relation between bone mineral density and severity of spondylosis was evaluated in postmenopausal women.

Objective

To examine the possible inverse relation between osteoporosis and spondylosis by evaluating the association between bone mineral density and osteophyte formation or intervertebral disc narrowing using a semiquantitative scoring system.

Summary Of Background Data

The literature contains studies demonstrating an inverse relation between osteoporosis and spondylosis as well as those documenting insufficient support for such a relation. However, in these studies, only limited-range grading systems (e.g. Grades 1–4) were used to evaluate the severity of spondylosis.

Methods

In this study, 104 postmenopausal women older than 60 years underwent bone mineral density measurement of the lumbar spine (anteroposterior, lateral, and midlateral) and proximal femur (femoral neck, trochanter, and Ward's triangle) using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Raw data representing the semiquantitative osteophyte score and disc score as well as the number of vertebral fractures were obtained using spinal radiograph. Correlations between bone mineral density and the radiographic variable were then analyzed.

Results

Significant negative correlations were found between all bone mineral density data and the number of vertebral fractures (-0.524 < or r = r ≤ -0.347; P < 0.05). Marginal/moderate positive correlations were observed between the osteophyte score and the bone mineral density data (0.263 ≤ r ≤ 0.580, P < 0.05), and between the disc score and the bone mineral density data (0.233 ≤ r ≤ 0.570, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS On the basis of the finding that spondylotic changes in postmenopausal women exhibit positive correlations not only with the lumbar bone mineral density, but also with the remote-site bone mineral density, this study supports the view that osteoporosis has an inverse relation with spondylosis.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117Cv92K]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain imaging — radiographic degenerative changes and associations in young men are described as follows: Mild LBP was reported by 44 subjects (52%), and lumbar degenerative changes were found in 52% of the subjects, with DSN and VOs found in 30% and 46% of subjects, respectively. There was a significant association between VOs and LBP (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.23–7.33; p = 0.013), whereas there was not a significant association between DSN and LBP, and no association between LBP and lifestyle factors such as smoking, sports, alcohol intake or weight gain was demonstrated. The authors concluded that, in young men without initial radiological abnormalities, there was a significant association between VOs and incidence of mild LBP. In critique of the methodology, the work group downgraded the level of evidence of this potential Level III study due to the small sample size, and this study provides Level IV evidence that there is an association between vertebral osteophyte formation and incidence of LBP. The work group recommends the development of studies that incorporate a reference standard in patients without other confounding factors such as spondylolisthesis or radiculopathy.

### A longitudinal study for incidence of low back pain and radiological changes of lumbar spine in asymptomatic Japanese military young adults [^113F6635]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The relation between radiological abnormalities on lumbar spine and low back pain (LBP) has been debated, presumably because of potential biases related to heterogeneity in selection of the subjects, radiological abnormalities at entry, or its cross-sectional observation in nature. Therefore, the aim of this study of a selected population of asymptomatic Japanese Self Defense Forces (JSDF) young adults male with normal lumbar radiographs was to investigate the incidence of newly developed lumbar degenerative changes at middle age and to study their association to LBP.

Subjects and Methods

In 1990, 84 JSDF male military servicemen aged 18 years, without a history of LBP and radiological abnormal findings, were enrolled. After 20 years, 84 subjects were underwent repeated X-ray and completed questionnaires on current LBP and lifestyle factors.

Results

The prevalence of LBP was demonstrated 59%, with 85% of them showing mild pain. Analysis of lumbar radiographs revealed that 48% had normal findings and 52% had degenerative changes. The association between LBP and life style factors was not demonstrated. Lumbar spine in subjects with LBP was more degenerated than in those without. Although disc space narrowing and LBP did not achieve a statistical significance, a significant correlation existed between vertebral osteophyte and LBP in univariate and multivariate analysis (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.227–7.333).

Discussion and Conclusions

This longitudinal study demonstrated the significant association between vertebral osteophyte and incidence of mild LBP in initially asymptomatic and radiologically normal subjects. These data provide the additional information concerning the pathology of LBP, but further study is needed to clarify the clinical relevance.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^111xdzkS]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging Assessment

Imaging of the lumbosacral spine is essential in the workup of patients with the heretofore-described clinical features of discogenic pain. Specifically, the minimum imaging to classify the degree of degenerative changes in the disc requires a sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) view (Figure 1, Box 3). This imaging sequence allows for the grading of intervertebral disc degeneration based on MR signal intensity, disc structure, distinction between nucleus and annulus, and disc height. Originally devised by Pfirrmann et aland later modified to an eight-category rating scale, this system describes the progression from a normal disc to severely degenerated disc. Grade 1 corresponds to no disc degeneration while Grade 8 corresponds to end-stage degeneration.

Grades 1, 2, and 3 are based on the signal intensity of the nucleus (ie, hyperintense ranging from cerebrospinal fluid [grade 1] to presacral fat [grade 3]) with a distinct junction between the inner and outer fibers of annulus posteriorly and normal disc height. For Grade 4, the margins between the inner and outer fibers of the annulus at the posterior margin of the disc are indistinct with normal disc height. For Grade 5, the disc is uniformly hypointense (ie, equal to outer annulus fibers) with an indistinct junction between inner and outer annular fibers and no loss of disc height. For Grades 6, 7, and 8, there is a hypointense MR signal and progressive loss of disc space height. These are broadly classified as mild (< 30%), moderate (30–60%), to severe (> 60%) loss of disc height, respectively (Figure 1, Box 4).

Sagittal MRI views should also be evaluated for the presence or absence of Modic changes. These vertebral bone marrow signal intensity changes are graded as absent, 1, 2 or 3. Briefly, type 1 changes represent bone marrow edema and inflammation; type 2 changes represent normal red haemopoietic bone marrow conversion into yellow fatty marrow as a result of marrow ischemia; and, type 3 changes represent subchondral bony sclerosis.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112Stkj3]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain imaging — degenerative disc disease (DD), endplate signal change (ESC), and Schmorl node (SN) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show associations with low back pain (LBP) in a Japanese cross-sectional cohort. A cross-sectional study of 975 patients (324 men, 651 women, aged 21–97 years) used T2–weighted images from L2–L3 to L5–S1. Prevalence by feature combination was DD alone (30.4%), ESC alone (0.8%), SN alone (1.5%), DD and ESC (26.0%), DD and SN (12.3%), SN and ESC (0.6%) and DD, ESC and SN (19.1%). A combination of DD, ESC and SN was associated with LBP (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.2–3.9; p < 0.01), with level-specific associations at L1–L2 (OR 6.00, 95% CI 1.9–26.6; p < 0.005), L4–L5 (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.4–4.9; p < 0.005) and L5–S1 (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.1–3; p < 0.05), and for DD plus ESC at L3–L4 (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.5–4.0; p < 0.05), L4–L5 (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.2–2.8; p < 0.01) and L5–S1 (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.1–2.3; p < 0.05). The authors stated that although DD alone is not associated with LBP, combined degenerative changes were, and this provides Level IV evidence that a combination of degenerative changes shows high correlation to LBP.

Imaging findings

X-rays

In standard lateral X-rays of the spine the most common finding is the close approximation and contact of adjacent spinous processes with sclerosis of the articulating surfaces. Additionally, in more severe cases there is flattening and enlargement of the articulating surfaces or articulation of the two affected spinous processes (Fig. 1). Furthermore, general degenerative changes in the spine can be seen, usually most prominent at the pathological level. Advantages of radiographic imaging include the low cost and wide availability of the technique and a relatively low ionising radiation dose. On the other hand, there is poor imaging quality especially at the lower lumbar levels of obese patients.

Results

Comparison of General Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes Between the X-Ray and MRI Groups

There were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, main lesion level, symptom duration, number of injections, affected side, and NRS scores at baseline between the X-ray and MRI groups. The NRS scores in both groups reduced significantly at 2 and 10 weeks after treatment when compared with the pretreatment scores (p < 0.001). In the intergroup comparison, no significant difference was found in the improvement in the NRS scores and the Macnab criteria results (Table 1).

Distribution of Main Lesion Levels as Determined on Radiography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Post-Treatment in the X-Ray Group

In 62 out of 201 patients in the X-ray group, the spinal level to be treated changed on the post-procedural confirmative MRI. Out of the three patients with L1–2 herniation determined initially on plain radiography, one changed to L3–4 on the confirmative MRI. Among the seven patients preliminarily determined as having L2–3 herniation, one changed to L1–2, another to L3–4, and the remaining five to L4–5 level on the confirmative MRI. Moreover, of the 10 cases with L3–4 herniation, 3 patients were confirmed to have a lesion at L2–3, L4–5, and L5-S1, respectively. Among the 95 cases initially determined as having L4–5 lesions, 2 patients changed to L1–2, 3 to L2–3, 8 to L3–4, and 13 to L5-S1 lesions. Among the 86 patients initially determined as having L5-S1 lesions, 3 changed to L1–2, 3 to L2–3, 9 to L3–4, and 14 to L4–5 lesions (Table 2).

(c) The extruded disc material is round in the axial slides, which is a typical presentation

Herniation directed posteriorly toward the spinal canal may have clinical significance as it can cause neuronal or spinal cord compression. However, annular fissures and acute disc herniation involving the anterior aspect of the disc can also be responsible for back pain. These are frequently are overlooked and underestimated.

There are no universally accepted radiological definitions of the intervals that distinguish among acute, subacute and chronic disc herniations. From the neurological perspective, the patients with degenerative spines may present acute (lasting less than 4 weeks), subacute (lasting 4–12 weeks) and chronic (lasting more than 12 weeks) symptoms and pain. Acute disc herniations manifest with acute pain and neurological symptoms, subacute herniations correspond with subacute clinical presentations, and chronic herniations are accompanied by chronic symptoms and neurological signs.
Acute herniations occur in the early stage of degenerative disease when intradiscal pressure is still relatively high. Acute increases in intradiscal pressure in the setting of trauma or lifting heavy weights lead to the displacement of the nucleous pulposus through the compromised fibres of the annulus fibrosus, causing the annulus fibrosus fibres to rupture. Injured tissues show increased levels of catabolic cytokines and an acute focal inflammatory reaction. Every episode of acute disc displacement leads to further migration of the nucleous pulposus posteriorly and worsening of the annulus fibrosus tear. Herniation without disc degeneration is rarely seen and typically occurs secondary to an acute traumatic event (Fig. 15 a).
Subacute disc herniation is associated with classically described back pain that worsens with standing and is better when the patient is lying down. It arises only when disc material migrates peripherally as the intradiscal pressure increases (for example, in the standing position), but improves when intradiscal pressure drops (in the horizontal position) and the remaining intact fibres of the annulus fibrosus recoil to bring the extruded material back into the disc space. Since the majority of MRI and CT studies are performed in the prone position when the intradiscal pressure decreases, imaging findings may underestimate the extent of fluctuating nucleous pulposus displacement (Fig. 15 b).
Chronic nucleous pulposus displacement represents the stable displacement of the disc material outside the disc. In its early stage, chronic protrusions persist because of high intradiscal pressure pushing the nucleous pulposus material out of the disc; however, annulus fibrosus fibres later undergo advanced degenerative changes and lose the ability to recoil (Fig. 15 c). Excessive axial stresses may lead to further migration of the intradiscal nucleous pulposus fragment, and additional tearing of the annulus fibrosus fibres results in the repetition of the acute stage. Extrusion occurs when the intradiscal fragment tears apart all the annulus fibrosus layers. Further migration of the extrusion leads to posterior longitudinal ligament tearing and free disc fragments (sequester) floating freely in the spinal canal.

A total of 263 subjects were included in this retrospective study, with a mean age of 57 (SD: 9.9) years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 22.7 kg/m² (SD: 3.0). There were 150 females (57%) and 113 males (43%). The incidence of MC1, MC2, and MC3 among the included population was 30% (79/263), 46% (121/263), and 24% (63/263), respectively. According to the sizes of MCs, 113 subjects were defined as slight, 82 subjects as moderate, and the remaining 68 subjects as severe. In the present work, we did not identify any MCs occurring at the segment of L1/2 or L2/3. Over 70% of MCs (189/263) were observed at a single lumbar level, of which 27 MCs (14.3%) occurred at L3/4, 64 (33.9%) at L4/5, and 98 (51.8%) at L5/S1. The incidence of MCs at double and triple lumbar levels was 17.5% (46/263; L3–5: 18; L4-S1: 28) and 10.7% (28/263, L3-S1). Baseline characteristics of the included subjects are shown in Table 2.

### Spinal phenotypes on MRI and X-ray alone cannot predict short-term progression of lumbar disc degeneration [^113QsMkC]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Different lumbar phenotypes impact the biomechanical properties and might lead to progressive degeneration of the spine. This study aims to investigate whether lumbar phenotypes observed through X-rays and MRIs can predict the progression of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD).

Methods

A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted to identify important variables for the progression of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). The study included n = 279 patients (n = 1395 discs), who respectively underwent two lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams with an interval between 1 and 4 years. The Pfirrmann grade was allocated to score IVDD. Lateral standing X-rays evaluated sacral slope, lumbar lordosis, spondylolisthesis, and osteophytes. Anteroposterior X-rays examined lumbar scoliosis and pelvic obliquity. Sagittal MRI T2 imaging assessed muscle atrophy, intervertebral disc level (IVD), end plate defects, Modic changes, annular tears, disc protrusion, extrusion, sequestration, IVD height, and Pfirrmann grade. Axial T2 imaging evaluated facet joint angles. The study used correlation analysis and conditional logistic regression analysis to identify significant variables.

Results

The likelihood to contribute to the progression IVDD was 100% for end plate defect. Protrusion follows closely at 88%, the female gender shows a likelihood of 72%, lower IVD level has a likelihood of 45%, the sacral slope is present at 40%, osteophytes have a possibility of 37%, suggesting they also play a role in the progression of IVDD. Weak positive correlations with IVDD progression are noted: r = .056 (sacral slope), 0.146 (disc level), 0.057 (osteophytes), 0.066 (end plate defect), 0.130 (protrusion), and 0.068 (sequesters).

Conclusion

Lumbar phenotypes like sacral slope, disc level, osteophytes, end plate defect, and protrusion were the most predictive phenotypes for IVDD progression. Relying solely on lumbar phenotypes may not provide, however, enough specificity and sensitivity for predicting IVDD progression.

### Risk of progression of degenerative lumbar scoliosis [^1112KJGe]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Object

In this paper the authors' goal was to determine the factors associated with the progression of degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS).

Methods

Twenty-seven patients (3 men and 24 women; mean age 64.9 years) with more than 10° of lumbar scoliosis at baseline were monitored for a mean period of 10 years. The radiological evaluation included measurement of the scoliosis angle using the Cobb method, the direction of the scoliosis, the relationship between the intercrest line and the L-5 vertebra, lateral listhesis, segmental angle, distance from the center of the sacral line to the apical vertebra, degenerative listhesis anteriorly or posteriorly or both, and lordosis angle. In addition, the lateral osteophyte difference, disc index, and severity of osteoporosis were measured. The pain and disability outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) relative to severity of the angle of scoliosis.

Results

The mean initial and final scoliosis angles were 14° ± 5.4° and 25° ± 8.5°, respectively. The initial disc index at the L-3 vertebra (Spearman ρ = 0.7, p < 0.001), the sum of the segmental wedging angles above and below the L-3 vertebra (ρ = 0.6, p < 0.001), and the initial disc index at the apical vertebra (ρ = 0.6, p < 0.001) were correlated with the last follow-up angle of the scoliosis. By contrast, there was no statistically significant correlation between the initial segmental angles at L2–3 and L3–4 and the final follow-up scoliosis angle (ρ = 0.2, p = 0.67; and ρ = 0.1, p = 0.22; respectively). When the authors separated the patients into 3 groups according to the sum of the segmental angles above and below L-3 (< 5°, 5° to 10°, and > 10°), they found that 3 (42.9%) of 7, 8 (66.7%) of 12, and 6 (75.0%) of 8 patients in the 3 groups showed increases of greater than 10° in scoliosis angle. The mean distance from the center of the sacral line to the apical vertebra was 36.0 ± 9.7 mm, and the distance correlated with the measurement of the last follow-up angle of the scoliosis (ρ = 0.6, p < 0.001). The mean angle of the scoliosis was significantly greater when the intercrest line passed through the L-5 or L4–5 disc space than when the line passed through the L-4 vertebral body (31.4° ± 7.9° vs 21.8° ± 6.7°, p = 0.01). The ODI correlated with the measurement of the angle of the scoliosis (ρ = 0.6, p < 0.001). Age, sex, osteoporosis, the direction of the scoliosis, listhesis of coronal and sagittal planes, the lateral osteophyte difference, and the vertebral body index did not correlate with curve progression.

Conclusions

The findings of this study demonstrated that the progression of DLS was affected by the relationship between the intercrest line and the L-5 vertebra. When L-5 was deep seated, progression of DLS was found. Asymmetrical change in the disc space above and below the L-3 or apical vertebra may also be an important predictor of curve progression.

### Quantitative radiological characteristics of the facet joints in patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis [^1173AWfo]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The FJ area was proposed to reflect the narrowing of the joint space. Patients with lumbar stenosis have a significantly lower FJ area than that of healthy controls. However, despite the moderate to strong correlations found between the FJ area and FJ OA in this study, no significant association was found between the FJ area and LFS in the multivariable analysis. Our explanation is that although joint space narrowing is an important indicator of FJ OA, the FJ area may be influenced by other factors. On the one hand, the appearance of vertebral instability or displacement can also lead to the change of FJA. On the other hand, in many cases of severe OA, hypertrophy and osteophyte formation in the articular process can cause lengthening of the joint surface, so the FJ area does not reduce significantly (Figure 4).

Figure 4
Examples of factors that may influence the facet joint area. (A) Vertebral displacement can lead to changes in the facet joint area. (B) Despite severe hyperplasia and sagittalization, the facet joint area increased because of the lengthening of the joint surface.

This study was a validation and expansion of previous research, with a larger sample size. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the FJ based on several aspects. FJ hypertrophy and tropism are associated with LFS. FJ hypertrophy and joint space narrowing correlated with the severity of FJ OA. Taken together, SAPA seemed to be a good quantitative parameter to reflect FJ OA and degenerative LFS. We speculated that SAP hypertrophy and osteophyte formation could reflect the increase in segmental loading, FJ degenerative change, and nerve root compression. Although the causal relationship among them has not been identified, these conclusions may be helpful for clinicians to understand FJ morphology and degeneration.

This study has several limitations. First, this study was retrospective, and we could not determine the causal relationship between the changes in radiological parameters and FJ OA. Second, the study sample was not community-based. The control patients were from a group of middle-aged and elderly individuals who underwent physical examination, which may explain why aging was not associated with LFS in this study. Third, we used the cross-sectional area to reflect the hypertrophy and narrowing of the FJ. Although this method is very common, there are measurement errors owing to differences in the cutting angle of the CT. Three-dimensional volume measurements are required to further confirm our results. Fourth, other structures in the lumbar spine, such as the intervertebral disc and ligament flavum, were not investigated in this study.

### The unique characteristics of "upper" lumbar disc herniations [^1125kqNm]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the characteristics, presentation, and surgical outcome of patients with microdiscectomies at L1-L2 and L2-L3 with those we treated at L3-L4. We further sought to compare these results with those reported in the literature for discectomies at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.

Methods

We reviewed the clinical data collected from 69 patients who had 72 L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4 microdiscectomies performed from 1989 to 1999 at the New York University Medical Center. Patients who had surgery at L1-L2 or L2-L3 were grouped and compared with those treated at the L3-L4 level. Patients' charts were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of 12.9 months after surgery for presenting signs and symptoms, patient characteristics, and surgical outcome. Long-term follow-up via telephone interview was obtained at an average of 81.3 months after surgery.

Results

In the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group, 58% of the patients had previous lumbar disc surgery, compared with only 10% of those in the L3-L4 group, and 20% in the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group required a fusion during the procedure compared with only 10% in the L3-L4 group. These differences are both statistically significant. The short-term chart review demonstrates that only 58% and 53% of patients in the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group were improved with regard to radicular and back pain, respectively, whereas those in the L3-L4 group reported 94 and 87% rates of improvement in the same categories, both highly statistically significant findings. The long-term follow-up confirmed a highly statistically significantly worse outcome in the L1-L2 + L2-L3 group, with only 33% of patients reporting an improvement in their economic or functional status, compared with an 88% rate of improvement in the L3-L4 group. The outcome of our patients with L3-L4 herniations was similar to that reported in the literature for herniations at L4-L5 and L5-S1.

Conclusion

Herniated discs at the L1-L2 or L2-L3 level are different entities from those at lower levels of the lumbar spine. The surgical outcome in terms of postoperative back and radicular pain is worse for herniated discs at L1-L2 and L2-L3 compared with those treated at L3-L4. Our patients with L1-L2 or L2-L3 surgically treated herniated discs were more likely to have had previous lumbar surgery and required a fusion more often than their counterparts with L3-L4 herniated discs.

### A slowly progressive and reproducible animal model of intervertebral disc degeneration characterized by MRI, X-ray, and histology [^112dNScG]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

The progression of intervertebral disc degeneration following anterolateral "stab" of adult rabbit lumbar discs by 16-gauge hypodermic needle to a limited (5-mm) depth was studied for up to 24 weeks using magnetic resonance imaging, radiograph, and histologic outcome measures.

Objectives

To develop a slowly progressive, reproducible rabbit model of intervertebral disc degeneration suitable for studying pathogenesis and pathophysiology of intervertebral disc degeneration and testing safety and efficacy of novel approaches to the treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration (e.g., growth factors, gene therapy, cell therapy, and tissue engineering).

Summary Of Background Data

Numerous animal models of intervertebral disc degeneration have been proposed in the literature, each with attendant advantages and disadvantages. The classic "stab model", involving full-thickness stab of anterior anulus fibrosus of adult rabbit lumbar discs by a number 11 scalpel blade, appears to produce changes in certain biochemical and histologic outcome measures that are similar to changes seen in human intervertebral disc degeneration. However, the immediate herniation of nucleus pulposus on full-thickness stab renders this model less suitable for 1) studying effects of less precipitous changes in nucleus pulposus and anulus fibrosus that may be important in the onset and progression of intervertebral disc degeneration and 2) testing novel therapeutic approaches that target the processes of early intervertebral disc degeneration.

Methods

The L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral discs of 18 skeletally mature female New Zealand White rabbits were stabbed by 16-gauge hypodermic needle to a depth of 5 mm in the left anterolateral anulus fibrosus. Serial magnetic resonance imaging scans of the stabbed discs and intact L1-L2 and L5-L6 control discs were performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks post surgery and compared with preoperative magnetic resonance images. Supplemental radiograph and histologic analyses were performed.

Results

The stabbed discs exhibited a progressive decrease in "magnetic resonance imaging index" (the product of nucleus pulposus area and signal intensity from T2-weighted midsagittal plane images) starting at 3 weeks post stab and continuing through 24 weeks, with no evidence of spontaneous recovery or reversal of magnetic resonance imaging changes. Radiograph findings included early osteophyte formation by 6 weeks post stab and extensive, bridging osteophytes by 24 weeks. Histologic analysis revealed progressive loss of notochordal cells from the nucleus pulposus, filling of the nucleus pulposus space with fibrocartilage, and derangement of anulus fibrosus.

Conclusions

Stabbing the anterolateral anulus fibrosus of adult rabbit lumbar discs with a 16-gauge hypodermic needle to a limited (5-mm) depth results in a number of slowly progressive and reproducible magnetic resonance imaging, radiograph, and histologic changes over 24 weeks that show a similarity to changes seen in human intervertebral disc degeneration. This model would appear suitable for studying pathogenesis and pathophysiology of intervertebral disc degeneration and testing safety and efficacy of novel treatments of intervertebral disc degeneration.

Depending on the zone — or zones — in which the displacement is most localized, we distinguish, respectively, central (Fig. 3 a), paramedian (Fig. 3 b), foraminal (Fig. 3 c) or extraforaminal (Fig. 3 d) protrusion/herniations.

It is advisable to specify in the report the (xxx) coexistence of herniations/protrusion in one zone with other focal or diffuse disc displacements especially in cases where the latter lead to additional foraminal or spinal canal stenosis.
(β) VERTEBRAL BODIES AND SUBCHONDRAL BM ALTERATIONS

Concerining the degenerative processes of vertebral bodies, the report should include a description of vertebral spondylosis (sclerosis and irregularities of vertebral end plates and osteophytosis) and the severity of the findings (minimal, mild, moderate, severe), even without using classifications, such as Kellgren's one.

The description of degenerative findings of subchondral bone marrow may be limited to the generic definition of "osteochondrosis"-without specifying Modic's classification type, if others are the most relevant degenerative pathological findings-.
(b) FACET JOINTS AND LIGAMENTOUS APPARATUS

The report should identify these degenerative findings:

Arthrosis — characterized by irregularity, sclerosis and osteophytosis and articular joint space narrowing and synovial thickening-, the presence of synovitis (facet joint fluid collection) and/or synovial cysts (Fig. 4) and the description of the severity of these findings (minimal, mild, moderate, severe).

Imaging findings (Table 1)

X-ray imaging: Radiographs and computed tomography (CT)

The initial radiographic assessment of patients presenting with lumbar facet-mediated pain includes AP, lateral, and oblique views. Oblique radiographs are the best projections for assessing FJs of the lumbar spine because of their oblique position ("Scottie dog"). Lateral films, however, may provide useful information from the isthmus profile such as the pars interarticularis defect. Because of its ability to provide cross-sectional images and to provide a higher contrast between bony structures, CT improves anatomic evaluation of the FJs and is the preferred method for imaging FJ osteoarthritis. However, standard radiographs can also show pathological changes especially in severe disease. Degeneration is characterized by joint space narrowing, sclerosis, subchondral sclerosis and erosions, cartilage thinning, calcification of the joint capsule, hypertrophy of articular processes and of the ligamentum flavum causing impingement of the foramina and osteophytes. Secondary signs include vacuum joint phenomenon (intra-articular gas), joint effusion and associated degenerative spondylolisthesis. Synovial and subchondral cysts can extend posterior to the FJ but also anterior in the spinal cord or neuroforamen. Kalichman et al. showed 24% of X-rays FJOA before 40 years and 89% in the 60–69 years population, but once again with no correlation between abnormal morphology on radiologic findings and back pain.

Exemplary measurements in a 63-year-old male patient with an acute wedge-compression fracture of L3: Anterior and posterior height of the vertebral body (a; arrows); anterior and posterior height of intervertebral discs (a; arrows with rhomboid tips); neuroforaminal AP diameter (b; bracket); extent of facet joint degeneration (here: joint space narrowing + sclerosis; c; dashed arrows)

Furthermore, in every patient, in the two non-fractured segments with the most prominent degenerative changes (as determined by the more experienced radiologist, B.J.S.), the following imaging findings were evaluated (Table 2; Fig 3): anterior and posterior distance between bony endplates (i.e. intervertebral disc height), anteroposterior (AP) diameter of intervertebral foramina, spondylolisthesis (distance between vertebral body rims, mm), and extent of diffuse sclerosis adjacent to one or both vertebral endplates, of osteophyte formation, and of facet joint degeneration.

Images from all modalities were graded for overall diagnostic image quality on a five-point Likert scale (score of 1, inadequate; 2, poor; 3, moderate; 4, good; 5, excellent).

Statistical analysis

In addition to descriptive statistics, the agreement of numerical, approximately normally distributed data was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were created for illustration purposes. The diagnostic performance of MRI for the detection of fractures was assessed using contingency tables. The agreement of ordinal scaled parameters was assessed using weighted Cohen's κ. To assess inter-reader reproducibility of the readings of MR-based CT-like images and CT images, the same tests were used. For all measures, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. B.J.S. (11 years of experience in biostatistics) analyzed all data with SPSS, version 25 (IBM).

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^116sT4B3]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — decompressive laminoplasty versus conservative care (Matsudaira et al): In a retrospective comparative study, Eighteen patients underwent decompressive laminoplasty without fusion and 16 patients were treated conservatively after at least three months of conservative therapy, with a minimum of 2 years follow-up. Decompressive laminoplasty patients showed significantly better improvements in Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores than the conservative group (p < 0.001), and L4–5 range of motion changed with values 9.1 ± 4.5 to 9.1 ± 4.3 vs. 11.1 ± 3.8 to 9.3 ± 4.0 (p = 0.0443); the L4–5 angle on flexion showed no change in the conservative group whereas posterior enlargement tended to decrease in the decompressive laminoplasty group (p = 0.6617). This paper provides Level III therapeutic evidence that decompressive surgery alone in the form of a decompressive laminectomy results in better outcomes than conservative treatment in patients with spinal stenosis and Grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Definition of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — an acquired anterior displacement of one vertebra over the subjacent vertebra, associated with degenerative changes, without an associated disruption or defect in the vertebral ring — was agreed upon by the work group as an anatomic definition. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is an anatomic finding, its clinical symptoms are varied, patients can be asymptomatic, and presentations can include back pain, neurogenic claudication and/or radicular pain, with or without axial back pain. The literature also describes position dependent deformities in which the degree of anterior displacement is measurably affected by the posture and position of the patient, though no longitudinal studies have yet addressed this issue.

### Association of lumbar spine radiographic changes with severity of back pain-related disability… [^117D5xuX]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Primary exposure was lumbar spine radiographic changes, defined using the Kellgren-Lawrence grade. Secondary exposures were defined using presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing. The composite score combined the number of lumbar spine segments with definite changes detected on radiographic images. Currently, the presence of osteophytes and disc space narrowing are the most frequent changes detected on radiographs that may be indicative of spinal pathologic conditions, and the Kellgren-Lawrence grade is the tool commonly used to assess the severity of osteoarthritis. Good within-observer reproducibility was found.

21 At each lumbar spine segment, disc space narrowing and osteophytes were assessed through the semiquantitative method reported by Lane et al, 22 with grade 0 corresponding to normal, grade 1 to mild narrowing and osteophytes, grade 2 to moderate narrowing and osteophytes, and grade 3 to severe narrowing and osteophytes. The Kellgren-Lawrence grade was summarized as grade 0 indicating normal; grade 1 indicating doubtful narrowing of disc space and possible osteophytic lipping; grade 2 indicating definite osteophyte and possible narrowing of disc space; grade 3 indicating moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of disc space, some sclerosis, and possible deformity of bone contour; and grade 4 indicating large osteophytes, marked narrowing of disc space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour.
