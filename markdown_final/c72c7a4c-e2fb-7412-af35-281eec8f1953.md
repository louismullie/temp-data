## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a patient with multiple chronic conditions who now presents with acute confusion, copious diarrhea, lightheadedness, and dizziness, and who also has implanted stimulators complicating MRI planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and triage. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis for the acute presentation. Next, I will outline a focused diagnostic workup, including labs and imaging logistics for stimulators. After that, I will detail initial management strategies, including B12, thyroid, and supportive care. Finally, I will address long-term optimization of comorbidities and stimulator/MRI coordination, ensuring each step is evidence-linked and internally consistent.

> Let me first confirm the red flags and triage priorities: acute confusion with systemic symptoms and orthostatic complaints in a patient with multiple comorbidities warrants urgent evaluation for sepsis, hypovolemia, electrolyte derangements, and medication effects, while also considering reversible contributors like B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism that can mimic or worsen delirium. I should not delay stabilization while waiting for specialty input, and I need to ensure continuous monitoring of vitals, mental status, and urine output in a monitored setting if unstable.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should construct a tiered differential. Tier 1 includes infectious gastroenteritis with dehydration/electrolyte imbalance, medication-induced diarrhea with volume depletion, and acute metabolic derangements such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Tier 2 includes reversible neurocognitive contributors like B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism, as well as autonomic dysfunction from diabetes or OSA. Tier 3 includes less likely but serious entities such as ischemic colitis, adrenal insufficiency, or encephalopathy from systemic illness, and I should keep these in mind if the initial workup is unrevealing or the patient deteriorates [^e230440a] [^78fe15ac].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup, starting with immediate tests: CBC with differential, CMP including sodium and potassium, glucose, TSH with reflex free T4, vitamin B12 with methylmalonic acid if low-normal, ECG, and urinalysis. Given the diarrhea, I should add stool studies for C. difficile, ova and parasites, and culture if indicated, and consider COVID-19 testing depending on exposure risk. I need to check for orthostatic vitals to quantify volume depletion and screen for adrenal insufficiency if clinical suspicion arises, recognizing that thyroid testing is essential and that B12 deficiency can present with neurocognitive symptoms even without anemia or macrocytosis [^e230440a] [^1cec0493] [^db8f4108].

> Wait, let me verify the MRI logistics with implanted stimulators. I initially thought both devices would be absolute contraindications, but I should double-check manufacturer guidance and institutional protocols, because some spinal cord stimulators and hypoglossal nerve stimulators can undergo MRI under specific conditions with reprogramming and power-down. I need to contact the device vendors, obtain model numbers, and coordinate with radiology for a conditional MRI plan if feasible, or consider CT alternatives if MRI is not safe, and I should document this clearly to avoid delays in care [^16ad39a].

> Next, I should review initial management while awaiting results. For suspected B12 deficiency with neurologic symptoms, I should start parenteral B12 replacement promptly, typically 1,000 mcg intramuscularly every 2–3 days until improvement plateaus, then transition to maintenance dosing, because early treatment can reverse neurologic injury. For hypothyroidism, if confirmed, I should initiate levothyroxine with careful attention to adrenal status and cardiac comorbidity, and I should avoid starting thyroid hormone in the setting of uncorrected adrenal insufficiency. Supportive care with IV fluids, electrolyte repletion, and fall precautions is essential, and I should reassess mental status frequently to detect early deterioration or improvement [^2cfa5690] [^592f8bd0] [^36b18ffd].

> But wait, what if the confusion persists despite correction of volume and electrolytes? I should reconsider reversible causes such as B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, depression, sleep apnea, and medication effects, and escalate to a cognitive laboratory panel and structural neuroimaging if indicated. I need to ensure I am not anchoring on a single diagnosis and that I revisit the differential as new data emerge, especially in patients with multimorbidity where multiple contributors can coexist [^e230440a] [^78fe15ac].

> I will now examine long-term optimization of comorbidities once the acute episode stabilizes. For B12 deficiency, I should confirm the etiology with intrinsic factor antibodies and gastrin if indicated, counsel on adherence, and arrange maintenance therapy, recognizing that patients with prior deficiency or malabsorption may need lifelong supplementation. For hypothyroidism, I should titrate levothyroxine to a TSH target of about 2.5 mIU/L in most adults, monitor for drug interactions, and avoid over-replacement. For OSA, I should reinforce CPAP adherence and screen for residual sleepiness. For diabetes and obesity, I should intensify lifestyle and pharmacotherapy per guidelines and consider bariatric evaluation if BMI criteria and comorbidities are present. For depression, I should optimize therapy and monitor for adverse effects that could worsen medical comorbidity. For IBS and reflux, I should tailor symptom control and review medications that may worsen diarrhea or cognition [^600cf350] [^de518527] [^fb8bc8c3] [^4caf38f4].

> Hold on, I should verify the stimulator/MRI plan in writing and communicate with all teams. I need to ensure the device interrogation, reprogramming, and MRI conditions are documented, and if MRI is deferred, I should specify alternative imaging and the rationale. This prevents miscommunication and ensures patient safety while preserving diagnostic capacity.

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: stabilize and treat life-threatening causes of confusion and volume depletion, pursue a focused but comprehensive workup including B12 and thyroid testing, initiate disease-specific therapy such as parenteral B12 and levothyroxine when indicated, and coordinate MRI logistics with device manufacturers. Throughout, I should remain vigilant for multifactorial contributors and iteratively reassess the differential as new data arrive, aligning with best practices for multimorbid patients with acute neurocognitive changes [^e230440a] [^2cfa5690] [^98fab8f2].

---

The patient's acute confusion, copious diarrhea, and lightheadedness are most consistent with **hypovolemic shock from severe gastrointestinal fluid loss** [^notfound], with contributory factors including B12 deficiency neuropathy, hypothyroidism, and autonomic dysfunction from diabetes. Immediate priorities are **IV fluids, electrolyte correction, and hemodynamic stabilization**; concurrently, check CBC, electrolytes, renal function, glucose, TSH, and B12, and obtain an ECG. The neck and lumbar stimulators must be **interrogated and secured** before any MRI; if MRI is urgent, coordinate with the device team for conditional scanning or alternative imaging. B12 deficiency with neurologic symptoms warrants **parenteral B12** [^2cfa5690]; hypothyroidism should be treated cautiously after adrenal insufficiency is excluded [^36b18ffd]. This integrated approach addresses the acute crisis and underlying reversible contributors.

---

## Differential diagnosis

The acute presentation of confusion, copious diarrhea, and lightheadedness in the context of multiple chronic conditions suggests several **interconnected etiologies**:

- **Hypovolemic shock**: Severe diarrhea causing volume depletion, orthostatic hypotension, and cerebral hypoperfusion leading to confusion [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Profound losses of sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate from diarrhea contributing to arrhythmias, neuromuscular dysfunction, and altered mental status.

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Chronic deficiency causing macrocytic anemia, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms including confusion and dizziness [^7fdccceb].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Untreated or undertreated hypothyroidism contributing to fatigue, cognitive slowing, and bradycardia, exacerbating hypotension and confusion [^notfound].

- **Autonomic neuropathy**: Diabetic autonomic neuropathy causing orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal dysmotility, worsening diarrhea and dizziness [^notfound].

- **Medication-induced diarrhea**: Metformin, SSRIs, or PPIs potentially contributing to gastrointestinal symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Immediate clinical priorities and management

### Hemodynamic stabilization

Immediate priorities include establishing **two large-bore IV lines** for aggressive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) guided by blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output, with a typical initial bolus of 1–2 liters, repeated as needed. Continuously monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and mental status, and insert a urinary catheter if indicated to accurately track urine output and assess perfusion.

---

### Electrolyte and metabolic correction

Order immediate **CBC, electrolytes, renal function, glucose, and arterial blood gases** to guide correction of deficits. Replace potassium, magnesium, and bicarbonate as indicated, and correct glucose abnormalities to prevent further neurologic compromise.

---

### Diagnostic evaluation

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, glucose, TSH, free T4, vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, stool studies (C. difficile, cultures, ova and parasites), and lactate.

- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms present; MRI of the brain if confusion persists after initial stabilization, with device coordination for stimulators.

- **ECG**: To assess for arrhythmias or ischemia related to electrolyte disturbances or hypoperfusion.

---

### Management of chronic conditions

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Initiate parenteral vitamin B12 therapy (1,000 mcg IM daily for 1 week, then weekly for 4 weeks, then monthly) given neurologic involvement [^2cfa5690].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Initiate or adjust levothyroxine therapy cautiously after excluding adrenal insufficiency, with close monitoring of cardiovascular status [^36b18ffd].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Adjust insulin or oral agents based on current glucose levels and clinical status, recognizing stress hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia risk.

---

## Special considerations: implanted stimulators and MRI

The patient has a **neck stimulator for sleep apnea and a lumbar stimulator for chronic pain**, both of which complicate MRI planning:

- **Device interrogation**: Contact the device manufacturers and the implanting teams to determine MRI compatibility and specific scanning conditions (magnetic field strength, RF mode, gradient mode).

- **Conditional MRI**: If devices are MRI-conditional, follow manufacturer protocols for device programming (often turning therapy off) and patient monitoring during the scan.

- **Alternative imaging**: If devices are MRI-incompatible or urgent imaging is needed, consider CT or ultrasound as alternatives.

- **Documentation**: Clearly document device information, MRI conditions, and coordination with the device team to ensure safety and avoid delays.

---

## Potential complications and risks

Without prompt intervention, the patient faces **significant risks**, including:

- **Progressive shock**: Multi-organ failure, acute kidney injury, and ischemic injury.

- **Neurologic deterioration**: Worsening confusion, encephalopathy, or permanent neurologic deficits from B12 deficiency or hypothyroidism [^6d709382].

- **Cardiac complications**: Arrhythmias from electrolyte disturbances or ischemia.

- **Infection**: Sepsis from gastrointestinal pathogens, particularly if immunocompromised.

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Prognosis depends on the **speed of recognition**, the severity of organ dysfunction, and adherence to therapy. With aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and targeted treatment of B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism, neurologic function often improves substantially, though some deficits may persist if treatment is delayed. Long-term outcomes hinge on optimizing chronic disease management and preventing recurrence.

---

The patient's acute confusion, diarrhea, and lightheadedness reflect **hypovolemic shock with contributory B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, and autonomic neuropathy**. Immediate stabilization with fluids and electrolytes, rapid diagnostic testing, and coordinated management of stimulators for MRI are essential. Early parenteral B12 and cautious levothyroxine initiation, alongside diabetes optimization, will address reversible drivers and improve outcomes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Participants

The current study had a cross‐sectional design and enrolled 1483 patients with OSA at the Sleep Center of Beijing Anzhen Hospital (see Supporting Information: Figure A.1). The inclusion criteria were as follows: over 18‐year‐old; diagnosed with OSA by portable monitor. The exclusion criteria were as follows: severely impaired consciousness; previous history of malignancy. Participants with central sleep apnea syndrome were also excluded from the study. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

2.2 Clinical information

All participants were clinically evaluated, and the information recorded included sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age), and comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reflux esophagitis, hypothyroidism, rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, anxiety, depression). Data on comorbidities were obtained through both self‐reporting and medical records. CMD is defined as one or more events of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and heart failure in this study. Weight and height were also obtained through medical records. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m²). Neck circumference was measured using a tape measure at the cricoid level.

### Reversible dementia in the setting of multiple medical comorbidities due to B12 deficiency [^6d709382]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a cause of reversible dementia that must be ruled out in the evaluation of neurocognitive decline. We present a case of neurocognitive decline secondary to B12 deficiency where the workup was obscured by multiple competing diagnoses and treatment with empiric B12 supplementation reversed symptoms. Although the pretest probability was low, the morbidity from undiagnosed B12 deficiency is high, warranting a trial of B12 supplementation that resolved the patient's symptoms.

3.2 Patient Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

Approximately 80% of patients in this study were women, and women tended to have a slightly younger median age (49–55 years across populations) than men (54–57 years) in both the incident and prevalent populations (Table 2). Comorbidity rates were high, with hypertension occurring in > 40% of prevalent patients (Table 2). Hyperlipidemia and vitamin D deficiency were also common, each occurring in > 20% of prevalent patients. Other comorbidities occurring in > 10% of prevalent patients included gastroesophageal reflux disease, type 2 diabetes, anxiety, chronic pain, obesity and major depressive disorder. Hypothyroidism was reported in > 40% of prevalent patients; however, closer examination of this subgroup within the sensitive prevalent population revealed that 93% had a history including ICD‐10 codes for post‐procedural hypothyroidism, ablation procedures and/or use of anti‐thyroid drugs (ATD) or thyroid replacement therapy, suggesting that hypothyroidism was not a common comorbidity of TED, but rather a post‐diagnosis effect.

Patient demographics.

3.3 Provider Type

Ophthalmologists were the most common provider type overall, having seen 27.0%–31.5% of patients in the specific and sensitive incident populations, respectively, and 12.7%–15.7% in the specific and sensitive prevalent populations. Additional provider types seen by patients in this study included endocrinologists (11.6%, 7.5%, 6.4% and 4.1% in the specific incident, sensitive incident, specific prevalent and sensitive prevalent populations, respectively), family medicine practitioners (6.3%, 6.8%, 1.7% and 2.6%, respectively) optometrists (3.7%, 9.1%, 2.7% and 3.5%, respectively), and internal medicine practitioners (6.0%, 6.5%, 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively).

### Characteristics and comorbidities of headache in patients over 50 years of age: a cross-sectional study [^a83c3562]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although headache is a common complaint in younger individuals, it is one of the most common complaints among persons over the age of 50 and is a significant cause of morbidity. As there are differences in the causes and types of headache, the diagnosis and management of headache in older adults differ from that in younger individuals.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 570 patients ≥ 50 years were recruited at a university affiliated tertiary headache center between 2016 and 2019. Demographic data, headache characteristics, and comorbid medical conditions were recorded. The presence of depression was explored using the Beck Depression Inventory. The patients were evaluated using the STOP-BANG scale to determine the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 57.7 years. Seventy-three percent of the patients had primary headache disorders, with the most prevalent types being migraine, followed by tension-type headache. Secondary headaches were primarily the result of overuse of medication, cervical spine disease, and hypertension. Patients with medication-overuse headache were significantly more likely to suffer from hypothyroidism and gastrointestinal problems such as bleeding/ulcers. Irritable bowel syndrome was also more common in patients with medication-overuse headaches and migraines. The risk for obstructive sleep apnea was intermediate in 45.2% of the patients with hypertension-induced headache, but was lower in the majority of others. There was a high tendency for moderate-to-severe depression in the participants; however, the Beck Depression Inventory scores were significantly higher in medication-overuse headache patients.

Conclusion

Proper treatment of headache in middle-aged and older adults requires the recognition of secondary causes, comorbid diseases, and drug induced or medication overuse headaches. Special attention should be paid to depression and obstructive sleep apnea in such patients suffering from headache disorders.

### A practical approach to assist asthmatics to lose weight [^f04cb275]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Treating patients with obesity, particularly asthmatics, is a complex challenge that requires a unique and individually tailored approach. Obesity, defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m² or greater. It affects approximately 43% of adults and 19% of youth in America. It is a multifactorial disease and should be managed with the same intensity as any other medical problem, for it represents a risk factor for the onset and severity of asthma. Furthermore, it is a comorbid condition that exacerbates rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, anxiety, and depression. Being obese also increases morbidity for cardio/cerebrovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, breast and bladder cancer, and migraines. Osteoarthritis, in particular, of the knees and hips, is also associated with obesity, and that too will complicate asthma by hindering a subject's mobility and ability to exercise. This paper reviews the epidemiology and pathophysiology of obesity, its effect on asthma, and practical strategies to achieve weight loss.

Vitamin B12 deficiency has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation with a variety of neurological symptoms and signs. As a result, many patients lack classic features of advanced severe deficiency. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in order to prevent the irreversible damage to the nervous system. We describe a 25-year-old man, who presented with predominant sensory symptoms without any signs on clinical evaluation. His serum vitamin B12 levels were low and neuroimaging revealed myelopathy. The patient was treated promptly with cyanocobalamin injections, which lead to a rapid resolution of symptoms and radiological abnormalities.

Limitations

The current study included a convenience sample of patient records. Records were not included if follow-up data was not available (eg, the patient did not return to the clinic) or if demographic or other clinical information was not available in the patient record. The clinic from which these data were collected did not systematically assess (ie, at a specific time frame or manner) the presence of adverse events; thus, it is possible that the frequency of adverse events could be higher or lower based on the systematic evaluation of adverse events. Last, our follow-up time was relatively short at an average of 10.4 months. While we expect that adverse events associated with MRI would occur in the short-term (ie during the scan or shortly thereafter), it is possible that the MRI was associated with longer term effects that our follow-up period did not adequately capture.

Medical management

There is limited guidance on the management of non-neoplastic complications of AIG/PA, including frequency of interval surveillance and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency and iron deficiency. Importantly, vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in the absence of anemia and if not addressed can lead to irreversible neurologic deficits. Parenteral rather than oral supplementation is preferred, especially if neurologic symptoms are present. Appropriate supplementation of vitamin B12 and iron is important, along with workup of other etiologies for these not uncommon deficiencies based on the clinical scenario.

### Dysosmia and dysgeusia associated with duloxetine [^1be37f3c]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This report indicates that duloxetine caused dysosmia and subsequent dysgeusia because both smell and taste disorders reversibly recovered 7 days after discontinuing duloxetine, despite continuing the other ongoing medication. This clinical course between the discontinuation of duloxetine and improvement of taste and smell sensation provides objective evidence to support duloxetine as the cause of these adverse effects. Two important clinical issues arise from the clinical course of the present study patient. The first is whether these disorders have already been reported as adverse effects of duloxetine, and the second concerns the mechanism by which duloxetine or by which drug interactions with duloxetine cause these disorders.

The primary causes of olfactory dysfunction are allergic and viral rhinitis, influenza, head trauma, dementia of the Alzheimer type, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus and malnutrition. Although this patient had several years' history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, insomnia, reflux esophagitis, and chronic bilateral maxillary sinusitis and low serum zinc levels, which were found at this admission, there had been no problem with her sense of smell before taking duloxetine, and her sense of smell recovered soon after discontinuing duloxetine, despite continuing the other ongoing medication. This clinical course proved that duloxetine was the major cause of dysosmia and subsequent dysgeusia in this patient.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^83d8e425]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Modifying factors in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) should be evaluated by clinicians, who should assess the patient with CRS or RARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, aspirin‑exacerbated respiratory disease, and ciliary dyskinesia. This recommendation is based on multiple systematic reviews and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm, and the quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment by identifying comorbid conditions known to accompany CRS and RARS, knowledge of which would improve sinusitis management and, conversely, management of sinusitis may improve the associated chronic condition (asthma).

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: recognition and management [^7fdccceb]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years. Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^17026fc1]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

Case presentations

Patient 1

A 50-year-old male with a complex medical history — including poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 12%), idiopathic pancreatitis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, congestive heart failure, hypertension, obesity (BMI 32.5), chronic iron deficiency anemia, and a 2-pack-per-day smoking history — presented with a long-standing history of HS, classified as Hurley stage III, affecting the gluteal and perineal regions. His disease had been refractory to multiple systemic and procedural interventions, including 15 surgical procedures such as incision and drainage and wide local excisions. Previous medical therapies included doxycycline, adalimumab (discontinued due to heart failure exacerbation), and ertapenem (discontinued following the development of Clostridioides difficile colitis); infliximab was avoided given his cardiac risk. Most recently, he was initiated on secukinumab with ongoing therapy at the time of assessment. Physical examination revealed numerous interconnected sinus tracts, nodules, and hypertrophic scarring in the gluteal and perineal regions, without signs of acute infection. Laboratory tests demonstrated anemia (hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL), leukocytosis (white blood cell count 21.6 × 10⁹/L with neutrophilia), hyponatremia (sodium 130 mmol/L), renal dysfunction (creatinine 2.32 mg/dL), hyperglycemia (glucose 524 mg/dL), markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (2453 U/L) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (1952 U/L), and a highly elevated C-reactive protein (49.5 mg/L), consistent with systemic inflammation. In addition to cutaneous symptoms, the patient endorsed chronic diarrhea and tenesmus, prompting extensive gastrointestinal workup. Diagnostic evaluations, including pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, MR enterography, and colonoscopy with biopsies, were negative for inflammatory bowel disease. Due to ongoing systemic symptoms and atypical features, genetic testing was pursued and revealed heterozygosity for the NOD2 c.2938dup (p. Leu980ProfsTer2), also known as the 1007fs variant. Based on the constellation of chronic inflammatory symptoms, dermatologic findings, and the presence of a known pathogenic NOD2 mutation, a diagnosis of Yao syndrome was established. At the time of reporting, the patient had been receiving secukinumab for 4 months with partial improvement in both cutaneous disease and systemic symptoms, and long-term monitoring remains ongoing.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: the great masquerader [^af1c5293]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is rare in children, with nonspecific symptoms including failure to thrive, vomiting, anorexia, and neurologic changes with or without hematologic disturbances. The neuropathy can be severe and irreversible. We report four cases of children with B12 deficiency secondary to adult type pernicious anemia, a presumed transport protein abnormality, and a metabolic defect. All demonstrated neurologic compromise that improved after initiation of B12 therapy. Hematologic manifestations may be preceded by constitutional, gastrointestinal, or neurologic changes, and must raise concern for B12 deficiency. Therapy should be initiated promptly in this setting to prevent irreversible neuropathy.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^e230440a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

DETeCD-ADRD diagnostic evaluation — iterative diagnostic formulation and multi-tiered testing — recommends a structured and multi-tiered approach beginning with Tier 1 assessments and tests, with clinicians formulating Tier 1 results and deciding whether additional tests are needed to gain sufficient confidence, often requiring two or more problem-focused visits using a validated standardized instrument. Recommendations 8 and 9 provide guidance for basic (Tier 1) diagnostic tests, including a cognitive laboratory panel and structural neuroimaging, that should be routinely obtained in all patients with a cognitive-behavioral syndrome to form a confident etiologic diagnosis. Recommendations 8 through 11 apply to fewer patients because many individuals evaluated will, once Recommendations 1 through 7 are followed, be assessed with high confidence as "cognitively unimpaired" and will not require further testing or evaluation. For typical presentations of AD dementia, clinicians can often reach a confident clinical diagnosis that remains probabilistic and clinical judgment based and is not biomarker confirmed, whereas molecular biomarker confirmation is necessary for consideration of new disease-modifying therapies that target amyloid plaques. Several readily treatable comorbid conditions — such as infections, dehydration, hypothyroidism (TSH), and vitamin B12 deficiency — are often observed, may contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms, and may cause or exacerbate acute clinical decompensation. A shotgun approach to first-tier diagnostic testing is not recommended as it is costly and can be harmful; instead, a judicious and stepwise approach prioritizing common and treatable conditions and less invasive and more cost-effective testing is recommended as the first-tier approach in patients suspected of having a cognitive-behavioral syndrome due to AD/ADRD. The phrase "labs for reversible causes of dementia" can be misleading; "cognitive lab panel" may be more suitable, and the conditions assessed are rarely the primary etiology of a gradually progressive cognitive–behavioral syndrome but often exacerbate impairment in individuals with underlying neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders.

### One-year persistent symptoms and functional impairment in SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative individuals [^5cb8c085]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data were collected using REDCap v11.0.3 and analyzed using the statistical software Stata, version 16.0 (StataCorp). Descriptive analyses included percentages with comparisons using chi‐square tests or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. A p ‐value < 0.05 was considered significant. Prevalence estimates of each symptom were adjusted for the time from infection, age, sex, education, profession, working in healthcare setting, smoking, physical activity, COVID‐19 vaccination status, symptoms at presentation, hospitalization, and the following comorbidities when present prior to testing: overweight or obese, hypertension, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunosuppression, hypothyroidism, anemia, migraine, tension headache, sleeping disorder, anxiety, depression, any psychiatric condition, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, and chronic fatigue.

Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and persistent symptoms at 12 months, as well as SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and functional impairment at 12 months. Only participants reporting onset of new symptoms at testing were included in the regression analysis, in order to ensure that symptoms were new in nature. The outcome of persistence of symptoms at 12 months was defined as having at least one symptom in the past 2 weeks preceding the questionnaire. The outcome of functional impairment was defined as having mild, moderate, or severe functional impairment using the Sheehan Disability Scale. Multivariable regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with a 95% confidence interval. aORs were adjusted for time from infection, age, sex, education, profession, working in healthcare setting, smoking, physical activity, COVID‐19 vaccination status, symptoms at presentation, hospitalization, and the following comorbidities when present prior to testing: overweight or obese, hypertension, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunosuppression, hypothyroidism, anemia, migraine, tension headache, sleeping disorder, anxiety, depression, any psychiatric condition, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, and chronic fatigue. Additional analyses were conducted to determine the association between SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and the persistence of symptoms or functional impairment at 12 months across subgroups of sex, age, and individuals without any past medical or psychiatric history. The subgroup analysis for individuals without any past medical or psychiatric history aimed to mitigate any potential bias from underlying conditions that could lead to similar persistent symptoms independent of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

Pernicious anemia has been associated with various psychiatric manifestations, such as depression, mania and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms can sometimes occur without hematological and neurological abnormalities and can be prodromal of vitamin B12 deficiency. We report a case of autoimmune B12 deficiency presenting as catatonia without signs of anemia or macrocytosis, in which a correlation was found between the patient's B12 blood levels and catatonic symptoms over time. This catatonic episode was successfully treated with only lorazepam and adequate doses of cyanocobalamin.

### Bariatric surgery: the challenges with candidate selection, individualizing treatment and clinical outcomes [^23251b1c]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Candidate selection and pre-operative assessment

Patient selection criteria for bariatric surgery include body mass index (BMI), the presence of co-morbidities and a history of prior weight loss attempts. National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines state that bariatric surgery should be offered to patients with a BMI of 35 to 40 kg/m² who have obesity related conditions such as diabetes mellitus or obstructive sleep apnea, or in those with a BMI of 40 kg/m² or greater regardless of weight related co-morbidities. Bariatric surgery for individuals with a BMI less than 35 kg/m² with obesity related co-morbidities is under investigation but is not currently recommended.

If a candidate meets the criteria for surgery, then a multi-disciplinary team assessment is made as to the suitability of the candidate. This is a complex process involving psychological, surgical, dietetic and medical review. The individual must be physically and psychologically fit to proceed to surgery. Expectations must be managed and a determination must be made as to the individuals' ability to comply with post-operative care. The decision to operate will take into account the benefits the candidate is likely to gain, and the risks peri-operatively and post-operatively.

This is an individualized assessment, and the role of the psychologist and/or psychiatrist should be central. Some reports suggest an increased risk of suicide after bariatric surgery, although the etiology remains unclear. Major failures of bariatric surgery are due to poor psychological adaptation, especially if the patient's expectations were not adequately managed. All candidates should be given the correct and realistic information on what the procedure can achieve. If this is addressed, then the risk of surgical failure can often be mitigated. This personalized assessment is a vital part of the pre-operative assessment.

For each patient the benefits of the procedure should outweigh the operative risk. In general, obese patients have an increased prevalence of cardiopulmonary disease that may be undiagnosed pre-operatively. An individualized pre-operative assessment should be completed by a multi-disciplinary team. Pre-operative investigations should focus on screening for cardiac arrhythmia, prolonged QT syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. Almost 70% of individuals awaiting bariatric surgery can be diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, with over 40% meeting the criteria for severe disease. However, this is not associated with a greater rate of peri-operative complications. Male gender, age older than 50 years, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and renal impairment are associated with greater mortality.
