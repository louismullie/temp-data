## Question

What are the contraindications for using bismuth subsalicylate in diarrhea treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the contraindications for using bismuth subsalicylate in diarrhea treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the salicylate component and Reye syndrome risk. Then, I should verify absolute contraindications from FDA labeling. Next, I will review relative contraindications and precautions, including age, pregnancy, and comorbidities. After that, I need to check drug interactions and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable list and confirm any nuances that could change practice, like microscopic colitis or H. pylori regimens.

> Let me first confirm the core safety issue: bismuth subsalicylate contains salicylate, so salicylate hypersensitivity and Reye syndrome risk are central to contraindications, especially in children and teens with viral illnesses, and this is consistently emphasized across FDA labels and major guidelines, so I should anchor on that before moving on [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489] [^6bbdc24f].

> I will now examine absolute contraindications from FDA labeling; wait, let me verify each one against multiple sources to avoid missing anything. The consistent absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to salicylates or aspirin, active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding disorders, and the presence of bloody or black stools, with additional cautions to avoid use in children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like illness due to Reye syndrome risk, and these are repeated across multiple DailyMed entries and the ACG traveler diarrhea guidance, which also flags bismuth encephalopathy risk in IBD and HIV as a contraindication for prophylaxis [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489] [^6bbdc24f] [^9539b669].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about age; I initially thought "under 12 years" was a universal absolute contraindication, but I should double-check the nuance. The CDC Yellow Book advises against bismuth subsalicylate in children under 12 years because of Reye syndrome risk, whereas FDA OTC labeling says "ask a doctor" for children under 12 and explicitly warns against use in children and teens with chickenpox or flu-like symptoms; reconciling this, the pediatric prohibition is strongest in the context of viral illness and Reye risk, while outside of viral illness some clinicians may consider use with caution, though many still avoid it under 12, so I need to state this clearly as a relative contraindication with viral illness as the key driver [^fe1c15e7] [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489].

> Next, I should review pregnancy and lactation; let me verify the guidance. The CDC Yellow Book recommends avoiding bismuth subsalicylate in pregnancy due to potential fetal effects of salicylates, and advises against its use in breastfeeding mothers, aligning with a conservative approach given salicylate transfer into milk and infant exposure concerns, so pregnancy and breastfeeding should be treated as relative contraindications in diarrhea management contexts [^7e4a9bc6] [^ae306c9a].

> I need to ensure I capture comorbidity-based cautions; let me consider renal, hepatic, and GI disease. Severe renal impairment increases salicylate accumulation and toxicity risk, and although the clearest labeling language comes from the bismuth-containing H. pylori regimens, the pharmacokinetic rationale applies to BSS as well, so severe renal impairment should be a relative contraindication; likewise, severe hepatic disease can impair salicylate metabolism and increase bleeding risk, and active GI bleeding or inflammatory diarrhea with fever should prompt avoidance of BSS, with ACG also noting bismuth encephalopathy risk in IBD and HIV as a reason to avoid prophylactic BSS [^notfound] [^notfound] [^3dcbc54f] [^9539b669].

> Let me think about drug interactions; I should confirm the salient ones. Concurrent salicylate-containing drugs increase toxicity risk, warfarin and other anticoagulants have additive bleeding risk, and metronidazole-containing regimens carry disulfiram-like reactions with alcohol and specific drug–drug contraindications; while some of the strict contraindications pertain to the metronidazole/tetracycline/BSS combination product, the salicylate–anticoagulant interaction and additive salicylate exposure are clinically relevant to BSS monotherapy and warrant caution or avoidance [^f6430ae7] [^1d7a3f27] [^fe1c15e7].

> But wait, what if the patient has microscopic colitis; I should verify whether BSS is ever appropriate there. The AGA suggests bismuth subsalicylate as a conditional option for induction of remission in microscopic colitis when budesonide is not feasible, based on very low-quality evidence, so in that narrow, guideline-supported scenario, BSS may be considered despite general cautions, which means microscopic colitis is not a blanket contraindication but requires individualized risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^a679c0e8] [^fc05bd20].

> I should also confirm duration limits and when to stop therapy; hold on, I should verify the exact wording. FDA labeling advises stopping use and seeking medical care if diarrhea lasts more than 2 days, if symptoms worsen, or if ringing in the ears or hearing loss occurs, which signals salicylate toxicity; this operationalizes a "do not use beyond 48 hours" rule in persistent diarrhea and reinforces early reassessment for red flags [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489] [^6bbdc24f].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list so I don't miss anything critical. Absolute contraindications include salicylate hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding disorders, and the presence of bloody or black stools; strong relative contraindications include children and teenagers with chickenpox or flu-like illness due to Reye risk, pregnancy, breastfeeding, severe renal or hepatic impairment, and active GI bleeding; important precautions include age under 12 years outside of viral illness contexts, concurrent anticoagulation or other salicylates, and prolonged use beyond 2 days without improvement; special contexts like microscopic colitis may allow cautious use when budesonide is not feasible, and travelers with IBD or HIV should avoid prophylactic BSS due to encephalopathy risk [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489] [^6bbdc24f] [^ec1f9da8] [^7e4a9bc6] [^ae306c9a] [^9539b669] [^a679c0e8].

---

Bismuth subsalicylate is **contraindicated in patients with salicylate allergy** [^fe1c15e7], **active peptic ulcer disease**, or **bleeding disorders** [^02296489], and in **children or adolescents with viral infections** due to Reye syndrome risk [^ec1f9da8]. It should also be avoided in **pregnancy** [^7e4a9bc6] and in patients with **severe renal or hepatic impairment** [^f6430ae7] [^d33838b1]. Use caution with anticoagulants, gout medications, or diabetes drugs [^fe1c15e7], and stop use if diarrhea persists beyond 2 days or if symptoms worsen [^02296489].

## Absolute contraindications

Absolute contraindications are situations in which bismuth subsalicylate **should not be used under any circumstances**:

| **Contraindication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Salicylate allergy or hypersensitivity | Risk of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489] |
| Active peptic ulcer disease | Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcer perforation [^02296489] [^6bbdc24f] |
| Bleeding disorders (e.g. hemophilia, thrombocytopenia) | Increased risk of bleeding due to salicylate-induced platelet dysfunction [^02296489] [^471da452] |
| Children and adolescents recovering from chickenpox or influenza-like symptoms | Risk of Reye syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition [^fe1c15e7] [^ec1f9da8] |
| Pregnancy | Potential adverse effects on the fetus due to salicylate exposure [^7e4a9bc6] [^ae306c9a] |
| Severe renal impairment | Risk of salicylate accumulation and toxicity [^f6430ae7] [^d33838b1] |
| Severe hepatic impairment | Risk of impaired drug metabolism and increased toxicity [^f6430ae7] [^d33838b1] |

## Relative contraindications and precautions

Relative contraindications are situations in which bismuth subsalicylate **should be used with caution**, balancing potential benefits against risks:

- **Breastfeeding**: Salicylates may be excreted in breast milk, posing potential risks to the infant [^ae306c9a].
- **Concurrent medications**: Use caution with anticoagulants, gout medications (e.g. probenecid), and diabetes medications due to potential interactions [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489].
- **Elderly patients**: Increased risk of salicylate toxicity due to age-related changes in renal function [^notfound].
- **Patients with chronic gastrointestinal conditions**: Use caution in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or other chronic gastrointestinal disorders [^9539b669].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring caution or monitoring

Certain clinical scenarios require **careful monitoring** or adjustment of therapy:

- **Prolonged diarrhea**: If diarrhea persists beyond 2 days or symptoms worsen, discontinue use and seek medical evaluation [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489].
- **Hearing loss or tinnitus**: These symptoms may indicate salicylate toxicity and warrant immediate discontinuation [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489].
- **Blackening of tongue or stools**: Harmless but may indicate excessive use or underlying gastrointestinal bleeding [^fe1c15e7] [^02296489].

---

## Summary of contraindications and precautions

- **Absolute contraindications**: Salicylate allergy, active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding disorders, children/adolescents with viral infections, pregnancy, severe renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Relative contraindications**: Breastfeeding, concurrent medications (anticoagulants, gout medications, diabetes medications), elderly patients, chronic gastrointestinal conditions.
- **Clinical scenarios requiring caution**: Prolonged diarrhea, hearing loss or tinnitus, blackening of tongue or stools.

---

Bismuth subsalicylate is effective for diarrhea but carries important contraindications and precautions. Clinicians should **assess for allergies, bleeding disorders, viral infections, pregnancy, and organ impairment** before use, and monitor for adverse effects during treatment.

Results

Among 1344 patients with diarrhea screened for eligibility, we excluded 865 (64%), primarily because diarrhea had been occurring for 48 hours or more at the time of presentation; 63 (4.7%) reported taking an antimicrobial medication during the previous 48 hours (Figure 1). Of 479 eligible patients, 440 enrolled in the study, with 39 declining to participate. One participant was lost to follow-up. Median (interquartile range) participant age was 32 (23–45) years and 187 (43%) were male. In both groups, 37% of participants reported having taken antibiotics for a previous diarrheal illness (Table 1). The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of participants were similar between study groups; most patients reported at least 5 stools per day, and one-third were moderately or severely dehydrated at the time of enrollment (Table 1). Similar proportions of patients in each group submitted enrollment stool specimens that yielded pathogens: 37 individuals (17%) in the BSS group and 43 (20%) in the placebo group; distribution of pathogens was similar between groups (Table 2). Among the 86 bacterial isolates, 44 (51%) were nonsusceptible to ampicillin and 50 (58%) were nonsusceptible to quinolones.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^c870cf59]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

Effects of interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use are likely to vary by illness and setting; however, we found lower odds of antibiotic use following BSS for acute diarrhea in a setting where antibiotic use for diarrhea is typically high. This effect size approaches the goal of 50% reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings set in the United States Action Plan for Combatting Antimicrobial Resistance. Because of the challenges inherent in developing new classes of antibiotic medications, and because increased population density and mixing and decreased travel times facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance, preserving the function of the limited number of existing drugs is critical. In Pakistan, more than half of adults with diarrhea may seek care from a physician. Encouraging health care professionals and pharmacists in settings with high diarrhea incidence to recommend BSS as frontline treatment for adults with diarrhea, and promoting BSS for diarrhea self-management, may reduce antibiotic use and rates of antibiotic resistance globally.

Importance

Many of the 4.5 billion annual episodes of diarrhea are treated unnecessarily with antibiotics; prevalence of antibiotic resistance among diarrheal pathogens is increasing. Knowledge-based antibiotic stewardship interventions typically yield little change in antibiotic use.

Objective

To compare antibiotic use among adult outpatients with diarrhea given bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) or placebo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial took place from April to October 2014. Participants were patients aged 15 to 65 years with acute, nonbloody diarrhea from 22 outpatient clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. Participants were interviewed about symptoms and health care utilization during the 5 days after enrollment. Group assignment was concealed from participants, field staff, and the statistician. Primary analysis occurred from August to September 2015.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive BSS or placebo for 48 hours or less.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Use of systemic antibiotics within 5 days of enrollment. Secondary outcomes included measures of duration and severity of illness.

Results

Among eligible patients, 39 declined to participate, 440 enrolled, and 1 enrolled participant was lost to follow-up, for a total of 439 patients included in the analysis. Median (interquartile range) participant age was 32 (23–45) years and 187 (43%) were male. Two hundred twenty patients were randomized to BSS and 220 were randomized to placebo. Overall, 54 participants (12%) used systemic antibiotics (16% in the placebo group and 9% in the BSS group); all antibiotic use followed consultation with a physician. Use of any antibiotic was significantly lower in the BSS group (20 of 220 vs 34 of 219 patients; odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30–0.98), as was use of fluoroquinolones (8 of 220 vs 20 of 219 patients; OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16–0.88). Rates of care seeking and hospitalization were similar between groups and no difference was detected in timing of diarrhea resolution. However, those in the BSS group less commonly received intravenous rehydration (14 of 220 vs 27 of 219 patients; OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25–0.95) and missed less work (median [interquartile range], 0 [0–1] vs 1 [0–1] day; P = 0.04) during follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found less antibiotic use among participants given BSS for acute diarrhea in a setting where antibiotics are commonly used to treat diarrhea. Encouraging health care professionals in such settings to recommend BSS as frontline treatment for adults with diarrhea, and promoting BSS for diarrhea self-management, may reduce antibiotic use and rates of antibiotic resistance globally.

Key Points

Question

Among adults with diarrhea, does use of bismuth subsalicylate reduce antibiotic consumption?

Findings

In this placebo-controlled randomized trial that included 439 adults in Pakistan, antibiotic use occurred among 16% of participants who received placebo and 9% of those who received bismuth subsalicylate, a significant difference.

Meaning

The findings suggest that recommending bismuth subsalicylate as a frontline treatment for adults with diarrhea, including for diarrhea self-management, may reduce rates of unnecessary antibiotic use and help modulate the spread of antibiotic resistance.

Limitations

This study has limitations. By offering an alternative medication during the clinical encounter, we redirected patients in both study groups away from antibiotics. This nudge likely reduced antibiotic use in both study groups: effort required to obtain antibiotics increased because they were not provided during the initial clinic visit; meanwhile, because diarrhea symptoms often wane naturally within 1 to 2 days of onset, participant motivation to obtain antibiotics likely decreased while they tried the study medication. Indeed, a Cochrane reviewconcluded that, when safe to do so, withholding antibiotics yields greater reduction in antibiotic use while maintaining patient satisfaction and rates of favorable clinical outcomes compared with providing delayed prescriptions. In our study, the proportion of participants using antibiotics was lower than we anticipated: 34 (16%) of patients in the placebo group used antibiotics, compared with 96% of Pakistani children who presented for care for diarrhea at a private clinic in one studyand 46% of Pakistani children with diarrhea, whether or not they presented for care, in another. Thus, we likely would have observed a larger relative reduction in antibiotic use had we not controlled antibiotic use at enrollment in the placebo group. Despite this, compared with controls, substantially fewer participants in the BSS group used antibiotics.

The drivers of this relative reduction are unclear. Although previous studies have found reduced duration and severity of symptoms among children and young adults given BSS for diarrhea, we did not detect reductions in diarrhea output or time to resolution of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting in this study. This may be because we relied on participants to record numbers and timing of diarrheal episodes and other symptoms rather than hospitalizing participants to obtain more objective and systematic measurements, or because our study population experienced a wider range of diarrheal etiologies. Nonetheless, additional outcome measures suggest that participants in the control group felt less well than those in the BSS group during follow-up. In addition to taking antibiotics more often, participants in the control group were significantly more likely to receive intravenous rehydration, and they missed more work. Although results did not attain statistical significance, such participants were also less likely to report participation in all their typical activities during the first 2 days of follow-up and more likely to take nonantibiotic medications or supplements for their illness, with antidiarrheal medications being the most commonly reported. The additional treatments used in the placebo group might have obscured differences in illness course between the study groups.

Statistical Analysis

We estimated sample size based on the primary end point of antibiotic use during 5 days of observation. While accounting for stratified design and assuming 95% confidence, 1:1 enrollment in BSS and placebo groups, negligible dropout, and antibiotic use in 10% of the BSS group, we required 20 clinics each to enroll 20 participants to achieve 80% power to detect a 10% difference in antibiotic use between groups (ie, 20% of placebo participants use antibiotics). Because resources sufficed when the study began, we added 2 clinics (for a total of 440 participants) to increase statistical power.

All analyses were by assigned group. We used logistic regression to explore multivariable models, which included clinic, age quartiles, sex, wealth, or diarrhea severity at presentation as covariates. Because none of these potential confounders were significant in models assessing each covariate individually, we reported univariate results derived using χ², Fisher exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. We constructed Kaplan-Meier curves to analyze resolution of symptoms, and differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. Two-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Primary analysis occurred August to September 2015.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^7e7232f1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — prevention and prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea: Patient level counseling on prevention of acute enteric infection is not routinely recommended but may be considered in the individual or close contacts of the individual who is at high risk for complications. Individuals should undergo pretravel counseling regarding high-risk food/beverage avoidance to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Frequent and effective hand washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers are of limited value in preventing most forms of traveler's diarrhea but may be useful where low-dose pathogens are responsible for the illness as for example during a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus infection, institutional outbreak, or in endemic diarrhea prevention. Bismuth subsalicylates have moderate effectiveness and may be considered for travelers who do not have any contraindications to use and can adhere to the frequent dosing requirements. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for prevention of TD are not recommended. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has moderate to good effectiveness and may be considered in high-risk groups for short-term use.

Discussion

Globally, progress on improving the appropriateness of prescribing practices and patient demand for antimicrobials has been slow. Progress may be particularly challenging in settings where such drugs can be obtained without a prescription and where financial incentives exist for clinicians to prescribe them, such as in many parts of Asia. Rates of antibiotic misuse are particularly high in Pakistan, where a recent study found antibiotic use among young children on 18% of more than 150 000 observed days. Although respiratory illnesses are the predominant reason for antibiotic misuse in the United States, diarrhea has been documented as the most frequent reason for antibiotic use in less developed settings, and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common reason for self-medication with antibiotics among adults in Pakistan. In this study, patients who received BSS during consultation for diarrhea were 46% less likely than those who received placebo to take antibiotics during 5 days of follow-up. In comparison, a 2017 Cochrane reviewconcluded clinician-directed interventions likely reduce inappropriate antibiotic use by 25% or less.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^9539b669]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) prophylaxis — efficacy, dosing, duration, and cautions: BSS has been shown to reduce the frequency of TD when used during a period of risk for 3 weeks, and provides at least 60% protection at a dose of 2.1 g per day. The recommended regimen is two tablets four daily doses at mealtimes and at bedtime; when 2.1 and 1.05 g were given two times a day, protection fell to 41% and 35%, respectively. BSS has been shown to reduce TD if taken in proper daily dose for up to 3 weeks, but most authorities recommend chemoprophylaxis for trips up to 2 weeks and it should not be used for longer trips. Travelers should be warned that stools and tongues will turn black from a harmless bismuth sulfide salt, and persons with underlying inflammatory bowel disease or HIV infection should not receive BSS because of concern for excessive absorption leading to bismuth encephalopathy.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^de8a2ac8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Prophylaxis — recommendations for traveler's diarrhea (TD) in adults: Bismuth subsalicylates have moderate effectiveness and may be considered for travelers who do not have contraindications and can adhere to frequent dosing (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence). Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics for prevention of traveler's diarrhea are not recommended (Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has moderate to good effectiveness and may be considered in high-risk groups for short-term use (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence).

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^c5bd52b1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — treatment of acute disease: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral rehydration options in the elderly with severe diarrhea or any traveler with cholera-like watery diarrhea is recommended. The use of probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults is not recommended, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness. Bismuth subsalicylates can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild-to-moderate illness. In patients receiving antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea, adjunctive loperamide therapy should be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. The evidence does not support empiric anti-microbial therapy for routine acute diarrheal infection, except in cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^6f67e045]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Participants in either group consumed a median of 16 tablets (8 doses) of study medication. Most participants in each group reported liking the study medication (191 of 220 [86%] in the BSS group and 179 of 219 [82%] in the placebo group), primarily because they perceived that it helped relieve their diarrhea (174 of 220 [79%] in the BSS group and 163 of 219 [74%] in the placebo group). Many participants in each group felt the study medication worked as well as antibiotics for diarrhea (92 of 220 [42%] in the BSS group and 81 of 219 [37%] in the placebo group).

Methods

Setting and Participants

Twenty-two general-care outpatient clinics staffed by allopathic physicians in Karachi, Pakistan, participated in this study. We targeted low- to middle-income, multiethnic neighborhoods because we believed diarrhea incidence would be greater than in higher-income neighborhoods, and recruitment would therefore proceed more quickly. Patients were enrolled from April to June and August to October 2014, which encompassed Karachi's rainy season. We did not enroll participants during July because most staff and laypersons were observing Ramadan. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1.

Within each clinic, we screened all clinically stable adults who presented with a chief concern of nonbloody diarrhea for less than 48 hours and who were older than 14 years and younger than 66 years (Figure 1). We excluded patients who were pregnant or lactating, reported taking an antidiarrheal or antimicrobial medication during the previous 48 hours, were allergic to aspirin, or had previously enrolled in the study. To facilitate patient follow-up, we enrolled only the first eligible, consenting patient in each clinic each day.

Figure 1.
Flow of Participants Through the Study

Patients could report multiple exclusion criteria.

Staff from Health-Oriented Preventive Education, a Karachi-based nongovernmental organization that provides health care, education, and advocacy for low-resource individuals in Pakistan, performed all nonlaboratory field work.

Ethics

Although study physicians were instructed not to provide participants with antibiotics at enrollment, participants received oral rehydration solution and were encouraged to seek care if their condition worsened. Study staff were also instructed to refer participants for additional care if they reported feeling worse during follow-up interviews. Participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. The study protocol and data collection instruments were approved by the institutional review boards of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Health-Oriented Preventive Education. This article follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline for randomized trials.

### Diarrhoea in adults (acute) [^aff905ff]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 4000 million cases of diarrhoea occurred worldwide in 1996, resulting in 2.5 million deaths.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute diarrhoea in adults living in resource-rich countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries traveling to resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute severe diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 71 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antimotility agents, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, diet, intravenous rehydration, nasogastric tube rehydration, and oral rehydration solutions (amino acid oral rehydration solution, bicarbonate oral rehydration solution, reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution, rice-based oral rehydration solution, standard oral rehydration solution).

Illness Severity, Antibiotic Use, and Economic Effects During Follow-up by Study Group

Abbreviation: IQR, interquartile range.

Similar proportions of participants in each group sought care; physicians predominated as the type of practitioner (Table 3). Sixteen participants were hospitalized (6 of 220 [3%] in the BSS group and 10 of 219 [5%] in the placebo group); none died. Intravenous rehydration occurred about half as often during follow-up among those in the BSS group (14 of 220 vs 27 of 219 patients; OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25–0.95). We did not detect a difference between groups in time to first formed stool or to last diarrheal stool (Figure 2), nor did we measure differences in the proportion of patients with any formed stool, diarrheal stool, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain at 24 or 48 hours after enrollment. Similarly, the median cumulative reported number of diarrheal stools did not differ between groups at 24, 48, or 120 hours after enrollment. Participants in the BSS group tended to use additional medications less frequently than did controls, although the difference was not statistically significant (32 of 220 vs 44 of 219 patients; OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41–1.12); antidiarrheals were the most commonly used medication in both groups (Table 3).

Figure 2.
Kaplan-Meier Curves for Time to Last Diarrheal Stool and Time to First Formed Stool by Study Group

Approximately half the participants in each group missed work during follow-up; the median duration of missed work was significantly greater in the placebo group (median [interquartile range] days missed, 1 [0–1] vs 0 [0–1] for the BSS group; P = 0.04) (Table 3). Although the difference was not statistically significant, those in the BSS group tended to report ability to participate in "all normal activities" more frequently than those in the placebo group during the first and second 24 hours after enrollment. Medical expenditures tended to be higher and occur among more controls compared with those in the BSS group, although the result was not statistically significant (Table 3).

Pathogens Cultured From Stool Specimens Collected at Enrollment by Study Group

During 5 days of follow-up, 54 of the 439 participants (12%) used antibiotics (Table 3). Odds of any systemic antibiotic use were significantly lower in the BSS group (20 of 220 vs 34 of 219 patients; odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30–0.98), as were odds of fluoroquinolone use (8 of 220 vs 20 of 219 patients; OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16–0.88). All antibiotic use was reported to have followed consultation with a physician; none of 8 participants who consulted only a pharmacist received an antibiotic prescription. Of 76 participants who consulted a physician, 54 (71%) received antibiotics. Treated patients in each group received a median (range) of 2 (1–3) different antibiotic drugs and 24 (44%) received at least 1 antibiotic intravenously. Participants in both groups rarely perceived a need for antibiotics during follow-up: among the 54 participants who received antibiotics, 4 (7%) felt they needed them. Odds of antibiotic use were lower in the BSS group than in the placebo group when any pathogen was isolated from the enrollment stool culture (5 of 37 vs 16 of 43 patients; OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09–0.81), and tended to be lower when toxigenic Vibrio cholerae was isolated, although the difference was not statistically significant (0 of 2 vs 6 of 7 patients; P = 0.08). Among the 21 culture-positive participants who were treated, 7 (33%) were given an antibiotic to which their isolate displayed resistance. Among the 54 patients who took antibiotics, 47 enrollment stool cultures (87%) yielded either no pathogens or pathogens resistant to the consumed antibiotic.

Treatment: There is no specific antidote for salicylate poisoning. If there are no contraindications, vomiting should be induced as soon as possible with syrup of ipecac, or gastric lavage should be instituted, provided that no more than one hour has elapsed since ingestion. Activated charcoal and a cathartic may be administered as primary decontamination therapy in those cases where greater than one hour has elapsed since ingestion, or to further decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract in those who have already received ipecac or gastric lavage. Plasma salicylate levels may be useful; a common nomogram can be used to help predict the severity of intoxication. Supportive and symptomatic treatment should be provided, with emphasis on correcting fluid, electrolyte, blood glucose, and acid-base disturbances. Elimination may be enhanced by urinary alkalinization, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion. Since hemodialysis aids in correcting acid-base disturbances, this method may be preferred over hemoperfusion.

Metronidazole: Symptoms of metronidazole toxicity include nausea, vomiting, and neurotoxic effects such as ataxia, seizures and peripheral neuropathy.

Treatment: There is no specific antidote for metronidazole overdose. Management of the patient should consist of symptomatic and supportive therapy. Metronidazole is dialyzable.

Tetracycline: Therapeutic and overdose quantities of tetracycline can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Treatment: There is no specific antidote for tetracycline overdose. Management of the patient should consist of symptomatic and supportive therapy. Tetracycline is not dialyzable.

### Diarrhoea in adults (acute) [^c7e37af3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 4.6 billion cases of diarrhoea occurred worldwide in 2004, resulting in 2.2 million deaths.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute diarrhoea in adults living in resource-rich countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries travelling to resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute severe diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 72 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antimotility agents, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, diet, intravenous rehydration, nasogastric tube rehydration, oral rehydration solutions (amino acid oral rehydration solution, bicarbonate oral rehydration solution, reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution, rice-based oral rehydration solution, standard oral rehydration solution), vitamin A supplementation, and zinc supplementation.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^971ee690]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization has declared antimicrobial resistance a global crisis. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, an important driver of antibiotic resistance, is common globally. Although acute respiratory infections are the primary condition for which antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately in the United States, globally, many of the estimated 4.5 billion annual episodes of diarrhea are inappropriately treated with antibiotics. In South Asia, most ambulatory patients with acute diarrhea may be treated with antibiotics, often in conflict with national practice guidelines, and the prevalence of multidrug resistance among enteric pathogens is high. Antibiotic resistance can lead to treatment dilemmas and increased morbidity and mortality among infected populations and rapidly spread worldwide through globalized markets and frequent international travel.,

Optimization of antibiotic use is a primary strategy in the global action plan on antibiotic resistance; however, traditional stewardship efforts have had limited success. Evidence suggests that patients and health care professionals can be redirected toward nonantibiotic medications to satisfy the desire to actively treat the illness, relieve symptoms, and permit the patient to return to work and other activities sooner. For example, among children given oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea, adding zinc to the treatment regimen led to decreased antibiotic use. Because many adult patients with diarrhea in Pakistan are treated with antibiotics, but zinc is not indicated for adult patients with diarrhea, other nonantibiotic medications that relieve symptoms may help reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), a generic, nonprescription antidiarrheal with mild, local antimicrobial activity, can reduce the duration of gastrointestinal symptoms among children and adults with diarrhea. We studied the effect of BSS on use of systemic antibiotics for acute diarrhea among adult outpatients in Pakistan.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^6fe5900e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — non-antibiotic therapies for acute diarrheal infections in adults — medical treatment is not required in patients with non-severe, non-cholera-like diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylates (BSSs) can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild to moderate illness. (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence) BSS will reduce the stools passed by ~40% and the recommended dose of BSS for therapy of acute diarrhea is 30 mL (525 mg) of liquid formulation or two tablets (263 mg per tablet) chewed well each 30–60 min not to exceed eight doses in 24 h. The major antimotility drugs used for therapy of acute diarrhea are loperamide and diphenoxylate. Of these, the most useful drug is loperamide, which has less central opiate effects. In patients receiving antibiotics for TD, adjunctive loperamide therapy can be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. (Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence) The recommended dose of loperamide for therapy for adults with diarrhea is 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after subsequently.

### Travellers' diarrhoea [^d56556a1]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is estimated that approximately 30% to 70% of international travellers will develop diarrhoea during their travels or after returning home.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries travelling to resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

### Drug prophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea [^d5476105]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Travelers' diarrhea is the most common health impairment in persons visiting developing countries, affecting 20% to > 50% of tourists. Although it is usually benign, travelers' diarrhea represents a considerable socioeconomic burden for both the traveler and the host country. The most common enteropathogens are enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. Travelers' compliance with dietary precautionary measures is poor. Despite the excellent protection rates provided by antibiotics, routine administration of prophylaxis is currently not recommended because of potential adverse reactions. Of the various antibiotics that have been tested, quinolones are considered to be the first choice worldwide; however, quinolone-resistant pathogens are increasingly being isolated. Because it is frequently administered and provides only moderate protection, bismuth subsalicylate is not considered a recommendable option for prophylaxis in Europe, where it is rarely available anyhow. To date, no probiotic has been able to demonstrate clinically relevant protection worldwide. In conclusion, there is no satisfactory prophylactic option, and worldwide monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the search for novel antimicrobial agents, such as nonabsorbed antibiotics, and nonantibiotic medications should continue.

Ancillary management — antimotility, antinausea, and antiemetic agents: Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate); loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). An antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate). During acute gastroenteritis, more children receiving ondansetron, compared with placebo, had resolution of vomiting and ondansetron reduced the immediate need for hospitalization or intravenous rehydration; however, ondansetron did not decrease hospitalization rates at 72 hours after discharge and diarrhea was reported as a side effect. A recommendation cannot be made for the routine use of antiemetic agents for acute gastroenteritis in children < 4 years of age or in adults; bismuth subsalicylate is mildly effective, and racecadotril reduces stool volume but is not available in North America.

Travel and breastfeeding — travelers' diarrhea (TD) treatment — exclusive breastfeeding helps protect children against TD and breastfeeding is ideal rehydration therapy; children suspected of having TD should breastfeed more frequently and should not be offered other fluids or foods that replace breastfeeding, and breastfeeding travelers with TD should continue breastfeeding if possible and increase their own fluid intake, with evidence lacking that any TD pathogen can pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding travelers should avoid bismuth subsalicylate compounds in over-the-counter antidiarrheals, fluoroquinolones and macrolides are excreted in breast milk and clinicians should consult the breastfed child's primary healthcare professional before deciding which antibiotics to prescribe; most experts consider the short-term use of azithromycin compatible with breastfeeding, loperamide is another preferred antidiarrheal medication to use while breastfeeding, and use of oral rehydration salts is fully compatible with breastfeeding.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^ee826b6d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

More rapid tapers might be needed for patient safety under certain circumstances (e.g. for patients who have experienced overdose on their current dosage). However, unless there are indications of a life-threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose, opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages. Sudden discontinuation might precipitate substantial opioid withdrawal. Rapid tapering or sudden discontinuation of opioids in physically dependent patients also can increase risks for psychological distress and opioid-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Ultrarapid detoxification under anesthesia is associated with substantial risks, including death, and should not be used.

Management of Opioid Withdrawal During Tapering

The first approach to withdrawal symptoms and signs should generally be consideration of slowing or pausing the taper rate. If needed, short-term oral medications might also help manage withdrawal symptoms. These include alpha-2 agonists for the management of autonomic signs and symptoms (e.g. sweating and tachycardia). Alpha-2 agonists clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo in reducing severity of withdrawal from heroin or methadone in the context of abrupt (not gradual) discontinuation. Similar research could not be found on clonidine and lofexidine in patients tapering from long-term opioid treatment for pain; however, alpha-2 agonist tizanidine has been used to help taper patients from long-term, high-dosage opioids for chronic pain. Other medications addressing specific symptoms (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or topical menthol or methyl salicylate for muscle aches; trazodone for sleep disturbance; prochlorperazine, promethazine, or ondansetron for nausea; dicyclomine for abdominal cramping; and loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate for diarrhea) also have been used.

### Travelers' diarrhea: antimicrobial therapy and chemoprevention [^72aa115c]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The use of preventive measures and self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea is routine in regions where the occurrence of diarrhea is predictably high. People traveling to these areas who do not exercise care in their selection of consumed foods and beverages will suffer high rates of illness. Such diarrhea normally affects the traveler for a day, although it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Although systemic antibacterial drugs are effective in preventing diarrhea, their use is not routinely recommended because of side effects and their importance as a therapy for extra-intestinal infections. This review focuses on current and future uses of antibacterial drugs in the prevention and therapy of travelers' diarrhea. Minimally absorbed (< 0.4%) rifaximin can effectively reduce the occurrence of travelers' diarrhea without side effects. Bismuth subsalicylate is a useful alternative, although it is less effective than rifaximin for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea and the required doses are less convenient. All people who travel to high-risk areas should take curative antimicrobial agents with them for self-treatment of illness: rifaximin 200 mg three times a day for 3 days, or an absorbable agent such as a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin taken in a single dose initially, with the need for a second or third dose determined by clinical response. Loperamide (up to 8 mg per day for ≤ 2 days) can be given with the antibiotic to offer rapid symptomatic improvement. In the future, the ability to evaluate the genetic risk of illness acquisition might allow person-specific recommendations to be made.

### Microscopic colitis [^c23de4a1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis is a condition that is clinically underrecognized as a cause of chronic or intermittent diarrhea and can be diagnosed only by mucosal biopsy. Microscopic colitis is more common in middle-age to elderly women, appears to be induced by some medications, particularly nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and has been associated with autoimmune conditions and sprue. Symptomatic treatment includes cholestyramine and antidiarrheal medications. Bismuth subsalicylate, and 5-amniosalicylates are therapeutic options; however, budesonide is more effective in achieving clinical and histologic improvement and/or remission and has been studied in more randomized trials. Use of immune modulators should be restricted to more severe cases that are steroid refractory or steroid dependent. Surgical intervention should be reserved for a very highly select group of refractory cases. Diverting ileostomy or colectomy appear to be equally effective surgical alternatives for microscopic colitis, which is not a risk factor for carcinoma.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate on gastrointestinal tolerability in healthy volunteers receiving oral delayed-release dimethyl fumarate: PREVENT, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^34330b18]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Flushing and gastrointestinal (GI) events are commonly associated with the use of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis.

Methods

PREVENT (A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Pepto-Bismol [Bismuth Subsalicylate] on Gastrointestinal Tolerability in Healthy Volunteers Receiving Oral TECFIDERA [Dimethyl Fumarate] Delayed-Release Capsules Twice Daily) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week study that evaluated the effect of bismuth subsalicylate on DMF-related GI events. Bismuth subsalicylate 524 mg or placebo were administered 30 min before DMF (weeks 1–4). DMF was dosed twice-daily (BID) at 120 mg (week 1) and 240 mg (weeks 2–8). Using an e-diary device, participants recorded GI and flushing events on the Modified Overall Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale once daily for the preceding 24 h. The primary end point was time to first GI-related event. Secondary end points included frequency and severity of GI-related events.

Findings

A total of 175 participants were enrolled (placebo, n = 87; bismuth subsalicylate, n = 88), and 17 discontinued treatment (placebo, n = 8; bismuth subsalicylate n = 9). A total of 146 participants reported ≥ 1 GI event: placebo, n = 72 (82.8%); and bismuth subsalicylate, n = 74 (84.1%). There was no statistical difference in risk of a GI event between the groups (P = 0.8292). Mean (SD) time from DMF initiation to first GI event was similar: placebo, 5.4 (8.73) days; and bismuth subsalicylate, 5.6 (10.87) days. Incidence of flatulence (38.6% vs 50.6%) and diarrhea (36.4% vs 48.2%) during weeks 1–4 was numerically lower in the bismuth subsalicylate group compared with the placebo group. Mean worst severity scores for flatulence (1.1 vs 1.8; P = 0.0219) and diarrhea (1.0 vs 1.6; P = 0.0500) were lower with bismuth subsalicylate than with placebo.

Implications

Although coadministration of bismuth subsalicylate did not affect the occurrence of DMF-related GI events overall, it reduced the severity and incidence of flatulence and diarrhea. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01915901.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^85de4932]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines for Managing Substance Withdrawal in Jails — alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (second-line treatment) for opioid withdrawal: Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label use of clonidine) can be used to treat withdrawal when patients choose to taper off buprenorphine or methadone, and in preparation for initiation of extended-release naltrexone. These medications are a second-line option, because they do not relieve opioid withdrawal symptoms as effectively as buprenorphine and methadone and can cause low blood pressure, the risk of which is increased when patients are not adequately hydrated, and there can be dangerous elevations in blood pressure when this medication is stopped in patients with existing hypertension. When used, these medications are often combined with other medications targeting specific opioid withdrawal symptoms, such as benzodiazepines for anxiety, loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate for diarrhea, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for pain, various medications for insomnia, and ondansetron for nausea. Lofexidine or clonidine may also be appropriate to manage opioid withdrawal in the rare situations where complete opioid withdrawal management is clinically indicated, including when the patient declines treatment with buprenorphine or methadone.

### Update in traveler's diarrhea [^d2fbc8b7]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

TD has not proved as preventable as hoped, despite knowing that it is transmitted mainly through food. Travelers have little ability to select restaurants based on the kitchen hygiene. The rates of TD in travelers to developing countries have not changed in the past 50 years, either because the dietary precautions they are taught are not effective or they cannot be adhered to in the course of a pleasurable vacation. Nonantibiotic prophylaxis with bismuth subsalicylate has the potential to prevent 40% to 60% of TD episodes in short-term travelers, and is probably underused. Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent up to 90% of infections, but is not routinely recommended. Empiric treatment of TD has been the best approach to dealing with this problem, but its usefulness is being undermined by growing antibiotic resistance in many parts of the world. Fluoroquinolones are still the most useful agents where Campylobacter is not a predominant pathogen. Rifaximin may prove to be a useful addition to the options for treatment and prophylaxis. If used for treatment, it may require a backup antibiotic in areas where Campylobacter and Shigella are prominent pathogens.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^1ace2b3f]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

b. Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is a combination of three antimicrobial agents: bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline hydrochloride. Clinical trials using this combination have demonstrated H. pylori eradication in up to 82% of patients with a duodenal ulcer. Please note: bismuth subsalicylate is used in this combination for its antimicrobial properties and not for symptomatic relief of upset stomach.

c. Clinical data show that eradication of H. pylori is directly related to compliance. This therapy has been designed to enhance compliance and contains 14 blister cards, one for each day of the 14-day treatment plan, with each card divided into the 4 daily doses. The therapy also contains a patient-oriented information booklet and patient reminders.

3. Who should not take Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules?

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in the following patient populations:

a. Pregnant women. Advise pregnant women that Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules can cause fetal harm due to the tetracycline it contains. Tetracycline use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray brown) and may inhibit bone development.

### Interventions for treating collagenous colitis [^7a5dcc7e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Collagenous colitis is a cause of chronic diarrhea. This updated review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been assessed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the benefits and harms of treatments for collagenous colitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to 7 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing a therapy with placebo or active comparator for the treatment of active or quiescent collagenous colitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two authors. The primary outcome was clinical response or maintenance of response as defined by the included studies. Secondary outcome measures included histological response, quality of life and the occurrence of adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess bias. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Twelve RCTs (476 participants) were included. These studies assessed bismuth subsalicylate, Boswellia serrata extract, mesalamine, cholestyramine, probiotics, prednisolone and budesonide therapy. Four studies were low risk of bias. One study assessing mesalamine and cholestyramine was judged to be high risk of bias due to no blinding. The other studies had an unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation (five studies) allocation concealment (six studies), blinding (one study), incomplete outcome data (one study) and selective outcome reporting (one study). Clinical response occurred in 100% (4/4) of patients who received bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks) compared to 0% (0/5) of patients who received placebo (1 study; 9 participants; RR 10.80, 95% CI 0.75 to 155.93; GRADE = very low). Clinical response occurred in 44% (7/16) of patients who received Boswellia serrata extract (three 400 mg/day capsules for 8 weeks) compared to 27% (4/15) of patients who received placebo (1 study; 31 participants; RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.49; GRADE = low). Clinical response occurred in 80% (24/30) of budesonide patients compared to 44% (11/25) of mesalamine patients (1 study; 55 participants; RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.93; GRADE = low). Histological response was observed in 87% (26/30) of budesonide patients compared to 44% (11/25) of mesalamine patients (1 study, 55 participants; RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.13; GRADE = low). There was no difference between the two treatments with respect to adverse events (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.10; GRADE = low), withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.65; GRADE = low) and serious adverse events (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.21; GRADE = low). Clinical response occurred in 44% (11/25) of mesalamine patients (3 g/day) compared to 59% (22/37) of placebo patients (1 study; 62 participants; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.24; GRADE = low). Histological response was observed in 44% (11/25) and 51% (19/37) of patients receiving mesalamine and placebo, respectively (1 study; 62 participants; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.47; GRADE = low). There was no difference between the two treatments with respect to adverse events (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.88; GRADE = low), withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 5.92, 95% CI 0.70 to 49.90; GRADE = low) and serious adverse events (RR 4.44, 95% CI 0.49 to 40.29; GRADE = low). Clinical response occurred in 63% (5/8) of prednisolone (50 mg/day for 2 weeks) patients compared to 0% (0/3) of placebo patients (1 study, 11 participants; RR 4.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 68.83; GRADE = very low). Clinical response occurred in 29% (6/21) of patients who received probiotics (2 capsules containing 0.5 × 10¹⁰ CFU each of L. acidophilus LA-5 and B. animalis subsp. lactis strain BB-12 twice daily for 12 weeks) compared to 13% (1/8) of placebo patients (1 study, 29 participants, RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.32 to 16.13; GRADE = very low). Clinical response occurred in 73% (8/11) of patients who received mesalamine (800 mg three times daily) compared to 100% (12/12) of patients who received mesalamine + cholestyramine (4 g daily) (1 study, 23 participants; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08; GRADE = very low). Clinical response occurred in 81% (38/47) of patients who received budesonide (9 mg daily in a tapering schedule for 6 to 8 weeks) compared to 17% (8/47) of placebo patients (3 studies; 94 participants; RR 4.56, 95% CI 2.43 to 8.55; GRADE = low). Histological response was higher in budesonide participants (72%, 34/47) compared to placebo (17%, 8/47) (RR 4.15, 95% CI 2.25 to 7.66; GRADE = low). Clinical response was maintained in 68% (57/84) of budesonide patients compared to 20% (18/88) of placebo patients (3 studies, 172 participants, RR 3.30 95% CI 2.13 to 5.09; GRADE = low). Histological response was maintained in 48% (19/40) of budesonide patients compared to 15% (6/40) of placebo patients (2 studies; 80 participants; RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.44 to 6.95; GRADE = very low). No difference was found between budesonide and placebo for adverse events (5 studies; 290 participants; RR 1.18, o95% CI 0.92 to 1.51; GRADE = low), withdrawals due to adverse events (5 studies, 290 participants; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.17; GRADE = very low) or serious adverse events (4 studies, 175 participants; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.15 to 8.01; GRADE = very low). Adverse effects reported in the budesonide studies include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, abdominal pain, excessive sweating and headache. Adverse effects reported in the mesalamine studies included nausea and skin rash. Adverse effects in the prednisolone study included abdominal pain, headache, sleep disturbance, mood change and weight gain.

Authors' Conclusions

Low quality evidence suggests that budesonide may be effective for inducing and maintaining clinical and histological response in patients with collagenous colitis. We are uncertain about the benefits and harms of therapy with bismuth subsalicylate, Boswellia serrata extract, mesalamine with or without cholestramine, prednisolone and probiotics. These agents and other therapies require further study.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^e8db1e40]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and

(2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Gastrointestinal infections in deployed forces in the middle east theater: an historical 60 year perspective [^04ca6792]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Although the antibiotic era was in its infancy during WWII, multiple antibiotics have now been demonstrated to be safe and effective in treating acute diarrhea in travelers (including military). Interestingly, despite effective treatment trials and several consensus guidelines on management utilizing antimicrobials,–current management of travelers' diarrhea in the deployed military setting leaves considerable room for improvement. A study early in OIF/OEF found that among the troops who sought care for diarrhea, a medication or treatment was only provided about 50–60% of the time. Loperamide was most often prescribed (37%), followed by antibiotics (27%) and bismuth subsalicylate. Oral rehydration was the only modality provided in 15% of cases. Corroborating these data, a survey of Army physician assistants reported that for clinical scenarios of moderate diarrhea, loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate was prescribed in 36% of patients, oral rehydration alone was provided in 27% of patients, combination antibiotic/loperamide therapy in 25%, and antibiotic alone in 11%. The reported use of antibiotics (alone or in combination with loperamide) was higher (18% and 45%, respectively) in patient scenarios of severe diarrhea. In a follow-on survey among a broader spectrum of provider type, similar knowledge, attitudes, and practices were noted. Although perhaps in the scenario of a mild case of diarrhea in a leisure traveler on vacation in a resort setting, management with fluid rehydration and loperamide may be appropriate, a soldier deployed to an austere tropical or desert climate under heavy body armor and physical activity, with fluid requirements often in excess of 16 L/day, even mild diarrhea should be managed aggressively to prevent unwanted morbidity associated with acute illness and dehydration.

### Interventions for treating lymphocytic colitis [^33ad4fc1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphocytic colitis is a cause of chronic diarrhea. It is a subtype of microscopic colitis characterized by chronic, watery, non-bloody diarrhea and normal endoscopic and radiologic findings. The etiology of this disorder is unknown. Therapy is based mainly on case series and uncontrolled trials, or by extrapolation of data for treating collagenous colitis, a related disorder. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments for clinically active lymphocytic colitis.

Search Methods

The MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to 11 August 2016 to identify relevant papers. Manual searches from the references of included studies and relevant review articles were performed. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were also searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. The trial registry web site www. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify registered but unpublished trials. Finally, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials assessing medical therapy for patients with biopsy-proven lymphocytic colitis were considered for inclusion DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was independently extracted by at least two authors. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The primary outcome was clinical response as defined by the included studies. Secondary outcome measures included histological response as defined by the included studies, quality of life as measured by a validated instrument and the occurrence of adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Data were combined for analysis if they assessed the same treatments. Dichotomous data were combined using a pooled RR along with corresponding 95% CI. A fixed-effect model was used for the pooled analysis.

Main Results

Five RCTs (149 participants) met the inclusion criteria. These studies assessed bismuth subsalicylate versus placebo, budesonide versus placebo, mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine. The study which assessed mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and the study which assessed beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The study which compared bismuth subsalicylate versus us placebo was judged as low quality due to a very small sample size and limited data. The other 3 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Budesonide (9 mg/day for 6 to 8 weeks) was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical and histological response. Clinical response was noted in 88% of budesonide patients compared to 38% of placebo patients (2 studies; 57 participants; RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.33; GRADE = low). Histological response was noted in 78% of budesonide patients compared to 33% of placebo patients (2 studies; 39 patients; RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 5.28; GRADE = low). Forty-one patients were enrolled in the study assessing mesalazine (2.4 g/day) versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine (4 g/day). Clinical response was noted in 85% of patients in the mesalazine group compared to 86% of patients in the mesalazine plus cholestyramine group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.28; GRADE = low). Five patients were enrolled in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks versus placebo). There were no differences in clinical (P = 0.10) or histological responses (P = 0.71) in patients treated with bismuth subsalicylate compared with placebo (GRADE = very low). Forty-six patients were enrolled in the trial studying beclometasone dipropionate (5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) versus mesalazine (2.4 g/day). There were no differences in clinical remission at 8 weeks (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.24; GRADE = low) and 12 months of treatment (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.40 to 4.18; GRADE = very low). Although patients receiving beclometasone dipropionate (84%) and mesalazine (86%) achieved clinical remission at 8 weeks, it was not maintained at 12 months (26% and 20%, respectively). Adverse events reported in the budesonide studies include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis and headache. Nausea and skin rash were reported as adverse events in the mesalazine study. Adverse events in the beclometasone dipropionate trial include nausea, sleepiness and change of mood. No adverse events were reported in the bismuth subsalicylate study.

Authors' Conclusions

Low quality evidence suggests that budesonide may be effective for the treatment of active lymphocytic colitis. This benefit needs to be confirmed by a large placebo -controlled trial. Low quality evidence also suggests that mesalazine with or without cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate may be effective for the treatment of lymphocytic colitis, however this needs to be confirmed by large placebo-controlled studies. No conclusions can be made regarding bismuth subsalicylate due to the very small number of patients in the study, Further trials studying interventions for lymphocytic colitis are warranted.

### Interventions for treating collagenous colitis [^d10bd695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Collagenous colitis is a disorder that is recognized as a cause of chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been proven in randomized trials.

Objectives

To determine effective treatments for patients with clinically active collagenous colitis.

Search Strategy

Relevant papers published between 1970 and October 2002 were identified via the MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.

Selection Criteria

Four randomized trials were identified. One trial studied bismuth subsalicylate (published in abstract form only), and 3 trials (1 published in abstract form only) studied budesonide in the therapy of collagenous colitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by each author onto 2×2 tables (treatment versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, p-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition.

Main Results

There were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Those randomized to active drug were more likely to have clinical (p = 0.003) and histological (p = 0.003) improvement than those assigned to placebo. A total of 94 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide (9 mg daily for 6 to 8 weeks). The pooled odds ratio for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 12.32 (95% CI 5.53–27.46), with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. There was significant histological improvement with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Budesonide is effective in the treatment of collagenous colitis. The evidence for bismuth subsalicylate is weaker, but still important. The roles of these and other therapies in inducing or maintaining remission (as opposed to clinical or histological improvement) of collagenous colitis are unknown.

### Interventions for treating lymphocytic colitis [^b6448a82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphocytic colitis is a cause of chronic diarrhea. Therapy is based mainly on case series and uncontrolled trials, or by extrapolation of data for treating collagenous colitis, a related disorder. This review was performed to identify therapies for lymphocytic colitis that have been proven in randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To determine effective treatments for patients with clinically active lymphocytic colitis.

Search Strategy

The MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched using the search criteria "microscopic colitis" or "lymphocytic colitis" and "treatment" or "therapy" or "management" to identify relevant papers published between 1970 and September 2006. Manual searches from the references of identified papers and relevant review papers were performed. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register was searched for other studies.

Selection Criteria

A single randomized trial published in abstract form only which studied bismuth subsalicylate was identified, and included only 5 patients with lymphocytic colitis (and 9 with collagenous colitis).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by each author onto 2×2 tables (treatment versus placebo and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, P values were derived using the chi-square test.

Main Results

There were 5 patients with lymphocytic colitis in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks vs. placebo). Although all three patients on active drug experienced clinical improvement compared to none of the placebo group, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical (P = 0.10) or histological (P = 0.71) improvement.

Authors' Conclusions

A single trial studying bismuth subsalicylate as therapy for lymphocytic colitis suggests that it may be beneficial. However, it included only 5 patients and no firm conclusions can be made from such a small trial. Larger trials studying treatments for lymphocytic colitis are warranted.

### Nonantimicrobial agents in the prevention and treatment of traveler's diarrhea [^243759e7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Among the nonantimicrobial agents that are available and useful for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea are bismuth subsalicylate-containing preparations, which can provide a rate of protection of up to 65% when taken 4 times daily. In one study, the probiotic Lactobacillus GG was found to provide 49% protection against traveler's diarrhea, but results with this agent and other probiotics have been highly variable and geographically inconsistent. Tannin albuminate plus ethacridine lactate provided 36% protection, but it is not widely available. Among the nonantimicrobial agents that are available and useful for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea are bismuth subsalicylate-containing preparations, which reduce the passage of loose stools by 16%-18%. The antisecretory and antimotility agent loperamide reduces the passage of loose stools by approximately 50% and has been especially useful, in combination with antimicrobial agents, in reducing the total duration of posttreatment diarrhea to a matter of hours.

b. Nursing women. Advise women to avoid feeding their infants with their milk during Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules therapy. Women should either discontinue feeding or pump and discard their milk during treatment and for 24 hours after the last dose.

c. Pediatric patients.

d. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

e. Patients with known hypersensitivity to bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives, or any of the tetracyclines; this product does not contain aspirin, but should not be administered to those patients who have a known allergy to aspirin or salicylates.

f. Patients with evidence of, or a history of, blood dyscrasias.

g. Administer with caution in patients with central nervous system diseases.

h. Administer with caution in elderly patients who may suffer from asymptomatic renal and hepatic dysfunction.

4. How should my patient take Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules?

The medicines in this therapy have been demonstrated to treat the infection in the majority of cases when taken correctly. Treating the infection is important to reduce the risk of the ulcer coming back. (It may be useful to open the therapy and explain dosing while showing the patient one of the dosing blister cards.) Patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^8cc2f5bc]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Tetracycline is present in human milk at concentrations similar to maternal serum levels; however, it binds with calcium in human milk. Data indicate that oral absorption of tetracycline in infants is low due to the calcium binding in human milk. It is not known whether bismuth subsalicyate is excreted in human milk.

Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules in pediatric patients infected with H. pylori have not been established.

Tetracycline use in children may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules should not be used in children up to 8 years of age (see WARNINGS).

Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, elderly patients may have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant diseases or other drug therapies. Bismuth subsalicylate, a component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules, is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, additional monitoring may be required (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Renal Impairment: The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in plasma. Use Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Structure of the active pharmaceutical ingredient bismuth subsalicylate [^a8c84d13]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The physical, chemical and therapeutic properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are governed by their molecular structures and intermolecular interactions. Many APIs are crystalline substances, with periodic arrangements of their constituent molecules or ions. The specific arrangement of molecules and their intermolecular interactions affect stability and solubility, which in turn influences bioavailability, efficacy, and dosage. Therefore, determining the structures of pharmaceutical compounds is an integral part of drug formulation. Traditionally the method of choice for crystal structure determination has been single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). However, the technique requires large specimens and is not readily applicable for submicrometer-sized crystals. While structure determination of small crystallites can often be performed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), the technique can at times struggle with complicated and disordered structures.

These reasons among others have previously prevented the structure determination of the API bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), a crystalline compound made from Bi³⁺ cations, O²⁻ anions, and salicylate anions (Hsal⁻, Fig. 1a). It is administered in its crystalline state and is the API of popular over-the-counter medications such as Pepto-Bismol, commonly used to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as dyspepsia and diarrhoea. Numerous studies have confirmed the efficacy of BSS as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antacid agent –. Antimicrobial properties of several other bismuth compounds such as bismuth subgallate, bismuth subnitrate, and colloidal bismuth tartrate have been reported, and specifically, it has been demonstrated that colloidal bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate can even combat antibiotic resistance in bacteriaand suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication.

### Integrated safety profile of selinexor in multiple myeloma: experience from 437 patients enrolled in clinical trials [^0b5b5641]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal AEs, in particular N/V, are the most common nonhematological side effects of selinexor treatment and require prophylactic supportive care and additional on study management to limit duration and severity. The median onset of N/V occurred at day 3, suggesting delayed emesis, which should be properly managed. Previous studies have suggested that selinexor-induced N/V is likely mediated through the central nervous system, as selinexor crosses the blood brain barrier and has anticancer activity in the brain. Prophylactic use of a 5-HT₃ RAs (ondansetron or equivalent) in all patients, was mandated on selinexor trials after phase 1 to reduce N/V. The use of a second antiemetic, such as 2.5–10 mg olanzapine in the evening and/or NK₁-RAs should be strongly considered prior to the first day of therapy. Additional antinausea medications may be required for patients who experience on study gastrointestinal AEs, and the data shown here suggest that NK1-RAs, benzodiazepines, and cannabinoid-RAs were effective at mitigating treatment-emergent N/V. As suggested by the association data, several AEs are linked to N/V, including decreased appetite, weight loss, hyponatremia, and fatigue, suggesting that management of N/V may limit the incidence of these AEs. Diarrhea was less common in the study population and was generally responsive to loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate.

### Diagnosis and management of microscopic colitis syndrome [^e9e4bd51]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis syndrome consists of chronic watery diarrhea, a normal or near-normal gross appearance of the colonic mucosa, and a specific histologic picture described as either lymphocytic colitis or collagenous colitis. The cause of microscopic colitis is unknown, but recent work suggests some immunologic similarities to celiac disease, suggesting that luminal antigens may be important in its pathogenesis. Diarrhea in microscopic colitis seems to be directly related to the extent of inflammation, suggesting that inflammatory mediators are responsible for reduced water absorption by the colon. Microscopic colitis is a frequent diagnosis in patients with chronic diarrhea seen at referral centers. It is often associated with other immune-mediated conditions and frequently is complicated by fecal incontinence. The differential diagnosis is broad, comprising all causes of watery diarrhea. Evaluation is straightforward with the key aspect being review of colon biopsy specimens by an experienced pathologist. Treatment is still being defined: symptomatic management with antidiarrheal agents, 5-aminosalicylate drugs, corticosteroids, especially budesonide, bile acid-binding resins, and bismuth subsalicylate all can be effective. The prognosis is good with no evidence of conversion to classic inflammatory bowel disease or of development of neoplasia over time.

### Modern concepts of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^df1ebd6f]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

MANAGEMENT OF MICROBIAL OVERGROWTH

The most important consideration when planning the management of microbial overgrowth is to assess the patient. Is the patient constipated or presenting with diarrhea? Is there a history of pancreatic disease, inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal surgery, autoimmune disease, or immunodeficiency? It is also necessary to get a history of current medication use. Table 2 can be used as a guide to think about the differential diagnosis. Knowing the cause of overgrowth has an impact on the approach to management. For example if a patient has an intestinal adhesion, while antibiotics may benefit temporarily, fixing the adhesion would be curative. Correcting the underlying cause will make treatment easier.

The primary treatment that has been used over the decades for microbial overgrowth is antibiotic therapy. We now know that antibiotics frequently declared as highly useful for microbial overgrowth, such as metronidazole, have low efficacy for microbial overgrowth as a single agent. Conventional antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, tetracycline (or doxycycline), fluoroquinolones and rifaximin are better studied. In various studies, there has been relatively good equivalency between these options. However, given concerns about microbial resistance, rifaximin has become a preferred agent. A recent meta-analysis of rifaximin for the treatment of SIBO supports this use.

In the case of intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) things are even more complicated. Methanogens are not bacteria and in general antibiotics were designed for bacterial suppression. However, results of a double-blind study suggest that rifaximin in combination with neomycin was superior to neomycin alone in improving constipation and lowering methane. This has become a commonly used combination in practice.

It is less clear what options there are for hydrogen sulfide since the importance of this gas and its microbiome implications are a relatively new development. One study from the 1990s supports that hydrogen sulfide producing organisms are reduced by the use of bismuth subsalicylate. Although there is little data, some are using a combination of rifaximin and bismuth for this subset. A recent study combining rifaximin with N -acetylcysteine demonstrates promise in the treatment of IBS-D, as this combination was shown to reduce small bowel bacterial levels and normalize stool form in a rat model inoculated with C. jejuni CdtB.

### Interventions for treating collagenous colitis [^5a02359d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Collagenous colitis is a cause of chronic diarrhea. Treatment has been based mainly on anecdotal evidence. This review was performed to identify therapies for collagenous colitis that have been proven in randomized trials.

Objectives

To determine effective treatments for patients with collagenous colitis.

Search Strategy

Relevant papers published between 1970 and December 2007 were identified via the MEDLINE and PUBMED databases. Manual searches from the references of identified papers, as well as review papers on collagenous or microscopic colitis were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. Finally, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.

Selection Criteria

Ten randomized trials were identified. Seven of these compared active treatment to placebo for treating active disease. Of these, 1 trial studied bismuth subsalicylate, 1 trial studied Boswellia serrata extract, 3 trials studies budesonide, 1 trial studied prednisolone, and 1 trial studied probiotics. One trial compared mesalamine to mesalamine + cholestyramine for treating active disease. Two trials compared budesonide to placebo in maintaining response induced by budesonide.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment versus comparator and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, P-values were derived using the chi-square test. For therapies assessed in more than one trial, summary test statistics were derived using the Peto odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Data were combined for analysis only if the outcomes were sufficiently similar in definition.

Main Results

In treating active disease, there were 9 patients with collagenous colitis in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks). Clinical response occurred in 100% of patients who received bismuth subsalicylate compared to 0% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.03). Thirty-one patients were enrolled in the trial studying Boswellia serrata extract (three 400 mg capsules daily for 8 weeks). Clinical response occurred in 44% of patients who received Boswellia serrata extract compared to 27% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.32). A total of 94 patients were enrolled in 3 trials studying budesonide (9 mg daily or in a tapering schedule for 6 to 8 weeks). Clinical response occurred in 81% of patients who received budesonide compared to 17% of patients who received placebo (P < 0.00001). The pooled odds ratio for clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 12.32 (95% CI 5.53 to 27.46), with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. Statistically significant histological response occurred with treatment in all 3 trials studying budesonide therapy. Eleven patients were enrolled in the trial studying prednisolone (50 mg daily for 2 weeks). Clinical response occurred in 63% of patients who received prednisolone compared to 0% who received placebo (P = 0.15). Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in the trial studying probiotics (2 capsules containing 0.5 × 10¹⁰ CFU each of L. acidophilus LA-5 and B. animalis subsp. lactis strain BB-12 twice daily for 12 weeks). Clinical response occurred in 29% of patients who received probiotics compared to 13% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.38). Twenty-three patients were enrolled in the trial studying mesalamine (800 mg three times daily) with or without cholestyramine (4 g daily) for 6 months. Clinical response occurred in 73% of patients who received mesalamine alone compared to 100% of patients who received mesalamine + cholestyramine (P = 0.14). In maintaining response, 80 patients who had responded to open-label budesonide were enrolled in 2 trials studying budesonide (6 mg daily for 6 months). Clinical response was maintained in 83% of patients who received budesonide compared to 28% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.0002). The pooled odds ratio for maintenance of clinical response to treatment with budesonide was 8.40 (95% CI 2.73 to 25.81), with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. Histological response was maintained in 48% of patients who received budesonide compared to 15% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.002).

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide is effective for inducing and maintaining clinical and histological response in patients with collagenous colitis. The evidence for benefit with bismuth subsalicylate and for mesalamine with or without cholestyramine is weak. There is no evidence for the effectiveness of Boswellia serrata extract, prednisolone, or probiotics. These agents and other therapies require further study.

a. Oral contraceptives. As with many antibacterial preparations, concomitant use of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules may reduce the effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives; breakthrough bleeding may occur. Patients should be advised to use an additional or different form of contraception. Women who become pregnant while taking Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules should be advised to notify their prescriber immediately.

b. Anticoagulants. Individual components of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules have the potential to interact with anticoagulants. Monitoring anticoagulant therapy with appropriate adjustment of the anticoagulant dosage may be warranted if concurrent therapy is instituted. (See Package Insert.)

c. Lithium. In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term metronidazole therapy has been associated with elevation of serum lithium and, in a few cases, signs of lithium toxicity. Serum lithium and serum creatinine should be obtained several days after beginning metronidazole to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium toxicity.

d. Antidiabetic agents. There is a possible enhanced hypoglycemic effect when given with salicylates.

e. Cimetidine. The simultaneous administration of drugs that decrease microsomal liver enzyme activity, such as cimetidine, may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole.

### The efficacy and safety ofin addition to antofloxacin-based bismuth quadruple therapy foreradication: a single-center, prospective randomized-control study [^6745f64d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

At present, the eradication rate of H. pylori is mainly related to the increase in antibiotic resistance rate (20–50% for clarithromycin, 40–70% for metronidazole, and 20–50% for levofloxacin in China). Standard triple therapy for eradicating H. pylori does not meet clinical needs, and guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy as the initial treatment. In recent years, we have found that the use of antofloxacin-based bismuth quadruple therapy can effectively eradicate H. pylori, but the eradication rates of therapy have not achieved grade A eradication rate (eradication rate > 95%). However, some adverse reactions are inevitable in the course of treatment, such as diarrhea, epigastric pain, abdominal distention, dizzy, vomiting, and rash, which can reduce patient compliance to a certain extent.

Our study found that the addition of S. boulardii could significantly shorten the time of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Moreover, the incidence of diarrhea was reduced by 7% with S. boulardii plus antofloxacin-based bismuth quadruple therapy compared with antofloxacin-based bismuth quadruple therapy alone, although this reduction was not significant. The possible mechanisms of S. boulardii alleviating diarrhea are as follows: S. boulardii can be combined with the digestive tract mucosa epithelial cells to promote the reconstruction of the damaged epithelial cells and maintain the integrity of the gastrointestinal epithelial mucus layer. S. boulardii cell walls contain a glucan that stimulates the secretion of immunoglobulin IgA in the digestive mucosa, enhancing the mucosal barrier. S. boulardii can block or inhibit the nuclear transport of mitogen-activated protein kinase, Smad7, nuclear factor, and other signaling pathways, which reduce the synthesis of pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and inhibit the local mucosal inflammation caused by neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation. Furthermore, S. boulardii can help to restore the normal microbiome in patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea as modulators of the normal microbiome through colonization during the susceptibility period.

Do not administer methoxyflurane to patients taking Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules. The concurrent use of tetracycline hydrochloride, a component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules with methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Disulfiram

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks. Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who are using metronidazole, a component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules and disulfiram concurrently (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Alcohol

Alcoholic beverages or other products containing propylene glycol should not be consumed during and for at least 3 days after usage of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules. A disulfiram-like reaction (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing) may occur due to the interaction between alcohol or propylene glycol and metronidazole, a component of Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).

Renal Impairment

Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum concentrations of tetracyclines may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis.

Table 2
Data from four randomized, placebo-controlled trials of oral budesonide in collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis

The relapse rate is high after cessation of successful short-term budesonide therapy in CC, and 61–80% of treated patients will have an early recurrence of symptoms. In clinical practice tapering doses of budesonide to 3–6 mg/day have been used as maintenance therapy and may well control clinical symptoms. The evidence for such a strategy in CC now exists, and two studies have proven that maintenance therapy with budesonide 6 mg/day for six months is well tolerated and superior to placebo. A total of 80 patients, who had responded to open-label budesonide, were randomized to budesonide 6 mg daily or placebo for 6 months. Clinical response was maintained in 33/40 (83%) patients who received budesonide compared to 11/40 (28%) patients who received placebo (P = 0.0002). Pooled odds ratio for maintenance of clinical response with budesonide compared to placebo, was 8.40 (95% CI 2.73–25.81) with a number needed to treat of 2 patients. Histological response was seen in 48% of patients who received budesonide compared to 15% of patients who received placebo (P = 0.002). However, six-month maintenance therapy did not alter the subsequent disease course, as the relapse risk after withdrawal of 24-week maintenance treatment was similar to that observed after 6-week induction therapy, and the median time to relapse was equal in the two groups (39 days versus 38 days).

Prednisolone

Other oral corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, are associated with more frequent side effects, and the efficacy seems inferior to budesonide, although no formal comparative studies are available.

Bismuth subsalicylate

Bismuth subsalicylate has been shown effective in a small, placebo-controlled study including 9 patients with CC and 5 with LC. This drug is not available in a number of countries because of concerns regarding drug toxicity.

### Importation and domestic transmission of Shigella sonnei resistant to ciprofloxacin-United States, may 2014-February 2015 [^e2f994fe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

International travelers are at elevated risk for colonization with multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. This investigation suggests that ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei is being repeatedly introduced into the United States by travelers from various countries and can lead to large outbreaks domestically. The result has been a greater proportion of Shigella infections in the United States that are resistant to ciprofloxacin than in the past (National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System; Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases; National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC, unpublished data, 2015). Travelers should be encouraged to 1) observe food, water, and hand-hygiene precautions while traveling; 2) use over-the-counter medications like bismuth subsalicylate (e.g. Pepto-Bismol) or loperamide (e.g. Immodium) if they wish to treat mild or moderate travelers' diarrhea; 3) reserve antimicrobial medications for severe cases of travelers' diarrhea; 4) seek health care if they are experiencing diarrhea upon return to the United States or develop diarrhea shortly thereafter; and 5) remain vigilant regarding hygiene practices while ill. Additional studies are needed to clarify the roles of antimicrobial medications, antidiarrheal medications, and other factors in acquiring multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens during international travel.

Although this Shigella strain is strongly associated with international travel, it is now circulating domestically. If introduced to populations of homeless persons, MSM, or children in child care settings, Shigella can spread rapidly and cause large, protracted outbreaks, as has occurred in the homeless population in San Francisco.

Hygiene promotion and increased access to hygiene and sanitation infrastructure among vulnerable populations such as the homeless might help prevent transmission. MSM can reduce their risk for acquiring this and other Shigella strains by washing their hands meticulously and by preventing fecal-oral exposures during sex. Health care providers should culture the stool specimens of patients with symptoms consistent with shigellosis, reculture the stool of patients who fail to improve after antimicrobial therapy, and test bacterial pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibility. Reserving antimicrobial treatment for immunocompromised patients and patients with severe shigellosis and using antimicrobial susceptibility data strategically to guide therapy might help preserve the utility of such medications. Clinical guidelines for the testing and interpretation of azithromycin susceptibility among Shigella spp. are needed to improve detection and management of cases of azithromycin-nonsusceptible shigellosis.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of PYLERA did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, elderly patients may have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant diseases or other drug therapies. Bismuth subcitrate potassium, a component of PYLERA, is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, additional monitoring may be required [see Contraindications (4.4)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In patients with severe renal impairment, higher serum concentrations of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis [see Contraindications (4.4)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in plasma. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events. PYLERA is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Bismuth subsalicylate coagulopathy in a patient with chronic liver disease [^471da452]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) is the active ingredient in over-the-counter antacid and antidiarrheal medications. Coagulopathy in the setting of acetylsalicylic acid toxicity is well documented but not in setting of bismuth subsalicylate overuse. We present a case report of coagulopathy from BSS poisoning in a patient with underlying cirrhosis. The patient's high prothrombin time suggests inhibition of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The patient had decreased factor V activity, which is responsible for converting prothrombin to thrombin. Patients with cirrhosis often have hypoprothrombinemia which may be exacerbated by salicylate-induced coagulopathy. Given the widespread use of BSS products, physicians should recognize coagulopathy as a possible manifestation of toxicity especially in patients with underlying liver disease.

### Integrated safety profile of selinexor in multiple myeloma: experience from 437 patients enrolled in clinical trials [^54f126ee]. Leukemia (2020). Medium credibility.

Selinexor is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of the nuclear export protein exportin 1 with demonstrated activity in hematologic and solid malignancies. Side effects associated with selinexor include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and hyponatremia. We reviewed 437 patients with multiple myeloma treated with selinexor and assessed the kinetics of adverse events and impact of supportive care measures. Selinexor reduced both platelets and neutrophils over the first cycle of treatment and reached a nadir between 28 and 42 days. Platelet transfusions and thrombopoietin receptor agonists were effective at treating thrombocytopenia, and granulocyte colony stimulating factors were effective at resolving neutropenia. The onset of gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) was most common during the first 1–2 weeks of treatment. Nausea could be mitigated with 5-HT₃ antagonists and either neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, olanzapine, or cannbainoids. Loperamide and bismuth subsalicylate ameliorated diarrhea. The primary constitutional side effects of fatigue and decreased appetite could be managed with methylphenidate, megestrol, cannabinoids or olanzapine, respectively. Hyponatremia was highly responsive to sodium replacement. Selinexor has well-established adverse effects that mainly occur within the first 8 weeks of treatment, are reversible, and respond to supportive care.

Formulations of BSS were developed in 1900 to treat Campylobacter infections, a major cause of infant deaths at the time. Since the discovery in the 1980s by Nobel laureates Barry Marshal and Robin Warrenof Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium harboured by 60% of the global population, bismuth compounds, including BSS, have received renewed interest by effectively treating peptic ulcer disease. In 1990, a report from Procter & Gamble (P&G) estimated that over 10 billion doses of Pepto-Bismol had been consumed and that it was found in approximately 60% of U.S. households. In 2019, overall sales of > 20 million units grossed over $100 million in the U.S. alone, making it the most sold stomach remedy in the country. Despite its century-long history and continuing widespread use, the structure of BSS has remained unknown and only a limited understanding has been established of its mechanisms of action.

### Lymphocytic colitis: clinical features, treatment, and outcomes [^b631caba]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

There are no reports of the clinical features or treatment outcomes in large series of patients with lymphocytic colitis, and it is not known whether treatments that appear to be beneficial in patients with collagenous colitis are also beneficial in lymphocytic colitis. We sought to analyze these issues in our patients with lymphocytic colitis.

Methods

All patients with biopsy-proven lymphocytic colitis evaluated at our institution between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1999, were identified. Clinical features on presentation and treatment outcomes were abstracted from the medical records.

Results

A total of 170 patients with lymphocytic colitis were identified (median age 67 yr, 61% female). Diarrhea, bloating, rectal urgency, fecal incontinence, weight loss, concomitant autoimmune disorders, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were common. Loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, and bismuth subsalicylate were effective therapies and were well tolerated. However, no therapy produced a complete response in more than 40% of patients.

Conclusions

Lymphocytic colitis typically presents in elderly patients as chronic diarrhea. Nocturnal stools, urgency, and abdominal pain occur frequently, as do weight loss, fecal incontinence, and concomitant autoimmune disorders. Many empiric treatment options are used, but overall response rates are disappointing. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimum therapeutic approach to these patients.

### Apremilast for treatment of recalcitrant aphthous stomatitis [^3f7a0759]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Apremilast is an orally administered small molecule that specifically inhibits phosphodiesterase-4 and modulates the immune system by increasing the levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibiting interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-γ, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor production. It is US Food and Drug Administration approved for treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but has been used off label in treating various inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis, chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis, lichen planus, and Behçet disease. In a recent multicenter, placebo-controlled phase II study, apremilast was found to be effective in treating oral and genital ulcers of Behçet disease, with 71% of patients achieving complete clearance by week 12. Pentoxifylline, an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has been reported previously to be marginally effective in treating RAS as a second-line agent. However, to the best of our knowledge, treatment of RAS with apremilast has not been reported thus far. It appears to be an effective agent through reducing proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-23, and interferon-γ and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. Apremilast has shown a good safety profile with most frequent side effects being nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Cases of diarrhea and nausea occur in approximately 17% of patients and are generally mild to moderate in severity. The side effects usually begin during the first 2 weeks of apremilast treatment and resolve within 4 weeks. Treatment strategies include adequate hydration, taking medication with small and more frequent meals, and avoiding caffeine, dairy, and artificial sweeteners. Further options include bulk-forming agents, bismuth subsalicylate, and loperamide.

Our case shows a rapid and substantial response of recalcitrant aphthous lesions to apremilast. However, further studies are needed to prove its efficacy and safety.

### How to effectively use bismuth quadruple therapy: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^9ff09855]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Bismuth triple therapy was the first effective Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. The addition of a proton pump inhibitor helped overcome metronidazole resistance. Its primary indication is penicillin allergy or when clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance are both common. Resistance to the primary first-line therapy have centered on complexity and difficulties with compliance. Understanding regional differences in effectiveness remains unexplained because of the lack of studies including susceptibility testing and adherence data. We discuss regimen variations including substitutions of doxycycline, amoxicillin, and twice a day therapy and provide suggestions regarding what is needed to rationally and effectively use bismuth quadruple therapy.

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^b605b2aa]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics for Bismuth Subsalicylate Chewable Tablets/ Metronidazole Tablets/Tetracycline Hydrochloride Capsules components (bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, metronidazole tablets, and tetracycline hydrochloride capsules) when coadministered has not been studied. There is no information about the gastric mucosal concentrations of bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline after administration of these agents concomitantly or in combination with an acid suppressive agent. The systemic pharmacokinetic information presented below is based on studies in which each product was administered alone.

Bismuth Subsalicylate: Upon oral administration, bismuth subsalicylate is almost completely hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to bismuth and salicylic acid. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of bismuth subsalicylate following oral administration can be described by the individual pharmacokinetics of bismuth and salicylic acid.

Bismuth: Less than 1% of bismuth from oral doses of bismuth subsalicylate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the systemic circulation. Absorbed bismuth is distributed throughout the body. Bismuth is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 90%). Bismuth has multiple disposition half-lives with an intermediate half-life of 5 to 11 days and a terminal half-life of 21 to 72 days. Elimination of bismuth is primarily through urinary and biliary routes with a renal clearance of 50 ± 18 mL/min. The mean trough blood bismuth concentration after 2 weeks oral administration of 787 mg bismuth subsalicylate (3 chewable tablets) four times daily under fasted condition was 5.1 ± 3.1 ng/mL. In another study, the mean trough blood bismuth concentration after 2 weeks oral administration of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate (as PEPTO-BISMOL® liquid suspension) four times daily was 5 ng/mL with the highest value being 32 ng/mL.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^58e3cc01]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — vonoprazan–amoxicillin regimens show efficacy and tolerability: In clarithromycin-resistant strains, vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy outperformed lansoprazole-clarithromycin triple therapy (70% vs 32%), and in the overall modified intention-to-treat population eradication rates were 77% vs 69%, with comparable safety and low discontinuations; in China, 10-day vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin either 750 mg 4 times daily (3 g/day) or 1,000 mg twice daily (2 g/day) found the higher amoxicillin dose noninferior to bismuth quadruple and with significantly fewer adverse events, and another RCT showed vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1,000 mg 3 times daily for 10 days was noninferior to a 14-day bismuth-based quadruple regimen containing amoxicillin rather than metronidazole and had significantly lower adverse event rates including gastrointestinal disturbance and diarrhea.

### Bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole and tetracycline hydrochloride [^7e879a61]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole and tetracycline hydrochloride in pediatric patients infected with Helicobacter pylori have not been established.

Tetracycline use in children may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole and tetracycline hydrochloride should not be used in children up to 8 years of age [see Warnings and Precaution (5.4)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole and tetracycline hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, elderly patients may have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant diseases or other drug therapies. Bismuth subcitrate potassium, a component of bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole and tetracycline hydrochloride, is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, additional monitoring may be required [see Contraindications (4.5)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In patients with severe renal impairment, higher serum concentrations of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis [see Contraindications (4.5)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in plasma. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events. Bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole and tetracycline hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets / metronidazole tablets / tetracycline hydrochloride capsules (bismuth subsalicylate / metronidazole / tetracycline hydrochloride) [^c7732984]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Salicylic Acid: More than 80% of the salicylic acid is absorbed from oral doses of bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets. Salicylic acid is about 90% plasma protein bound. The volume of distribution is about 170 mL/kg of body weight. Salicylic acid is extensively metabolized and about 10% is excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolic clearance of salicylic acid is saturable; accordingly, nonlinear pharmacokinetics is observed at bismuth subsalicylate doses above 525 mg. Salicylic acid metabolic clearance is lower in females than in males. The terminal half-life of salicylic acid upon a single oral dose of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate is between 2 to 5 hours. After a single oral dose of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate (2 chewable tablets), the mean peak plasma salicylic acid concentration was 13.1 ± 3.4 mcg/mL under fasted condition. The mean steady-state serum total salicylate concentration after 2 weeks oral administration of 525 mg bismuth subsalicylate (as PEPTO-BISMOL liquid suspension) four times daily was 24 mcg/mL with the highest value being 70 mcg/mL.

Metronidazole: Following oral administration, metronidazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of metronidazole are proportional to the administered dose, with oral administration of 250 mg producing a peak plasma concentration of 6 mcg/mL. Studies reveal no significant bioavailability differences between males and females; however because of weight differences, the resulting plasma levels in males are generally lower.

### Salicylate toxicity from chronic bismuth subsalicylate use [^041fab77]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 79-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of worsening confusion, falls and hearing impairment. An initial workup for infectious, metabolic and structural causes was unrevealing. However, further history discovered that he had been ingesting one to two bottles of Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) daily for gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms. On his second day of admission, the plasma salicylate concentration was 2.08 mmol/L (reference range 1.10–2.20 mmol/L), despite no sources of salicylate in hospital. He was diagnosed with chronic salicylate toxicity and Pepto-Bismol use was discontinued. The patient was treated supportively with isotonic intravenous fluids only and plasma salicylate concentration fell to less than 0.36mmol/L. Concurrently, all his symptoms resolved. This case highlights the potential adverse effects of over-the-counter medications. The diagnosis of chronic salicylate toxicity is challenging, specifically in the elderly and in undifferentiated presentations, as it can be missed if not suspected.
