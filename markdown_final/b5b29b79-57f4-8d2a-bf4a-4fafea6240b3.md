## Question

58-year-old woman with 2 days of worsening RUQ abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, leukocytosis, cholestatic liver enzyme pattern, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and ultrasound showing dilated intra/extrahepatic bile ducts with gallbladder stones; deteriorates with fever and altered mental status despite antibiotics.

A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of worsening abdominal pain for the past 2 days. She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 13 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,000/mm3
Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 2 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 432 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase 196 U/L
Aspartate transaminase 207 U/L
Bilirubin
Total 3.8 mg/dL
Direct 2.7 mg/dL
Lipase 82 U/L
Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer Choices:
A. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
B. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
C. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
D. Percutaneous cholecystostomy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step is most appropriate for a 58-year-old woman with acute cholangitis who is deteriorating despite antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of cholangitis. Then, I should verify the indication and timing for biliary drainage. Next, I will compare endoscopic versus percutaneous options and when to choose each. After that, I need to check why the alternative choices are incorrect or not first-line. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, guideline-concordant recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has Charcot's triad (fever, RUQ pain, jaundice) plus leukocytosis and a cholestatic pattern, and ultrasound shows biliary dilation with gallstones, which together establish acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis. The development of altered mental status indicates progression to severe disease with organ dysfunction, which mandates urgent biliary decompression rather than continued medical therapy alone [^5af8766a] [^27f5b24c].

> Wait, let me verify the principle of therapy. In acute cholangitis, antibiotics alone are insufficient when there is ongoing biliary obstruction; source control via biliary drainage is required to prevent sepsis progression and death, and delays increase mortality and organ failure, so I need to ensure we move quickly to definitive drainage rather than more imaging or temporizing measures [^f85956e7] [^11de8129] [^5fe90aae].

> I will now examine the timing. For severe cholangitis, multiple high-quality guidelines converge on urgent endoscopic drainage within 12–24 hours, and even faster in septic shock. Given her mental status change and rising fever despite antibiotics, this is not a situation to defer drainage for additional noninvasive testing or observation [^50b6570a] [^5fe90aae] [^11de8129].

> Next, I should review modality selection. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and stone extraction is first-line because it achieves both decompression and definitive stone clearance in the same session, with lower morbidity and mortality than surgery and a more favorable safety profile than percutaneous approaches. I initially thought percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) might be equivalent, but hold on, I should correct that — guidelines prioritize endoscopic internal drainage when feasible due to better outcomes and the ability to clear stones endoscopically [^f85956e7] [^11de8129] [^50b6570a].

> But wait, what if ERCP is unavailable or fails? In that scenario, PTBD is an acceptable alternative for unstable patients or when endoscopic access is not possible; however, it is not the preferred first step when ERCP expertise is available, so I should not jump to PTBD unless there is a compelling reason or failed ERCP [^30286fdd] [^035ebd52].

> Let me consider why the other options are incorrect. MRCP is a diagnostic test, not therapeutic, and would only delay life-saving drainage in a deteriorating patient; laparoscopic cholecystectomy treats the gallbladder but does not address the obstructed duct and is contraindicated in unstable cholangitis; percutaneous cholecystostomy drains the gallbladder and does not decompress the obstructed bile ducts, so it will not treat the source of sepsis in cholangitis [^79d21570] [^f85956e7] [^035ebd52].

> I should double-check that our antibiotic regimen is appropriate while we arrange urgent ERCP. Broad-spectrum coverage targeting gram-negatives and anaerobes is recommended, and ceftriaxone plus metronidazole is a reasonable empiric choice pending cultures, but I need to ensure we do not delay drainage while waiting for further clinical response to antibiotics alone [^9a51c21c] [^035ebd52].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is urgent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction for biliary decompression, ideally within 12–24 hours and as soon as the patient is stabilized for sedation, because she has severe acute cholangitis with organ dysfunction and will not improve without source control of the obstructed bile duct [^50b6570a] [^5fe90aae] [^11de8129].

---

The most appropriate next step is **urgent ERCP** [^11de8129] because the patient has acute cholangitis with sepsis and altered mental status, and definitive biliary decompression is required within 24–48 hours [^50b6570a] to prevent progression to multi-organ failure. MRCP is diagnostic and would delay care, cholecystectomy is not first-line in unstable cholangitis, and percutaneous cholecystostomy does not decompress the obstructed bile ducts [^035ebd52].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Charcot's triad**: Fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain are classic for acute cholangitis [^5af8766a].
- **Reynolds' pentad**: Adds altered mental status and hypotension, indicating severe disease with sepsis [^notfound].
- **Laboratory findings**: Leukocytosis, cholestatic LFTs, and direct hyperbilirubinemia support cholangitis [^fd1091df].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts with gallstones, confirming obstruction [^a178586a].

---

## Indications for urgent biliary drainage

Urgent biliary drainage is indicated for **severe acute cholangitis**, characterized by organ dysfunction (altered mental status, hypotension, or renal insufficiency) [^5fe90aae]. Delays in drainage increase mortality, organ failure, and ICU admission [^5fe90aae].

---

## Comparison of management options

| **Option** | **Indication** | **Timing** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ERCP | First-line for severe cholangitis with sepsis | Within 24–48 hours [^50b6570a] | Invasive; requires expertise |
| MRCP | Diagnostic for equivocal cases | Not urgent | No therapeutic benefit; delays care |
| Laparoscopic cholecystectomy | Definitive for gallbladder disease | After stabilization | Contraindicated in unstable cholangitis |
| Percutaneous cholecystostomy | Acute cholecystitis or high surgical risk | Emergent | Does not decompress bile ducts |

---

## Role of ERCP in acute cholangitis

ERCP is the **gold standard** for biliary decompression in acute cholangitis [^11de8129], providing both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. It allows stone extraction, sphincterotomy, and stent placement, effectively relieving obstruction and sepsis [^50b6570a]. Early ERCP within 24–48 hours reduces mortality, organ failure, and length of stay [^5fe90aae].

---

## Risks and benefits of ERCP

Benefits include **effective biliary decompression**, reduced mortality, and shorter hospital stay [^5fe90aae]; risks include pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and infection, but these are outweighed by the benefits in severe cholangitis [^f85956e7].

---

## Alternative interventions

- **MRCP**: Noninvasive but purely diagnostic; not appropriate when urgent decompression is needed [^79d21570].
- **Laparoscopic cholecystectomy**: Not first-line in unstable cholangitis; reserved after stabilization [^notfound].
- **Percutaneous cholecystostomy**: Does not address bile duct obstruction; not indicated here [^035ebd52].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is **urgent ERCP** [^11de8129] for definitive biliary decompression in this patient with severe acute cholangitis and sepsis. MRCP would delay care, cholecystectomy is not first-line in this unstable setting, and percutaneous cholecystostomy would not relieve the obstruction [^035ebd52].

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^5fe1df3e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm3 (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm 3, platelet count 88,000/mm 3, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

COMMENTARY

In this case, the clinician employed both pattern recognition (fever, jaundice and abdominal pain triggered the diagnosis of cholangitis) and analytical reasoning to explain the jaundice and LUQ pain. Pattern recognition is a method of reasoning associated with "expertise" whereby the experienced clinician makes the correct diagnosis after asking only a few questions and performing a few physical examination maneuvers. A more advanced model of expert diagnostic reasoning embraces this ability to recognize many patterns, but also emphasizes fluidity between pattern recognition and analytical reasoning. This requires recognizing elements that do not fit the readily available pattern and further exploring those features in a focused, efficient manner. Emerging research on reasoning suggests that an approach using pattern recognition combined with careful consideration of discordant case features may improve diagnostic accuracy.

In this complex case, multiple candidate illnesses remained plausible even after the accumulation of substantial data. Clinicians approach this problem by prioritizing the differential diagnosis in relationship to the refined problem representation. Sorting the possible diagnoses into categories of close, intermediate and limited match, and including diagnoses that pose great risk if missed, can tailor the diagnostic workup for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness (Table 1).

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^937acf14]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly, mild gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. There were no gallstones or biliary ductal dilatation. Chest radiograph was normal. The patient was admitted for presumed cholecystitis and treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.

Marked thrombocytopenia may arise from acute infection or medication toxicity, but autoimmunity, hypersplenism or an infiltrative process of the bone marrow must also be considered. The urinalysis results are compatible with pyelonephritis, but there is no history of dysuria or costovertebral angle tenderness. Other explanations for the urinary findings include glomerulonephritis or urolithiasis. Endocarditis, via immune complex deposition, could cause this active urine sediment and involve the liver.

The laboratory tests point to a combined cholestatic and hepatocellular process. The AST to ALT ratio is compatible with alcoholic hepatitis, which can present with systemic toxicity and abdominal pain; therefore, revisiting the alcohol history would be logical here. Acetaminophen levels should be checked. The sonogram results, particularly the absence of gallstones, substantially lower the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, and the left-sided abdominal pain never really supported that diagnosis. Given the biochemical evidence of direct liver involvement and unexplained left upper quadrant pain, an abdominal CT is indicated.

She has a subacute illness associated with weight loss, night sweats, SIRS, prolonged fever, LUQ pain, hepatopathy and thrombocytopenia. Leading considerations include alcoholic hepatitis, SLE with autoimmune hepatitis, lymphoma or an indolent infection. Her travel to Mexico and potential involvement of the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow) renders tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis), endocarditis (especially if she has undiagnosed rheumatic heart disease) and brucellosis distinct possibilities. HIV testing is also indicated.

The clinician has explicitly articulated the revised problem representation in the first sentence of the paragraph above. The new data have triggered new hypotheses (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis) and eliminated earlier hypotheses (e.g. cholecystitis). The next diagnostic test (abdominal CT) is chosen to identify features that discriminate among the competing diagnoses.

### Management of gallstones [^6f32346d]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^cd9bc304]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Tokyo guidelines offer a systematic overview and revision of the pathophysiological, clinic and diagnostic approach to the biliary infections. Based on this exhaustive overview these guidelines give also specific therapeutic indications about operative and conservative management.

The diagnosis is the starting point of the treatment of any kind of pathology and of acute cholecystitis as well. Prompt and timely diagnosis should allow early treatment and lower morbidity and mortality. The Tokyo guidelines proposed a staging system based upon the evaluation of local signs of inflammation (Murphy's sign and RUQ mass/pain/tenderness), systemic signs (fever, elevated CRP with values of 3 mg/dl or more and abnormal WBC count) and imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis. Similar diagnostic criteria are reported from other recent studies.

As far as diagnosis and treatment of acute cholecystitis is concerned, the peculiarity of the Tokyo guidelines is the division of the disease in mild, moderate and severe. No previous study examined the optimal treatment of acute cholecystitis on the basis of an organ-related severity score index. In the Tokyo consensus meeting the need for surgical treatment according to the grade of severity was suggested and discussed. Subsequent studies analyzed the impact of the Tokyo guidelines on the management of patients with acute cholecystitis, stressing the attention on their impact on surgical outcomes. Even if the expert panel of that consensus made an extraordinary scientific work, no benefits have been demonstrated by applying those guidelines, except a decrease of mean length of hospital stay.

### 2024 clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on complicated intra-abdominal infections: risk assessment, diagnostic imaging, and microbiological evaluation in adults, children, and pregnant people [^fd1091df]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Acute cholecystitis or cholangitis — subsequent imaging after equivocal ultrasound in non-pregnant adults is addressed as follows: In non-pregnant adults with suspected acute cholecystitis or acute cholangitis, if initial US is equivocal/non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion persists, the panel suggests obtaining an abdominal CT scan as subsequent imaging to diagnose acute cholecystitis or acute cholangitis (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). CT with IV contrast is preferable and usually appropriate when CT is obtained for subsequent imaging, and the diagnosis of acute cholangitis should include clinical signs (jaundice, fever, chills, and right upper quadrant [RUQ] abdominal pain), laboratory findings (indicators of inflammation and biliary stasis), and imaging findings (biliary dilatation or evidence of an etiology [eg, stricture, stone, obstructing mass]). The panel did not identify any studies assessing the accuracy of abdominal US or CT for the diagnosis of acute cholangitis and relied on indirect evidence from acute cholecystitis; because acute cholecystitis and acute cholangitis are uncommon in children, evidence in children was not systematically reviewed, and it would be reasonable to mirror the imaging pathway for adults in children.

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholangitis (with videos) [^5af8766a]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholangitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholangitis is a bacterial infection that occurs in the setting of biliary obstruction, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acute cholangitis involves a blockage in the bile ducts, often due to choledocholithiasis or strictures. This blockage allows for the retrograde migration of bacteria from the intestine into the biliary system, leading to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent immune response, which results in inflammation and infection of the bile ducts.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute cholangitis in the US is estimated at 3,000 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute cholangitis often present with the Charcot triad of fever, jaundice, and RUQ pain. In severe cases, patients may also exhibit signs of sepsis, such as hypotension and altered mental status.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary and is influenced by factors such as disease severity, the patient's overall health, and the timeliness and effectiveness of treatment. Certain laboratory values, such as a WBC count > 20,000 cells/mcL and a TBIL level > 10 mg/dL, have been identified as independent prognostic factors for adverse outcomes.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^79d21570]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Suspected choledocholithiasis — initial investigations and imaging accuracy — For all patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, obtaining liver transaminases, bilirubin and a transabdominal ultrasound are recommended as preliminary investigations, and ultrasound findings consistent with choledocholithiasis include visualization of a common bile duct stone and a dilated common bile duct greater than 8-mm; the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings should be considered when deciding on management. If diagnosis remains in question, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive option with a sensitivity of > 90% and specificity nearing 100%, though common bile duct stones identified require intervention by another method to be removed; endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has average sensitivity and specificity approximately 95% and 97%, respectively.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^8755fe23]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

### Clinical approach to patients with obstructive jaundice [^14e4b8e1]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive jaundice is a clinical symptom that results from cholestasis. Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in the liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

### A 52-year-old man with abdominal pain and jaundice [^add6d24c]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 52-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with subacute abdominal pain and jaundice. Fever, worsening liver function tests, and multi-organ failure developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^acd69367]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis pre-test probability — clinical and imaging predictors are as follows: On abdominal ultrasound, visualization of a common bile duct stone carries approximately a 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Strong predictors include clinical evidence of acute cholangitis, a bilirubin greater than 1.7 mg/dL and a dilated common bile duct (CBD), and the presence of two or more of these factors has a pre-test probability of 50%-94% for choledocholithiasis (considered high). Patients without evidence of jaundice and a normal bile duct on ultrasound have a low probability of choledocholithiasis (< 5%), and patients that fall between these two spectrums are categorized as having an intermediate probability of choledocholithiasis. Meta-analyses have found an observed superiority in the sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as compared to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) due to better accuracy for small stones, and EUS-directed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been advocated as a cost-effective method since both EUS and ERCP could be performed in the same session; the algorithm presented in Fig. 1 may be helpful for managing patients with suspected choledocholithiasis dependent on their risk stratification.

Case presentation

A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting for 3 days. She did not drink alcohol, and there was no clinical or biochemical evidence of primary liver disease or coagulopathy. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed that the percentage of neutrophils (N%) was 80.3% (50–70%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 192 U/L (< 64 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 66 U/L (< 64 U/L), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) was 197 U/L (< 47 U/L), and all other laboratory parameters were normal (e.g. haemoglobin and platelet counts, prothrombin time, and renal function). An abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct with a stone at the lower CBD and sludge in the gallbladder. (Fig. 1) Bile duct cholangiopancreatography revealed a dilated CBD (10 mm in diameter) with a round filling defect (8 mm in diameter) (Fig. 2). Balloon dilation (10 mm in diameter) of terminal CBD after a 5-mm long sphincterotomy for extraction of the stone was uneventful. Unfortunately, she presented with cholangitis and a significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils (94%) and cholestatic parameters (total bilirubin 111.1 μmol/L (2–18 μmol/L), direct bilirubin 81.3 μmol/L (< 7 μmol/L), ALT 465 U/L, AST 538 U/L, and γ-GT 634 U/L) after 3 days.

Q fever — laboratory findings indicate that although up to 25% of patients with acute Q fever have an increased leukocyte count, most patients have normal white blood cell counts. Mild thrombocytopenia in early illness, which occurs in approximately one third of patients, might be followed by subsequent thrombocytosis. The most common laboratory abnormalities are increased liver enzyme levels, which are observed in up to 85% of cases, and hyperbilirubinemia occurs in one in five patients. Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly also might be present, although jaundice is rare.

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^6c1be7e7]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

Case presentation

An 80-year-old female patient was admitted to Santa Maria Hospital's emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, chills and vomiting. Her medical history was relevant for CN type II, systemic hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus. Although she presented persistent jaundice since birth, the diagnosis of CN was only made in adulthood, based only on clinical grounds. She had never required treatment for CN. Seven years earlier, she had been admitted to a different institution with cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis. She underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy. The patient declined cholecystectomy for personal reasons. A laboratory evaluation requested by her general practitioner 5 years earlier showed normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) – 24 U/L (normal range < 34 U/L), gama-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) - 30 U/L (normal range < 32 U/L), prothrombin time – 11.6 s (normal range < 11.8 s), markedly increased total bilirubin - 11.7 mg/dl (normal range < 1.0 mg/dl), and only slightly elevated direct bilirubin - 0.37 mg/dl (normal range < 0.35 mg/dl). At admission, physical examination showed fever (39 °C), severe icterus and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed signs of systemic inflammation (leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein) and a cytocholestatic pattern with unusual elevation in total bilirubin, but only a slight elevation of the direct fraction. There was no evidence of hemolysis (Table 1). Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated distention of the gallbladder with marked wall thickening (10 mm), pericholecystic fluid, positive sonographic Murphy's sign and cholelithiasis. The intrahepatic and common bile ducts were dilated (11 mm) and there was an echogenic material within the common bile duct suggestive of gallstones (Fig. 1). This was compatible with acute obstructive cholangitis with cholecystitis. After starting broad spectrum antibiotics, the patient underwent emergency ERCP which revealed multiple gallbladder and common bile duct stones. Following exploration with basket and balloon, sludge and pus were observed coming out from the papilla, thus confirming cholangitis (Fig. 2). The patient evolved uneventfully. By the 7 th day of admission there was a clear improvement in cholestasis (Table 2). She was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Four weeks later, the patient underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The surgical specimen measured 7 × 3.5 cm. The gallbladder wall was moderately thickened. The outer surface was partially rough, yellow-gray with multiple hemorrhagic foci. The lumen exhibited multiple ovoid yellow-brown stones, the largest measuring 15 mm. Rokitansky–Aschoff sinuses could also be seen. These findings were compatible with chronic calculous cholecystitis.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults… [^3aca242b]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The remaining 45% of acute jaundice cases are extrahepatic and include gallstone disease, hemolysis, and malignancy. 2 This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of jaundice in adults and reviews common etiologies of hyperbilirubinemia. An algorithm for the evaluation of jaundice in adults is provided in Figure 1.
3. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia INCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually a result of too much bilirubin presented to the conjugating machinery. Increased red blood cell breakdown may be caused by red blood cell membrane disorders, 9 red blood cell enzyme disorders, 10 hemoglobin disorders, 11 autoimmune red blood cell destruction, 12 or some cancers. The excess turnover of red blood cells results in increased heme metabolism, producing large amounts of bilirubin that overwhelm the conjugating machinery, leading to decreased excretion and clinical jaundice.

20 Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder, is associated with a loss of function of a cellular transporter responsible for moving dietary copper into liver canaliculi. Elevated liver copper levels affect hepatic lipid metabolism, which leads to steatosis and cholestasis. 21 Additional causes of intrahepatic hyperbilirubinemia include autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hepatitis and the rare autoimmune condition primary biliary cirrhosis, which occurs most commonly in middle-aged women. Both conditions are associated with inflammation, which disrupts the transport of bilirubin within the liver.
3. **EXTRAHEPATIC DISORDERS**: CHOLESTASIS Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may also arise from extrahepatic obstruction. Patients with biliary obstruction may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including fever, pruritus, abdominal pain, weight loss, muscle wasting, dark urine, and pale stools.

Choledocholithiasis is the most common non-neoplastic cause of biliary obstruction, accounting for 14% of all new cases of jaundice. 23 Less commonly, stones in the gallbladder or cystic duct may mechanically compress the common hepatic duct causing jaundice, and, rarely, stones may cause the formation of a biliary-vascular fistula with accompanying jaundice. 24 Biliary stricture causing postoperative jaundice is a rare complication of cholecystectomy. 7, 23.

### Timing of endoscopic therapy for acute bilio-pancreatic diseases: a practical overview [^ecc852f5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP)

Obstruction of the pancreatic outlet, as a result of gallstone migration in the CBD, triggers the pathophysiological mechanisms of ABP, such as intracellular enzyme activation, self-digestion, and activation of the inflammatory pathway. The diagnosis of ABP is based on the association of typical abdominal pain, laboratory tests elevation and US findings. The latter, when direct visualization of biliary obstruction is not feasible, may detect indirect signs, such as dilation of the biliary tract and/or the presence of gallbladder stones. The combination of elevated serological liver tests and dilation of the common bile duct (CBD) on US evaluation has 95% sensitivity in diagnosing ABP. Moreover, alanine aminotransferase levels > 150 U/L within 48 h from the onset of symptoms have a positive predictive value > 85% for the presence of CBD stones. Early conservative management of ABP is based on appropriate intravenous fluid administration, to minimize the risk of hypovolemia and organ failure. After initial resuscitation and patient stabilization, timing of ERCP in ABP depends on the clinical situation. When this condition is associated with cholangitis, there is evidence that strongly supports performing ERCP as soon as possible and within 24 h. In the absence of cholangitis, the role and timing of ERCP in ABP are still under debate, as pointed out in a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis. Early routine ERCP may lead to many unnecessary procedures, as the offending gallstone might have spontaneously passed before the diagnosis of pancreatitis is reached. The results of an ongoing multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing early ERCP versus conservative treatment might impact on the future management of severe ABP patients. While we wait for this evidence, ERCP within 48–72 h has been suggested in the setting of severe acute pancreatitis (as defined by the revised Atlanta classification) that shows persistent or worsening signs of biliary tract obstruction. Otherwise, if signs of biliary obstruction improve or finally regress, previous EUS evaluation or MRCP should be performed within 24–48 h to avoid inappropriate ERCP (Fig. 2).

Acute cholangitis, also referred to as ascending cholangitis, is an infection of the biliary tree characterized by fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain, which in most cases is the consequence of biliary obstruction. Diagnosis is commonly made by the presence of clinical features, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The treatment modalities include administration of intravenous fluids, antimicrobial therapy, and prompt drainage of the bile duct. Early diagnosis and treatment of acute cholangitis are crucial to prevent unwanted clinical outcome of the disease.

Primary outcome measure

The primary endpoint of this study is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24 months, defined as hospital admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Hospital visit is a condition, because all patients with noteworthy symptoms will eventually visit the hospital. Mild and self-limiting complaints are not a large burden to the health care system or to the patient, and usually gallstone involvement is not objectified in these patients. Symptomatic gallstone disease is defined as biliary pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or biliary colics. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed in the presence of two of the three following: upper abdominal pain; serum lipase or amylase levels above 3 times the upper level of normal; characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Pancreatitis is regarded of biliary origin when imaging reveals gallstones, sludge or a dilated common bile duct, or when laboratory investigation reveals an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level > 2 times higher than normal values, with ALT > aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the updated Tokyo Guidelines. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in the presence of at least one local sign of inflammation (either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count). Choledocholithiasis is defined as the presence of stones in the extrahepatic bile ducts as proven by clinical imaging, or clinical suspicion based on abnormal liver function tests in combination with upper abdominal pain for which an ERCP or PTC was indicated. Cholangitis is diagnosed when there is a sign of systemic inflammation (fever/shaking chills or laboratory evidence of inflammatory response) and either clinical or laboratory evidence of cholestasis (total bilirubin ≥ 34 μmol/L, or increased serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, ALT, or AST > 1.5× higher than the upper limit of normal value) or evidence of cholestasis on biliary imaging (biliary dilatation or evidence of the etiology on imaging). Biliary colics are defined as upper abdominal pain (either right upper quadrant or epigastric pain) lasting at least 30 min with gallstones visible on ultrasound, according to the Rome criteria. In case of doubt whether a participant has reached the primary endpoint, endpoint adjudication will be done by an independent blinded committee.

Sepsis secondary to cholangitis — management emphasizes rapid stabilization, antimicrobials, and timely drainage: After definitive diagnosis of acute cholangitis in patients with sepsis, initial treatment includes IV fluid resuscitation with careful monitoring of hemodynamic status, followed by immediate antimicrobial therapy targeted to the biliary tract, with biliary drainage as a key goal; the drainage strategy should be decided in consideration of the patient's general status, and in patients who do respond to initial sepsis management, early internal drainage by transpapillary biliary drainage during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be considered first-line as it not only achieves biliary drainage but also allows for stone removal; if stones cannot be extracted concurrently, two-session treatment can be pursued with endoscopic biliary stenting as initial treatment followed by endoscopic stone removal after improvement of cholangitis; if endoscopic techniques fail or in patients with rapid deterioration and sepsis-induced organ damage, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage should be considered, while surgical drainage and management is generally rare and not advocated in these critically ill patients due to increased morbidity and mortality compared to endoscopic treatment.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — evaluation when suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma is high (Best Practice Advice 4): PSC patients with increasing cholestatic biochemistry values or who develop jaundice, fever, right upper-quadrant pain, or pruritus should undergo appropriate evaluation for cholangiocarcinoma rather than continued surveillance. Dominant strictures are defined by stenoses with a diameter of 1.5 mm or less in the common bile duct and/or 1.0 mm or less in a hepatic duct within 2 cm of the main hepatic confluence by ERCP. Among PSC patients with a dominant stricture, 6.2% to 26.3% will be diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma over a 6.2- to 9.8-year follow-up period. Because benign and malignant strictures can appear similar on imaging, a high index of suspicion is warranted and direct sampling of the stricture should be considered to rule out underlying cholangiocarcinoma.

Acalculous cholecystitis, an important but often unrecognized cause of fever in critically ill patients, may be suspected with right upper quadrant pain, although this is commonly absent; in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of a febrile episode. However, a lack of data on false-positive and false-negative results in patients without abdominal signs or symptoms precludes a firm recommendation supporting routine diagnostic abdominal ultrasound.

An 81-year-old woman with no history of immunocompromise presented with 2 days of upper abdominal pain associated with nausea. On arrival, her physical examination was unremarkable apart from mild epigastric and right hypochondriac tenderness, and laboratory investigations were unremarkable apart from mild thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. A CT scan performed on the day of admission revealed a tiny 0.3 cm stone in the common bile duct, with no upstream dilatation. On day 2 of admission, she developed a vesicular rash and with acutely worsening transaminitis. She deteriorated rapidly and demised from complications of acute liver failure within the next 24 hours. The diagnosis of varicella was confirmed with antibody testing. Fulminant varicella hepatitis is an extremely rare and lethal condition with only a handful of reported cases in the current literature.

### Timing of endoscopic therapy for acute bilio-pancreatic diseases: a practical overview [^5fe90aae]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute cholangitis

The first clinical context where urgent ERCP is required is severe acute cholangitis. Bile is a sterile liquid with bacteriostatic properties. Moreover, the pressure of Oddi's sphincter physiologically represents a barrier that prevents bacterial migration in the biliary tree. In case of biliary tract obstruction, bile flow is impaired and there is a retrograde migration of pathogens with bacterial proliferation in the biliary tree, which leads to the development of acute cholangitis. The Tokyo Guidelines on the management of acute cholangitis and cholecystitis, issued by the Japanese Society of Hepatobiliary Surgery in 2018, represent the reference for the recognition, diagnosis and staging of acute cholangitis severity. The diagnosis of acute cholangitis is based on the following criteria: 1) clinical, including jaundice, pain and fever (Charcot triad); 2) serological, with cholestasis signs (bilirubin), with or without elevation of transaminases; and 3) radiological, which allows the recognition of common bile duct dilation (CBD > 6 mm with gallbladder in place, > 10 mm in case of previous surgical cholecystectomy) and the cause of the obstruction (e.g. stenosis, lithiasis, neoplasia). Once the diagnosis of acute cholangitis has been established, stratifying patients according to the severity of the clinical scenario is mandatory. In particular, severe (or grade III) acute cholangitis is characterized by its association with signs of organ failure (Table 1).

Table 1
Severity assessment criteria for acute cholangitis according to Tokyo Guidelines 2018

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, which evaluated data from 9 observational studies involving a total of 7534 patients, showed that ERCP performed within 48 h of symptom onset is associated with a reduction in early and late mortality, organ failure, and length of hospitalization. According to the Tokyo guidelines, ERCP should be performed within 24 h, whilst the European Society of Digestive Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines recommend biliary drainage as soon as possible, and within 12 h in patients with septic shock. Therefore, in case of severe acute cholangitis, ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy becomes a life-saving therapeutic procedure and should be performed as soon as possible (within 12–24 h). Otherwise, in case of non-severe acute cholangitis, conservative management with antibiotic therapy for 24 h should be attempted before ERCP, which can be delayed for 48–72 h. In case of therapy failure, ERCP should be performed in these patients as soon as possible, or within 24 h (Fig. 1).

Case presentation

A 60-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Room with abdominal pain, fever, pruritus and jaundice since 1 week. The patient had a history of smoking and a family history of pancreatic cancer.

On physical examination, a hard and painful mass was identified on the right hypochondrium. Blood laboratory examination showed extrahepatic cholestasis enzymes (total bilirubin 8,44 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 8,31 mg/dl, AST 529 U/L; ALT 728 U/L; GGT 3974 U/L; LDH 353 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 876,4 U/L. In anamnesis, the patient referred to abdominal pain occurring during the last 6 months located in the right upper quadrant, which had been interpreted as biliary colic by her general practitioner.

Tumour markers and blood count showed no alterations. Viral serology, autoimmunity antibodies, metanephrines and urine normetanephrine were within the normal range.

A large mass associated with the gallbladder was identified by abdominal ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced CT scan disclosed a large soft tissue mass originating from the gallblader with homogenous contrast enhancement and without clear infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma. The mass displaced the transverse colon, hepatic flexure and duodenum. No lymphadenopathies were identified in the hepatoduodenal ligament, pancreas, retroduodenum or celiac axis (Fig. 1 a, b) The gallbladder was distended, contained stones, and had a regular lumen, while there was slight dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct on magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1 c).

### A rare cause of biliary obstruction and pancreatitis [^90af5b55]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The prevalence of duodenal diverticula varies considerably in the literature, between 3–24%. They are acquired extraluminal outpouchings of the mucosal wall through the muscularis propria and their incidence increases with age. While most duodenal diverticula do not cause major symptoms, they are increasingly recognized as causes of pancreaticobiliary disease. Food bezoar in a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum (JPDD) causing pancreaticobiliary obstruction is rare, with the first of such case reported in 1977. We present a case of food bezoar in JPDD causing pancreatitis, severe pancreaticobiliary duct obstruction and dilation — mimicking as neoplasm — that was successfully diagnosed and treated endoscopically.

A 60-year-old female presented with two months of right upper quadrant abdominal (RUQ) pain radiating to the back with associated jaundice, nausea, vomiting, pruritus and clay colored stools. Physical exam was significant for jaundice, epigastric and RUQ tenderness without guarding. Vital signs were normal and afebrile. Laboratory testing revealed leukocyte count of 8,800 mm 3, lipase of 1085 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 164 IU/L, total/direct bilirubin of 10.8/8.9 mg/dL and alkaline phosphatase of 523 IU/L. Abdominal ultrasound showed common bile duct (CBD) dilation to 17 mm and was without choledocholithiasis. CT of abdomen showed a 3.8 cm pancreatic head mass causing significant biliary ductal dilatation as well as pancreatic ductal dilatation (Fig. 1). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed large periampullary diverticula with impacted bezoar that was disimpacted with flushes and Roth Net (Fig. 2). Endoscopic ultrasound performed post disimpaction demonstrated aforementioned ductal dilatation on CT and diverticula, but without pancreatic head mass, choledocholithiasis, or pancreatic duct stones. The patient's symptoms and obstructive liver associated enzymes improved to normal levels over the next two months. Patient did not have recurrence of symptoms and laboratory findings also did not show evidence of hepatobiliary obstruction at one year follow up.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^f00e70b4]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

### A young lady with post-partum jaundice and right upper quadrant lump abdomen: an unusual etiology [^dc1896f6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Case report

A 22-year-old young lady was referred to the Gastroenterology department by her local physician with 4 weeks history of yellowish discoloration of urine and sclera. Lumpy upper abdomen and significant loss of weight (approx. 5 kg) were present for 3 weeks. There were no prodromal symptoms and she denied any history of pruritus or passage of light colored stool. Her drug and family histories were unremarkable.

She had normal full-term pregnancy with transvaginal delivery of a healthy infant 6 weeks previously. There were no complications during pregnancy and no evidence of jaundice or cholestasis during pregnancy. Patient had a sensation of a lump in the right upper hypochondrium which had been gradually increasing in size over the past 3 weeks. It was associated with colicky pain lasting for 15–20 min and then subsided gradually. The patient also had intermittent spikes of fever with chills for one week.

On general examination there was pallor, jaundice but no lymphadenopathy. Tenderness was present in the right hypochondrium and a globular bulge was felt 4 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatomegaly was present with left lobe enlargement more than the right lobe; margins were sharp with firm consistency. Routine investigations confirmed normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL) with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (10.5/6.8 mg/dL) and deranged liver function test (Table 1). Ultrasonography was done showing grossly dilated common bile duct with large filling defect throughout. Gross dilatation of intrahepatic biliary radicals and common hepatic ducts were seen.

Table 1
Summary of investigations

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) study of abdomen was done showing grossly dilated gallbladder with moderate to gross dilatation of intrahepatic biliary radicals and common bile duct (Fig. 1). A large polypoidal intraluminal multifocal enhancing lesion filling almost the entire common bile duct, cystic duct was also seen multifocally in the gallbladder. Multiple small hypodense lesions seen in both lobes showing peripheral rim enhancement clustered around central intra hepatic biliary radical dilatations were suggestive of cholangitic abscess.

### Diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis [^06da1ac9]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial infection that occurs in the setting of biliary obstruction can lead to acute cholangitis, a condition characterized by fever, abdominal pain and jaundice. Choledocholithiasis is the most common cause of acute cholangitis and is often associated with bacterial infection and colonization in addition to biliary obstruction. Iatrogenic introduction of bacteria into the biliary system most commonly occurs during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with biliary obstruction. The majority of patients with acute cholangitis respond to antibiotic therapy, but endoscopic biliary drainage is ultimately required to treat the underlying obstruction. Acute cholangitis is often diagnosed using the clinical Charcot triad criteria; however, recommendations from an international consensus meeting in Tokyo produced the most comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis. These guidelines enable a more accurate diagnosis of acute cholangitis than do earlier methods, and they facilitate the classification of disease as mild, moderate or severe. Although these guidelines represent a notable advance toward defining a universally accepted consensus for the definition of acute cholangitis, they have several limitations. This Review discusses current recommendations for the diagnosis of acute cholangitis and addresses the advantages and disadvantages of different modalities for the treatment of this disease.

### Acute gallbladder torsion-a continued pre-operative diagnostic dilemma [^f9d4eb9e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute gallbladder volvulus continues to remain a relatively uncommon process, manifesting itself usually during exploration for an acute surgical abdomen with a presumptive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The pathophysiology is that of mechanical organo-axial torsion along the gallbladder's longitudinal axis involving the cystic duct and cystic artery, and with a pre-requisite of local mesenteric redundancy. The demographic tendency is septua- and octo-genarians of the female sex, and its overall incidence is increasing, this being primarily attributed to increasing life expectancy. Despite significant challenges in pre-operative diagnosis, a high index of suspicion and prompt surgical intervention results in an overall mortality of approximately 5 percent.

Case Report One

A 99-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 3 day history of acute onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain with intermittent radiation to the right flank and back. It was described as colicky in nature on a baseline dull character, and with no obvious precipitating, aggravating or relieving factors. Associated phenomena included anorexia and nausea, but no constitutional upset, vomiting, or change in bowel habit. Her medical history included peptic ulcer disease, uncontrolled hypertension, tobacco abuse, diverticulosis, a hiatal hernia, and dementia. Her surgical history was significant for an appendectomy.

Clinical physical examination revealed an apyrexic frail patient in no acute distress with stable vital signs. Focused abdominal examination demonstrated a soft, mildly distended abdomen with tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, and a positive Murphy's sign. There was no overt peritonism. A reducible left inguinal hernia was also appreciated. Laboratory parameters yielded a mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and hypokalemia. Her liver function enzymes were elevated in a cholestatic distribution with a total bilirubin of 3.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL, and an alkaline phosphatase of 150 IU/L.

An 89-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 1-month history of upper right quadrant pain, worsened in the last 3days and accompanied by fever and chills. On physical examination, he had scleral icterus and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings showed hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes and C reactive protein. The patient was admitted, suspecting of an acute cholangitis and started on antibiotics. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of a juxtapapillary diverticulum in the second portion of the duodenum, which was confirmed by a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, along with upstream biliary tract ectasia. The imaging findings allowed us to diagnose a Lemmel's syndrome. Due to potential surgical risk, we decided for a conservative approach. The patient had a favourable course and was discharged home.

The immediate action is to "Hold tolvaptan," "Repeat LFTs within 48–72 hours," and "Assess for other etiologies (other diseases, drugs, exposures)." If repeat tests are "Increased to ≥ 3 × ULN," then "Permanently discontinue tolvaptan unless other explanation for liver injury and injury resolved"; if "Stable or improved," then "Reinitiate tolvaptan with frequent monitoring." The pathway concludes that "All patients with evidence of possible drug‑induced liver injury should be followed until all abnormalities return to normal or to the baseline state."

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^345cd7e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement (indications for percutaneous/endoscopic drainage of pancreatic collections)

Clinical deterioration with signs or strong suspicion of infected necrotizing pancreatitis is an indication to perform intervention (percutaneous/endoscopic drainage)

After 4 weeks after the onset of the disease:
On-going organ failure without sign of infected necrosis
On-going gastric outlet, biliary, or intestinal obstruction due to a large walled off necrotic collection
Disconnected duct syndrome
Symptomatic or growing pseudocyst

After 8 weeks after the onset of the disease:
On-going pain and/or discomfort

(grade 1C)

Discussion

The evidence of indications is based on understanding the natural course of the disease, mechanism-based reasoning, and non-randomized studies. Interventions for necrotizing pancreatitis should preferably be done when the necrosis has become walled-off, usually after 4 weeks after the onset of the disease.

Signs or strong suspicion of infected necrosis in a symptomatic patient requires intervention, although a small number of patients have been shown to recover with antibiotics only. When a patient deteriorates a step-up approach starting with percutaneous or endoscopic drainage is indicated.

A majority of patients with sterile necrotizing pancreatitis can be managed without interventions. However, it should be noted that nearly half of patients operated due to on-going organ failure without signs of infected necrosis have a positive bacterial culture in the operative specimen. Therefore, interventions should be considered when organ dysfunctions persist for more than 4 weeks.

Walled off necrotic collections or pseudocysts may cause symptoms and/or mechanical obstruction and if they do not resolve when inflammation ceases, a step up approach is indicated. A symptomatic disconnected pancreatic duct results in a peripancreatic collection and is an indication for interventions.

Statements (indications for surgical intervention)

The following are indications for surgical intervention:
As a continuum in a step-up approach after percutaneous/endoscopic procedure with the same indications
Abdominal compartment syndrome
Acute on-going bleeding when endovascular approach is unsuccessful
Bowel ischaemia or acute necrotizing cholecystitis during acute pancreatitis
Bowel fistula extending into a peripancreatic collection

(grade 1C)

Discussion

The evidence of indications is based on understanding the natural course of the disease, mechanism-based reasoning, and non-randomized studies. When percutaneous or endoscopic strategies fail to improve the patient, further surgical strategies should be considered. Abdominal compartment syndrome should first be managed by conservative methods. Surgical decompression by laparostomy should be considered if conservative methods are insufficient.

Bleeding complications in acute severe pancreatitis may warrant surgical interventions if endovascular approach is unsuccessful. Bowel- and other extrapancreatic complications are relatively rare but may require surgical interventions.

Abstract

A 14-year-old adolescent girl presented with severe abdominal pain, tenderness, and guarding in the right upper quadrant associated with nonbilious vomiting, scleral icterus, and fever. Laboratory tests were consistent with acute hepatitis A virus-related cholestatic hepatitis. A point-of-care ultrasound showed mild gallbladder wall thickening with increased color Doppler flow and pericholecystic fluid collection, in the absence of gallstones or biliary ducts dilatation, thus suggesting acute acalculous cholecystitis. Both the clinical symptoms and the point-of-care ultrasound findings completely resolved within 1 week after admission with conservative treatment.

### Approach to the patient who has suspected acute bacterial cholangitis [^edaf6c30]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Table 4 gives summary recommendations concerning the major decisions that are related to the diagnosis and management of suspected acute bacterial cholangitis. All of these decisions have to be made within the context of disease severity, degree of diagnostic uncertainty, and associated comorbidity. Although these recommendations are based on evidence, there are few randomized controlled trials. Antibiotics that cover gram negatives and anaerobes, along with fluid and electrolyte correction, frequently stabilize the patient. Imaging studies frequently confirm the diagnosis and identify the location and etiology of the obstruction. With or without a definitive diagnosis, ERCP or PTC can be done emergently to establish drainage to control sepsis. Although endoscopic and percutaneous drainage techniques have lower morbidity and mortality than does emergent surgical decompression, optimal management of this potentially life-threatening condition requires close cooperation between the gastroenterologist, radiologist, and surgeon.

### A fluke catch: biliary obstruction and pancreatitis from dicrocoeliasis [^79ed2799]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

An 82-year-old woman presented with 3 days of epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was afebrile and had a bilirubin level of 2.9 mg/dL without leukocytosis or eosinophilia. Peak aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipase levels were 675, 708, 236, and 7366 U/L, respectively. CT with contrast showed mild gallbladder wall thickening and no stones or pericholecystic fluid. Bile ducts and pancreas appeared normal.

EUS of the distal common bile duct revealed a 5-mm thin hyperechoic lesion without shadowing and no pancreatic abnormalities (Fig. 1). ERCP revealed poor contrast drainage but showed no filling defects. Sphincterotomy and sweeping with a balloon retrieved a live 3- × 3- × 1-mm fluke (Video 1, available online at), which pathology results from the Centers for Disease Control identified as Dicrocoelium dendriticum. By this time, the patient had already been discharged after symptomatic improvement and downtrending liver enzymes while on empiric nitazoxanide and 2 doses of triclabendazole for suspected Fasciola hepatica. Notably, the patient emigrated from China 20 years earlier after working in the fields and construction; she had last visited 4 years earlier and might have been infected during one of those trips.

Recommendation 27: Patients should have a clear monitoring pathway for early detection of recurrent stent blockage and on-demand endoscopic intervention.

Strength of recommendation: STRONG

Quality of evidence: LOW

It is useful for patients to have serial monitoring of liver function tests to monitor for early stent blockage/cholangitis during active oncology or palliative follow-up. This may happen for a variety of reasons (table 4). Although non-evidence based, a minimum of 3-monthly repeat blood tests (full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function test, γ-glutamyl transferase and CRP) would seem a reasonable approach for those patients who would be suitable for treatment. Patients should have support phone numbers to call if their stent becomes blocked, and have access to a home supply of antibiotics for use if they were to develop stent cholangitis, with instructions of when to use them. It is generally recommended that repeat imaging is arranged with suspected stent blockage (recurrent bile duct blockage) to ensure that further endoscopic/EUS/PTC drainage is the correct course of action and relative anatomy determined in conjunction with the patient's wishes and performance status.

Table 4
Causes of recurrent biliary obstruction

ERCP options in this situation potentially include: removing a covered stent and replacing it, sweeping the stent to clear debris, placing a plastic stent within a metal stent, or placing a metal stent within a metal stent. The most appropriate choice will be determined by the nature of the problem and the operator's assessment of the situation.

Where expertise is available, EUS biliary drainage might be an option in the following situations: (1) failed ERCP, (2) postsurgical anatomy and (3) difficult biliary cannulation. Finally, at the time of a planned interventional procedure, the cause of the stent dysfunction should be defined for audit and research purposes.

Recommendation 28: Patients with recurrent pain after biliary stenting during their disease process should be evaluated with cross-sectional imaging. Patients with stent dysfunction should also be re-evaluated with cross-sectional imaging before any further endotherapy is undertaken.

Strength of recommendation: MODERATE

Quality of evidence: LOW

Complications other than stent blockage are also clinically important and include: pancreatitis, cholecystitis, non‐occlusion cholangitis, bleeding, ulceration, penetration, perforation and complications associated with the stent placement procedure (perforation, desaturation, aspiration pneumonia, etc).

Role of ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis — Most patients with gallstone pancreatitis will not benefit from ERCP, including early ERCP. In a multicenter trial of early ERCP, early (within 24 hours) ERCP was not found to decrease complications, including mortality, and urgent ERCP was indicated only for cholangitis or progressive cholestasis defined by a rise in bilirubin in the setting of severe or moderately severe AP (bilirubin > 3–5 mg/dL).

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^e9ac49e1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (< 10%), moderate risk (10 to 50%) and high risk (> 50%) of CBDS (see Table 2). This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC, in order to select patients who need stone removal; finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP. See Fig. 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC.

What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?

2.5 We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

ASGE guidelines remains a valuable tool for the diagnosis and the management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients have a probability of having CBDS exceeding 50%, which in turn means that up to 49% of patients undergoing ERCP will not have evidence of CBDS and, given the potential complications of ERCP, this may not be considered acceptable. For this reason, we would recommend more cautious approach: only patients with evidence of CBDS at abdominal US should be considered at high risk of CBDS and should undergo diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP directly; patients with total serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dl or enlarged common bile duct diameter at US with concomitant bilirubin level 1.8 to 4 mg/dl should be considered as moderate risk and should undergo second level investigation such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) or IOC, in order to avoid the complications related to ERCP. See Table 2 for the modified risk stratification.

Regarding medical management for primary biliary cholangitis, more specifically with respect to first-line therapy, BSG 2018 guidelines recommend to adjust the dose of obeticholic acid in patients with advanced liver disease as per the drug label and obtain a careful evaluation of potential benefits and risks, as well as monitor patients with very advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh class A liver disease with portal hypertension; Child-Pugh class B and C liver disease).

Regarding diagnostic procedures for primary sclerosing cholangitis, more specifically with respect to ERCP, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to consider performing ERCP for the evaluation of relevant strictures, new-onset or worsening pruritus, unexplained weight loss, worsening serum liver test abnormalities, rising serum CA 19–9, recurrent bacterial cholangitis, or progressive bile duct dilation. Consider performing MRI with cholangiopancreatography before ERCP to clarify the need for biliary intervention and guide the technical approach.
