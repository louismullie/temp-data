## Question

What are the typical durations of therapy for osteoporosis treatment with alendronate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical duration of alendronate therapy for osteoporosis, how to individualize treatment based on fracture risk, when to consider a drug holiday, and how to monitor patients during that break. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled baseline duration and the evidence base behind it. Then, I should verify how major guidelines stratify duration by risk category and what the randomized extension data show. Next, I will examine the concept and timing of a bisphosphonate holiday, including monitoring triggers to restart. After that, I should review special populations like glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and men. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm the monitoring cadence and safety considerations, anchoring to high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the baseline duration. The FDA labeling states that the optimal duration of alendronate is undetermined, that efficacy and safety data extend to about 4 years, and that for patients at low fracture risk, discontinuation after 3 to 5 years can be considered, with periodic reassessment of fracture risk thereafter [^113qYnbw] [^113gNTjV] [^114dp4xK].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for longer-term therapy. The pivotal trials and meta-analyses demonstrate robust antifracture efficacy over 3 to 5 years, including reductions in vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures, which supports a 3 to 5 year initial course as standard for most patients with osteoporosis [^1113xGtU] [^112sm93Z] [^113buTKd].

> Hold on, I should verify how guidelines translate that into risk-stratified duration. The Endocrine Society and AACE/ACE recommend treating for 3 to 5 years initially, then reassessing risk. If risk remains high, continue oral bisphosphonate therapy up to a total of about 10 years, whereas if risk is low to moderate, consider a drug holiday, with the decision individualized to clinical factors and patient preference [^11321AQ1] [^114wUxoj] [^115fF8SP].

> I will now examine the randomized extension data that inform continuation decisions. In the FLEX trial, women who had completed 5 years of alendronate were randomized to continue alendronate or switch to placebo for another 5 years; those who continued had fewer clinical vertebral fractures and maintained higher BMD, whereas those who stopped had a modest BMD decline but BMD remained above pretreatment levels, indicating a residual benefit, especially relevant for higher-risk patients [^115pbdTr] [^116LEZ3f].

> Let me think about the drug holiday concept and its timing. A bisphosphonate holiday is a planned, temporary discontinuation after an initial 3 to 5 year course in appropriately selected patients, leveraging the skeletal retention of alendronate; most guidelines advise limiting the holiday to about 2 to 3 years, with earlier reassessment at 2 to 4 years and a low threshold to restart if BMD falls or fracture risk rises [^115AQZNp] [^11321AQ1] [^1168sxzv] [^115AQZNp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the holiday could extend to 5 years in all low-risk patients, but I should double-check that. Some guidance allows up to 5 years off in select low-risk scenarios, yet multiple sources caution that fracture risk begins to rise after about 2 years off therapy, so I should correct that and recommend closer surveillance and earlier reinitiation if risk increases rather than routinely extending to 5 years off treatment [^11321AQ1] [^115AQZNp] [^113PX9CC].

> Next, I should review monitoring during the holiday. I need to ensure we reassess fracture risk every 2 to 4 years with clinical review, DXA to detect BMD declines beyond the least significant change, and, when available, bone turnover markers to detect early increases that might prompt earlier resumption of therapy, because a significant BMD drop or BTM rise should trigger ending the holiday and restarting treatment [^1168sxzv] [^116xDekm].

> Let me consider special populations. For glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, alendronate is indicated and treatment duration is generally aligned with the duration of glucocorticoid exposure and ongoing fracture risk, with reassessment at 3 to 5 years and continuation if risk remains high, consistent with rheumatology guidance and FDA labeling for alendronate in GIO [^113qYnbw] [^115r3ExB]. For men with osteoporosis, efficacy has been demonstrated over 1 to 2 years in trials, and duration decisions follow the same risk-based principles used in women, with individualized reassessment after the initial course [^114bRLwy] [^115AQZNp].

> I should confirm the practical, risk-stratified synthesis. Typical initial therapy is 3 to 5 years for most patients, followed by risk reassessment. Continue up to a total of about 10 years for those who remain high risk, and consider a 2 to 3 year holiday for those at low to moderate risk, with earlier resumption if BMD declines, BTMs rise, or new fractures occur, balancing the rare but increasing risks of atypical femoral fracture with prolonged exposure against the substantial fracture-prevention benefits [^11321AQ1] [^114wUxoj] [^115AQZNp] [^112TJ2qa].

> But wait, what if the patient is very high risk, such as older than 70 to 75 with prior vertebral fractures or very low T-scores. In that scenario, I should verify that some guidance supports continuing without a holiday or using a very short holiday with close monitoring, and even consider transitioning to an anabolic agent followed by an antiresorptive to consolidate gains, given the disproportionate benefit of fracture prevention in this group [^114xLEF5] [^115fF8SP] [^117KvzpZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure the monitoring cadence is explicit. Reassess tolerance early after initiation, review adherence at 1 year, and formally reassess fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of therapy. During a holiday, monitor clinically and with DXA every 2 to 4 years and check BTMs when available, resuming therapy if risk escalates or surrogate markers deteriorate, aligning with endocrine and menopause society guidance [^114xLEF5] [^11321AQ1] [^115AQZNp].

The typical duration of alendronate therapy is **3–5 years** for most patients, after which fracture risk should be reassessed [^114jtBQy] [^11321AQ1]. For low-risk patients, consider a **drug holiday** after 3–5 years; for high-risk patients (e.g. T-score ≤ –2.5, prior vertebral fracture, or ongoing glucocorticoid use), continue up to 10 years, then reassess [^111zvn9u] [^114wUxoj]. Drug holidays of 1–3 years are appropriate for low-to-moderate risk, with monitoring of BMD and clinical status; resume therapy if risk rises or BMD declines [^115AQZNp] [^1168sxzv]. The optimal duration is individualized based on risk, response, and adverse effects [^1129L4dq].

---

## Evidence supporting typical duration of therapy

- **Initial treatment period**: Clinical trials show alendronate reduces fracture risk over 3–5 years, establishing this as the standard initial duration [^1113xGtU] [^11321AQ1].

- **Long-term extension studies**: The FLEX trial found that after 5 years, continuing alendronate reduced clinical vertebral fractures but not nonvertebral or hip fractures; BMD gains persisted in both groups, supporting reassessment at 5 years [^115pbdTr] [^116LEZ3f].

- **Meta-analyses**: Long-term bisphosphonate therapy reduces vertebral fractures, with diminishing returns after 3–5 years; rare harms (e.g. atypical femoral fractures) increase with duration, supporting individualized duration decisions [^114Qqq3i] [^112TJ2qa].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommended duration** | **Holiday considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| FDA | 3–5 years initially | Consider discontinuation after 3–5 years if low risk [^113qYnbw] |
| Endocrine Society | 3–5 years initially | Reassess at 3–5 years; holiday for low-to-moderate risk; continue up to 10 years if high risk [^notfound] |
| AACE/ACE | 3–5 years initially | Holiday after 5 years if risk no longer high; continue up to 10 years if high risk [^114wUxoj] |
| ACOG | 3–5 years initially | Holiday after 5 years if low-to-moderate risk; continue up to 10 years if high risk [^111zvn9u] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration

- **Fracture risk**: High-risk patients (low T-score, prior vertebral fracture, glucocorticoid use) benefit from longer therapy (up to 10 years) [^114wUxoj] [^111zvn9u].

- **Age**: Older patients, especially ≥ 70 years, often require longer treatment given higher absolute fracture risk [^114xLEF5].

- **Response to therapy**: Significant BMD gains or stable BMD support continuation; limited response may prompt alternative therapy [^1168sxzv].

- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal intolerance or rare events (e.g. atypical femoral fracture) may necessitate discontinuation or a holiday [^112TJ2qa].

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged therapy

Benefits include sustained vertebral fracture risk reduction and maintained or improved BMD with continued therapy, especially in high-risk patients [^115pbdTr] [^113ShnQq]. Risks include rare atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw, which increase with duration but remain uncommon; the benefit-risk balance remains favorable in appropriately selected patients [^112TJ2qa] [^115hsKH3].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

- **Bone mineral density (BMD)**: Reassess every 1–2 years during therapy and every 2–4 years during holidays [^1168sxzv].

- **Clinical status**: Monitor for new fractures, adverse effects, and changes in risk factors (e.g. new glucocorticoid use) [^113QPAfF].

- **Bone turnover markers**: Consider to assess response or guide holiday decisions in select cases [^1168sxzv].

---

## Circumstances for discontinuation or drug holiday

- **Low-to-moderate risk**: Consider a holiday after 3–5 years if BMD is stable and no new fractures occur [^11321AQ1].

- **High-risk**: Continue up to 10 years; if a holiday is considered, keep it short (≤ 1–2 years) with close monitoring [^112syzA1].

- **Adverse effects**: Discontinue if atypical femoral fracture or severe gastrointestinal intolerance occurs [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

The typical duration of alendronate therapy is **3–5 years**, with individualized decisions thereafter based on fracture risk, response, and adverse effects. High-risk patients may benefit from up to 10 years, while low-to-moderate risk patients may take a 1–3 year holiday with monitoring. Regular reassessment of risk, BMD, and clinical status is essential to optimize outcomes [^1129L4dq].

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^1117ccbw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts (bone cells that break down bone tissue). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women at lower and higher risk of fracture, respectively.

Search Methods

We searched Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (which includes CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, drug approval agency websites, and the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews to identify the studies included in this review. The latest search date was 01 February 2023. We imposed no restrictions on language, date, form of publication, or reported outcomes.

Eligibility Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of alendronate on postmenopausal women. Targeted participants must have received at least one year of alendronate. We classified a study as secondary prevention if its population met one or more of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, a low bone mineral density T-score (-2.5 or lower), and 75 years old or older. If a study population met none of those criteria, we classified it as a primary prevention study.

Outcomes

Our major outcomes were clinical vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Based on the previous review experience, in which the clinical and methodological characteristics in the primary and secondary prevention studies were homogeneous, we used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis and estimated effects using the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Our base case analyses included all eligible placebo-controlled studies with usable data. We selected the data available for the longest treatment period. We consider a relative change exceeding 15% as clinically important.

Included Studies

We included 119 studies, of which 102 studies provided data for quantitative synthesis. Of these, we classified 34 studies (15,188 participants) as primary prevention and 68 studies (29,577 participants) as secondary prevention. We had concerns about risks of bias in most studies. Selection bias was the most frequently overlooked domain, with only 20 studies (19%) describing appropriate methods for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Eight studies (8%) were at low risk of bias in all seven domains.

Synthesis Of Results

The base case analyses included 16 primary prevention studies (one to five years in length; 10,057 women) and 20 secondary prevention studies (one to three years in length; 7375 women) which compared alendronate 10 mg/day (or 70 mg/week) to placebo, no treatment, or both. Indirectness, imprecision, and risk of bias emerged as the main factors contributing to the downgrading of the certainty of the evidence. For primary prevention, alendronate may lead to a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (16/1190 in the alendronate group versus 24/926 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.84; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.9% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence) and non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; ARR 1.6% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.3% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, clinically important differences were not observed for the following outcomes: hip fractures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; ARR 0.2% fewer, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 0.2% more; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49; ARR 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 1.1% more; low-certainty evidence); withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18; ARR 0.2% more, 95% CI 0.9% fewer to 1.5% more; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; ARR 0.5% more, 95% CI 1.2% fewer to 2.8% more; low-certainty evidence). For secondary prevention, alendronate probably results in a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (24/1114 in the alendronate group versus 51/1055 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; ARR 2.7% fewer, 95% CI 3.5% fewer to 1.3% fewer; moderate-certainty evidence). It may lead to a clinically important reduction in non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; ARR 2.8% fewer, 95% CI 5.1% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); hip fractures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.96; ARR 1.0% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90; ARR 1.8% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; ARR 3.5% fewer, 95% CI 5.8% fewer to 0.6% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, the effects of alendronate for withdrawals due to adverse events are uncertain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.16; ARR 0.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.7% fewer to 1.3% more; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the updated evidence for the safety risks of alendronate suggests that, irrespective of participants' risk of fracture, alendronate may lead to little or no difference for gastrointestinal adverse events. Zero incidents of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

For primary prevention, compared to placebo, alendronate 10 mg/day may reduce clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, but it might make little or no difference to hip and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. For secondary prevention, alendronate probably reduces clinical vertebral fractures, and may reduce non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, and serious adverse events, compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alendronate on withdrawals due to adverse events.

### Which drug next? Sequential therapy for osteoporosis [^117KvzpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The proliferation of drugs with unique modes of action for treating osteoporosis has been most welcome. Fear of complications, even though rare, associated with long-term bisphosphonates (BPs) changed prescribing patterns. The BPs are stored in bone for years. Drugs not stored in bone; for example, abaloparatide, teriparatide, denosumab, and romosozumab have expanded our armamentarium for treating osteoporosis but have brought new challenges. Bone accrued during treatment with the last 3 drugs, and perhaps abaloparatide, is lost rapidly after their withdrawal due to rebound increase in bone resorption. Treatment with these drugs must be followed by administration of an antiresorptive agent. The article by Kendler et al. (1) in this issue of JCEM reports alendronate preserves bone accrued during administration of denosumab.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^112Rnpie]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the largest comparative effectiveness study conducted to date, we found clinically meaningful reductions in the risk of fracture for patients treated with denosumab vs alendronate in a representative cohort of almost half a million treatment-naïve women with PMO in the US. Over a nearly 8-yr follow-up period, we found greater reductions in the risk of fracture with longer duration of use, which provides complimentary evidence to the results from the original registrational clinical trial and its long-term extension. As fractures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, this study provides clinically meaningful evidence, comparing available osteoporosis medicines to help guide physicians, patients, and policymakers, and may translate into significant improvement in the quality of life of women with PMO.

### Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^115r3ExB]. Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced bone loss is dose- and duration-related, develops rapidly (within months of therapy), and leads to an increased risk of fractures. Moreover, less than one in four patients prescribed oral glucocorticoids receive any treatment to prevent or treat osteoporosis. The American College of Rheumatology recommends bisphosphonate therapy to prevent bone loss in most patients beginning long-term glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone equivalent of ≥ 5 mg/day for at least 3 months), and in men and postmenopausal women receiving long-term glucocorticoids who have an abnormal bone mineral density (T score below -1). Patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis are at particularly high risk for fractures, and should be treated aggressively to reduce fracture risk. Risedronate is approved in the United States for both prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and alendronate is approved for treatment. Both drugs increase bone mass in patients with established glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Risedronate has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of fractures after 1 year of treatment. Prevention or treatment of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss is recommended for patients at risk.

The risk–benefit balance of bisphosphonates can be evaluated by the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). Although the NNT for preventing typical osteoporosis fractures is largely favorable in the early years of treatment, the NNH for serious adverse events such as AFF increases with extended therapy. In White women, bisphosphonate use corresponded to a NNT for preventing a typical fragility hip fractures of approximately 350 and 170 at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In contrast, in Asian women, the NNT was greater at 575 and 278 at 5 and 10 years, respectively. After five years of treatment, the NNH to cause an AFF was 12,500 for all women. However, The NNH decreased after 10 years of continuous treatment to 2,630. Of note, the NNH at 10 year was disproportionately lower among Asian women at only 424, thus indicating a higher rate of AFF compared to the overall population. The study also identified other risk factors for AFF, beside Asian ethnicity, including reduced height, weight, and glucocorticoid use. Importantly, the risk of AFF decreased rapidly after discontinuation of bisphosphonates, highlighting the importance of considering so called drug holidays. These therapy transitions to other types of medications are intended to mitigate long‐term risks while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of fracture prevention. This balance in risk and benefit among different ethnic groups of women, in particular, necessitates careful consideration on the selective timing and duration of bisphosphonate therapy.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, duration, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering a bisphosphonate holiday after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates, if fracture risk is no longer high (such as a T score > -2.5, or if the patient has remained fracture free), but continue treatment up to an additional 5 years if fracture risk remains high.

### Effects of continuing or stopping alendronate after 5 years of treatment… [^116LEZ3f]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

A small sample of 18 transilial bone biopsies did not show any qualitative abnormalities, with bone turnover seen in all specimens. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 00398931 Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the disease process is characterized by increased bone turnover, progressive loss of bone mass, microarchitectural deterioration, and increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates, which are antiresorptive drugs, are the most commonly used pharmacologic treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate, a potent bisphosphonate, decreases bone turnover, increases bone mineral density, and decreases vertebral, nonspine, and hip fracture risk in women with osteoporosis. 1–4. Treatment for osteoporosis often continues indefinitely, but few studies have examined the effects of using bisphosphonates longer than 5 years or the effects of stopping treatment after 5 years.

A small number of participants in a phase 3 study of alendronate were followed up for as long as 10 years of continued treatment. 5 Among women who continued alendronate, spinal BMD increased throughout the entire treatment period, with maintenance of increases in hip BMD. Pharmacokinetic studies show that bisphosphonates remain in bone matrix for many years, and the incorporated bisphosphonate remains inactive until it is gradually released as bone containing it is resorbed. The terminal half-life of alendronate is similar to that of bone mineral, approximately 10. 5 years. 7 Thus, some of the skeletal effects of alendronate and other bisphosphonates may last for years after treatment stops. Average follow-up in the FIT vertebral fracture arm was 2. 9 years and in the clinical fracture arm was
4. 2 years. One year of alendronate, 10 mg/d, was offered at no cost to all participants at the end of FIT.

Thereafter, women were encouraged to consult their personal physicians regarding continued treatment. The FLEX results are generally consistent with findings from a smaller long-term study of alendronate reported by Bone et al. 5 In both studies, the difference in BMD between continuous alendronate for 10 years and treatment with alendronate for 5 years followed by placebo for 5 years was about 4% for spine BMD and about 3% to 4% at the hip.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1113xGtU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bisphosphonate treatment up to 5 years shows fracture risk reductions in direct placebo-controlled meta-analyses: alendronate reduced vertebral (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.67), hip (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.92), and nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.93); risedronate reduced vertebral (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.77), hip (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.94), and nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.89); ibandronate lowered vertebral fractures (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.97) with no evidence for hip or nonvertebral reduction; and zoledronic acid reduced vertebral (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.84) and hip fractures (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.79) with an 18% nonvertebral reduction (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.07), while a network meta-analysis reported a 21% reduction in nonvertebral fractures (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.94). After hip fracture, zoledronic acid reduced all clinical fractures by 35% (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.84) and mortality by 28% (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.93), although mortality reduction was not shown in other trials.

### Alendronate sodium [^111PhUfX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Weekly Dosing

The safety of alendronate sodium 35 mg once weekly compared to alendronate sodium 5 mg daily was evaluated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of 723 patients. The overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg and alendronate sodium 5 mg daily were similar.

The adverse reactions from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with either once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg, alendronate sodium 5 mg/day or placebo are presented in Table 3.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy

In two studies (of one and two years' duration) of postmenopausal osteoporotic women (total: n = 853), the safety and tolerability profile of combined treatment with alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily and estrogen ± progestin (n = 354) was consistent with those of the individual treatments.

Osteoporosis in Men

In two placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in men (a two-year study of alendronate sodium 10 mg/day and a one-year study of once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg) the rates of discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event were 2.7% for alendronate sodium 10 mg/day vs. 10.5% for placebo, and 6.4% for once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg vs. 8.6% for placebo. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with either alendronate sodium or placebo are presented in Table 4.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^111tu5PJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a chronic disease associated with age-related declines in bone mass, changes in bone microarchitecture, and skeletal fragility. These changes place postmenopausal women at increased risk of fragility fractures, which are linked to significant morbidity, economic cost, and negative impact on health-related quality of life. Antiresorptive therapies, including bisphosphonates and denosumab, have been demonstrated to reduce fracture incidence and increase bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, although the optimal duration and sequencing of available treatments remain poorly understood. Whereas bisphosphonates bind to bone mineral and become incorporated into bone matrix, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), is a reversible therapy. There is a rebound in bone turnover after treatment cessation, leading to loss of the bone density gained on treatment and loss of vertebral fracture protection. If denosumab is discontinued, follow-on therapy with a bisphosphonate has been recommended to prevent reversible bone loss, although limited data are available on patients transitioning from denosumab to bisphosphonates, such as alendronate.

The Denosumab Adherence Preference Satisfaction (DAPS) study was a 24-month study designed to compare adherence to denosumab with alendronate over 12 months in postmenopausal women with low BMD. Participants were randomized to receive denosumab or alendronate for the first year, after which they crossed over to receive the other treatment for the second year. We previously reported that the primary efficacy endpoints of adherence, preference, and satisfaction favored injectable denosumab over oral alendronate and that alendronate could maintain the gains in BMD achieved with 1 year of denosumab treatment. Here we perform a descriptive subanalysis of participants randomized to the denosumab/alendronate sequence to investigate the effect of transitioning to alendronate.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^113Kz4K2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, bisphosphonates, ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate bisphosphonates as initial therapy in most postmenopausal patients at increased risk of fracture. Consider discontinuing bisphosphonates to allow a drug holiday in low-to-moderate risk patients being stable after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or after 3 years of therapy with IV zoledronic acid. Consider continuing treatment for longer durations of up to 10 years for oral bisphosphonates or up to 6 years for IV zoledronic acid in patients at high risk of fracture. (CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE.

### ACTIVExtend: 24 months of alendronate after 18 months of abaloparatide or placebo for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^112E1V6o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Anabolic drugs are important therapeutic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. To date, anabolic drugs approved for the treatment of osteoporosis act via PTH receptor type 1 (PTH1R). Although there are differences between the agents, they also share common characteristics. They stimulate bone formation and resorption and have important effects on bone microstructure, mass, and strength, while transiently increasing the remodeling space. Regulatory authorities limit the use of anabolic drugs for postmenopausal osteoporosis to 18 to 24 months. An important characteristic typical of PTH and PTH-related agents is loss of bone mass that occurs soon after they are discontinued when an antiresorptive agent is not subsequently administered. Whereas bone anabolic agents increase the volume of bone, leading to an increase in measured bone mineral density (BMD), antiresorptive agents increase BMD mainly by decreasing the remodeling space and increasing the degree of mineralization. For this reason, sequential therapy with alendronate (ALN) following PTH 1–84 was employed in an extension of the phase 2 trial, resulting in further gains in BMD. Investigations of sequential and combination therapeutic schemes employing PTH1R-mediated agents and antiresorptives have subsequently been performed. The overall result has been that such studies, as well as recent studies of romosozumab followed by an antiresorptive, have demonstrated cumulative gains in BMD when a drug that promotes bone formation is followed by an antiresorptive. However, until now, an adequate, formal fracture-endpoint trial of sequential therapy with a PTH1R-mediated anabolic agent followed by a potent antiresorptive agent has not been reported. As a result, the prescribing information for such agents has not addressed measures to sustain their beneficial effects.

### Efficacy of bisphosphonates in reducing fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis [^111Ru8GU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates have been available for more than a decade. Currently, 4 bisphosphonates — alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid — are approved in the United States. Alendronate and risedronate are oral agents, ibandronate is available in oral and intravenous formulations, and zoledronic acid is an intravenous drug. This review summarizes results from pivotal clinical trials in which these bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce risk for osteoporotic fractures. Also reviewed are results of "bridging" studies designed to demonstrate the comparable efficacy of less frequent dosing regimens to increase bone mineral density and to reduce bone turnover. Compared with placebo controls, all 4 approved bisphosphonates reduce the relative risk of new vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid reduce the relative risk of new nonvertebral and hip fractures. Clinical trial extensions of up to 10 years with alendronate and 7 years with risedronate have shown that efficacy is maintained during long-term treatment.

### Alendronate sodium (Binosto) [^112J2LyB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for:

Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1.1)
Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis (1.2)

Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use (1.3)

1.1	Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .]

1.2	Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis

BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3	Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113Dhr5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength that increases the risk for fracture. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually. In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, that has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures. However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period. In this Beyond the Guidelines, 2 experts discuss management of osteoporosis in general and for a specific patient, the role of bone density monitoring during and after a 5-year course of alendronate, and treatment recommendations for a patient whose bone density decreases during or after a 5-year course of alendronate.

### Long-term outcome of weekly bisphosphonates [^115baLP2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bisphosphonates currently are the preferred therapy for treating osteoporosis. Treatment with potent bisphosphonates such as alendronate or risedronate decreases biochemical markers of bone turnover and increases bone mineral density. These changes are associated with significant reductions in vertebral and nonvertebral fracture risk. Clinical trial data with up to 10 years of followup shows these agents are effective and well tolerated for long-term periods. Daily administration is effective and generally well tolerated. However, once weekly doses are more convenient, which may enhance long-term compliance and lead to more successful outcomes. The pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action predict the short-term and long-term skeletal effects and safety profile of once-weekly doses of bisphosphonates are similar to daily doses. These predictions are supported by authors of trials of up to 2 years who report once-weekly doses are therapeutically equivalent to daily doses in terms of BMD and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. Once-weekly bisphosphonate doses have safety and tolerability profiles as good as daily doses and are comparable with the placebo.

### Effect of oral alendronate on bone mineral density and the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. the alendronate phase III osteoporosis treatment study group [^112sm93Z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1995). Excellent credibility.

The study Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study was published by Liberman UA and colleagues in 1995 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the trial question was: what is the role of alendronate therapy in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis? In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the population was: 994 female patients. The inclusion criteria were postmenopausal female patients with osteoporosis. The key exclusion criteria were treatment with corticosteroids, vitamin D deficiency, Paget's disease, or hyperparathyroidism, active peptic ulcer disease, abnormal renal function, or abnormal hepatic function. In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the interventions were: n = 526 alendronate (5 or 10 mg daily for three years, or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year) n = 355 placebo (matching placebo). In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in new vertebral fractures (3.2% vs. 6.2%; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in progression of vertebral deformities (33% vs. 41%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.51). In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study study, the conclusion was: in postmenopausal female patients with osteoporosis, alendronate was superior to placebo with respect to new vertebral fractures.

### Mineralization density distribution of postmenopausal osteoporotic bone is restored to normal after long-term alendronate treatment: qBEI and sSAXS data from the fracture intervention trial long-term extension (FLEX) [^116em26D]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment studies showed that the therapeutic effects of alendronate (ALN) were sustained over a 10-year treatment period. However, data on the effects on intrinsic bone material properties by long-term reduction of bone turnover are still sparse. We analyzed transiliacal bone biopsies of a subgroup of 30 Fracture Intervention Trial Long-Term Extension (FLEX) participants (n = 6 were treated for 10 years with ALN at dose of 10 mg/day, n = 10 were treated for 10 years with ALN at dose of 5 mg/day, and n = 14 were treated for 5 years with ALN plus a further 5 years with placebo) by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI) and scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (sSAXS) to determine the bone mineralization density distribution (BMDD) and the mineral particle thickness parameter T. BMDD data from these FLEX participants were compared with those from a previously published healthy population (n = 52). Compared with 5 years of ALN plus 5 years of placebo 10 years of ALN treatment (independent of the dose given) did not produce any difference in any of the BMDD parameters: The weighted mean (Ca(mean)), the typical calcium concentration (Ca(peak)), the heterogeneity of mineralization (Ca(width)), the percentage of low-mineralized bone areas (Ca(low)), and the portion of highly mineralized areas (Ca(high)) were not different for the patients who continued ALN from those who stopped ALN after 5 years. Moreover, no significant differences for any of the BMDD parameters between the FLEX participants and the healthy population could be observed. In none of the investigated cases were abnormally high mineralization or changes in mineral particle thickness observed (Ca(high) and T were both in the normal range). The findings of this study support the recommendation that antiresorptive treatment with ALN should be maintained for 5 years. Even with longer treatment durations of up to 10 years, though, no negative effects on bone matrix mineralization were observed.

### The effect of 3 versus 6 years of zoledronic acid treatment of osteoporosis: a randomized extension to the HORIZON-pivotal fracture trial (PFT) [^115guJbX]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

In comparison to our ZOL results, data on efficacy and safety of other bisphosphonates beyond 3 to 5 years varies and is limited. A similar extension study to ours was performed for alendronate. Patients with an average of 5 years of previous alendronate were rerandomized and continued on alendronate 5 or 10 mg/day or placebo for 5 more years. In that extension study, 3-year results were similar to ours, showing a small decline in BMD (approximately 1% to 2% at the hip and 2% to 3% at the spine), and 5-year results showed no reduction in clinical nonvertebral fractures. The alendronate extension study also showed a reduction in vertebral fractures, but only for clinical, not morphometrically defined fractures. Over the 5 years of the follow-up, there was a larger resolution of effect for bone turnover after alendronate than we showed over 3 years of follow-up after ZOL. From these data, the authors concluded that women at high risk of vertebral fractures or those with very low BMD might be best continued after 5 years of alendronate but that others could safely discontinue. In comparison to our ZOL data and those for alendronate, which show a similar residual effect, the limited data for risedronate suggest faster offset and less residual effect, and there are no long-term data for ibandronate. It is important that clinicians do not assume that the residual effects observed with ZOL and alendronate apply to other bisphosphonates.

### Clinical and therapeutic aspects of osteoporosis [^112e816J]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and alteration in bone architecture, resulting in increased fracture risk. These fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and impose a huge economic burden on health services. Oestrogen deficiency plays a major role in the pathogenesis of bone loss and fracture in both women and men. Other pathogenetic factors include reduced physical activity and vitamin D insufficiency. A range of options is available for the prevention of fractures in high risk postmenopausal women. These include the bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, raloxifene and parathyroid hormone peptides. Because of their broad spectrum of demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy, alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate and strontium ranelate are generally considered as front-line options for most women. The optimum duration of treatment has not been established but re-evaluation of risk and the need for continued therapy after 5 years of treatment may be appropriate. Compliance and persistence with long-term treatment is poor but may be improved by less frequent dosing regimens.

Optimal duration of treatment and drug holidays — "treatment of 3 to 5 years" with osteoporosis therapies is "highly beneficial with only minimal risk", but long-term decisions depend on medication type. For bisphosphonates, evidence "includes two randomized trials (one of alendronate and one of zoledronic acid)" and data "beyond 5 years", and "These studies support a residual effect of bisphosphonates after stopping, which support bisphosphonate holidays". In contrast, "for all other therapies… after discontinuation, benefits are quickly lost", so "these therapies must be continued indefinitely or followed with bisphosphonates or another type of therapy to retain the gains achieved".

### Spontaneous femoral shaft fracture after long-term alendronate [^113Q4scg]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

Alendronate is used as first-line treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women worldwide. The evidence supporting its benefit in reducing the risk of fragility fracture among this high-risk group is well established. Due to its mechanism of action, there were concerns about potential reduction in bone turnover, repair of microdamage and hence reduced bone toughness and increased risk of fractures with long-term use. A number of cases have been reported from other countries describing a pattern of atraumatic mid-femoral fractures in women on long-term alendronate therapy. We present a case of an atraumatic femoral shaft fracture in an elderly woman on long-term alendronate therapy admitted to a UK Hospital.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^112cvFho]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) provided guidance on managing the discontinuation of denosumab to mitigate the rebound effect. The ECTS strongly recommended initiating an alternative antiresorptive treatment at the time the patient is due for the next denosumab injection. Moreover, in patients who have been taking denosumab for only one year, switching to alendronate has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing rebound bone loss. The most commonly recommended approach is to administer a potent bisphosphonate such as zoledronate six months after the final dose of denosumab. This timing is crucial because it coincides with the period when denosumab's effects start to wane and the risk of rebound increases. The exact timing of bisphosphonate administration following denosumab discontinuation is still an open question. For example, if bisphosphonates are administered too late (ie, more than nine months after the last denosumab injection), the maximum rebound in bone turnover might have already occurred, reducing the efficacy of bisphosphonates in preventing BMD loss and fractures. Administration of a pulsatile bisphosphonate too early also might not be maximally effective. Indeed, six months after the last dose of denosumab, many patients still have a closed remodeling phase with less exposed bone available for binding by a bisphosphonate. In patients with prolonged denosumab use, the rebound effect is more pronounced, and a single dose of bisphosphonate might not be sufficient, potentially necessitating additional doses or alternative strategies.

If clinically available, monitoring of BTMs after denosumab discontinuation can help tailor subsequent therapy more effectively. For patients showing significant increases in these markers, rapid BMD loss or not responding to a single dose of zoledronic acid, additional doses may be required. If BTMs are not available, then redosing as soon as three months or as late as six months after the first zoledronic acid dose is prudent. Moreover, the ECTS guidance on denosumab discontinuation may present challenges for implementation in the United States and other health systems due to payment concerns. Specifically, the recommendation for BMD assessment at six months after discontinuation, followed by a zoledronic acid infusion at the same time, is often not covered or reimbursed by some health plans. As an alternative approach, if BTMs remain elevated at 6 months, clinicians could consider adding alendronate for 6 months before administering a second dose of zoledronic acid 12 months after denosumab discontinuation.

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^116Ki9SK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Daily Dosing

The safety of alendronate 5 mg/day in postmenopausal women 40–60 years of age has been evaluated in three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving over 1,400 patients randomized to receive alendronate sodium for either two or three years. In these studies the overall safety profiles of alendronate 5 mg/day and placebo were similar.

Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event occurred in 7.5% of 642 patients treated with alendronate 5 mg/day and 5.7% of 648 patients treated with placebo.

Weekly Dosing

The safety of alendronate 35 mg once weekly compared to alendronate 5 mg daily was evaluated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of 723 patients. The overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate 35 mg and alendronate 5 mg daily were similar.

The adverse reactions from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with either once weekly alendronate 35 mg, alendronate 5 mg/day or placebo are presented in Table 3.

Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy

In two studies (of one and two years' duration) of postmenopausal osteoporotic women (total: n = 853), the safety and tolerability profile of combined treatment with alendronate 10 mg once daily and estrogen ± progestin (n = 354) was consistent with those of the individual treatments.

Osteoporosis in Men

In two placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies in men (a two-year study of alendronate 10 mg/day and a one-year study of once weekly alendronate 70 mg) the rates of discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event were 2.7% for alendronate 10 mg/day vs. 10.5% for placebo, and 6.4% for once weekly alendronate 70 mg vs. 8.6% for placebo. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with either alendronate or placebo are presented in Table 4.

### Osteoporosis treatment: updated guidelines from ACOG… [^112RR2VL]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Bisphosphonates, for up to five years orally or three years intravenously, are first-line therapy for osteoporosis.
- Denosumab injections every six months improve bone density more quickly than bisphosphonates, although bone density improvements fade within months after discontinuation unless bisphosphonates are started.
- Parathyroid hormone analog therapy for up to two years dramatically improves bone density and reduces fractures but requires subsequent bisphosphonate use to maintain benefit.
- One year of treatment with romosozumab, a sclerostin-binding analog, followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk more than two years of alendronate therapy alone. Anabolic Agents Anabolic agents restore lost bone structure in advanced osteoporosis and can be considered in patients with a very high risk of fracture. They should be followed by an antiresorptive agent to preserve bone density improvements.

PARATHYROID HORMONE ANALOGS In patients with very high risk of fracture due to a history of severe or multiple vertebral fractures, a T-score of −3 or lower, or multiple risk factors, the parathyroid hormone analogs teriparatide and abaloparatide are highly effective. Parathyroid hormone analogs can also be used in patients whose symptoms do not respond to antiresorptive therapy. Unlike antiresorptive agents, they can restore bone mass that is already lost in patients with advanced osteoporosis. Treatment duration should be limited to two years because of a possible risk of osteosarcoma. Although teriparatide and abaloparatide improve bone density and reduce vertebral and nonvertebral fracture, abaloparatide increases bone density more than teriparatide and more effectively reduces new vertebral fracture.

SCLEROSTIN-BINDING ANALOGS Like the parathyroid hormone analogs, the sclerostin-binding analog romosozumab is an anabolic agent for patients at very high risk of fracture. Use of romosozumab is limited to one year based on the limited duration of studies to date. Treating with romosozumab for one year followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk compared with alendronate treatment for 24 months.

### Alendronate sodium tablet (alendronate) [^114Skw2X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with alendronate 10 mg/day for one or two years, the effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed. Following discontinuation, there were no further increases in bone mass and the rates of bone loss were similar to those of the placebo groups.

Bone Histology

Bone histology in 270 postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with alendronate at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/day for one, two, or three years revealed normal mineralization and structure, as well as the expected decrease in bone turnover relative to placebo. These data, together with the normal bone histology and increased bone strength observed in rats and baboons exposed to long-term alendronate treatment, support the conclusion that bone formed during therapy with alendronate sodium is of normal quality.

Effect on Height

Alendronate sodium, over a three- or four-year period, was associated with statistically significant reductions in loss of height vs. placebo in patients with and without baseline radiographic vertebral fractures. At the end of the FIT studies, the between-treatment group differences were 3.2 mm in the Three-Year Study and 1.3 mm in the Four-Year Study.

Weekly Dosing

The therapeutic equivalence of once-weekly alendronate 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1% (4.8, 5.4%; 95% CI) in the 70 mg once-weekly group (n = 440) and 5.4% (5, 5.8%; 95% CI) in the 10 mg daily group (n = 330). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers.

### Long-term drug therapy and drug discontinuations and holidays for osteoporosis fracture prevention: a systematic review [^114Qqq3i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal long-term osteoporosis drug treatment (ODT) is uncertain.

Purpose

To summarize the effects of long-term ODT and ODT discontinuation and holidays.

Data Sources

Electronic bibliographic databases (January 1995 to October 2018) and systematic review bibliographies.

Study Selection

48 studies that enrolled men or postmenopausal women aged 50 years or older who were being investigated or treated for fracture prevention, compared long-term ODT (> 3 years) versus control or ODT continuation versus discontinuation, reported incident fractures (for trials) or harms (for trials and observational studies), and had low or medium risk of bias (ROB).

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently rated ROB and strength of evidence (SOE). One extracted data; another verified accuracy.

Data Synthesis

Thirty-five trials (9 unique studies) and 13 observational studies (11 unique studies) had low or medium ROB. In women with osteoporosis, 4 years of alendronate reduced clinical fractures (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.82]) and radiographic vertebral fractures (both moderate SOE), whereas 4 years of raloxifene reduced vertebral but not nonvertebral fractures. In women with osteopenia or osteoporosis, 6 years of zoledronic acid reduced clinical fractures (HR, 0.73 [CI, 0.60 to 0.90]), including nonvertebral fractures (high SOE) and clinical vertebral fractures (moderate SOE). Long-term bisphosphonates increased risk for 2 rare harms: atypical femoral fractures (low SOE) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (mostly low SOE). In women with unspecified osteoporosis status, 5 to 7 years of hormone therapy reduced clinical fractures (high SOE), including hip fractures (moderate SOE), but increased serious harms. After 3 to 5 years of treatment, bisphosphonate continuation versus discontinuation reduced radiographic vertebral fractures (zoledronic acid; low SOE) and clinical vertebral fractures (alendronate; moderate SOE) but not nonvertebral fractures (low SOE).

Limitation

No trials studied men, clinical fracture data were sparse, methods for estimating harms were heterogeneous, and no trials compared sequential treatments or different durations of drug holidays.

Conclusion

Long-term alendronate and zoledronic acid therapies reduce fracture risk in women with osteoporosis. Long-term bisphosphonate treatment may increase risk for rare adverse events, and continuing treatment beyond 3 to 5 years may reduce risk for vertebral fractures. Long-term hormone therapy reduces hip fracture risks but has serious harms.

### Clinical practice. postmenopausal osteoporosis [^113WfNAn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Key Clinical Points Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Fractures and osteoporosis are common, particularly among older women, and hip fractures can be devastating. Treatment is generally recommended in postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score indicating increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates (generic) and denosumab reduce the risk of hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; bisphosphonates are commonly used as first-line treatment in women who do not have contraindications. Teriparatide reduces the risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures have been reported with treatment but are rare. The benefit-to-risk ratio for osteoporosis treatment is strongly positive for most women with osteoporosis. Because benefits are retained after discontinuation of alendronate or zoledronic acid, drug holidays after 5 years of alendronate therapy or 3 years of zoledronic acid therapy may be considered for patients at lower risk for fracture.

### Intermittent dosing of alendronate [^116GUfRA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review data describing use of intermittent dosing of alendronate.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-May 2001) and EMBASE (1974-May 2001) databases to identify all information regarding intermittent dosing of alendronate.

Data Synthesis

A small number of clinical studies have evaluated the use of intermittent alendronate dosing in an attempt to improve patient compliance and adverse events.

Conclusions

Evidence from more controlled clinical trials and postmarketing data are needed to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of intermittent alendronate dosing. The definitive role of intermittent dosing in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis remains to be determined.

### Clinical evaluation of cost efficacy of drugs for treatment of osteoporosis: a meta-analysis [^1169HXG6]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the cost efficacy of available regimens for therapy of osteoporosis as defined as the cost time's number need to treat to prevent one fracture.

Methods

Existing meta-analyses were supplemented through electronic databases SCOPUS and PubMed between 2013 (a date overlapping the latest meta-analyses) and March 2016. Primary references included all randomized controlled trials of anti-osteoporotic drugs versus comparators using search terms "osteoporosis", "random", and "trial".

Results

There were 43 evaluable randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 71,809 postmenopausal women comparing fracture frequency. Trials were similar in recruitment age (mean ± SD, 67.3 ± 8.1 years) and follow-up duration (25.5 ± 12.6 months). Cost comparisons were evaluated for a treatment strategy assuming generic alendronate as first-line therapy. Denosumab and teriparatide showed benefits in vertebral fracture reduction over alendronate at incremental costs respectively of $46,000 and $455,000 per fracture prevented. Zoledronate, recently released as a generic, would be either less expensive or comparable in cost. None of the alternate medicines were statistically better in preventing hip fractures. Teriparatide was more effective in preventing nonvertebral fractures at an incremental cost of $1,555,000.

Conclusion

The most cost-effective initial therapy of postmenopausal osteoporosis is generic oral alendronate or generic parenteral zoledronate. There is no statistically significant difference in efficacy of available drugs to prevent hip fractures. There are limited data to suggest switching drugs after sustaining an osteoporotic fracture while on oral alendronate therapy, although generic zoledronate may be considered on the basis of side effects or questions of medication adherence.

### The effect of 3 versus 6 years of zoledronic acid treatment of osteoporosis: a randomized extension to the HORIZON-pivotal fracture trial (PFT) [^1118szvv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

These results provide some guidance for clinicians in deciding whether to continue a patient on ZOL beyond 3 years. Changes in bone density and markers suggest statistically significant, but small differences between continuing and stopping medication after 3 years for up to 3 years. There was no difference for any type of clinical fracture, although a 49% lower risk of morphometric vertebral fractures was found in those continuing on ZOL. Incident morphometric vertebral fractures have been shown to be associated with significant pain, limited activity, disability, and increased future fracture risk.–Although there was no significant decrease in clinical vertebral fractures, the confidence interval for all categories of clinical fracture were wide and therefore we cannot exclude some potential benefit. Overall, the results suggest that after 3 years of initial treatment, many patients may discontinue therapy for up to 3 years or decrease frequency of infusion. However, based on the reduction in morphometric fractures, those who are at high fracture risk, particularly vertebral fracture, may benefit from continued annual infusions. A previous study of alendronate suggested that those with existing vertebral fractures or very low BMD after initial alendronate treatment were at highest risk of new fractures and may most benefit by continuing. Future analyses in our study will examine in detail factors that might aid clinical decision making regarding continuation: preliminary results are consistent with those from FLEX showing increased fracture risk in those who discontinued among those with very low BMD or existing vertebral fractures after an initial course of therapy. Long-term benefits must be balanced against any possible safety concerns including ONJ, atypical femur fracture, or other possible AEs. In some patients, clinicians might consider less frequent dosing, which may potentially provide similar efficacy while decreasing cumulative drug exposure, although it has not been studied after previous annual infusions.

### New national osteoporosis guidance-implications for geriatricians [^114xLEF5]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment approaches

Oral alendronate remains a highly clinically effective and cost-effective first-line anti-osteoporosis treatment, which is suitable for the majority of older people with high fracture risk, and, after consideration, for many with very high fracture risk unsuitable for parenteral intervention. Notably, because older people have such high absolute fracture risks, the number needed to treat (NNT) is relatively few; in a ' ' setting in Sweden, within a population aged ≥ 80 years recruited from hospitals and care homes, the NNT with oral alendronate to prevent a hip fracture was 26, and any fracture 20, compared against a number needed to harm, by causing mild upper gastrointestinal symptoms, of 91.

Treatment duration and monitoring guidance for people treated with oral bisphosphonates have been tightened. Anyone, either aged 70 years, or with ≥ 2 vertebral fractures, or is taking glucocorticoids, should be counselled from the outset for 10 years of treatment (only those who are younger and at lower risk should be considered for a treatment pause after 5 years). Tolerance to oral bisphosphonates must be checked after 12–16 weeks, adherence must be checked after 1 year and fracture risk must be reassessed after 5 years (sooner if re-fracture or new CRFs develop). This change in emphasis responds to the increased fragility fracture risk seen when anti-resorptive therapy is routinely stopped after 5 years; a decision in higher-risk patients that often fails to balance the far greater risk of typical fragility fracture versus very rare side-effects.

### Long-term use of bisphosphonates in osteoporosis [^112syzA1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Bisphosphonates have been widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Uncommon side effects have emerged in postapproval use. Because bisphosphonates accumulate in bone and are released for months or years after treatment is stopped, it is reasonable to consider the clinical question of how long to treat.

Objective

In this personal perspective, we review the pharmacology and mechanism of action of bisphosphonates and the clinical studies that support their efficacy. We then review the literature for longer-term studies and reports of possible side effects that were not seen in clinical trials.

Results

Bisphosphonates have demonstrated antifracture efficacy in randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 3 and 4 yr duration and have been widely used since the initial release of alendronate in 1995. For zoledronic acid and risedronate, an early effect (fractures reduced within 6–12 months of starting therapy) has been shown. A sustained effect for risedronate has been shown through 5 yr and suggested through 7 yr. Ten-year data with alendronate and 8 yr data with risedronate indicated good tolerability and safety; it is unlikely that longer-term studies will be done. Side effects that emerged in clinical trials include esophageal irritation with oral administration and acute phase response with iv treatment or high-dose oral therapy. Uncommon side effects that have been noted with wide clinical use include osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal complaints, and atypical fractures. The numbers of events are small, and a clear cause-and-effect relationship between these events and bisphosphonate treatment has not been established. Because bisphosphonates accumulate in bone, they create a reservoir leading to continued release from bone for months or years after treatment is stopped. Studies with risedronate and alendronate suggest that if treatment is stopped after 3–5 yr, there is persisting antifracture efficacy, at least for 1–2 yr.

Conclusions

Bisphosphonates are popular and effective for treatment of osteoporosis. Because they accumulate in bone and provide some residual antifracture reduction when treatment is stopped, we recommend a drug holiday after 5–10 yr of bisphosphonate treatment. The duration of treatment and length of the holiday are based on fracture risk and pharmacokinetics of the bisphosphonate used. Patients at mild risk might stop treatment after 5 yr and remain off as long as bone mineral density is stable and no fractures occur. Higher risk patients should be treated for 10 yr, have a holiday of no more than a year or two, and perhaps be on a nonbisphosphonate treatment during that time.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, duration, ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing bisphosphonates to allow a drug holiday for low-to-moderate risk postmenopausal patients being stable after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or after 3 years of therapy with IV zoledronic acid. Consider continuing treatment for longer durations of up to 10 years for oral bisphosphonates or up to 6 years for IV zoledronic acid in patients at high risk of fracture.

### Bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis [^112Zb89u]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis to reduce fracture risk. Because of their long retention time in bone and uncommon side effects, questions have been raised about the optimal duration of therapy. Potential side effects appear to be rare and may not be causally related. Although there is no strong science to guide "drug holidays", there appears to be some lingering antifracture benefit when treatment is stopped, so some time off treatment should be offered to most patients on long-term bisphosphonate therapy. For most patients with osteoporosis, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

### Western osteoporosis alliance clinical practice series: evaluating the balance of benefits and risks of long-term osteoporosis therapies [^114284rA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease that requires life-long strategies to reduce fracture risk. Few trials have investigated the balance of benefits and risk with long-term use of osteoporosis therapies, and fewer still have investigated the consequences of treatment discontinuation. The best available evidence suggests that up to 10 years of treatment with an oral bisphosphonate maintains the degree of fracture risk reduction observed in the 3-year registration trials. With denosumab, 10 years of therapy appears to provide fracture risk reduction similar to or better than that observed in the 3-year registration trial. Available data suggest an increasing but low risk of fractures with atypical features with increasing duration of bisphosphonate therapy. Published data linking duration of therapy to osteonecrosis of the jaw are lacking for bisphosphonates and denosumab. Other side effects associated with denosumab or bisphosphonates do not appear to be related to therapy duration. The antifracture benefits of long-term therapy with bisphosphonates and denosumab in appropriately selected patients outweigh the low risk of serious side effects.

### Duration of bisphosphonate therapy… [^1164BULX]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Oral bisphosphonates significantly reduce clinical fracture risk at four years in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Treatment beyond five years is associated with further reductions in fractures in women with persistent femoral neck T-scores less than −2.
5. Treatment beyond five years in other women with osteopenia or osteoporosis does not result in further decreases in rates of clinical vertebral fractures, nonvertebral fractures, or mortality. Evidence Summary A 2011 meta-analysis of three RCTs in post-menopausal women with primary osteoporosis evaluated continual oral bisphospho-nate treatment vs. discontinuation at five years.

1 Study participants had a bone mineral density of 0. 68 g per cm 2 or less in one trial or a T-score of −2. 5 or less in two trials, or a history of fracture. Oral bisphosphonates included alendronate, 5 or 10 mg per day, or etidronate, 400 mg per day. 2 The study excluded women who had peptic ulcers; history of an endocrine disorder; significant renal, hepatic, or medical problems precluding three years of participation; prior bisphosphonate therapy; or estrogen or calcitonin use within the preceding six months. Patients were randomized to alendronate, 5 mg per day for two years, then 10 mg per day for the remainder of the trial, or placebo. There was a significant decrease in radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures in the whole treatment group, regardless of baseline BMD.

A post-hoc analysis of a 2006 RCT included in the meta-analysis discussed previously evaluated the effect of BMD on the incidence of fractures with continuation or cessation of alendronate in women who initially received five years of treatment.

### Alendronate sodium [^115yZzxx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, alendronate sodium tablets, USP increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1).]

1.2 Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

1.4 Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women receiving glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who have low bone mineral density [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

1.5 Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone who have alkaline phosphatase at least two times the upper limit of normal, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for future complications from their disease. [See Clinical Studies (14.5).]

1.6 Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of alendronate sodium for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Bisphosphonate treatment beyond 5 years and hip fracture risk in older women [^1148cw4L]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

For more than 2 decades, bisphosphonate drugs have been a first-line therapy for preventing osteoporotic fractures, based on strong clinical trial evidence showing significant fracture risk reduction within the first 3 to 5 years of treatment. However, data regarding the optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment to minimize fracture risk beyond this initial period are limited.

In September 2015, a Task Force of the American Society Bone and Mineral Research recommended that a drug holiday be considered following 5 years of oral bisphosphonate treatment in women who were not at high fracture risk, whereas ongoing treatment was felt to benefit women at high fracture risk. Their recommendations were based on collective evidence from clinical trials that each included fewer than 1000 women who continued oral bisphosphonate treatment beyond 5 years. The task force acknowledged the limited evidence as well as its primary focus on symptomatic vertebral fractures and called for more studies of representative populations. The US Food and Drug Administration analyzed pooled datafrom the extension phase of major bisphosphonate clinical trials, and concluded that the benefits of continued treatment beyond 3 to 5 years remained unclear. A retrospective Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study of women who self-reported at least 2 years of bisphosphonate use did not find significant associations of 3 to 5 or 6 to 9 years of treatment with hip fracture, although a 5-year increase in bisphosphonate treatment was associated with increased risk of hip fracture. These reports emphasize the importance of distinguishing efficacy during the first 5 years of bisphosphonate treatment from efficacy beyond this period.

### Use of drug holidays in women taking bisphosphonates [^114ExQsy]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are the cornerstone of treatment for osteoporosis. These agents are generally safe and well-tolerated, but concerns have emerged about adverse effects related to long-term use, namely osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures. For most patients at moderate or high risk of fracture, the benefits of treatment far outweigh these serious but rare risks. Bisphosphonates accumulate in bone with some persistent protective effect after therapy is stopped, making it is reasonable to consider a "drug holiday". The duration of therapy and the length of the holiday should be based on clinical judgment.

### Ten years' experience with alendronate for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [^113ShnQq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antiresorptive agents are widely used to treat osteoporosis. We report the results of a multinational randomized, double-blind study, in which postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were treated with alendronate for up to 10 years.

Methods

The initial three-year phase of the study compared three daily doses of alendronate with placebo. Women in the original placebo group received alendronate in years 4 and 5 and then were discharged. Women in the original active-treatment groups continued to receive alendronate during the initial extension (years 4 and 5). In two further extensions (years 6 and 7, and 8 through 10), women who had received 5 mg or 10 mg of alendronate daily continued on the same treatment. Women in the discontinuation group received 20 mg of alendronate daily for two years and 5 mg daily in years 3, 4, and 5, followed by five years of placebo. Randomized group assignments and blinding were maintained throughout the 10 years. We report results for the 247 women who participated in all four phases of the study.

Results

Treatment with 10 mg of alendronate daily for 10 years produced mean increases in bone mineral density of 13.7 percent at the lumbar spine (95 percent confidence interval, 12.0 to 15.5 percent), 10.3 percent at the trochanter (95 percent confidence interval, 8.1 to 12.4 percent), 5.4 percent at the femoral neck (95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 7.4 percent), and 6.7 percent at the total proximal femur (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 9.1 percent) as compared with base-line values; smaller gains occurred in the group given 5 mg daily. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in a gradual loss of effect, as measured by bone density and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. Safety data, including fractures and stature, did not suggest that prolonged treatment resulted in any loss of benefit.

Conclusions

The therapeutic effects of alendronate were sustained, and the drug was well tolerated over a 10-year period. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in the gradual loss of its effects.

Serious adverse events (≥ 36 Months) — Bisphosphonates and denosumab resulted in no differences in serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events in RCTs. Bisphosphonates were associated with higher risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral or subtrochanteric fractures in observational studies, with higher risk after longer treatment duration. Romosozumab followed by alendronate probably did not increase risk for serious harms or withdrawal due to adverse effects compared with bisphosphonate alone at 12- to 36-month outcome assessment in an RCT. Teriparatide may have resulted in no difference in risk for serious adverse events but probably increased the risk for withdrawal due to adverse events in RCTs.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, bisphosphonates, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate as initial therapy to reduce hip, non-vertebral, and spine fractures in most patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. Consider initiating zoledronate in patients with osteoporosis unable to use oral therapy and as initial therapy in patients at very high risk of fracture. (Grade A; BEL 1) Consider initiating ibandronate as initial therapy in selected patients requiring drugs with spine-specific efficacy. (Grade B; BEL 1) Consider prescribing a bisphosphonate holiday after 5 years of treatment if the fracture risk is no longer high (a T score > -2.5, or if the patient has remained fracture-free), but continue treatment up to an additional 5 years if the fracture risk remains high. (Grade B; BEL 2). Consider prescribing a bisphosphonate holiday after 6–10 years of stability in patients with very high fracture risk. (Grade B; BEL 2) Consider prescribing a bisphosphonate holiday after 3 years of treatment with zoledronate in high-risk patients or until the fracture risk is no longer high, and continue for up to 6 years in very high-risk patients. (Grade A; BEL 1) Decide to end a bisphosphonate holiday based on individual patient circumstances, such as:

- increase in fracture risk

- decrease in bone mineral density beyond the least significant change of the DEXA machine

- increase in bone turnover markers. (Grade A; BEL 1).

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^11321AQ1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Bisphosphonate duration and holiday — postmenopausal osteoporosis — should follow risk reassessment: in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are taking bisphosphonates, we recommend that fracture risk be reassessed after 3 to 5 years; women who remain at high risk should continue therapy, whereas those at low-to-moderate risk should be considered for a "bisphosphonate holiday". A bisphosphonate holiday is operationally defined as a temporary discontinuation of bisphosphonate for up to 5 years, which may be longer depending on BMD and clinical circumstances; evidence is stronger for retention of benefits during a holiday for alendronate and zoledronic acid where randomized extension trials exist. For annual IV zoledronic acid (5 mg), a shorter reassessment period of 3 years is more appropriate based on RCTs showing residual effects after 3 years of annual use, and once a bisphosphonate holiday is initiated, reassess fracture risk at 2- to 4-year intervals.

### Bisphosphonate treatment beyond 5 years and hip fracture risk in older women [^116Vpkjw]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of older women who already received 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, there appeared to be neither hip fracture benefit nor harm associated with discontinuing treatment at study entry or continuing treatment for an additional 5 years. A potential benefit was suggested from continuing an additional 2 years, but the association of discontinuation at 2 years and other points with fracture risk should be further studied in randomized clinical trials. Future investigation should also examine whether such findings apply to women at higher or lower fracture risk and to what degree other fracture outcomes might be affected. Our findings of hip fracture risk are similar to the FLEX randomized clinical trial, in which overall clinical fracture risk was not significantly different between those who took placebo or alendronate for an additional 5 years.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114Ziyv4]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Bisphosphonate duration and drug holiday — effects on remodeling and fracture protection wane slowly over 1–5 y when stopped; a temporary "bisphosphonate holiday" can be considered after 3 to 5 years in patients at low or moderate fracture risk who no longer meet criteria for therapy, as fracture risk increases again after 2 years off oral bisphosphonate therapy. Osteoporosis treatment should be restarted with a significant decline in BMD, an intervening fracture, or other factors altering clinical risk; for those remaining at high risk after 3 to 5 years, continuing the bisphosphonate or switching to denosumab or an osteoanabolic agent is recommended. Therapy considerations note bisphosphonates are appropriate to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis, use with caution in significant renal impairment, and consider a bisphosphonate holiday for women at low or moderate fracture risk.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1129L4dq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — bisphosphonate duration, holiday, sequencing, and special populations: Current evidence suggests that increasing the duration of bisphosphonate therapy to longer than 3 to 5 years reduces risk for new vertebral fractures but not risk for other fractures; however, there is increased risk for long-term harms, therefore, clinicians should consider stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 5 years unless the patient has a strong indication for treatment continuation. The decision for a temporary bisphosphonate treatment discontinuation (holiday) and its duration should be individualized and should be based on baseline risk for fractures, type of medication and its half-life in bone, benefits, and harms. Females initially treated with an anabolic agent should be offered an antiresorptive agent after discontinuation to preserve gains and because of serious risk for rebound and multiple vertebral fractures. Older adults (for example, those aged > 65 years) with osteoporosis may be at increased risk for falls and other adverse events due to polypharmacy or drug interactions, and individualized treatment selection should address contraindications and cautions for drugs indicated to treat osteoporosis based on comorbidities and concomitant medications. There is variable risk for low bone mass in transgender persons based on age at gonadectomy, therapy with sex hormones, distribution of comorbidities, and behavioral risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures.

### The good and the bad about the 2017 American College of Physicians osteoporosis guidelines [^116GXSDb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Physicians (ACP) published a set of guidelines on how to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. As the population ages, the overall risk of fractures increases, thus burdening the health care system. These guidelines review current evidence for osteoporosis management, providing an update to the previous 2008 ACP's guidelines.

Methods

The ACP put forth 6 recommendations addressing the complexities in osteoporosis management based on evidence available through October 2016 with a focus on bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to recommended strength by using the ACP standard methods.

Findings

The ACP recommends anti-osteoporosis therapy with 1 of 3 bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) or denosumab in patients with osteoporosis, while excluding anabolic therapies, and recommends against raloxifene. Although bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment, anabolic therapy and raloxifene may be used in specific situations. Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for 5 years, oversimplifying length of therapy and failing to promote an individualized patient-centered care approach. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a decline in bone mineral density (BMD), which must be addressed. Routine monitoring of BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry is not endorsed during treatment, which leads to underrecognition of management issues. Pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates for male osteoporosis is recommended, although therapies such as denosumab and teriparatide are excluded. Finally, the ACP recommends treatment for women aged ≥ 65 years at high risk for fracture with osteopenia after a discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and medications.

Implications

Osteoporosis management is complex. The 2017 ACP guidelines address challenges faced by clinicians but oversimplify more complex issues. These are among a number of guidelines that are available for osteoporosis management, which may be used in combination with other sources to assist clinicians with diagnostic and management strategies.

### Postmenopausal osteoporosis: a review of latest guidelines [^113mgmFo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone turnover and reduced bone mass, leading to skeletal fragility and heightened fracture risk. It is a growing public health concern with expectations for a continued significant rise of fractures by 50% in 2030. Diagnosis is typically based on body mineral density with a T-score of -2.5 or lower indicating osteoporosis. Treatment duration varies, and is determined by careful monitoring of fracture risk and timing for potential drug holidays. Emerging therapies and ongoing research continue to evolve the landscape of osteoporosis management, aiming to reduce fracture risk and improve patient outcomes.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^113PX9CC]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A corollary concern is that once bisphosphonates are discontinued for an extended period, fragility fractures may recur. US Medicare data were used to examine the fracture risk associated with various lengths of drug holidays among 81,427 women aged 65 years and older who had been adherent to bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate) for at least three years. Discontinuing alendronate therapy for more than two years in more than a quarter of these women was associated with a significantly increased 30% greater risk of fractures compared to those who continued therapy (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–1.4). These findings suggest that extending the duration of a drug holiday beyond two years may significantly increase the risk of hip, humerus, and vertebral fractures. Among 25,000 matched pairs of older adults who had undergone long‐term bisphosphonate therapy (either alendronate or risedronate) followed by a drug holiday (1.8 years on average), hip fracture rates were approximately 18% higher in the group of patients who discontinued risedronate compared to those who discontinued alendronate (12.4 vs 10.6 per 1,000 patient years, HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.34). Although risedronate and alendronate provide significant protection against fractures during active treatment, the shorter tail effect of risedronate may lead to a slightly higher risk of fractures, particularly hip fractures, during extended drug holidays.

Many consider a slightly longer drug holiday duration for zoledronic acid (18–24 months) compared to oral bisphosphonates (no more than 12–24 months for alendronate and perhaps even less for risedronate). Indeed, risedronate drug holidays may pose similar risk to alendronate drug holidays for most patients at up to two years, but over three years the risk was 18% higher. However, decisions should be individualized based on the patient's duration of bisphosphonates therapy, fracture risk profile, and overall health status. Regular monitoring and bone health reassessment are crucial to determining the appropriate time to resume therapy to balance the benefits of fracture prevention with the potential adverse event risks of continued bisphosphonate exposure.

### Duration of treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis: how long to treat and what are the consequences of cessation of treatment? [^112592Yt]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Although a variety of medications are effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, there is concern that long-term use may incur side effects. Consequently, some have proposed discontinuing or temporarily suspending treatment after a defined period of time. As the benefits of fracture risk reduction may recede during this "drug holiday", the clinician may be faced with deciding when to resume therapy (and with which agent) while avoiding the possible cumulative risk of side effects. This article summarizes data regarding length of treatment and the effects of cessation of treatment on bone density, bone turnover markers, and fracture risk.

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^117WXXrH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady-state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption.

### Comparison of risk of osteoporotic fracture in denosumab vs alendronate treatment within 3 years of initiation [^111MPqMe]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

This large nationwide historical cohort study was conducted using routinely and prospectively collected data originating from a health care system with universal coverage. Initiation of denosumab and initiation of alendronate were associated with similar risks of hip fracture or any fracture during a median follow-up of approximately 3 years, regardless of sex, age, or previous fracture.

Randomized clinical trials evaluating head-to-head efficacy of denosumab vs alendronate used BMD as the primary outcome and clinical fractures as an adverse effect or complication. These RCTs, conducted in postmenopausal women, regardless of prior treatment for osteoporosis, both found denosumab to be more efficacious than alendronate in increasing BMD, possibly the best proxy outcome for subsequent fracture risk. Overall, 6 of 8 RCTs, included in 2 meta-analyses, reported results on risk of any fracture. Our finding of no clinically relevant differences between denosumab and alendronate in the risk of hip and any fracture is in line with findings of the RCTs. In addition, our absolute risk estimates are similar to those from the RCTs; however, the absolute number of fractures in our study is considerably higher than the total number of fractures from RCTs included in the 2 meta-analyses. Kendler et alreported the risk of any fracture during 12 months of treatment as 3.2% (8 of 253 patients) in denosumab initiators and 1.6% (4 of 249 patients) in alendronate initiators. McClung et alreported 3.8% (12 of 314 patients) vs 2.2% (1 of 46 patients) risk of any fracture among individuals taking denosumab vs alendronate, respectively, and Brown et alreported 4.0% (24 of 593 patients) vs 3.2% (19 of 586 patients) risk of any fracture after 1 year among individuals taking denosumab vs alendronate. Two additional studies reported the risk of any fracture being 4.4% vs 3.5%and 3.6% vs 3.2%for denosumab users vs alendronate users, respectively, after 1 year of treatment, whereas a third study reported the risk of any fracture within 2 years of treatment as 6.7% vs 4.3%. To our knowledge, no head-to-head RCTs were powered to examine the risk of specific fractures, such as hip fractures, between denosumab and alendronate users. A 1996 meta-analysis based on women has suggested that the risk of hip fracture changes 2.6-fold for each standard deviation in BMD at the hip. The gradient of risk is lower (1.4 vs 1.6) in predicting any other osteoporotic fractures, regardless of the site measured.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, duration, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to decide to end a bisphosphonate holiday based on individual patient circumstances, such as:

- increase in fracture risk

- decrease in bone mineral density beyond the least significant change of the DEXA machine

- increase in bone turnover markers.

### Comparison of risk of osteoporotic fracture in denosumab vs alendronate treatment within 3 years of initiation [^1125SNRL]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), denosumab was more efficacious than bisphosphonates in increasing bone mass among postmenopausal women. Although there is an association of change in BMD with reduction in fracture risk, the magnitude of the association is not well established. The RCTs examined the risk of any fracture as a secondary outcome, finding no difference in the fracture risk between denosumab and alendronate within 1 year of treatment initiation. However, these studies were based on a low number of fractures, and the extent of fracture reduction with denosumab compared with alendronate in routine clinical practice is unclear from the data. Using routinely collected data from population-based health registries in Denmark, we conducted a nationwide cohort study to compare risk of hip and any fracture in patients treated with denosumab and alendronate.

### Randomized trial of effect of alendronate continuation versus discontinuation in women with low BMD: results from the fracture intervention trial long-term extension [^116LuYtv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

To determine the effects of continuation versus discontinuation of alendronate on BMD and markers of bone turnover, we conducted an extension trial in which 1099 older women who received alendronate in the FIT were re-randomized to alendronate or placebo. Compared with women who stopped alendronate, those continuing alendronate for 3 years maintained a higher BMD and greater reduction of bone turnover, showing benefit of continued treatment. However, among women who discontinued alendronate and took placebo in the extension, BMD remained higher, and reduction in bone turnover was greater than values at FIT baseline, showing persistence of alendronate's effects on bone.

Introduction

Prior trials including the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) have found that therapy with alendronate increases BMD and decreases fracture risk for up to 4 years in postmenopausal women with low BMD. However, it is uncertain whether further therapy with alendronate results in preservation or further gains in BMD and if skeletal effects of alendronate continue after treatment is stopped.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a follow-up placebo-controlled extension trial to FIT (FIT long-term extension [FLEX]) in which 1099 women 60–86 years of age who were assigned to alendronate in FIT with an average duration of use of 5 years were re-randomized for an additional 5 years to alendronate or placebo. The results of a preplanned interim analysis at 3 years are reported herein. Participants were re-randomized to alendronate 10 mg/day (30%), alendronate 5 mg/day (30%), or placebo (40%). All participants were encouraged to take a calcium (500 mg/day) and vitamin D (250 IU/day) supplement. The primary outcome was change in total hip BMD. Secondary endpoints included change in lumbar spine BMD and change in markers of bone turnover (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide).

Results

Among the women who had prior alendronate therapy in FIT, further therapy with alendronate (5 and 10 mg groups combined) for 3 years compared with placebo maintained BMD at the hip (2.0% difference; 95% CI, 1.6–2.5%) and further increased BMD at the spine (2.5% difference; 95% CI, 1.9–3. 1%). Markers of bone turnover increased among women discontinuing alendronate, whereas they remained stable in women continuing alendronate. Cumulative increases in BMD at the hip and spine and reductions in bone turnover from 8.6 years earlier at FIT baseline were greater for women continuing alendronate compared with those discontinuing alendronate. However, among women discontinuing alendronate and taking placebo in the extension, BMD remained higher and reduction in bone turnover was greater than values at FIT baseline.

Conclusions

Compared with women who stopped alendronate after an average of 5 years, those continuing alendronate maintained a higher BMD and greater reduction of bone turnover, showing benefit of continued alendronate treatment on BMD and bone turnover. On discontinuation of alendronate therapy, rates of change in BMD at the hip and spine resumed at the background rate, but discontinuation did not result in either accelerated bone loss or a marked increase in bone turnover, showing persistence of alendronate's effects on bone. Data on the effect of continuation versus discontinuation on fracture risk are needed before making definitive recommendations regarding the optimal length of alendronate treatment.

### Time to benefit of bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention of fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115o8Ate]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The clinical decision to initiate bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis requires balancing shorter-term harms and burdens (eg, gastroesophageal irritation or severe musculoskeletal pain) with longer-term benefits in reducing potential fractures.

Objective

To assess the time to benefit (TTB) of bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention of nonvertebral and other fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Data Sources

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were identified from systematic reviews commissioned by the US Preventive Services Task Force (1 review), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1 review), the Cochrane Library (2 reviews), and the Endocrine Society (1 review).

Study Selection

Studies selected were RCTs involving postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of osteoporosis based on existing vertebral fractures or bone mineral density T scores of -2.5 or lower. The selection process was focused on studies of alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid because they are guideline-recommended first-line agents for reducing nonvertebral fractures. Studies were excluded if they did not focus on women with a primary diagnosis of osteoporosis, had no placebo arm, or had a lack of data on time to fracture.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Random-effects Weibull survival curves were fitted and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and TTB for each study. These estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the time to 3 different ARR thresholds (0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for the first nonvertebral fracture. Secondary outcomes included the time to 4 ARR thresholds (0.001, 0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for hip fracture, any clinical fracture, and clinical vertebral fracture.

Results

Of 67 full-text articles identified, 10 RCTs comprising 23 384 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were included either as the original RCT or part of subsequently published pooled analyses. Among the studies, the number of participants ranged from 994 to 7765, with mean (SD) age ranging from 63 (7) years to 74 (3) years and follow-up duration ranging from 12 to 48 months. The pooled meta-analysis found that 12.4 months (95% CI, 6.3–18.4 months) were needed to avoid 1 nonvertebral fracture per 100 postmenopausal women receiving bisphosphonate therapy at an ARRof0.010. To prevent 1 hip fracture, 200 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis would need to receive bisphosphonate therapy for 20.3 months (95% CI, 11.0–29.7 months) at an ARR of 0.005. In addition, 200 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis would need to receive bisphosphonate therapy for 12.1 months (95% CI, 6.4–17.8 months) to avoid 1 clinical vertebral fracture at an ARR of 0.005.

Conclusions and Relevance

This meta-analysis found that the TTB of bisphosphonate therapy was 12.4 months to prevent 1 nonvertebral fracture per 100 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. These results suggest that bisphosphonate therapy is most likely to benefit postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who have a life expectancy greater than 12.4 months.

### Long-term treatment strategies for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^117T3XHx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Osteoporosis guidelines do not usually provide specific recommendations regarding what medication is most appropriate for individual patients. Generic oral bisphosphonates are often considered first-line treatment for osteoporosis, but treatment duration is limited, based on potential long-term safety concerns, and there is no consensus about what to do after 5 years. There are no recommendations concerning long-term management of osteoporosis over 30 or more years of postmenopausal life.

Recent Findings

This review attempts to specify medication choices and provide the best clinical management strategies for women at different stages of life and with different underlying disease severity. Because there is no evidence that considers the entire postmenopausal lifespan, much of the discussion here will be based on expert opinion. The review considers a role for estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators, oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab and the anabolic agents, teriparatide and abaloparatide.

Summary

Optimal sequential monotherapy, over an average of 30 postmenopausal years, should be able to minimize exposure to pharmacology while maximizing benefits on bone strength and minimizing imminent and long-term risk of fracture.

### Alendronate sodium [^113buTKd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fracture Results Across Studies

In the Three-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing at least one new radiographic vertebral fracture from 15.0% to 7.9% (47% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001); in the Four-Year Study of FIT, the percentage was reduced from 3.8% to 2.1% (44% relative risk reduction, p = 0.001); and in the combined U.S./Multinational studies, from 6.2% to 3.2% (48% relative risk reduction, p = 0.034).

Alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new vertebral fractures from 4.2% to 0.6% (87% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies and from 4.9% to 0.5% (90% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the Three-Year Study of FIT. In the Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of osteoporotic women experiencing multiple vertebral fractures from 0.6% to 0.1% (78% relative risk reduction, p = 0.035).

Thus, alendronate sodiumreduced the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women whether or not they had a previous radiographic vertebral fracture.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density

The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of two or three years' duration.

Figure 2 shows the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate sodium 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies.

### Recommendations for the clinical evaluation of agents for treatment of osteoporosis: consensus of an expert panel representing the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD), and the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) [^111tJ2eZ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

A panel of experts representing ASBMR, NOF, and ISCD reviewed evidence and reached consensus that regulatory approval of treatments for osteoporosis should be based on trials with fracture endpoints, lasting 18–24 mo, and extending treatment to 5 yr; other indications could be approved based on BMD and turnover markers.

Introduction

In response to an FDA request for clinical trial guidance in osteoporosis, an expert panel was convened with representatives from the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, the International Society of Clinical Densitometry, and the National Osteoporosis Foundation.

Materials and Methods

The panel used a validated evidence-based expert panel process (the Rand Appropriateness Method) to address issues of trial duration, trial design, use of intermediate endpoints as outcomes, and use of placebo-controlled trials in high-risk patients.

Results and Conclusions

The panel concluded that placebo-controlled trials with fracture endpoints are appropriate and, with informed consent, are ethical for registration of new compounds. Trials may be 18–24 mo in duration for efficacy, assuming longer duration to 5 yr for safety and demonstration of sustained fracture reduction. Once fracture efficacy has been established for a particular agent, intermediate endpoints (e.g. BMD and bone turnover markers) may be used as outcomes for new indications other than corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — duration of therapy and drug holidays: Limit treatment with abaloparatide and teriparatide to 2 years and follow therapy with a bisphosphonate or denosumab (Grade A; BEL 1). Limit treatment with romosozumab to 1 year and follow with a drug intended for long-term use, such as a bisphosphonate or denosumab (Grade B; BEL 1, downgraded due to limited evidence). For oral bisphosphonates, consider a bisphosphonate holiday after 5 years of treatment if fracture risk is no longer high (such as when the T score is greater than −2.5, or the patient has remained fracture free), but continue treatment up to an additional 5 years if fracture risk remains high (Grade B; BEL 2); for very high fracture risk, consider a holiday after 6 to 10 years of stability (Grade B; BEL 2). For zoledronate, consider a bisphosphonate holiday after 3 years in high-risk patients or until fracture risk is no longer high, and continue for up to 6 years in very-high-risk patients (Grade A; BEL 1). The ending of a bisphosphonate holiday should be based on circumstances such as an increase in fracture risk, a decrease in BMD beyond the least significant change of the DXA machine, or an increase in bone turnover markers (Grade A; BEL 1). A holiday is not recommended for non-bisphosphonate antiresorptive drugs, and treatment with such agents should be continued for as long as clinically appropriate (both Grade A; BEL 1). If denosumab therapy is discontinued, patients should be transitioned to another antiresorptive (Grade A; BEL 1).

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^116UqsgT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Denosumab was first approved by the European and US Regulatory authorities in 2010. The first approved monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis, it binds to and inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κβ ligand (RANKL) leading to reduced bone resorption. Denosumab is recommended by the Endocrine Society and others as a first line treatment option for post-menopausal women at high risk for osteoporotic fractures. – Denosumab is also recommended for treatment of osteoporosis in men and in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Denosumab is used for several oncological indications including bone metastases, women with low bone mass receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer and men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer. It is also employed in the treatment of Paget's disease of the bone and fibrous dysplasia. The current paper presents an overview of the safety concerns regarding prolonged exposure to denosumab for the treatment of osteoporosis, the consequences of cessation and the putative harm-reducing strategy of sequential osteoporosis therapy for patients in whom cessation is medically indicated or patient determined. Six-monthly subcutaneous administration of denosumab increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, total hip and distal third radius site compared with both placebo and alendronate. During the initial 36 month FREEDOM trial, it was also shown to reduce the risk of new radiographic vertebral fracture, hip fracture and non-vertebral fracture when compared with placebo. At the time of its approval there was no pre-specified treatment duration and the deleterious rebound effect of denosumab withdrawal on fracture incidence was not fully anticipated.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate indicated for:

Treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1.1, 1.2)
Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis (1.3)
Treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (1.4)
Treatment of Paget's disease of bone (1.5)

Limitations of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. (1.6)

1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, alendronate sodium tablets increase bone mass and reduce the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures).

1.4 Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women receiving glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who have low bone mineral density [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

1.5 Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone who have alkaline phosphatase at least two times the upper limit of normal, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for future complications from their disease. [See Clinical Studies (14.5).]

1.6 Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of alendronate sodium tablets for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bisphosphonate holiday duration and monitoring: Patients who "remain at high risk receive a treatment duration of 10 years for an oral bisphosphonate… or 6 years for IV zoledronate", and for "high fracture risk", "a drug holiday can be considered after 5 years of stability on oral bisphosphonates or 3 years of IV zoledronate". For very high fracture risk, "a non-bisphosphonate treatment (teriparatide) may be offered during the holiday". Observational data indicate higher fracture risk on holiday "especially if their T-scores equal or are worse than −2.5", and "consider resuming therapy in patients who experience fracture or show significant BMD loss". Regarding expected duration by agent, "the holiday might be longest after treatment with zoledronate, shortest after treatment with risedronate, and intermediate after treatment with alendronate".

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^116gfSLw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ms BPS has been taking alendronate for 15 years, a duration of treatment that should be generally discouraged due to the cumulative efficacy of bisphosphonates and concern of rare adverse effects, albeit ones that are more strongly associated with very prolonged bisphosphonate use. A detailed history should explore any previous drug holidays or temporary discontinuation (prescribed or self‐administered). This could help to tailor the length of a new, possible drug holiday. Clinical evaluation should include assessment for thigh or groin pain indicative of prodromal symptoms of AFF and oral examination for dental health status that might affect ONJ risk.

Diagnostic evaluation should include a current DXA scan to assess BMD changes over time. If her BMD has remained stable or improved, and her fracture risk is now moderate to low, initiating a drug holiday might be considered. In addition, DXA images sometimes (if the window of interest is slightly lowered) can be used to screen for AFF and may add value. During her drug holiday, she should be under regular monitoring of BMD and BTMs. A significant decline in BMD or a significant increase in BTMs toward baseline levels may indicate the need to resume therapy. The duration of her drug holiday might vary but is typically less than one year.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bisphosphonate holidays and long-term trials note that longer-acting bisphosphonates accumulate and may have a prolonged residence time in bone, so "bisphosphonate holidays" may be considered. In a post hoc FIT/Long Term Extension (FLEX) analysis of 10 versus 5 years of alendronate, higher-risk women (those with a T-score −2.5 and below) who stopped treatment had nearly twice as many nonvertebral fractures: 21 (28%) versus 15 (15%) with continued treatment, and in the first 2 years the Kaplan-Meier curve for clinical vertebral fractures showed no difference between those who stopped and those who continued. In the HORIZON zoledronate extensions, patients who continued yearly zoledronate for 6 years had significantly fewer morphometric spine fractures than those who switched to placebo after 3 years of treatment, with no differences in clinical vertebral fractures or nonvertebral fractures; in the second extension, after 6 years of treatment and an additional 3 years randomized phase, Three morphometric vertebral fractures were reported with 9 years of treatment compared with 5 with 6 years, and clinical fractures were similar, reported in 10 of the patients who continued for 9 years and in 9 patients who received 6 years of therapy.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^1139XgwN]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, and antiresorptive treatments are often continued for many years. Despite their established efficacy in reducing fracture risk, the most commonly used antiresorptive treatments, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have short‐ and long‐term risks that, coupled with their benefits and other unique characteristics, influence consideration for at least periodic discontinuation. Bisphosphonates retain their effects even after discontinuation due to their prolonged skeletal retention, whereas denosumab discontinuation is associated with a rapid rebound in bone turnover and increased fracture risk. There is controversy about how, when, and why to potentially stop these agents. We discuss both permanent and temporary discontinuation of long‐term treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab. We focus on the reasons and timing for discontinuation as well as strategies to mitigate future fracture risk.

### Secondary fracture prevention: consensus clinical recommendations from a multistakeholder coalition [^113QPAfF]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis-related fractures are undertreated, due in part to misinformation about recommended approaches to patient care and discrepancies among treatment guidelines. To help bridge this gap and improve patient outcomes, the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research assembled a multistakeholder coalition to develop clinical recommendations for the optimal prevention of secondary fracture among people aged 65years and older with a hip or vertebral fracture. The coalition developed 13 recommendations (7 primary and 6 secondary) strongly supported by the empirical literature. The coalition recommends increased communication with patients regarding fracture risk, mortality and morbidity outcomes, and fracture risk reduction. Risk assessment (including fall history) should occur at regular intervals with referral to physical and/or occupational therapy as appropriate. Oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous pharmacotherapies are efficacious and can reduce risk of future fracture. Patients need education, however, about the benefits and risks of both treatment and not receiving treatment. Oral bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate are first-line options and are generally well tolerated; otherwise, intravenous zoledronic acid and subcutaneous denosumab can be considered. Anabolic agents are expensive but may be beneficial for selected patients at high risk. Optimal duration of pharmacotherapy is unknown but because the risk for second fractures is highest in the early post-fracture period, prompt treatment is recommended. Adequate dietary or supplemental vitamin D and calcium intake should be assured. Individuals being treated for osteoporosis should be reevaluated for fracture risk routinely, including via patient education about osteoporosis and fractures and monitoring for adverse treatment effects. Patients should be strongly encouraged to avoid tobacco, consume alcohol in moderation at most, and engage in regular exercise and fall prevention strategies. Finally, referral to endocrinologists or other osteoporosis specialists may be warranted for individuals who experience repeated fracture or bone loss and those with complicating comorbidities (eg, hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease). © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. II. meta-analysis of alendronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women [^1175NWyT]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effect of alendronate on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Data Source

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Controlled trials registry from 1980 to 1999, and we examined citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings.

Study Selection

We included 11 trials that randomized women to alendronate or placebo and measured bone density for at least 1 yr.

Data Extraction

For each trial, three independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted data.

Data Synthesis

The pooled relative risk (RR) for vertebral fractures in patients given 5 mg or more of alendronate was 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43–0.65]. The RR of nonvertebral fractures in patients given 10 mg or more of alendronate was 0.51 (95% CI 0.38–0.69), an appreciably greater effect than for the 5 mg dose. We found a similar reduction in RR across nonvertebral fracture types; in particular, RR reductions for fractures traditionally thought to be "osteoporotic", such as hip and forearm, were very similar to RR reductions for "nonosteoporotic" fractures. Individual studies showed similar results, reflected in the P values of the test of heterogeneity (P = 0.99 for vertebral and 0.88 for nonvertebral fractures). Alendronate produced positive effects on the percentage change in bone density, which increased with both dose and time. After 3 yr of treatment with 10 mg of alendronate or more, the pooled estimate of the difference in percentage change between alendronate and placebo was 7.48% (95% CI 6.12–8.85) for the lumbar spine (2–3 yr), 5.60% (95% CI 4.80–6.39) for the hip (3–4 yr), 2.08% (95% CI 1.53–2.63) for the forearm (2–4 yr), and 2.73% (95% CI 2.27–3.20) for the total body (3 yr). Heterogeneity of the treatment effect of alendronate was not consistently explained by any of our a priori hypotheses; in particular, the effect was very similar in prevention and treatment studies. The pooled RR for discontinuing medication due to adverse effects for 5 mg or greater of alendronate was 1.15 (95% CI 0.93–1.42). The pooled RR for discontinuing medication due to gastro-intestinal (GI) side effects for 5 mg or greater was 1.03 (0.81–1.30, P = 0.83), and the pooled RR for GI adverse effects with continuation of medication was 1.03 (0.98 to 1.07) P = 0.23.

Conclusions

Alendronate increases bone density in both early postmenopausal women and those with established osteoporosis while reducing the rate of vertebral fracture over 2–3 yr of treatment. Reductions in nonvertebral fractures are evident among postmenopausal women without prevalent fractures and have bone mineral density (BMD) levels below the World Health Organization threshold for osteoporosis. The impact on fractures appears consistent across all fracture types, casting doubt on traditional distinctions between osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fractures.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1168sxzv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Bisphosphonate holiday — monitoring and dose adjustment in postmenopausal osteoporosis states that fracture risk and bone mineral density (BMD) should be re-evaluated every 2 to 4 years after discontinuation, and that a significant drop in BMD (or a large increase in bone turnover markers) may lead to reinitiation of therapy before the 5-year maximum holiday is completed; some data suggest that a lower dose of alendronate (5 mg/d) after 5 years can maintain BMD and bone turnover marker levels as effectively as continuing the full dose (10 mg/d), but whether dose reduction decreases atypical femoral fracture (AFF) risk is unknown.

### Managing osteoporosis in patients on long-term bisphosphonate treatment: report of a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research [^115AQZNp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most commonly used medications for osteoporosis. This ASBMR report provides guidance on BP therapy duration with a risk-benefit perspective. Two trials provided evidence for long-term BP use. In the Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term Extension (FLEX), postmenopausal women receiving alendronate for 10 years had fewer clinical vertebral fractures than those switched to placebo after 5 years. In the HORIZON extension, women who received 6 annual infusions of zoledronic acid had fewer morphometric vertebral fractures compared with those switched to placebo after 3 years. Low hip T-score, between -2 and -2.5 in FLEX and below -2.5 in HORIZON extension, predicted a beneficial response to continued therapy. Hence, the Task Force suggests that after 5 years of oral BP or 3 years of intravenous BP, reassessment of risk should be considered. In women at high risk, for example, older women, those with a low hip T-score or high fracture risk score, those with previous major osteoporotic fracture, or who fracture on therapy, continuation of treatment for up to 10 years (oral) or 6 years (intravenous), with periodic evaluation, should be considered. The risk of atypical femoral fracture, but not osteonecrosis of the jaw, clearly increases with BP therapy duration, but such rare events are outweighed by vertebral fracture risk reduction in high-risk patients. For women not at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of BP treatment, a drug holiday of 2 to 3 years can be considered. The suggested approach for long-term BP use is based on limited evidence, only for vertebral fracture reduction, in mostly white postmenopausal women, and does not replace the need for clinical judgment. It may be applicable to men and patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, with some adaptations. It is unlikely that future trials will provide data for formulating definitive recommendations. © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Patterns of osteoporosis medications selection after drug holiday or continued therapy: a real-world experience [^112bbKwu]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Published literature on physicians' preferences and sequential treatment patterns of osteoporosis therapy is scarce.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of patients who received bisphosphonates, denosumab, and/or raloxifene for at least 3 consecutive years or teriparatide for at least 18 months for osteoporosis. Data collection spanned 10 years, from October 2007 to September 2016, at a tertiary care center in the United States.

Results

In total, 12885 patients were identified on the basis of receiving at least 1 treatment at any point in time; 1814 patients were randomly reviewed, and 274 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 68.8 ± 10.7 years, and women represented 90.9% of all the cases. Primary care physicians and rheumatologists constituted 65.7% and 22.6% of the prescribers, respectively. Before instituting a drug holiday, alendronate was the most common initial treatment (percentage, mean duration ± standard deviation in years: 69%, 5.4 ± 2.4 years) followed by ibandronate (9.5%, 4.9 ± 2.1 years) and raloxifene (9.1%, 5.2 ± 1.6 years). Denosumab was the most common second course of treatment, accounting for 29.3% of 82 patients who were subsequently prescribed another therapy, followed by alendronate (24.4%) and zoledronate (20.7%). Among patients who were placed on a drug holiday and eventually restarted on osteoporosis therapy, denosumab was the most common treatment instituted (n = 21), accounting for 40% of the total patients, followed by alendronate (32%) and zoledronate (16%). There was a progressive decline in osteoporosis therapy over the duration of the study.

Conclusion

Alendronate was the most common initial therapy. Denosumab was the most common second course of treatment prescribed.

### Alendronate sodium tablet (alendronate) [^115DJrNe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new vertebral fractures from 4.2% to 0.6% (87% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies and from 4.9% to 0.5% (90% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the Three- Year Study of FIT. In the Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of osteoporotic women experiencing multiple vertebral fractures from 0.6% to 0.1% (78% relative risk reduction, p = 0.035).

Thus, alendronate sodium reduced the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women whether or not they had a previous radiographic vertebral fracture.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density

The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of two or three years' duration.

Figure 2 shows the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies.

### Alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis in men [^114bRLwy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

The study Alendronate for osteoporosis in men was published by Orwoll E and colleagues in 2000 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Osteoporosis in men. In the Alendronate for osteoporosis in men study, the trial question was: what is the role of alendronate in male patients with osteoporosis? In the Alendronate for osteoporosis in men study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Alendronate for osteoporosis in men study, the population was: 241 male patients. The inclusion criteria were male patients with osteoporosis. The key exclusion criteria were medical conditions associated with bone loss or other bone diseases, vitamin D deficiency, renal disease, severe cardiac disease, or history of treatment for osteoporosis. In the Alendronate for osteoporosis in men study, the interventions were: n = 146 alendronate (10 mg daily for up to2 years) n = 95 placebo (matching placebo daily for up to 2 years). In the Alendronate for osteoporosis in men study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in gain in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 2 years (7.1% vs. 1.8%; ARD 5.3, 95% CI 4.3 to 6.3). In the Alendronate for osteoporosis in men study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in vertebral fractures (0.8% vs. 7.1%; RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.2) Significant increase in bone mineral density at the total body at 2 years (2% vs. 0.4%; AD 1.6%, 95% CI 1 to 2.1). In the Alendronate for osteoporosis in men study, the conclusion was: in male patients with osteoporosis, alendronate was superior to placebo with respect to gain in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 2 years.

### Alendronate sodium and cholecalciferol (Fosamax PLUS D) [^113qGT1G]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

FOSAMAX PLUS D is a combination of a bisphosphonate and vitamin D indicated for:

Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1.1)
Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis (1.2)

Limitations of use:

FOSAMAX PLUS D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency. (1.3)
Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. (1.3)

1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

FOSAMAX®PLUS D is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, FOSAMAX PLUS D increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .]

1.2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis

FOSAMAX PLUS D is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Important Limitations of Use

FOSAMAX PLUS D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency.

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of FOSAMAX PLUS D for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Treatment of osteoporosis: all the questions we still cannot answer [^111ELoiJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Many questions remain with regard to the treatment of osteoporosis. The increase in bone mineral density due to bisphosphonates accounts for only a quarter of their antifracture action. The studies of bone mineral density equivalences that have validated certain modes of administration are therefore not relevant. No comparative study on the same patient cohort has been carried out, and the inclusion criteria of the pilot studies on the drugs currently available are all different. This makes any comparison impossible, and thus, the choice of treatment is subjective. Certain combinations (antiresorptive drugs and anabolic agents) are logical, but no major study is available to validate them. Drugs with a long latency period could interfere with later treatments or allow therapeutic windows, but the data in the literature in support of these hypotheses are scarce. The osteoporotic patient will require treatment for 10 to 30 years, depending on the age at diagnosis, but the available data on the efficacy and nontoxicity of the drugs are based on studies of a duration of only 3 or 5 years.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^112cvLgp]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, given her history of two vertebral fractures, Ms BPS would be considered by the ASBMR task force to be at higher risk for future fractures. Moreover, the ASBMR guidance suggests that all patients aged > 70 to 75 years should be considered at high risk, independently from T score improvement. Thus, continuing bisphosphonate or switching to an alternate bone therapy could be justified despite her very prolonged duration of bisphosphonates. If she is agreeable to transitioning to a nonbisphosphonate therapy, options would include osteoanabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, or romosozumab. Romosozumab, in particular, demonstrated significantly greater increases in bone mass and bone strength, as assessed by finite element analysis, compared to teriparatide. We would not generally favor a selective estrogen receptor modulator in this circumstance after alendronate. If a PTH analog is chosen, she should know that there may be a period of slight and temporary bone loss at cortical sites such as the hip. Of note, an antiresorptive agent would again be recommended at the end of any anabolic treatment. It is important to note that osteoanabolic agents may be less effective after 15 years of bisphosphonate therapy compared to a treatment‐naïve patient. Long‐term bisphosphonate use significantly suppresses bone turnover and leads to reduced remodeling surfaces, which are necessary for an optimal anabolic response.

Both patients require comprehensive fracture risk assessments incorporating clinical factors, BMD results, and using validated fracture risk calculators or algorithms. This assessment should consider the limitations of these expert panel generated recommendations for drug holidays and should be heavily guided by shared decision‐making. It is critical to discuss with these sisters the known benefits of fracture prevention against the risks of longer‐term risks of therapy with alendronate and the rebound risk when discontinuing denosumab. The sisters' preferences are paramount, especially when concerns about adverse effects influence their willingness to continue treatment and when the evidence available is not of the highest level.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and side effects of medications used to prevent fractures [^112DQKB8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is an increasing number of effective therapies for fracture prevention in adults at risk of osteoporosis. However, shortcomings in the evidence underpinning our management of osteoporosis still exist. Evidence of antifracture efficacy in the groups of patients who most commonly use calcium and vitamin D supplements is lacking, the safety of calcium supplements is in doubt, and the safety and efficacy of high doses of vitamin D give cause for concern. Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate and denosumab have been shown to prevent spine, nonspine and hip fractures; in addition, teriparatide and strontium ranelate prevent both spine and nonspine fractures, and raloxifene and ibandronate prevent spine fractures. However, most trials provide little information regarding long-term efficacy or safety. A particular concern at present is the possibility that oral bisphosphonates might cause atypical femoral fractures. Observational data suggest that the incidence of this type of fracture increases steeply with duration of bisphosphonate use, resulting in concern that the benefit-risk balance may become negative in the long term, particularly in patients in whom the osteoporotic fracture risk is not high. Therefore, reappraisal of ongoing use of bisphosphonates after about 5 years is endorsed by expert consensus, and 'drug holidays' should be considered at this time. Further studies are needed to guide clinical practice in this area.

KDOQI commentary — bisphosphonate and related osteoporosis therapy considerations in CKD stage 3: There is some evidence from large trials with bisphosphonates, teriparatide, and raloxifene in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, and it appears that treatments with risedronate, alendronate, teriparatide, or raloxifene had similar efficacy in those with moderately decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as in those with mildly decreased or normal eGFR, resulting in improved bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced fractures; this recommendation is applicable to the United States and may apply to older patients with eGFRs in the upper CKD stage 3 range (GFR, 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m²) without laboratory evidence of CKD-MBD. Along with concerns about applicability of treatment effects, there is increasing concern about long-term safety with drugs that are cleared by the kidneys; the work group suggests that secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) be addressed first, and in patients with corrected HPT, stable GFR, and fracture risk that outweighs the potential long-term risk of inducing irreversible low bone turnover, therapy with bisphosphonates may be considered. Because bisphosphonates are likely to prevent fractures only in patients who have increased bone resorption, the work group suggests a bone biopsy when feasible, and if therapy with bisphosphonates is given, lower dose and shorter duration treatment should be considered; this suggested approach is applicable in the United States, although bone biopsy availability may be limited.

How and when to discontinue antiresorptives

Given their different mechanisms of action, we will discuss separately denosumab discontinuation and bisphosphonate drug holidays. The evidence supporting the decision‐making in continuing or stopping these therapies is summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Bisphosphonate discontinuation: benefits, risks, and competing evidence *

Table 2
Denosumab discontinuation: benefits, risks, and competing evidence *

Bisphosphonates

Bisphosphonates can be classified based on the route of administration and, more importantly, based on their relative osteoclast inhibition potency, mostly determined by their affinity to the bone. Among the commonly used bisphosphonates — alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, and ibandronate — there are significant differences in their bone affinity, with zoledronic acid having the most affinity to bone and ibandronate and risedronate having the lowest.

Long‐term extension to the clinical trials of bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, have provided critical insights into their efficacy and the effects on treatment discontinuation. In the pivotal study of alendronate for postmenopausal participants with osteoporosis who continued alendronate treatment for up to 10 years showed significant and sustained increases in BMD. This was most notable at the lumbar spine, where after approximately five years of therapy, BMD essentially plateaued and persisted even after the drug was stopped for five years. In contrast, BMD at the hip and bone turnover returned toward baseline over approximately five years. The impact of alendronate discontinuation after five years on fracture risk is somewhat nuanced. Overall, there was no significant difference in the incidence of morphometric vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures between those who continued treatment for 10 years and those who discontinued after only 5 years. However, there was a 55% reduction in the risk of clinical vertebral fractures in those who continued alendronate therapy for 10 years, and the subgroup of women who were at highest fracture risk also saw a preferential benefit to continuing therapy. Notably, the study was considerably underpowered to detect differences in fracture risk among those who persisted with therapy and patients who remain in extensions to clinical trials have low generalizability to the general population.

### Effects of continuing or stopping alendronate after 5 years of treatment: the fracture intervention trial long-term extension (FLEX): a randomized trial [^115pbdTr]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

The optimal duration of treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis is uncertain.

Objective

To compare the effects of discontinuing alendronate treatment after 5 years vs continuing for 10 years.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind trial conducted at 10 US clinical centers that participated in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT).

Participants

One thousand ninety-nine postmenopausal women who had been randomized to alendronate in FIT, with a mean of 5 years of prior alendronate treatment.

Intervention

Randomization to alendronate, 5 mg/d (n = 329) or 10 mg/d (n = 333), or placebo (n = 437) for 5 years (1998–2003).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was total hip bone mineral density (BMD); secondary measures were BMD at other sites and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. An exploratory outcome measure was fracture incidence.

Results

Compared with continuing alendronate, switching to placebo for 5 years resulted in declines in BMD at the total hip (-2.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.9% to -1.8%; P < .001) and spine (-3.7%; 95% CI, -4.5% to -3.0%; P < .001), but mean levels remained at or above pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. Similarly, those discontinuing alendronate had increased serum markers of bone turnover compared with continuing alendronate: 55.6% (P < .001) for C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen, 59.5% (P < .001) for serum n = propeptide of type 1 collagen, and 28.1% (P < .001) for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, but after 5 years without therapy, bone marker levels remained somewhat below pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. After 5 years, the cumulative risk of nonvertebral fractures (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76–1.32) was not significantly different between those continuing (19%) and discontinuing (18.9%) alendronate. Among those who continued, there was a significantly lower risk of clinically recognized vertebral fractures (5.3% for placebo and 2.4% for alendronate; RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24–0.85) but no significant reduction in morphometric vertebral fractures (11.3% for placebo and 9.8% for alendronate; RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.60–1.22). A small sample of 18 transilial bone biopsies did not show any qualitative abnormalities, with bone turnover (double labeling) seen in all specimens.

Conclusions

Women who discontinued alendronate after 5 years showed a moderate decline in BMD and a gradual rise in biochemical markers but no higher fracture risk other than for clinical vertebral fractures compared with those who continued alendronate. These results suggest that for many women, discontinuation of alendronate for up to 5 years does not appear to significantly increase fracture risk. However, women at very high risk of clinical vertebral fractures may benefit by continuing beyond 5 years.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ibandronate sodium is a bisphosphonate indicated for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. (1.1)

Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low -risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. (1.2)

1.1 Treatment and Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

Ibandronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Ibandronate sodium tablets increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures.

1.2 Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of ibandronate sodium tablets for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of three years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^112TJ2qa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Atypical femoral fracture (AFF) risk with bisphosphonates — incidence and duration trends is characterized by very low absolute rates but increases with longer exposure; studies report "about 3 AFFs per 1000 hip fractures", with population rates "about 5 per 100,000 person-years" versus hip fracture incidences of "300 to 400 per 100,000 person-years". Duration-related risk rose from "~3 per 100,000 person-years" after 2 years to "~20 per 100,000 person-years" at 5 years and "~50 per 100,000 with > 8 years of use". A benefit–risk analysis estimated that treating 1000 osteoporotic women for 3 years would "prevent 100 fractures, including 11 hip fractures, while causing about 0.1 AFF". Given rising risk beyond 5 years, the text states "the consistent increase shown for treatment beyond 5 years suggests consideration of AFF risk in treating patients for > 5 years", and notes the ASBMR proposal of a drug holiday "from oral bisphosphonates after 5 years and from IV bisphosphonates after 3 years" in low-to-moderate risk patients.

### Prevention of postmenopausal bone loss: six-year results from the early postmenopausal intervention cohort study [^113g7qfB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

We report the effect of continuous treatment with alendronate for 6 yr vs. placebo in the Early Postmenopausal Intervention Cohort study. A total of 1609 healthy, early postmenopausal women were recruited; we describe results for the 585 women who received continuous placebo or alendronate (2.5 or 5 mg) daily for 6 yr. Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated at the lumbar spine, hip, forearm, and total body at baseline and annually thereafter. Bone turnover markers were measured every 6 months from baseline to yr 2 and annually thereafter. Adverse experiences, including upper gastrointestinal events and fractures, were recorded throughout the study. Women receiving placebo experienced progressive decreases in BMD at all skeletal sites. Patients receiving alendronate experienced significant gains in spine and hip BMD that were maintained through yr 6. Significantly greater, dose-related decreases in bone turnover markers in the alendronate groups vs. placebo occurred within the first year and were sustained through yr 6. Women receiving alendronate had adverse experience incidences similar to those receiving placebo. Fractures occurred in 11.5, 10.3, and 8.9% of women taking placebo, 2.5 mg alendronate, or 5 mg alendronate daily, respectively. Therapy with alendronate is an effective and promising strategy for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [^111ify9z]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by bone loss, which leads to impaired bone strength and an increased risk of fractures. Two million fractures are attributed to osteoporosis annually in the United States and they are associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture by suppressing bone resorption and increasing bone strength, and they have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, the use of these drugs for the management of osteoporosis remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations including appropriate patient selection, pretreatment evaluation, potential adverse effects, patient preferences, and adherence. This review will discuss the evidence informing the clinical strategy for using bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis and those at high risk of fracture, focusing on the benefits and risks of treatment. We will also consider issues related to the monitoring and duration of treatment.

Increase in BMD Alendronate 10 mg/day at Three Years

At three years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone mass of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as three months and continued throughout the three years of treatment. (See Figure 3 for lumbar spine results.) In the two-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean).

### The use of bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis [^115osCxP]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate, given orally once weekly, are the cornerstone of treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, as well as of male and secondary osteoporosis. They reduce significantly the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures; their effects appear early, within 6–12 months, and appear to be sustained. Several questions remain unanswered, however. In addition, data on a new bisphosphonate became available in 2004.

Recent Findings

The optimal duration of treatment has not been clearly established. Long-term data with alendronate are now available, indicating a persistence of alendronate effects on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers several years after stopping treatment given for 5 years. Whether these effects translate into sustained reduction of fractures needs to be further analyzed. Because of their efficacy, bisphosphonate use has been explored in other forms of osteoporosis, such as after androgen deprivation therapy for prostatic cancer. The challenge of long-term compliance with treatment of osteoporosis has triggered the use of intermittent bisphosphonate. The effects of intermittent oral and intravenous ibandronate on bone mineral density, bone turnover, and fractures have been recently reported.

Summary

The mechanism by which bisphosphonates improve bone strength is not yet fully understood but probably involves complex effects on different components of bone strength, such as microarchitecture.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113oGcH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — long-term bisphosphonate treatment beyond 5 years shows persistent effects after discontinuation and agent-specific offsets. Two randomized, placebo-controlled extension trials form the primary evidence base (1099 and 1233 women) comparing 10 years vs 5 years of alendronate and 6 vs 3 years of zoledronic acid. In FLEX, BMD decreased gradually with discontinuation and at 5 years ~50% to 75% of initial BMD gains were lost; continued alendronate lowered vertebral fracture risk without significant reductions in nonvertebral or hip fractures. In the zoledronic acid extension, BMD fell and bone turnover markers rose more slowly after discontinuation, and fracture results were similar to FLEX with reduced vertebral fractures but no significant effects on nonvertebral fractures. In the TRIO study, 2 years of alendronate, risedronate, or ibandronate followed by 2 years of discontinuation (n = 57 women) showed no between-group differences in bone turnover markers or BMD after discontinuation, and preliminary data did not show that the offset after stopping ibandronate or risedronate differs from alendronate; a larger, longer study is needed.

Introduction

In the Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence with Zoledronic acid Once Yearly–Pivotal Fracture Trial (HORIZON-PFT), 5 mg zoledronic acid (ZOL), given intravenously annually for 3 years, was shown to decrease spine, hip, and other nonvertebral fracture risk, to increase bone mineral density (BMD), and to decrease bone remodeling rates. These results, together with those from trials of similar duration for oral bisphosphonates,–support fracture risk reduction with 3 to 4 years of bisphosphonate administration, particularly in osteoporotic women. However, bisphosphonate efficacy over longer periods has been less well studied. There have been no long-term placebo-controlled trials, but one alendronate study randomized women after 5 years on treatment to either 5 more years of alendronate or placebo. This study found that those randomized to continue alendronate retained BMD gains, whereas those switched to placebo lost BMD but remained at or above pretreatment levels from 10 years earlier. Clinical vertebral, but not nonvertebral, fractures were reduced among those continuing. The authors recommended that many women could take a "drug holiday" after 5 years but that those at high risk of vertebral fractures might continue. A later post hoc analysis suggested nonvertebral fracture benefits in those with BMD T -scores lower than −2.5 after 5 years of treatment. This long persistence of effect is not true for all bisphosphonates; for example, 1 year after stopping risedronate, there was no difference between the active and placebo groups in bone turnover markers (although BMD was still higher and fracture incidence remained reduced in the active group).
