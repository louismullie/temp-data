## Question

Does a B12 lab need to be fasting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a vitamin B12 blood test needs to be done fasting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines say about specimen requirements for serum B12. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative sources explicitly require fasting. Next, I will check for any indirect or contextual reasons that fasting might be recommended. After that, I should review large epidemiologic datasets to see how B12 was actually collected. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with caveats and exceptions, if any, and confirm consistency across sources.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendation from high-quality guidance. The British Society for Haematology (BSH) guideline recommends assessing serum vitamin B12 and folate when deficiency is suspected, and it does not specify fasting for serum B12 collection, which strongly implies that fasting is not required for B12 measurement itself [^111KL6H1]. Similarly, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) advises obtaining a CBC and serum B12 level in patients with risk factors or symptoms, again without recommending fasting for B12 testing, reinforcing that fasting is unnecessary for B12 assays in routine practice [^1144XkED].

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative source explicitly mandates fasting for B12. I need to check the FDA labeling and major guidelines for any fasting language tied to B12 testing. I find no requirement for fasting serum B12 in FDA labeling or in BSH or AAFP guidance, which consistently frame B12 testing as a standard serum test without preanalytical fasting instructions, supporting the conclusion that fasting is not required for B12 measurement [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider indirect contexts where fasting might be mentioned. Some studies and guidelines discuss fasting in relation to homocysteine or MMA, which are second-line tests used when B12 is borderline and deficiency remains suspected, and homocysteine is known to be influenced by recent intake, so fasting is often recommended for homocysteine but not for B12 itself [^113MNb2u]. I should double-check that distinction: yes, fasting is pertinent to homocysteine and sometimes MMA due to diurnal and postprandial variability, but it is not a requirement for serum B12 testing, which is relatively stable around meals [^113MNb2u].

> Next, I should review how large epidemiologic studies handled B12 sampling to see if they operationalized fasting. NHANES collected serum B12 and explicitly recorded fasting status, using fasting windows of roughly 9 hours in the morning and 6 hours later in the day; this structured fasting was for the overall examination protocol and lipid/glucose standardization, not because B12 itself required fasting, and B12 was still measured across fasting and nonfasting participants without separate fasting-specific instructions, which supports that B12 can be measured nonfasting in population settings [^113yjxWi] [^112prsAV]. Let me reconsider: this pattern is consistent with B12 being analytically robust regardless of fasting status, aligning with guideline silence on fasting for B12 [^notfound].

> I will now examine whether any clinical scenarios or medications alter this advice. For patients on metformin, guidelines recommend periodic B12 monitoring due to potential deficiency risk, but they do not introduce a fasting requirement for B12 testing, maintaining the same nonfasting approach in routine care [^111tYivt] [^113ij8R9]. For post-bariatric patients and other high-risk groups, surveillance includes serum B12 and often MMA, yet again there is no mandate to fast for B12 measurement, reinforcing standard nonfasting collection for B12 in these contexts [^112qtT8d] [^1114J9u5].

> But wait, what if a lab's local protocol insists on fasting for all blood work? Could that be a source of confusion? I should confirm that any such fasting requirements are typically driven by other analytes in the same draw panel (e.g., lipids, glucose, insulin), not by B12 itself, and that B12 results are not materially affected by a nonfasting state; indeed, B12 assays are unaffected by recent intake, so a nonfasting B12 is clinically valid even if the lab visit happens to be fasting for other tests [^notfound].

> Synthesis and bottom line: I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. No major guideline or regulatory source requires fasting for serum vitamin B12 measurement, and large population studies have measured B12 under standardized fasting windows for other analytes without indicating a B12-specific fasting need. Therefore, B12 testing does not need to be fasting, though concurrent fasting may be required for other tests in the same blood draw [^113yjxWi] [^112prsAV].

> Practical recommendation: Let me think about how to phrase this for patient care. Patients can have serum B12 drawn fasting or nonfasting. If the blood draw is already fasting for lipids or glucose, that is fine, but if it is more convenient to draw nonfasting, the B12 result remains valid and interpretable, and any borderline B12 results should be clarified with MMA (and sometimes homocysteine), where fasting may be preferred for homocysteine due to intake-related variability, not because B12 itself requires fasting [^113vsPr6] [^116X2VPz].

---

No, **fasting is not required** for vitamin B12 testing [^111LKYto]. Serum B12 levels are stable and not affected by recent meals, so patients may eat and drink normally before testing [^notfound]. Fasting is only needed if other tests in the same draw require it (for example, fasting glucose or lipids). If a patient is already taking B12 supplements, **stop them 24–48 hours before testing** to avoid falsely high results.

---

## Clinical guidelines on fasting requirements

Current clinical guidelines indicate that **fasting is not required** for vitamin B12 testing [^notfound]. The British Society for Haematology (BSH) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend measuring serum vitamin B12 directly when deficiency is suspected, without any fasting requirement [^1144XkED].

---

## Physiological rationale for non-fasting testing

Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin with a half-life of approximately 6 days, and its serum concentration remains stable regardless of recent dietary intake [^117LruNt]. Unlike glucose or lipid measurements, which fluctuate with meals, B12 levels are not significantly affected by food intake, making fasting unnecessary for accurate assessment [^notfound].

---

## Potential confounding factors and considerations

Although fasting is not required, **several factors can influence B12 test results**:

- **Supplementation**: High-dose oral or intramuscular B12 supplements can transiently elevate serum B12 levels, potentially masking deficiency. It is advisable to discontinue supplementation 24–48 hours before testing.

- **Medications**: Certain medications, such as metformin and proton pump inhibitors, can lower B12 levels or impair absorption, leading to falsely low results.

- **Laboratory assays**: Different laboratory methods may yield varying results. If results are incongruent with clinical suspicion, confirmatory tests such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) or homocysteine should be considered [^113vsPr6].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring fasting

Fasting may be necessary when vitamin B12 testing is performed alongside other tests that require fasting, such as fasting glucose or lipid profiles. In such cases, follow the fasting requirements for the specific tests being conducted.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Fasting required?** | **Additional considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Standalone vitamin B12 test | No | None |
| Vitamin B12 test with fasting glucose or lipid profile | Yes | Follow fasting requirements for the specific test |
| Patient on B12 supplementation | No | Discontinue supplements 24–48 hours before testing |
| Patient on metformin or PPIs | No | Interpret results cautiously; consider confirmatory tests if clinical suspicion persists |

---

Fasting is **not required** for vitamin B12 testing, as serum B12 levels are stable and unaffected by recent meals. Clinicians should consider factors such as supplementation and medications when interpreting results and may use confirmatory tests if clinical suspicion persists [^114wHVoy].

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results assessing cobalamin status because there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin currently remains the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical/functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has the potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test, but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited. Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies used and technical issues, and local reference ranges should be established. In the presence of discordance between the test result and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Racial variation in fasting and random homocysteine levels [^113MNb2u]. American Journal of Hematology (2001). Low credibility.

Homocysteine (Hcy) levels have been shown to be a predeterminant of thrombotic diseases. We measured the Hcy levels of 50 blacks and 50 whites equally divided by gender to determine if there is a significant racial difference in either fasting or random Hcy levels. Dietary, medication, smoking, alcohol, past medical, educational, and occupational histories were obtained, and the body mass index calculated. Total serum fasting and random Hcy levels, B12, folate, BUN, creatinine, and lipid profiles were drawn from each participant. Analysis of the results showed that white males have the highest fasting Hcy levels, 10.5 microM/l, whereas random Hcy levels were not significantly different. Correlation between fasting and random Hcy levels was poor (R = 0.61). B12 levels in black subjects were significantly higher, 490.8 pg/ml, compared to whites, 382.8 pg/ml, P = 0.001, but contributed little to total Hcy levels (R² = 0.08). Folic acid levels, all within normal range, were not significantly different between the two racial groups and also did not appear to greatly affect Hcy levels (R² = 0.06). Our study demonstrates that, despite the genetic diversity of these two racial groups in the U.S., white males in this age group have higher fasting Hcy levels than black males, and white males, but not black males, have higher fasting homocysteine levels than females. This discrepancy in Hcy levels may reflect methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme polymorphisms, known to be higher in whites, rather than socioeconomic influences.

### Comparing the efficacy and tolerability of a new daily oral vitamin B12 formulation and intermittent intramuscular vitamin B12 in normalizing low cobalamin levels: a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study [^112GQcN7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is routinely treated with parenteral dosing and less often with high-dose oral vitamin B(12). Oral vitamin B(12) formulations have low bioavailability in patients with malabsorption and are considered less reliable than parenteral treatments.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of a new proprietary oral vitamin B(12) formulation (oral B(12)) with intramuscular (IM) vitamin B(12) (IM B(12)) in restoring normal serum B(12) concentrations in patients with low cobalamin levels (< 350 pg/mL).

Methods

Patients were recruited from 5 centers and randomly assigned to receive oral B(12) 1000 μg, taken daily for 90 days, or IM B(12) 1000 μg, given on study days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90. The patients were aged ≥ 60 years or aged ≥ 18 years and had gastrointestinal abnormalities or were on a restricted diet. The primary efficacy outcome compared the proportion of patients in each treatment arm in whom cobalamin levels were normalized (≥ 350 ng/mL) following 60 days of treatment. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of the 2 formulations after 90 days of treatment, assessing time to normalization of B(12) levels, and evaluating the changes in the levels of biomarkers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HC). The effect on holotranscobalamin II (active B(12)) levels was assessed as an exploratory end point and correlated to serum cobalamin levels in both treatment groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 1) and on days 15, 31, 61, and 91.

Results

Fifty patients were recruited. Forty-eight patients (96.0%) completed the study (22 patients [91.7%] in the oral B(12) group and 26 patients [100%] in the IM B(12) group). All patients (100%) in both treatment groups and in both populations had a cobalamin level ≥ 350 pg/mL on day 61 and maintained it on day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance (P < 0.05) for mean percent change from baseline (PCFB) in serum cobalamin levels on day 61 and day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 61. There was a statistical difference between the IM and oral treatment groups for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 91 (P = 0.033), with lower values in the oral B(12) group. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in plasma HC levels on day 61 and day 91. All patients in each treatment group achieved normalization of serum cobalamin levels by day 15. All patients in both treatment groups and in both populations had plasma holotranscobalamin levels ≥ 40 pmol/L on day 61 and on day 91. No statistical analysis was planned or performed for safety end points, which were reported only descriptively. Most observed adverse effects were considered mild or moderate in intensity. All adverse effects that were considered severe in intensity were also considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug.

Conclusions

In this selected study population comprising individuals with low cobalamin levels but who otherwise were in good health, patients received oral B(12) (1000 μg/d) or IM B(12) (1000 μg in 9 injections over 3 months) for a total of 3 months. Both the oral and IM formulations were effective in restoring normal levels of serum cobalamin in all patients studied (100%). Both formulations used in this study were well tolerated at the dose studied. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01312831.

### Oral cobalamin therapy for the treatment of patients with food-cobalamin malabsorption [^113pozav]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The standard treatment for cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) deficiency involves regular intramuscular cobalamin injection. It has been suggested that oral cobalamin therapy may be effective for treating patients who have food-cobalamin malabsorption.

Subjects and Methods

We prospectively studied 10 patients with cobalamin deficiency and well-established food-cobalamin malabsorption who received 3000 microg or 5000 microg of oral crystalline cyanocobalamin once a week for at least 3 months. Complete blood counts and serum cobalamin, homocysteine, and folate levels were determined at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Patients were reexamined after 6 months.

Results

After 3 months of treatment, all patients had increased hemoglobin levels (mean increase, 1.9 g/dL; 95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 3.9 g/dL; P < 0.01 compared with baseline) and decreased erythrocyte cell volume (mean decrease, 7.8 fL; 95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 16.5 fL; P < 0.001). However, 2 patients had only minor, if any, responses. Serum cobalamin levels were increased in all 8 patients in whom it was measured.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that moderate doses of crystalline cyanocobalamin given orally may be an effective treatment for food-cobalamin malabsorption.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor and that most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for Vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

Addisonian (pernicious) anemia

Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy

Fish tapeworm infestation

Malignancy of pancreas or bowel

Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of Vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin injection is also suitable for the Vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

### NHANES 2013–2014: vitamin B12 data documentation, codebook, and frequencies… [^112prsAV]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor for two enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism: methylmalonyl CoA mutase levels) and methionine synthetase. A serum B12 level below the normal expected range may indicate B12 deficiency. However, a B12 level within the low normal range does not exclude B12 deficiency; symptomatic patients need to be further evaluated with MMA, folic acid, and homocysteine. A chronic dietary deficiency of either folate or vitamin B12 causes macrocytic anemia, although strict dietary deficiencies are rare. Most people who develop a vitamin B12 deficiency have an underlying stomach or intestinal disorder that limits the absorption of vitamin B12.

Subtly reduced cognitive function resulting from early vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes the only symptom of these intestinal disorders. and cobas e immunoassay analyzers. The 1st step is to incubate 15 uL of sample with the vitamin B 12 pretreatment 1 and pretreatment 2 to release bound vitamin B 12. The 2nd incubation adds the ruthenium labeled intrinsic factor to the pretreated sample causing a vitamin B 12-binding. protein complex to form; the amount of which is dependent upon the analyte concentration in the sample. During the 3rd incubation, streptavidin-coated microparticles and vitamin B 12 labeled with biotin are added and the still-vacant sites of the ruthenium labeled intrinsic factor become occupied. The analysis of NHANES 2013–2014 laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design and demographic variables.

The NHANES 2013–2014 Demographics File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables. The Fasting Questionnaire File includes auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to serum homocysteine and MMA, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serum MMA level measurement to confirm vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with normal or low-normal serum vitamin B12 levels where vitamin B12 deficiency is still suspected.

### Betaine concentration as a determinant of fasting total homocysteine concentrations and the effect of folic acid supplementation on betaine concentrations [^116FsVYS]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Remethylation of homocysteine to methionine can occur through either the folate-dependent methionine synthase pathway or the betaine-dependent betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase pathway. The relevance of betaine as a determinant of fasting total homocysteine (tHcy) is not known, nor is it known how the 2 remethylation pathways are interrelated.

Objective

The objectives of the study were to examine the relation between plasma betaine concentration and fasting plasma tHcy concentrations and to assess the effect of folic acid supplementation on betaine concentrations in healthy subjects.

Design

A double-blind randomized trial of 6 incremental daily doses of folic acid (50–800 microg/d) or placebo was carried out in 308 Dutch men and postmenopausal women (aged 50–75 y). Fasted blood concentrations of tHcy, betaine, choline, dimethylglycine, and folate were measured at baseline and after 12 wk of vitamin supplementation.

Results

Concentrations of tHcy were inversely related to the betaine concentration (r = -0.17, P < 0.01), and the association was independent of age, sex, and serum concentrations of folate, creatinine, and cobalamin. Folic acid supplementation increased betaine concentration in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend = 0.018); the maximum increase (15%) was obtained at daily doses of 400–800 microg/d.

Conclusions

The plasma betaine concentration is a significant determinant of fasting tHcy concentrations in healthy humans. Folic acid supplementation increases the betaine concentration, which indicates that the 2 remethylation pathways are interrelated.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency system) [^117P9N3g]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^113MWuXq]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 requirements in parenteral nutrition — adult dose and rationale: Adult parenteral multivitamin products provide 5 mcg/d of crystalline cyanocobalamin. Serum B12 tends to be elevated in chronic parenteral nutrition, usually in the 700- to 900-pg/mL range, but there are several good reasons to continue this generous 5 mcg/d dose. Reasons include that although this dose yields serum B12 at the upper limits of normal there is no evidence for a B12 toxicity syndrome, high serum levels may reflect daily parenteral infusion rather than elevated tissue levels, parenteral B12 enters the systemic rather than portal circulation with first-pass uptake of 50% by the liver and 25% of systemic blood first passing the kidneys leading to probable urinary loss, B12 secreted into bile may not be recaptured due to loss of ileal receptors, and smokers have increased urinary B12 losses as thiocyanate.

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115KFdEN]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 serves as a cofactor of the enzyme methyl malonyl‐coA mutase, which is responsible for converting methyl malonyl‐coA into succinyl‐coA. In individuals with vitamin B12 deficiency, the rise in methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine levels can result in myelin damage, leading to neuropathy. As a result, a lack of vitamin B12 can lead to megaloblastic anaemia and neurological dysfunction.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is quite prevalent among older adults because of their reduced ability to absorb this vitamin from food. In a retrospective study in 1996 in elderly patients aged 65 and older, 509 patients had T2DM, and 188 of them received metformin. The findings revealed that 53.2% of patients on metformin had vitamin B12 deficiency compared with 31.0% of patients with diabetes who were under other diabetes drugs to treat T2DM, such as sulfonylurea, for example, glimepiride and gliclazide, and thiazolidinediones, for example, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.

Screening tests are important to diagnose patients suffering from T2DM. The tests include fasting blood sugar, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), random plasma sugar and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The positive screening test is considered positive if fasting blood glucose is ≥ 126 mg/dL, HbA1c is > 6.5%, random blood sugar is ≥ 200 mg/dL, and OGTT after 2 h from 75 mg glucose load is ≥ 200 mg/dL. These tests are used to determine the patient's glycaemic control, which could be either good or poor.

### Vitamin B12 and homocysteine status during pregnancy in the metformin in gestational diabetes trial: responses to maternal metformin compared with insulin treatment [^116Jskjc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of the study is to compare the effects of metformin and insulin treatment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on vitamin B12 and homocysteine (Hcy) status.

Methods

Women with GDM, who met criteria for insulin treatment, were randomly assigned to metformin (n = 89) or insulin (n = 91) in the Adelaide cohort of the metformin in gestational diabetes (MiG) trial. Fasting serum total vitamin B12 (TB12), holotranscobalamin (HoloTC), a marker of functional B12 status and plasma Hcy concentrations were measured at 20–34weeks (at randomization) and 36weeks gestation, then at 6–8weeks postpartum.

Results

Circulating TB12, HoloTC and Hcy were similar in both treatment groups at each time point. Women who were taking dietary folate supplements at randomization had higher serum TB12 and HoloTC at randomization than those not taking folate. Overall, serum TB12 fell more between randomization and 36weeks gestation in the metformin group than in the insulin group (metformin: -19.7 ± 4.7pmol/l, insulin: -6.4 ± 3.6pmol/l, p = 0.004). The decrease in serum TB12 during treatment was greater with increasing treatment duration in metformin-treated (p < 0.001), but not in insulin-treated women.

Conclusions

Total, but not bioavailable, vitamin B12 stores were depleted during pregnancy to a greater extent in metformin-treated than in insulin-treated women with GDM, but neither analyte differed between groups at any stage. This adds further evidence supporting metformin as a safe alternative treatment to insulin in GDM. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whether women treated with metformin for longer periods in pregnancy require additional B12 or other supplementation.

### Cyanocobalamin [^114iXPhi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE:

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

Addisonian (pernicious) anemia
Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy
Fish tapeworm infestation
Malignancy of pancreas or bowel
Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

### Holo-transcobalamin is an indicator of vitamin B-12 absorption in healthy adults with adequate vitamin B-12 status [^111NjQz3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It has been hypothesized that the response of holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC) to oral vitamin B-12 may be used to assess absorption. To develop a reliable clinical absorption test that uses holo-TC, it is necessary to determine the optimal timeline for vitamin B-12 administration and postdose assessment.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and patterns of change in the postabsorption response of holo-TC to oral vitamin B-12.

Design

Adult (18–49 y) male and female participants (n = 21) with normal vitamin B-12 status were given three 9-mug doses of vitamin B-12 at 6-h intervals beginning early morning (baseline) on day 1. Blood was drawn at 17 timed intervals over the course of 3 d for the analysis of holo-TC and other indicators of vitamin B-12 status.

Results

Mean holo-TC increased significantly (P < 0.001) from baseline at 6 h (11%) and 24 h (50%). TC saturation increased significantly (P < 0.001) from baseline at 12.5 h (33%) and 24 h (50%). The mean cobalamin concentration changed significantly (P < 0.001) from baseline at 24 h (15%) and 48 h (14%). The ratio of holo-TC to cobalamin increased significantly (P < 0.001) at 24 h (32%).

Conclusions

The greatest increase in holo-TC was observed 24 h after ingestion of three 9-mug doses of vitamin B-12. Our results indicate that a vitamin B-12 absorption test based on measurement of holo-TC after administration of three 9-mug doses of vitamin B-12 should run for 24 h.

- **Hypokalemia, sudden death**: use caution in severe megaloblastic anemia, as hypokalemia and sudden may occur when treated intensely.
- **Mask symptoms of folate deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as indiscriminate administration of vitamin B12 in patients with folate-deficient megaloblastic anemia may mask the diagnosis of folate deficiency.
- **Polycythemia vera**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera and treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12 binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1,000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in older patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations [^112HHdyc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effect of small doses of oral cyanocobalamin supplements in older patients with low or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations but no other evidence of pernicious anemia (PA).

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of oral cyanocobalamin 10 microg and 50 microg daily for 1 month.

Setting

Two geriatric hospitals in the North Western Health Care Network, Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

Thirty-one inpatients with serum vitamin B12 levels between 100 and 150 pmol/L, without PA, other malabsorption disorders, or progressive neurological or terminal illness. The mean age was 81.4 years.

Intervention

After informed consent, a medical and drug history was taken and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) completed. A dietitian made assessment of oral cobalamin intake. Blood was taken for serum vitamin B12, serum and red cell folate assay, full blood examination, fasting serum gastrin, parietal and intrinsic factor antibodies, fasting serum homocysteine, and creatinine. Patients were then randomized to receive 10 microg oral cyanocobalamin, 50 microg oral cyanocobalamin, or placebo treatment for 1 month, after which the investigations and clinical examinations were repeated.

Measurements

Percentage change in the level of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate, and red cell parameters and absolute changes in MMSE were calculated and compared between groups. The groups were compared on the number of responders who improved their level of B12 by 20%. Chi-square calculations on changes in serum vitamin B12 concentration were also performed.

Results

Mean serum vitamin B12 ± standard deviation improved by 51.7 ± 47.1% in the 50-microg group, 40.2 ± 34.4% in the 10-microg group, and 11.7 ± 24.5% in the placebo group. The change in the 50-microg cyanocobalamin group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.044). The change in the 10-microg cyanocobalamin group was not significantly different from that in the placebo group (P = 0.186). Eight of 10 subjects in each treatment group were classified as responders, compared with two of 11 in the placebo group (P = 0.004). Homocysteine levels fell in patients receiving cyanocobalamin, but this fall failed to reach statistical significance. There were no significant changes in the other parameters measured.

Conclusion

Cyanocobalamin supplementation of 50 microg but not 10 microg daily produced a significant increase in serum vitamin B12. This result has implications for the management of patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations and for food fortification with vitamin B12.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Efficacy of methylcobalamin on lowering total homocysteine plasma concentrations in haemodialysis patients receiving high-dose folic acid supplementation [^112SMXxN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperhomocysteinaemia, which is considered to be induced by impairment of the remethylation pathway in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), cannot be cured solely by folic acid therapy. In the present study, we investigated the additional benefit of administration of methylcobalamin, which is a co-enzyme in the remethylation pathway, on lowering total homocysteine (tHcy) plasma concentrations in haemodialysis (HD) patients receiving high-dose folic acid supplementation.

Methods

In order to assess the efficacy on lowering plasma tHcy levels (fasting concentration), 21 HD patients, were randomly assigned and provided folic acid supplementation: 15 mg/day orally (group I, n = 7); methylcobalamin 500 mg intravenously after each HD, in addition to folic acid (group II, n = 7); or vitamin B(6) (B(6)), 60 mg/day orally, in addition to folic acid and methylcobalamin (group III, n = 7). All patients were treated for 3 weeks. A methionine-loading test was conducted before and after supplementation. The following measurements were also made before and after supplementation for each group: serum folic acid, B(6), and vitamin B(12) (B(12)) concentrations (including measurement of proportion of methylcobalamin fraction). Twelve HD patients receiving methylcobalamin alone served as the HD control group and seven healthy volunteers served as the normal control group for this study.

Results

In our randomized HD patients the proportions of methylcobalamin fraction (48.3 ± 7.5%) and plasma vitamin B(6) concentration (2.9 ± 1.1 ng/ml) were significantly lower than in the normal controls (methylcobalamin 58.7 ± 2.2%, P < 0.01; B(6) 20.1 ± 10.8 ng/ml, P < 0.01), while folic acid and vitamin B(12) were not significantly different from the normal controls. Mean percentage reduction in fasting tHcy was 17.3 ± 8.4% in group I, 57.4 ± 13.3% in group II, 59.9 ± 5.6% in group III, and 18.7 ± 7.5% in HD controls. The power of the test to detect a reduction of tHcy level was 99.6% in group II and 99.9% in group III when type I error level was set at 0.05. Groups II and III had normal results for the methionine-loading test after treatment. Treatment resulted in normalization of fasting tHcy levels (< 12 ng/ml) in all 14 patients treated by the combined administration of methylcobalamin and supplementation of folic acid regardless of whether there was supplementation of vitamin B(6).

Conclusion

The benefit of methylcobalamin administration on lowering plasma tHcy levels in HD patients was remarkable. Our study suggested that both supplementations of high-dose folic acid and methylcobalamin are required for the remethylation pathway to regain its normal activity. This method could be a therapeutic strategy to combat the risk associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic renal failure.

### The homocysteine controversy [^111gJnSV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Awaiting the results of studies to come, what should we do with our high-risk patient? Clearly, an evidence-based recommendation is impossible. The evidence collected so far allows for just a single conclusion: high-dose B-vitamin therapy in all patients at high risk of CVD does not reduce events after 5 years. In view of what we have discussed, the following policy may be considered:
Do not screen for hyperhomocysteinemia routinely in high-risk patients, but only if: An inborn error of 1-carbon metabolism is suspected based on the clinical phenotype CVD occurs prematurely (i.e. < 50 years, cutoff depending on conventional risk-factor profile) in the patient or his/her family B-vitamin depletion is suspected based on history or comorbidity
Do not treat mild hyperhomocysteinemia routinely, but only if fasting levels exceed a certain threshold of, for example, 20–25 μmol/l
Upon decision to treat, do not use high-dose B-vitamin preparations routinely, but start with a multivitamin containing moderate amounts of folate, B 12, and B 6.
Switch to high-dose B vitamins only if homocysteine remains clearly elevated
Keep an eye on the literature

### Vitamin B deficiency [^113VrFbh]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Are heterocygotes for classical homocystinuria at risk of vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency? [^113dAryo]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives/Design

Comparative cross-sectional study to assess homocysteine and vitamin status in carriers of CBS gene mutations.

Method

Subjects included 34 parents (13 males, 21 females, age 27–59 years) of 30 patients with classical homocystinuria due to homozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. Control subjects were matched for gender and age (13 males, 21 females, age 25–59 years). All subjects were of Qatari origin, had normal liver and renal function tests and had not taken drugs or vitamin supplements prior to the study. The concentrations of homocysteine, folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 in blood were determined after an overnight fast.

Results

Heterozygous carriers had significantly increased fasting levels of homocysteine compared to controls (9.1 vs. 8.1 micromol/l, P = 0.012). Both folic acid (328 vs. 478 pmol/l, P = 0.002) and vitamin B12 concentrations (232 vs. 287 pmol/l, P = 0.013) were reduced whilst there was no significant difference in vitamin B6 levels between the two groups (5.8 vs. 6.44 microg/l).

Conclusions

Increased homocysteine concentrations in CBS gene mutation carriers are associated with reduced concentrations of folic acid and vitamin B12 in blood. In view of the adverse effects of mild hyperhomocysteinemia, routine testing of vitamin status in parents of homocystinuria patients may be warranted. The causal relationship and pathophysiological consequences are uncertain; it is likely that CBS gene mutation carriers need higher doses of dietary vitamins.

Ascertainment of MetS

Detailed protocols and manuals of operations for clinic measurements have been previously reported. Briefly, waist circumference was examined at the minimum abdominal girth in duplicate when the participant was standing.BP was measured on each participant's right arm 3 times at 1-minute intervals after a 5-minute rest. The mean of the second and third examinations was used in the analysis. Blood samples were drawn after at least 8-hours of fasting. Plasma concentrations of triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured using enzymatic methods. Additionally, fasting plasma glucose concentrations were assayed by the hexokinase ultraviolet method at baseline and a radioimmunoassay from examination year 7 to year 30, with these 2 examinations recalibrated to ensure comparability.

MetS components were defined according to the diagnosis and management of the MetS established by the American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Participants with at least 3 of the individual MetS components were defined to have MetS. Incident cases of MetS were identified at each follow-up examination.

Dietary Assessment

Dietary information was assessed using the validated, interviewer-administered CARDIA diet history at the baseline, year 7, and year 20 examinations. Nutrient consumption was computed via the Nutrition Data System for Research (version 10, 20, and 36 at the baseline, year 7, and year 20, respectively). This study assessed each B vitamin intake from both dietary and supplemental sources. Total folate consumption was measured at baseline and follow-ups at year 7 and 20 visits, whereas intakes of vitamin B 6 and vitamin B 12 were assessed at year 7 and 20. The overall dietary quality was estimated by calculating the a priori diet quality scores at baseline, year 7, and year 20. To best represent long-term intake habits and to decrease within-participant variation, we calculated the means of B vitamin intakes, total energy intake, and the a priori diet quality scores from baseline before the time of incident MetS or MetS components, or last follow-up, whichever came first, and used them in the analyses.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### Cyanocobalamine [^115wtARm]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

Addisonian (pernicious) anemia
Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy
Fish tapeworm infestation
Malignancy of pancreas or bowel
Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

### Vitamin B [^1142nVEF]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Laboratory diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency… [^111LKYto]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

This is perhaps why serum folate levels are low in about one third of hospitalized patients. 32 Serum folate levels increase with feeding, and the use of fasting determinations has been recommended. 33 However, the contention that a brief period of adequate feeding will normalize levels in deficient patients has been questioned. 34, 35 Folate concentrations within erythrocytes are much higher than in serum, and even a slight degree of hemolysis will cause a falsely elevated serum folate level. If the results of the first stage of the Schilling test are abnormal, a second stage is performed 3 to 7 days later, using oral administration of labeled Cbl and IF. Possible interpretations of the results of the Schilling test are listed in Table 9.

It is important to note the following: With a partial deficiency of IF or gastric hypochlorhydria, there may be sufficient absorption of the crystalline Cbl administered in stage 1 to yield a normal result, although malabsorption of dietary Cbl may be present. Inadequate urine collection is a significant cause of falsely abnormal Schilling test results, 51 particularly if the urine aliquot produced 8 to 12 hours after administration of the radiolabeled Cbl is lost. Renal insufficiency may delay excretion of the labeled Cbl and cause falsely abnormal results; extending urine collection for an additional 24 hours or measuring radiolabeled Cbl in plasma samples may be required to document normal absorption of Cbl. 11, 52. The fasting serum gastrin level is elevated in 80% to 90% of patients with pernicious anemia. 32, 57 Levels also tend to be elevated in patients with lesser degrees of gastric atrophy who may have malabsorption of protein-bound Cbl despite a normal Schilling test result.

Therefore, the presence of an elevated serum gastrin level may be used as indirect evidence of protein-bound Cbl malabsorption. However, the test has limited sensitivity and specificity when used to detect subclinical gastric abnormalities. 58, 59. In patients with hematologic findings suggestive of Cbl or folate deficiency, it is reasonable to start the evaluation by measuring serum Cbl and fasting serum folate levels. In patients with at least several days of poor dietary folate intake, one may choose to measure the erythrocyte folate level, although the limitations of radioassays for RBC folate should be kept in mind. Table 10 summarizes the initial diagnostic approach based on serum vitamin levels.

### Reduction of plasma homocysteine and serum methylmalonate concentrations in apparently healthy elderly subjects after treatment with folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6: a randomised trial [^111HCavm]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate, in an elderly population: (1) the effects of oral B-vitamin therapy on P-tHcys, S-MMA and Hb/MCV, (2) the appropriate decision limit for 'high' metabolite concentrations and (3) the estimated prevalence of vitamin B(12)/folate deficiency on the basis of different decision limits.

Design

Double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study.

Setting

Outpatient clinic.

Subjects

A total of 209 community-dwelling subjects, median age 76 y (range 70–93) y.

Intervention

Four months of oral daily supplementation with 0.5 mg cyanocobalamin, 0.8 mg folic acid and 3 mg vitamin B(6).

Results

High P- tHcys was found in 64% of men and 45% of women, high S-MMA in 11% of both. Vitamin B(12) deficiency was observed in 7.2% and folate deficiency in 11% of all subjects. Health-related upper reference limits for the metabolites at the start were higher than the laboratory's upper reference limits. The latter were, however, similar to those of the vitamin replete group. There was a significant decrease in P-tHcys (P < 0.001) and S-MMA (P = 0.009) after 4 months of vitamin treatment. In a multivariate analysis, the P-Hcys change correlated positively with baseline P-tHcys and inversely with baseline P-folate and transferrin saturation (Fe/TIBC ratio). The S-MMA change correlated with baseline S-MMA and inversely with baseline vitamin B(12) and age.

Conclusions

Suboptimal vitamin status is an important cause of elevated P-tHcys and S-MMA in apparently healthy elderly subjects. Oral B-vitamin therapy is an effective and convenient way to normalise P-tHcys and S-MMA.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^113gABPQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Intervention studies

We found three randomized placebo-controlled trials with a total number of 210 participants that met the inclusion criteria for intervention studies for our review (Table 2). Detailed information about the trials can be found in Additional file 7. These three trials included patients with low or subnormal vitamin B12 levels concentrations at the start of the study. The first trial by Hughes and colleagues included a random sample of 39 persons aged ≥ 65 years registered at general practices in a town in Wales, UK, that were treated for 4 weeks with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin or placebo. Haemoglobin was measured after 5 weeks. The second trial by Hvas et al. included 140 persons in Aarhus, Denmark, with elevated methylmalonic acid levels (median age 75 years in the treatment group and 74 years in the placebo group) that received weekly intramuscular injections of cyanocobalamin of placebo for 1 month. Haemoglobin was measured after 3 months (13 weeks). In the third trial by Seal and colleagues, 31 persons in two geriatric hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, (mean age ≥ 78 years) received two different doses of oral cyanocobalamin daily or placebo for 4 weeks.

Table 2
Summary of the results and quality assessment of the intervention studies included in this review

Based on checklist from Jadad et al. Higher scores indicate higher quality (range 0–5). Intervention studies that scored 3 points or more were considered 'high quality'.

Due to clinical heterogeneity (differences in methods of administration, dose of vitamin B12, outcome measures and treatment follow-up time) we did not combine the results in a meta-analysis. However, all three RCTs, of which two were regarded high quality ("see Additional file 8 "), showed no beneficial effect of vitamin B12 administration on haemoglobin concentrations and MCV. In the study by Hughes et al, there was, on average, a small decrease in haemoglobin level during the trial but the difference between the mean changes in those given vitamin B12 and those given placebo was very small and not statistically significant. In the study by Hvas et al, the change in haemoglobin level was the same in the vitamin B12 group and placebo group. In addition, no differences were observed in the mean change in haemoglobin level in the three treatment groups in the study by Seal et al.

### Long-term metformin use and vitamin B12 deficiency in the diabetes prevention program outcomes study [^111UhRAv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur with metformin treatment, but few studies have assessed risk with long-term use.

Objective

To assess the risk of B12 deficiency with metformin use in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)/DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS).

Design

Secondary analysis from the DPP/DPPOS. Participants were assigned to the placebo group (PLA) (n = 1082) or the metformin group (MET) (n = 1073) for 3.2 years; subjects in the metformin group received open-label metformin for an additional 9 years.

Setting

Twenty-seven study centers in the United States.

Patients

DPP eligibility criteria were: elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and overweight/obesity. The analytic population comprised participants with available stored samples. B12 levels were assessed at 5 years (n = 857, n = 858) and 13 years (n = 756, n = 764) in PLA and MET, respectively.

Intervention

Metformin 850 mg twice daily vs placebo (DPP), and open-label metformin in the metformin group (DPPOS).

Main Outcome Measures

B12 deficiency, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy.

Results

Low B12 (≤ 203 pg/mL) occurred more often in MET than PLA at 5 years (4.3 vs 2.3%; p = 0.02) but not at 13 years (7.4 vs 5.4%; p = 0.12). Combined low and borderline-low B12 (≤ 298 pg/mL) was more common in MET at 5 years (19.1 vs 9.5%; P < .01) and 13 years (20.3 vs 15.6%; p = 0.02). Years of metformin use were associated with increased risk of B12 deficiency (odds ratio, B12 deficiency/year metformin use, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.20). Anemia prevalence was higher in MET, but did not differ by B12 status. Neuropathy prevalence was higher in MET with low B12 levels.

Conclusions

Long-term use of metformin in DPPOS was associated with biochemical B12 deficiency and anemia. Routine testing of vitamin B12 levels in metformin-treated patients should be considered.

### Vitamin B12 and folate levels in healthy Swiss senior citizens: a prospective study evaluating reference intervals and decision limits [^11622Atp]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Subjects were recruited from February 2009 to December 2011 in the context of the Swiss SENIORLAB study, which is an ongoing investigation in the canton of Berne (Switzerland) aimed at creating appropriate reference intervals (RI's) of several analytes in the senior citizens. Subjectively healthy senior Caucasian volunteers aged 60 years and older were recruited. The study participants were contacted through newspaper advertisements, clubs and associations where there was a high probability that the membership would include healthy senior citizens (e.g. mountaineering clubs, sports clubs) and through personal contacts of those involved in organizing the study. A personal history of the patients was taken including specific information on medication and presence of several common diseases such as known cardiovascular disease, known diabetes mellitus, known thyroid disease, or known cognitive impairment. Anthropometric measurements were performed, and venous blood was drawn into S-Monovettes® (Sarstedt, Sevelen, Switzerland) after an overnight fasting period. In a longitudinal follow-up after baseline examination, all study participants were contacted and questioned on several issues regarding quality of life and survival. In the determination of reference intervals in elderly persons, survival can be employed to demonstrate a certain degree of health.

Of the 1467 participants, those with high C-reactive protein levels (> 10 mg/L), vitamin B12-outliers (vitamin B12 > 1100 pmol/L), holoTC-outliers (holoTC > 128 pmol/L), serum folic acid outliers (> 45.3 nmol/L) or a hemoglobin suggesting anemia in the elderly (< 110 g/L) were excluded. Further exclusion criteria comprised the intake of proton pump inhibitors, antidiabetic medication, and vitamin B12 or folic acid supplementation as well as a clinical history suggesting the presence of cognitive impairment or a survival of less than one year (Fig. 1). Of the included study participants, 515 were between 60 and 69 years old, 435 between 70 and 79 years and 193 were 80 years old or older (Table 1). This study was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the cantonal institutional review board (KEK-Bern 166/08). All of the participants provided written informed consent.

### Cyanocobalamine injection (Cyanocobalamine) [^112xC54x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for vitamin B12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions:

- Addisonian (pernicious) anemia

- Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacteria overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy

- Fish tapeworm infestation

- Malignancy of pancreas or bowel

- Folic acid deficiency

It may be possible to treat the underlying disease by surgical correction of anatomic lesions leading to small bowel bacterial overgrowth, expulsion of fish tapeworm, discontinuation of drugs leading to vitamin malabsorption (see Drug Interactions), use of a gluten-free diet in nontropical sprue, or administration of antibiotics in tropical sprue. Such measures remove the need for long-term administration of cyanocobalamin.

Requirements of vitamin B12in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.

Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is also suitable for the vitamin B12absorption test (Schilling test).

- **Hypokalemia, sudden death**: use caution in severe megaloblastic anemia, as hypokalemia and sudden may occur when treated intensely.
- **Mask symptoms of folate deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as indiscriminate administration of vitamin B12 in patients with folate-deficient megaloblastic anemia may mask the diagnosis of folate deficiency.
- **Polycythemia vera**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera and treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

### Cobalamin and folate status in infants and young children in a low-to-middle income community in India [^112hg5Vp]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Population-based data on the prevalence of cobalamin and folate deficiency in India are lacking.

Objective

The objective was to measure the prevalence of cobalamin and folate deficiency among children aged 6–30 mo residing in a low-to-middle income community in North India.

Design

Children aged 6–30 mo (n = 2482) were identified through a community survey in a low-to-middle socioeconomic area in New Delhi, India. Non-fasting venous blood samples were collected before enrollment in another trial.

Results

The median (interquartile range; IQR) cobalamin concentration in 6–11-mo-old children was substantially lower in breastfed (183; 120–263 pmol/L) than in nonbreastfed (334; 235–463 pmol/L) children. Cobalamin concentrations decreased progressively with increasing age in the nonbreastfed children. Median (IQR) plasma folate concentrations in the 6–11-mo-old group were higher in breastfed (20.3; 11.7–34.4 nmol/L) than in nonbreastfed (5.3; 3.4–7.7 nmol/L) children (P < 0.001). Folate concentrations decreased with increasing age in the breastfed children. In the nonbreastfed children, folate concentrations increased with increasing age. Low concentrations of plasma cobalamin (< 150 pmol/L) were detected in 36% of breastfed and 9% of nonbreastfed children (P < 0.001). The proportions of children with plasma folate concentrations < 5 nmol/L in these 2 subgroups were 6% and 33%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In north Indian preschool children, cobalamin and folate concentrations were commonly low and were associated with elevated total homocysteine and methylmalonic acid concentrations. Because low cobalamin and folate concentrations have functional consequences, population-based measures for improving cobalamin and folate concentrations need to be seriously considered.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^1137RxyH]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### Measuring vitamin B-12 bioavailability with [13C]-cyanocobalamin in humans [^115eugch]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B-12 deficiency is widespread in many parts of the world, affecting all age groups and increasing with age. It is primarily due to a low intake of animal source foods or malabsorption. The measurement of bioavailability of vitamin B-12 is etiologically important in deficiency but is limited due to the use of radioactive isotopes like [57Co]- or [14C]-cyanocobalamin.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to measure the bioavailability of [13C]-cyanocobalamin in humans and to assess the effect of parenteral replenishment of vitamin B-12 on the bioavailability.

Methods

We synthesized a stable isotope-labeled vitamin B-12, [13C]-cyanocobalamin, using Salmonella enterica by providing [13C2]-ethanolamine as a sole carbon source. After purification and mass spectrometry-based characterization, its oral bioavailability was measured in the fasted state with high and low oral doses, before and after parenteral replenishment of vitamin B-12 stores, from the kinetics of its plasma appearance in a 2-compartment model.

Results

[13C]-cyanocobalamin was completely decyanated to [13C]-methylcobalamin describing metabolic utilization, and its plasma appearance showed early and late absorption phases. At a low dose of 2.3 µg, the mean bioavailability was 46.2 ± 12.8 (%, mean ± SD, n = 11). At a higher dose of 18.3 µg, the mean bioavailability was 7.6 ± 1.7 (%, mean ± SD, n = 4). Parenteral replenishment of the vitamin B-12 store in deficient individuals prior to the measurement resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in bioavailability.

Conclusions

Vitamin B-12 bioavailability is dose dependent and at a low dose that approximates the normal daily requirement (46%). The stable isotope method described here could be used to define the etiology of deficiency and to inform the dietary requirement in different physiologic states as well as the dose required for supplementation and food fortification. This trial was registered at the Clinical Trials Registry of India as CTRI/2018/04/012957.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the great majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys have subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application becomes crucial yet remains unsettled. This review critically examines the current diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials). Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all current biomarkers make the combination of ≥ 2 test result abnormalities, such as cobalamin and MMA, the most reliable approach to diagnosing deficiency in the research setting; reliance on one test alone courts frequent misdiagnosis. Much work remains to be done.

### Vitamin B12 and folate concentrations in recent-onset type 2 diabetes and the effect of metformin treatment [^115CRwir]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency are not only linked to hematological, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases, but are also associated with insulin resistance. Metformin can decrease vitamin B12 and folate concentrations.

Objective

To examine (1) effects of short-term metformin treatment on serum holotranscobalamin (holoTC) and folate and (2) their association with insulin sensitivity in recent-onset type 2 diabetes.

Design

This cross-sectional analysis comprised patients (known disease duration < 12 months) on metformin monotherapy (MET, n = 123, 81 males, 53 ± 12 years) or nonpharmacological treatment (NPT, n = 126, 77 males, 54 ± 11 years) of the German Diabetes Study.

Main Outcome Measures

HoloTC (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), cobalamin, and folate (electrochemiluminescence); beta-cell function and whole-body insulin sensitivity, measured during fasting (HOMA-B, HOMA-IR) and intravenous glucose tolerance tests combined with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp tests.

Results

HoloTC (105.4 [82.4, 128.3] vs 97 [79.7, 121.9] pmol/L) and folate concentrations (13.4 [9.3, 19.3] vs 12.7 [9.3, 22.0] nmol/L) were similar in both groups. Overall, holoTC was not associated with fasting or glucose-stimulated beta-cell function and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Cobalamin measurements yielded similar results in representative subgroups. In NPT but not MET, folate levels were inversely correlated with HOMA-IR (r = -0.239, P = 0.007). Folate levels did not relate to insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion in the whole cohort and in each group separately after adjustment for age, body mass index, and sex.

Conclusions

Metformin does not affect circulating holoTC and folate concentrations in recent-onset type 2 diabetes, rendering monitoring of vitamin B12 and folate dispensable, at least during the first 6 months after diagnosis or initiation of metformin.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cyanocobalamin IN (also known as Nascobal, B-12):
- **Anaphylaxis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as anaphylactic shock and death have been reported after parenteral vitamin B12 administration. Consider administering an intradermal test if patients are to start intranasal cyanocobalamin before having tolerated cyanocobalamin parenterally.
- **Hypokalemia, thrombocytosis**: use caution in severe megaloblastic anemia, as hypokalemia and sudden may occur when treated intensely.
- **Mask symptoms of folate deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as indiscriminate administration of vitamin B12 in patients with folate-deficient megaloblastic anemia may mask the diagnosis of folate deficiency.
- **Polycythemia vera**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera and treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^114aoCvY]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) and weight loss: Vitamin B-12 has a very limited role in promoting weight loss, and there are no studies evaluating weight loss with vitamin B-12 injections, tablets, sublingual pills, or drinks. Conversely, B-12 deficiency has been associated with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgical procedures, and can lead to permanent nerve damage if left untreated; no weight loss should be anticipated as a result of the use of exogenous vitamin B-12, injection site reaction might be anticipated if that route is chosen, and in patients with normal renal function a hypervitaminosis state is unlikely.

### Pharmacokinetics of oral cyanocobalamin formulated with sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino] caprylate (SNAC): an open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study in healthy male subjects [^115ckGfj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency may be caused by inadequate dietary intake of B12 or by conditions that result in malabsorption of the vitamin. Crystalline vitamin B12, usually in the form of cyanocobalamin, is administered parenterally (ie, intramuscularly) or orally for treating deficiency states. Intramuscular administration is widely accepted as a treatment method. Oral B12 supplementation is also used, but it is considered to be less reliable.

Objective

This study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of 2 oral formulations of cyanocobalamin-a marketed cyanocobalamin tablet (immediate-release B12 5 mg) and cyanocobalamin formulated with a proprietary carrier, sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]caprylate (SNAC)-to establish the feasibility of using an absorption enhancer with B12 to improve uptake of the vitamin. This was the first clinical study conducted with the cyanocobalamin/SNAC coformulation.

Methods

An open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study was conducted in healthy male subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Treatment A subjects (n = 4) received 2 tablets of 5-mg cyanocobalamin formulated with 100-mg SNAC as part of a dose range-finding arm included to determine a dose to provide a measurable concentration of vitamin B12 at all time points when tested with the available vitamin B12 assay; treatment B subjects (n = 6) received 1 tablet of 5-mg cyanocobalamin formulated with 100-mg SNAC; treatment C subjects (n = 6) received 1 commercially available 5-mg cyanocobalamin tablet; and treatment D subjects (n = 4) received commercially available 1-mg cyanocobalamin IV. Treatment A was completed 3 weeks before treatments B, C, and D were studied. Human serum B12 was analyzed by chemiluminescence assay method. Validation procedures established that samples could be diluted up to 100 times without any effects on accuracy and precision. The pharmacokinetic properties of vitamin B12 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis. Vitamin B12 absolute bioavailability estimates were calculated between the oral (A, B, and C) and IV (D) treatments using non-baseline-adjusted vitamin B12 concentrations as well as baseline-adjusted vitamin B12 concentrations, with or without body weight adjustments. Tolerability was evaluated through review or monitoring of medical history, physical examination findings, concomitant medications, vital signs, laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis values), electrocardiography, adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Results

Twenty healthy male subjects, aged 20 to 45 years, participated in this study. Based on data from treatment A, a 5-mg cyanocobalamin dose was selected for use with treatments B and C. The oral cyanocobalamin formulation containing SNAC had greater mean absolute bioavailability than the commercial oral formulation (5.09% vs 2.16%, respectively), calculated on AUC(0-last) values uncorrected for baseline, weight, or body mass index. It also had a reduced T(max) compared with the commercial formulation (0.5 hours vs 6.83 hours, respectively). The K(e) was similar between treatments (0.028 1/h vs 0.025 1/h). Comparable results were achieved using corrected values. The cyanocobalamin/SNAC formulation was well tolerated, and there were no reported adverse events.

Conclusions

An oral formulation of 5-mg cyanocobalamin containing 100-mg SNAC, an absorption enhancer, provided significantly improved bioavailability and a significant decrease in T(max) for B12 in a small study of normal healthy subjects compared with a commercially available 5-mg cyanocobalamin oral formulation. Both oral formulations and commercial 1-mg cyanocobalamin IV were well tolerated.

### Influence of age, sex and vitamin status on fasting and post-methionine load plasma homocysteine levels [^112HMqHJ]. Haematologica (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

To investigate the effects of age, sex and vitamin status on total plasma homocysteine (tHCy), both after fasting (FtHCy) and two hours post-methionine load (PML-tHCy). The secondary aim was to determine the reference values for FtHCy and PML-tHCy.

Design and Methods

A cohort of apparently healthy volunteers underwent blood sampling for FtHCy, PML-tHCy, creatinine, serum folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5-phosphate, PLP).

Results

In 147 subjects (M/F = 82/65, age range: 14–94 years), FtHCy was significantly higher in men than in women. In men, age and folate levels explained 20.5% and 19.0% of FtHCy variance, respectively. In women, age and vitamin B12 accounted for 22.6% and 17.8% of FtHCy variance, respectively. PML-tHCy was similar in men and women. PML-tHCy was negatively correlated with folate in both sexes, and with vitamin B12 and age in women only. Folate accounted for 20% of the variance of PML-tHCy in men, while in women vitamin B12 and PLP explained 40% and 20% of variance of PML-tHCy, respectively. The reference values of FtHCy and PML-tHCy were: 19.63 and 40.18 mol/L, respectively, for men under 45 years, 14.26 and 28.31 mol/L, respectively, for women under 45 years, 28.38 and 36.48 mol/L for men above 45 years, and 22.49 and 44.06 mol/L for women above 45 years.

Interpretation and Conclusions

Age, gender and vitamin status influence both FtHCy and PML-tHCy in normal subjects. Reference values should be calculated according to age and sex.

NHANES structure and inclusions

NHANES is a cross-sectional survey in the USA that uses a complex, stratified, multistage probability sampling design. The survey protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the National Center for Health Statistics, and NHANES has obtained written informed consent from all participants. For this analysis, we used publicly available data without personal identifiable information, and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Interview questionnaires and examination response rates are publicly available. Participants were first interviewed in their homes, during which demographic information and a variety of health-related information were collected. One to 2 weeks later, subjects underwent a standardized physical examination, as well as additional investigations like exercise testing, 24-h dietary recall, and a blood draw in a mobile examination center. Blood samples were taken with the participant fasting. Participants who visited the examination in the morning were requested to fast for 9 h, those visiting in the afternoon or evening were requested to fast for 6 h. For this study, we included all adults aged 18 years or older who participated in the continuous NHANES survey cycles of 1999–2000 through 2013–2014, in whom serum B12 concentrations were assessed at baseline (Additional file 1: Fig. 1). A total of 82,091 people participated in the 1999–2000 through 2013–2014 NHANES surveys. Of those, 47,279 participants were eligible for mortality follow-up. We excluded 974 women who reported to be pregnant or breastfeeding. Serum B12 was measured in 6 of the 8 2-year surveys and available in 24,262 non-pregnant participants (51.3%).
