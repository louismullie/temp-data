## Question

what disorders come from both glutamate and gaba being imbalanced

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which disorders demonstrate simultaneous and pathological imbalance of both glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) systems. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance" is defined and measured in humans versus models. Then, I should verify stringent inclusion criteria that require explicit evidence for both glutamate and GABA involvement rather than a single-system abnormality. Next, I will examine candidate disorders across neurology and psychiatry with convergent evidence, self-checking the strength of data types such as postmortem studies, high-field MRS, electrophysiology, and computational modeling. Finally, I should synthesize a clean list of conditions that truly meet the dual-imbalance bar, note borderline cases that do not, and acknowledge methodological caveats.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes E/I imbalance and how it is typically inferred, because I need to ensure I am not over-calling single-transmitter findings as dual-system pathology. In practice, E/I imbalance is supported by convergent data showing altered indices of both excitation and inhibition, including MRS measures of glutamate or Glx and GABA, postmortem transcriptomic markers in excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons, network-level physiology, and computational fits that require joint perturbation of excitatory and inhibitory parameters to explain behavior or perception, which together provide a mechanistic link to clinical features in neuropsychiatric disease [^1159CeUx] [^111NzZjG] [^113ow7QC].

> Next, I should review and explicitly define the inclusion criteria to avoid false positives. I need to check that each disorder I list shows: 1) direct evidence that both excitatory/glutamatergic and inhibitory/GABAergic systems are implicated in the same patients or model context, 2) a plausible causal or mechanistic link to symptoms or pathophysiology rather than mere association, and 3) at least one modality that ties the imbalance to circuit function or behavior, with preference for high-resolution or high-field MRS, layer- and cell-type–specific postmortem data, or causal modeling, while keeping in mind measurement limitations of MRS and overlapping metabolite pools [^115stVdd] [^113ow7QC] [^1113FtGm].

> Schizophrenia looks like a strong candidate, but wait, let me verify that both sides of the ledger are implicated within the same cortical microcircuits. Postmortem re-analysis shows layer- and circuit-specific reductions of both composite glutamate and GABA measures in layer 3 local DLPFC circuits, indicating a coordinated shift in E/I balance that is not visible in homogenate-level analysis, which argues for cell-type specificity of the dual disturbance and clinical relevance to cognition [^1159CeUx]. Complementing that, high-field MRS–connectivity studies reveal altered relationships between ACC glutamate and GABA levels and functional connectivity in schizophrenia compared to controls, consistent with disrupted neurometabolic–network coupling, while computational modeling of early visual processing shows that reductions in both cortical excitation and inhibition are necessary to account for perceptual signatures in schizophrenia, satisfying the dual-impairment criterion mechanistically [^1124ZXAX] [^111NzZjG].

> For major depressive disorder, I should confirm whether findings extend beyond isolated GABA deficits. Large MRS work demonstrates lower prefrontal GABA in current and past MDD, with variable glutamatergic alterations across regions and disease states, indicating that inhibition is consistently reduced while excitatory measures can change in regionally specific ways, which still supports E/I contribution to pathophysiology in at least a subset of circuits [^112adMgv]. Moreover, in treatment-resistant depression receiving ketamine, a higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio predicts greater antidepressant response and ratio reductions track symptom improvement, directly linking the excitatory-to-inhibitory balance to clinical change and implying that both arms of the system are functionally implicated and therapeutically targetable in MDD [^112YmNfn].

> Obsessive-compulsive disorder appears to meet the dual-imbalance bar, but hold on, I should verify the directionality and anatomical specificity. Ultra–high-field 7T MRS shows that patients with OCD exhibit elevated glutamate and lower GABA in ACC, and that compulsive traits and habitual control correlate with glutamate levels and the glutamate:GABA ratio in SMA and ACC, indicating a regionally specific pro-excitatory shift of the E/I set-point relevant to core behavioral phenotypes, which fulfills the simultaneous dual-abnormality criterion and ties it to symptoms [^115mchsD] [^116uZqPw].

> Alzheimer's disease also looks compelling; let me check for convergent human evidence beyond animal models. Postmortem and microtransplantation physiology from parietal cortex demonstrate a higher excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic ratio in AD compared with controls, while clinical and experimental data show that E/I imbalance manifests as an increased burden of epileptiform activity early in the disease course in a substantial subset of patients and is linked to accelerated progression, together arguing that a pro-excitatory imbalance is central in AD pathogenesis and clinically meaningful [^116A1yjT] [^114DcqkD]. Complementary mechanistic hypotheses emphasize that GABAergic dysfunction contributes to E/I imbalance alongside glutamatergic changes, underscoring the dual-system involvement in AD circuits [^111rrWA4].

> Let me consider autism spectrum conditions and Rett syndrome, but I should confirm that both glutamatergic and GABAergic axes are implicated. In autism, cortical interneuron work emphasizes the necessity of balanced glutamate and GABA signaling for circuit development and suggests that disrupting this balance contributes to core features, aligning with the E/I imbalance framework at the cellular level in both human and rodent models [^1155rUtB]. In Rett syndrome, receptor autoradiography reveals abnormalities in densities of both excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA synaptic receptors, and developmental regulation by MeCP2 affects BDNF and Dlx5 with downstream effects on glutamatergic transmission and GABA synthesis, indicating a dual neurotransmitter synaptopathy consistent with E/I imbalance [^113Y9iDH].

> Frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes warrant inclusion, but I should double-check that both neurotransmitter systems are altered in vivo. Ultra–high-field MRS demonstrates deficits in both glutamate and GABA across FTLD syndromes, with these biochemical changes correlating with behavioral disinhibition, a core phenotype, thereby supporting a clinically relevant E/I imbalance mechanism in FTLD circuitry [^114kLfSJ] [^112VMmcx].

> Migraine is trickier, so let me reconsider the directionality and timing across the migraine cycle. Experimental CSD work shows that AMPA antagonism and GABA receptor agonism modulate CSD-associated perfusion dynamics, indicating that both excitatory and inhibitory receptors are capable of shifting the pathophysiologic substrate of aura, while MRS studies in adults often report increased glutamate and increased GABA in visual cortex and thalamus, suggesting a dysregulated E/I set-point rather than a unidirectional transmitter abnormality, with pediatric data beginning to extend these observations and propose a ratio metric to index E/I balance in vivo [^117KAAVB] [^111CFL9c] [^115RKoS1].

> I will now examine stress- and trauma-related phenotypes, but wait, I should be careful not to over-interpret small samples. In PTSD, low cortical GABA and elevated glutamate have been reported, and in a small study comorbid alcohol use appeared to partially normalize these imbalances in certain regions while introducing injury markers, suggesting that both arms can be jointly perturbed and behaviorally relevant, though replication and larger samples are needed to meet a rigorous dual-imbalance threshold confidently [^111wEs5Y].

> Inherited metabolic diseases provide clean mechanistic links, but I need to ensure both glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways are implicated. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency produces a chronic hyperGABAergic state with receptor downregulation, while glutaric aciduria disrupts glutamate uptake and binding and directly inhibits glutamate decarboxylase, thereby decreasing GABA synthesis and selectively injuring striatal GABAergic neurons, together demonstrating that both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission are pathologically altered with network-level E/I consequences in these metabolic encephalopathies [^113xt8Dn] [^111nw5zF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every disorder with inhibitory dysfunction; I initially thought stiff-person syndrome should qualify automatically, but wait, I should verify whether there is explicit dual evidence rather than secondary disinhibition. SPS is characterized by impaired reciprocal inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission with cortical hyperexcitability and reduced central and CSF GABA, and although the resulting disinhibition increases downstream excitability, the primary lesion is GABAergic without clear concurrent primary glutamatergic pathology, so SPS does not strictly meet the simultaneous dual-imbalance criterion despite its E/I manifestations [^116n2PTR] [^116Twdqf]. By the same reasoning, trials of GABA modulators in ALS and regionally focal glutamatergic findings in Tourette syndrome are insufficient to prove a disorder-wide dual transmitter imbalance without convergent evidence of GABA dysfunction in the same circuits, so I should not include them as definitively dual until supported by stronger data [^115bvj5o] [^114LbAz8].

> Before finalizing, I should double-check methodological caveats that could bias interpretation. MRS has limited spatial specificity, cannot fully disentangle metabolic from synaptic pools, and often trades precision between glutamate and GABA depending on sequence, so observed Glu, Glx, or GABA changes must be triangulated with layer-specific postmortem markers, physiology, and computational modeling where possible to confidently call a dual E/I imbalance, which strengthens the cases for schizophrenia, OCD, FTLD, AD, and selected MDD and metabolic disorders while suggesting caution for small or heterogeneous PTSD cohorts [^113ow7QC] [^1113FtGm] [^1159CeUx].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the short list of disorders with credible simultaneous glutamatergic and GABAergic pathology that maps to symptoms via E/I mechanisms: schizophrenia with layer-3 circuit reductions of both composite glutamate and GABA and modeling that requires joint deficits, OCD with elevated glutamate and reduced GABA in ACC and a glutamate:GABA ratio linked to compulsivity, AD with elevated synaptic E/I ratios and epileptiform manifestations implying a pro-excitatory shift alongside inhibitory dysfunction, FTLD syndromes with dual transmitter deficits tied to disinhibition, MDD where E/I ratio metrics predict ketamine response and prefrontal inhibitory deficits co-occur with excitatory changes, autism spectrum and Rett syndrome where interneuron and synaptic receptor evidence supports developmental E/I dysregulation, and specific inherited metabolic encephalopathies that mechanistically perturb both excitatory and inhibitory transmission, while noting that SPS, ALS, and Tourette do not yet meet strict dual-imbalance evidence thresholds in the same circuits [^1159CeUx] [^115mchsD] [^116A1yjT] [^112VMmcx] [^112YmNfn] [^1155rUtB] [^113Y9iDH] [^113xt8Dn].

Imbalances in **glutamate and GABA** — the brain's main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters — are implicated in multiple disorders [^115stVdd]. The strongest evidence supports associations with **schizophrenia** [^1124ZXAX] (reduced GABA and altered glutamate in the prefrontal cortex) [^1159CeUx], **autism spectrum disorder** [^1155rUtB] (E/I imbalance from interneuron dysfunction) [^116HWPUS], **epilepsy** [^112a7TSk] (hyperexcitability from excess glutamate or reduced GABA) [^116jfPMi], and **major depressive disorder** [^116xepDZ] (lower GABA and altered glutamate in prefrontal/ACC) [^112adMgv]. Other implicated conditions include anxiety [^115Kz3af], bipolar disorder [^116hHPT1], Alzheimer's disease [^116A1yjT], PTSD [^111wEs5Y], OCD [^116uZqPw], and migraine [^111TJ8hv], all reflecting a **disrupted excitation–inhibition balance** [^116sJ4DL].

### Cortical interneuron function in autism spectrum condition [^1155rUtB]. Pediatric Research (2019). Low credibility.

Cortical interneurons (INs) are a diverse group of neurons that project locally and shape the function of neural networks throughout the brain. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that a proper balance of glutamate and GABA signaling is essential for both the proper function and development of the brain. Dysregulation of this system may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum condition (ASC). We evaluate the development and function of INs in rodent and human models and examine how neurodevelopmental dysfunction may produce core symptoms of ASC. Finding common physiological mechanisms that underlie neurodevelopmental disorders may lead to novel pharmacological targets and candidates that could improve the cognitive and emotional symptoms associated with ASC.

### Markers of glutamate and GABA neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects: Disease effects differ across anatomical levels of resolution [^1159CeUx]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia is thought to reflect, at least in part, altered levels of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Studies of the postmortem human brain allow for interrogation of the disease-related alterations in markers of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission at different levels of anatomical resolution. Here, we re-analyzed six published datasets from postmortem studies of schizophrenia to assess molecular markers of glutamate and GABA neurotransmission in the DLPFC at three levels of anatomical resolution: total cortical gray matter, gray matter restricted to layer 3, and a layer 3 local circuit composed of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory, parvalbumin-containing, GABA neurons. We formulated composite measures of glutamate and GABA neurotransmission from z-scores of key transcripts that regulate these functions. Relative to unaffected comparison subjects, the composite glutamate measure was higher in schizophrenia subjects in total gray matter homogenates but lower in samples restricted to layer 3 or the layer 3 local circuit. The composite index of GABA neurotransmission did not differ between subject groups in total gray matter homogenates but was lower in schizophrenia subjects in layer 3 and lower still in the local layer 3 circuit. These findings suggest that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the DLPFC of schizophrenia subjects differs depending on the level of anatomical resolution studied, highlighting the importance of layer- and cell-type specificity in understanding schizophrenia pathology.

### Gaba, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and neurological disease [^112a7TSk]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It is converted from glutamic acid by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), of which two isoforms exist: GAD65 and GAD67. GABA is then metabolized, both within the cell and in the synaptic cleft, by GABA transaminase to form succinic semialdehyde. Succinic semialdehyde can subsequently be converted either to succinic acid by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase or into gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) by succinic semialdehyde reductase.

Because GABA modulates much of the ongoing inhibition in the brain, perturbations in GABAergic inhibition can result in seizures. Consequently, epilepsy is the most common disorder targeted with treatments involving GABA. Other disorders related to dysfunction in GABAergic function include psychiatric diseases, spasticity, and stiff-person syndrome.

This review explores the roles of GABAergic neurotransmission in conditions such as epilepsy, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, stiff-person syndrome, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The final section discusses the GABA metabolite GHB, highlighting its physiological significance and its involvement in epilepsy, sleep disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, and an inborn error of GABA metabolism, namely succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

### Differences in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter levels between depressed patients and healthy controls: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116xepDZ]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and/or glutamate neurotransmitter systems have increasingly been implicated in the aetiology of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). It has been proposed that alterations in GABA and/or glutamate result in an imbalance of inhibition and excitation. In a review of the literature, we identified studies using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to examine the neurotransmitters GABA, glutamate, and the composite glutamate/glutamine measure Glx in patients diagnosed with MDD and healthy controls.

Results showed patients with MDD had significantly lower GABA levels compared to controls (-0.35 [-0.61, -0.10], p = 0.007). No significant difference was found between levels of glutamate. Sub-analyses were performed, including only studies where the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) was the region of interest. GABA and Glx levels were lower in the ACC of MDD patients (-0.56 [-0.93, -0.18] p = 0.004, and 0.40 [-0.81, 0.01] p = 0.05). This review indicates widespread cortical reduction of GABA in MDD, with a trend towards a localised reduction of Glx in the ACC. However, given both GABA and glutamate appear decreased, a simple interpretation in terms of an imbalance of overall excitation-inhibition is not feasible.

### Anterior cingulate glutamate and GABA associations on functional connectivity in schizophrenia [^1124ZXAX]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Low credibility.

The underlying neurobiological mechanism for abnormal functional connectivity in schizophrenia (SCZ) remains unknown. This project investigated whether glutamate and GABA, two metabolites that contribute to excitatory and inhibitory functions, may influence functional connectivity in SCZ.

- **Methods**: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were acquired from 58 SCZ patients and 61 healthy controls (HC). Seed-based connectivity maps were extracted between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) spectroscopic voxel and all other brain voxels. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) spectra were processed to quantify glutamate and GABA levels. Regression analysis was performed to describe relationships between functional connectivity and glutamate and GABA levels.

- **Results**: Reduced ACC functional connectivity in SCZ was found in regions associated with several neural networks, including the default mode network (DMN), compared to HC. In the HC, positive correlations were found between glutamate and both ACC-right inferior frontal gyrus functional connectivity and ACC-bilateral superior temporal gyrus functional connectivity. A negative correlation between GABA and ACC-left posterior cingulate functional connectivity was also observed in HC. These same relationships were not statistically significant in SCZ.

- **Conclusions**: The present investigation is one of the first studies to examine links between functional connectivity and glutamate and GABA levels in SCZ. Results indicate that glutamate and GABA play an important role.

### Schizophrenia, a disease of impaired dynamic metabolic flexibility: A new mechanistic framework [^117AQJCf]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a chronic, neurodevelopmental disorder with unknown etiology and pathophysiology that emphasizes the role of neurotransmitter imbalance and abnormalities in synaptic plasticity. The currently used pharmacological approach, antipsychotic drugs, which have limited efficacy and an array of side effects, have been developed based on the neurotransmitter hypothesis. Recent research has uncovered systemic and brain abnormalities in glucose and energy metabolism, focusing on altered glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. These findings call for a reconceptualization of schizophrenia pathophysiology as a progressing bioenergetics failure. In this review, we provide an overview of the fundamentals of brain bioenergetics and the changes identified in schizophrenia. We then propose a new explanatory framework positing that schizophrenia is a disease of impaired dynamic metabolic flexibility, which also reconciles findings of abnormal glucose and energy metabolism in the periphery and in the brain along the course of the disease. This evidence-based framework and testable hypothesis has the potential to transform the way we conceptualize this debilitating condition and to develop novel treatment approaches.

### Rett syndrome and neuronal development [^113Y9iDH]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical signs of Rett syndrome, along with neuropathology and brain imaging, suggest that the disorder disrupts neuronal circuits. Studies using receptor autoradiography demonstrate abnormalities in the density of excitatory glutamate and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synaptic receptors in postmortem brains from young female subjects with Rett syndrome. MeCP2, the protein abnormal in most females with Rett syndrome, is predominantly expressed in neurons and appears during development at the time of synapse formation.

Studies of nasal epithelium from patients with Rett syndrome show that the maturation of olfactory receptor neurons is impeded prior to synapse formation. Recent reports indicate that MeCP2 controls the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the DNA-binding homeobox protein Dlx5. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor enhances glutamate neurotransmission at excitatory synapses, whereas Dlx5 is expressed in most GABAergic neurons and stimulates GABA synthesis. Taken together, this information supports the hypothesis that Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder of synapse development, particularly affecting synapses utilizing glutamate and GABA as neurotransmitters.

### A preliminary examination of cortical neurotransmitter levels associated with heavy drinking in posttraumatic stress disorder [^111wEs5Y]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients have low cortical concentrations of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and elevated glutamate (Glu) as measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly comorbid with PTSD, but the neurobiological underpinnings are largely unknown. We aimed to determine if PTSD patients with AUD have normalized cortical GABA and Glu levels in addition to metabolite alterations common to AUD.

We compared brain metabolite concentrations in 10 PTSD patients with comorbid AUD (PAUD) with concentrations in 28 PTSD patients without AUD and in 20 trauma-exposed controls (CON) without PTSD symptoms. We measured concentrations of GABA, Glu, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine- (Cr) and choline-containing metabolites (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI) in three cortical brain regions using (1)H MRS and correlated them with measures of neurocognition, insomnia, PTSD symptoms, and drinking severity.

In contrast to PTSD, PAUD exhibited normal GABA and Glu concentrations in the parieto-occipital and temporal cortices, respectively, but lower Glu and trends toward higher GABA levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Temporal NAA and Cho, as well as mI in the ACC, were lower in PAUD than in both PTSD and CON. Within PAUD, more cortical GABA and Glu correlated with better neurocognition. Heavy drinking in PTSD is associated with partially neutralized neurotransmitter imbalance, but also with neuronal injury commonly observed in AUD.

### The role of D-amino acids in Alzheimer's disease [^115qW98b]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized by a complex and multifactorial etiology. Excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system is largely mediated by glutamate, whose receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, requiring the agonist glutamate and a coagonist such as glycine or the D-enantiomer of serine for activation, play a crucial role here. Additionally, D-aspartate acts as an agonist of NMDA receptors.

D-amino acids, present in low quantities in nature and long considered to be of bacterial origin, have unique functions in mammals. Alterations in the physiological levels of various D-amino acids have been linked to numerous pathological states, including chronic kidney disease and neurological disorders. NMDA receptor signaling must be balanced to promote neuronal survival and prevent neurodegeneration; in AD, this signaling is mainly affected by glutamate availability and modulation of the receptor's functions.

Recent experimental findings report a link between D-serine and D-aspartate, through NMDA receptor modulation, to AD and cognitive functions. Interestingly, AD progression has also been associated with enzymes related to D-amino acid metabolism, as well as glucose and serine metabolism. The D-serine and D-/total serine ratio in serum has recently been proposed as a biomarker of AD progression. A greater understanding of the role of D-amino acids in excitotoxicity related to the pathogenesis of AD is essential for advancing treatment strategies.

### Cortical spreading depression-associated cerebral blood flow changes induced by mechanical stimulation are modulated by AMPA and GABA receptors [^117KAAVB]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

Migraine is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, with approximately 30% of patients additionally suffering from focal neurological disturbances: the aura. The underlying mechanism behind the aura is generally considered to be a form of cortical spreading depression (CSD). We used mechanical stimulation to induce hyperemia associated with CSD in cats and rats and studied the effect of a glutamate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) and GABA(B) receptor agonists, to better understand the pharmacology of CSD. All three were able to inhibit CSD-associated cerebral blood flow changes in the rat and in a proportion of cats studied; non-responders showed altered speed of propagation and time to induction. The data suggest AMPA and GABA receptors may be targets for migraine therapy in inhibiting CSD and thus may alter the frequency of migraine aura.

### Rare genetic brain disorders with overlapping neurological and psychiatric phenotypes [^114XgWy6]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Understanding rare genetic brain disorders with overlapping neurological and psychiatric phenotypes is of increasing importance given the potential for developing disease models that could help to understand more common, polygenic disorders. However, the traditional clinical boundaries between neurology and psychiatry result in frequent segregation of these disorders into distinct silos, limiting cross-specialty understanding that could facilitate clinical and biological advances.

In this review, we highlight multiple genetic brain disorders in which neurological and psychiatric phenotypes are observed, but for which in-depth, cross-spectrum clinical phenotyping is rarely undertaken. We describe the combined phenotypes observed in association with genetic variants linked to epilepsy, dystonia, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. We also consider common underlying mechanisms that center on synaptic plasticity, including changes to synaptic and neuronal structure, calcium handling, and the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. Further investigation is needed to better define and replicate these phenotypes in larger cohorts, which would help to gain greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and identify common therapeutic targets.

### Glutamate plus glutamine to GABA ratio as a predictor of ketamine response in treatment-resistant depression: A double-blind, randomized, open-label extension study [^112YmNfn]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 30% of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) respond to ketamine; however, no replicable predictors of response have been reported. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions may be implicated in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This study aimed to evaluate whether the ratio of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) to GABA levels at baseline in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) could predict ketamine response in patients with TRD.

- **Method**: This exploratory study analyzed data from a double-blind randomized clinical trial with an open-label extension study (jRCTs031210124). Fifteen participants in the ketamine group and 15 of 16 participants in the placebo group received repeated intravenous ketamine during the double-blind and open-label extension periods, respectively. We measured Glx and GABA levels in the dACC before and after treatment during the double-blind period using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was measured for depressive symptomatology. General linear models were used to examine the relationship between baseline Glx/GABA ratio and HDRS-17 score changes.

- **Result**: Changes in HDRS-17 scores (mean ± SD) following ketamine treatment were -4.9 (6.5) and -4.9 (5.2) in the double-blind and open-label periods, respectively. A higher baseline dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater improvement in HDRS-17 (β = -0.42, p = 0.040). In the ketamine group, a reduction in the dACC Glx/GABA ratio was correlated with greater HDRS-17 improvement.

### Cerebral glutamate and GABA levels in high-risk of psychosis states: A focused review and meta-analysis of H-MRS studies [^114WMixo]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Disturbances in brain glutamate and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) homeostasis may be markers of transition to psychosis in individuals at high risk (HR). Knowledge of GABA and glutamate levels in HR stages could provide insight into changes in the neurochemistry underlying psychosis. Studies on glutamate in HR have yielded conflicting data, and GABA studies are only recently being initiated. In this meta-analysis, we compared cerebral levels of glutamate and GABA in HR individuals with healthy controls (HC).

We searched Medline and Embase for articles published on 1H-MRS studies on glutamate and GABA in HR states until April 9, 2019. We identified a total of 28 eligible studies, with 8 reporting GABA (243 HR, 356 HC) and 26 reporting glutamate (299 HR, 279 HC) or Glx (glutamate + glutamine) (584 HR, 632 HC) levels. Sample sizes ranged from 6 to 75 for HR and 10 to 184 for HC. Our meta-analysis of 1H-MRS studies on glutamate and GABA in HR states showed significantly lower (P = 0.0003) levels of thalamic glutamate in HR individuals compared to HC, and significantly higher (P = 0.001) Glx in the frontal lobe of genetic HR individuals (1st-degree relatives) compared to HC. No other significant differences in glutamate and GABA levels were found.

Subject numbers in the studies on glutamate and GABA levels were generally small, and the data were conflicting. Our meta-analytical findings highlight the need for larger and more homogeneous studies of glutamate and GABA in high-risk states.

### Metabolism of amino acid neurotransmitters: The synaptic disorder underlying inherited metabolic diseases [^113xt8Dn]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Amino acids are involved in various metabolic pathways, and some of them also act as neurotransmitters. Since the biosynthesis of L-glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) requires 2-oxoglutarate, while 3-phosphoglycerate is the precursor of L-glycine and D-serine, evolutionary selection of these amino acid neurotransmitters might have been driven by their capacity to provide important information about the glycolytic pathway and Krebs cycle.

Synthesis and recycling of amino acid neurotransmitters, as well as the composition and function of their receptors, are often compromised in inherited metabolic diseases. For instance, increased plasma L-phenylalanine concentrations impair cerebral biosynthesis of protein and bioamines in phenylketonuria, while elevated cerebral L-phenylalanine directly acts via ionotropic glutamate receptors. In succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, the neurotransmitter GABA and neuromodulatory γ-hydroxybutyric acid are elevated, leading to a chronic hyperGABAergic state that results in progressive downregulation of GABA A and GABA B receptors and impaired mitophagy.

In glycine encephalopathy, the neurological phenotype is precipitated by L-glycine acting both via cortical NMDA receptors and glycine receptors in spinal cord and brainstem neurons. Serine deficiency syndromes are biochemically characterized by decreased biosynthesis of L-serine, an important neurotrophic factor, and the neurotransmitters D-serine and L-glycine. Supplementation with L-serine and L-glycine has a positive effect on seizure frequency and spasticity, while neurocognitive development can only be…

### Excitatory synaptic dysfunction cell-autonomously decreases inhibitory inputs and disrupts structural and functional plasticity [^116HWPUS]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Genetic variants of proteins associated with glutamatergic synaptic function, such as CTNAP2 and SHANK3, have been implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, placing excitatory synapse dysfunction in the spotlight as a candidate mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of these disorders. Animal models with these genetic deficits also show reduced inhibitory tone, recapitulating findings from human patient studies.

Some of these neurological disorders are thought to have neurodevelopmental origins, such as ASD and schizophrenia, raising the intriguing questions: is there a causal link between defective excitatory synaptic function during development and reduced inhibition? And how do deficits in excitatory synaptic function lead to deficits in inhibitory function?

Here we examined the role of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission in the development of inhibition and excitation at synaptic, neuronal, circuit, and behavioral levels, focusing on inhibitory synapses and neurons. Very little is known about whether and how E/I is maintained in inhibitory neurons. Interfering with AMPAR-mediated inputs specifically in parvalbumin neurons, either with GluA1 or GluA4 knockout or by manipulating neuronal pentraxins, delayed inhibitory circuit maturation, blocked cortical plasticity, and resulted in behavioral deficits. We report a coordinated, cell-autonomous reduction in synaptic inhibition in response to decreasing glutamatergic transmission by GluACTP expression in individual neurons. The decreased inhibitory input was not only observed in spontaneous activity but…

### The effect of N-acetylcysteine on brain glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations and on smoking cessation: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117QkpkB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Substance dependence is associated with deviating glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). However, the literature is inconclusive on the direction of these neurotransmitter deviations. Pilot studies with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutamatergic agent, show treatment promise. A first study showed a direct effect of NAC on glutamate concentration in the dACC of cocaine-dependent individuals. The aim of the study was to test the effect of NAC on glutamate and GABA concentrations in the dACC in smokers and on smoking cessation. Smokers were hypothesized to differ in dACC glutamate and GABA concentrations from non-smokers, and smokers receiving NAC were hypothesized to show normalization of these neurotransmitter concentrations and higher success rates in smoking cessation.

Forty-eight male smokers, aged 15–55 years, smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day and scoring ≥ 3 on the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), participated in a 14-day randomized, double-blind trial with either 2400 mg/day NAC or placebo. Exclusion criteria included psychoactive medication, other mental and neurological disorders, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ineligibility. MRI and psychological testing were conducted one day before and after treatment. Forty-seven matched non-smoking males served as baseline controls, participating only in the first assessment. Glutamate and GABA concentrations in the dACC were assessed with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS). Due to overlap in the spectral assignment of glutamate, glutamine, and GABA, some challenges in measurement continuity were noted.

### Gaba and glutamate deficits from frontotemporal lobar degeneration are associated with disinhibition [^114kLfSJ]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Behavioral change is a common feature of the syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology, including behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). This is associated with the loss of functional independence and increased mortality in both disorders. Better treatment of behavioral symptoms might therefore improve both functionally independent survival and quality of life for patients and their families. A potential treatment strategy is to reverse neurotransmitter deficits, which have been effective in other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. There is evidence of neurotransmitter deficits in FTLD, but limited evidence of a relationship with phenotype.

The behavioral disturbance caused by FTLD syndromes comprises many neurocognitive processes with distinct anatomical and neurochemical alterations. An inability to inhibit inappropriate actions is seen in both bvFTD and PSP. This phenotypic overlap between bvFTD and PSP is reflected in the MDS-2017 criteria for the PSP-F subtype, along with frequent parkinsonism in bvFTD. In this study, we therefore used a transdiagnostic approach to behavioral disinhibition, with 'FTLD syndromes' encompassing bvFTD, PSP-Richardson's syndrome, and PSP-Frontal syndrome. We measured glutamate and GABA concentrations in vivo before testing the association of these neurotransmitter deficits with behavioral disinhibition.

The neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are associated with behavioral changes in FTLD syndromes.

### The role of GABA in anxiety disorders [^115Kz3af]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Anxiety stems from and perpetuates dysregulation of neurobiological systems, but the exact mechanisms of anxiety disorders are still only partially understood. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter known to counterbalance the action of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Several pharmacologic agents target the GABA system and modulate the overall effect of GABA. This article highlights multiple neurobiological interactions that play a role in anxiety and reviews selected studies of plasma neurosteroid levels, plasma GABA levels, and benzodiazepine binding site sensitivity and density in patients with anxiety disorders. The article concludes with further support for the role of the GABA system in anxiety by summarizing the evidence supporting the use of novel GABAergic agents, including tiagabine, in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

### The use of newer anticonvulsants in neuropsychiatric disorders [^116axC1t]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Anticonvulsants are becoming increasingly popular for the management of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric syndromes. This may be related to the antikindling properties of these agents, in addition to their modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters. Treatment selection is complicated by the inconsistent availability of randomized controlled data among the growing range of choices. Additionally, the generalization of psychiatric to neuropsychiatric applications of anticonvulsant treatments is not universally applicable. This paper reviews the use of newer anticonvulsants in the management of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly aggression and agitation.

The largest body of treatment data is available for valproic acid, which appears to be efficacious and well-tolerated in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, less consistent data are available for other medications. Further prospective studies are warranted to examine the use of these medications in neuropsychiatric populations.

### GABAergic dysfunction in excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) imbalance drives the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^111rrWA4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

To propose a new hypothesis that GABAergic dysfunction in excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) imbalance drives the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we investigate its underlying mechanisms:

- **Background**: Synaptic dysfunction and E/I imbalance emerge decades before the appearance of cognitive decline in AD patients, contributing to neurodegeneration. Initially, E/I imbalance was thought to occur first due to dysfunction of the glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. However, new evidence demonstrates that the GABAergic system, the counterpart of E/I balance and the major inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the central nervous system, is significantly altered. This alteration contributes to E/I imbalance and further exacerbates AD pathogenesis.

- **New hypothesis**: Alterations to the GABAergic system, induced by multiple AD pathogenic or risk factors, contribute to E/I imbalance and AD pathogenesis.

- **Major challenges for the hypothesis**: This GABAergic hypothesis addresses many critical questions and common challenges confronting new hypotheses of AD pathogenesis. It explains why amyloid beta (Aβ), β-secretase (BACE1), the apolipoprotein E4 gene (APOE ε4), and hyperactive glia cells contribute to AD pathogenesis, and why age and sex are risk factors for AD. GABAergic dysfunction promotes the spread of Aβ pathology throughout the AD brain, leading to cognitive impairments. Dysfunction induced by these varied risk factors shares a common neurobiology leading to E/I imbalance. Additionally, some of these factors exacerbate GABAergic dysfunction and E/I imbalance.

### Can epigenetics shine a light on the biological pathways underlying major mental disorders [^111Zsvxz]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways, which can lead to either excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, have been reported to play a role in the etiopathogenesis of psychotic disorders and ASD. Furthermore, N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid or N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDAR) hypofunction, as well as a decrease in the parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (PVI), both processes being essential for the excitatory/inhibitory balance, have been widely shown to be involved in psychotic disorders.

In SCZ and psychosis, there is evidence from candidate genes studies across tissues supporting DNAm differences between cases and controls in genes such as the parvalbumin (PVALB) gene; GMR2 and GMR5 of the glutamatergic receptors; various CpG sites in the β2 subunit of the GABAa receptor gene (GABRB2), and in GRIN2B, involved in the function of NMDAR. A dysregulation of multiple DNAm positions in the regulatory network of GAD1 was identified in patients with SCZ and BD compared to controls.

### Dietary modulation of cortical excitation and inhibition [^112y9szF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

The balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain affects both neural responses and behavior in humans and animals. Here, we investigated whether dietary intervention aimed at increasing levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) can influence neural responses to basic sensory stimuli. Using a steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm, we found that the neural response to visual patterns was reduced in individuals who consumed a yeast extract product rich in substances associated with the production of GABA (glutamate and B vitamins) but not in a control group who consumed a placebo substance (n = 14 per group). This demonstrates that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain can be influenced by dietary interventions, suggesting possible clinical benefits in conditions (e.g. epilepsy) where inhibition is abnormal.

### Linking GABA and glutamate levels to cognitive skill acquisition during development [^1113FtGm]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

As with any other noninvasive neuroimaging methods in human participants, 1H‐MRS offers a relatively coarse spatial resolution (centimeter) compared with studies that examine glutamate/GABA ratios at the level of neurons and neural circuits in animals. Furthermore, MRS glutamate measures may not necessarily be specific to the pool of excitatory glutamate. That is, as with previous MRS research, it is unclear to what extent our measurement quantifies metabolic vs. neurotransmitter glutamate pools.

However, a comparative analysis of N‐acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal viability, in the same brain regions did not show the same results. For example, NAA/Creatine (Cr) ratios vs. face processing performance in children in the IFG: rs(14) = −0.212, P = 0.468, bootstrapped 95% CI [−0.868, 0.483]; or NAA/Cr ratios vs. VS‐WMT performance in adults in the IOG: rs(11) = −0.042, P = 0.903, bootstrapped 95% CI [−0.725, 0.686].

In addition, we also looked at resting levels of glutamine (both against total levels of Creatine or as glutamine/GABA ratios), based on the previously made suggestion that "total glutamate levels could be a reasonable metric of glutamate involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission" [Hu et al. 2013]. The results for both analyses showed that glutamine levels did not correlate with face processing performance in children in the IFG or with VS‐WMT performance in adults (Supporting Information Tables S4, S5 for all analyses). Based on that, we suggest that the observed correlations were likely driven more by the metabolic pool, rather than by neurotransmitter pools.

### Cortical glutamate and GABA are related to compulsive behaviour in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder and healthy controls [^112Aq818]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Healthy individuals were recruited from the community; they were all in good health, unmedicated, and had no history of neurological or psychiatric conditions. Participants with OCD were recruited through an approved advertisement on the OCD Action website, local support groups, and via clinicians in East Anglia. All participants received monetary compensation for taking part in this study. Participants with OCD were screened by a qualified psychiatrist from our team (A.S.) to confirm a primary OCD diagnosis.

The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MINI) was used to confirm the absence of any psychiatric conditions in both groups. Within the OCD group, OCD symptom severity and characteristics were measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). In both OCD and healthy participants, mood status was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), anxiety levels were evaluated using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and verbal IQ was quantified using the National Adult Reading Test (NART).

All individuals included in the OCD group had a diagnosis of OCD (as per the DSM-V criteria) and exhibited anxiety and depressive symptoms. OCD participants with comorbid major depressive disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or any additional axis-I disorders, were not included in the study. We included only OCD participants who presented a total YBOCS score higher than 12. Four participants with OCD within the lower end of the YBOCS, i.e. mild symptomatology (scores between 12 and 15), were included to enable a broader range of symptom severity.

### Computational modeling of excitatory/inhibitory balance impairments in schizophrenia [^111NzZjG]. Schizophrenia Research (2022). Low credibility.

Deficits in glutamatergic function are well established in schizophrenia (SZ) as reflected in "input" dysfunction across sensory systems. By contrast, less is known about contributions of the GABAergic system to impairments in excitatory/inhibitory balance. We investigated this issue by measuring contrast thresholds for orientation detection, orientation discriminability, and orientation-tilt-aftereffect curves in schizophrenia subjects and matched controls. These measures depend on the amplitude and width of underlying orientation tuning curves, which, in turn, depend on excitatory and inhibitory interactions. By simulating a well-established V1 orientation selectivity model and its link to perception, we demonstrate that reduced cortical excitation and inhibition are both necessary to explain our psychophysical data. Reductions in GABAergic feedback may represent a compensatory response to impaired glutamatergic input in SZ, or a separate pathophysiological event. We also found evidence for the widely accepted, but rarely tested, inverse relationship between orientation discriminability and tuning width.

### Distinct manifestations of excitatory-inhibitory imbalance associated with amyloid-β and tau in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^114DcqkD]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Consistent with the phenomenon of altered excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, a growing body of work shows that an estimated 20–60% of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients have epileptic manifestations, depending on the sensitivity of the method. Importantly, these studies demonstrate that epileptic abnormalities manifest early in the disease course, often preceding the onset of cognitive decline, and have a high incidence in both sporadic and autosomal dominant AD. Furthermore, AD patients who harbor interictal spikes and sharp waves progress faster than those who are negative for such abnormalities — indicating that altered E/I balance is allied to the clinicopathological presentation. Collectively, both basic and clinical science evidence suggest that E/I imbalance in AD represents a central pathogenic mechanism.

However, this raises the intriguing question of why epileptic manifestations are not universally observed in all AD patients. One potential explanation is that while E/I imbalance in AD consistently contributes to epileptic abnormalities, these manifestations may only be detected in a subset of patients due to the limited sensitivity of electrophysiological assays. Alternatively, E/I imbalance in AD may involve diverse mechanisms — some leading to neuronal dysfunction present in all patients, and others specifically contributing to epileptic activity in a subset. Notably, findings in AD transgenic mouse models support such diversity. For instance, amyloid-β-overexpressing mice consistently exhibit abnormal hyperactivity of neurons, including seizures and interictal spikes that correlate with amyloid-β burden.

### Evaluation of prefrontal γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate levels in individuals with major depressive disorder using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [^112adMgv]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent illnesses worldwide. Perturbations of the major inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu), respectively, as well as Glx (Glu or glutamine [Gln]), have been extensively reported in a multitude of brain areas of individuals with depression. However, few studies have examined changes in Gln, the metabolic counterpart of synaptic Glu.

This study aims to investigate changes in GABA, Glx, Glu, and Gln levels in a voxel in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of participants with no, past, and current MDD using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This community-based study employed a cross-sectional design using 3-T 1H-MRS in participants not taking MDD medication recruited from the community. The sample consisted of 251 healthy controls, 98 participants with a history of past MDD, and 47 participants meeting the diagnostic criteria for MDD. Diagnostic groups were comparable regarding age, education, income, and diet. Data collection spanned from March 2014 to October 2021, with data analysis from October 2021 to June 2022.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The concentrations of GABA, Glx, Glu, and Gln in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were measured.

Results showed that, of the 396 included participants, 258 (65.2%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 25.0 (4.7) years. Compared with healthy controls, those with past MDD and MDD had lower GABA concentrations (mean [SEM] concentration: healthy controls, 2.70 [0.03] mmol/L; past MDD, 2.49.

### A meta-analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies on glutamatergic neurometabolite levels in major depressive disorder [^1152xeoV]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Protocol registration**: We followed the Transparent Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and uploaded the full protocol to the website of the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, #CRD42023405205.

	- **Search strategies**: The search was performed in PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SinoMed from the start date of these databases to May 2023. We used the following search terms: depress ∗ AND (glutam ∗ OR Glx OR GABA OR "γ-aminobutyric acid" OR "Gamma-aminobutyric acid") AND (MRS OR "magnetic resonance spectroscopy").

	- **Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria**: The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who met the DSM 3rd, 4th, or 5th edition criteria for MDD or met the ICD-10 or ICD-11 for MDD; (2) patients whose Gln, Glu, Glx, or GABA levels in the brain were compared via MRS between patients with MDD and healthy controls, or between MDD patients pre- and post-intervention; (3) studies included at least five subjects in each group; (4) the mean differences between the two groups were presented.

		The exclusion criteria for the analyses comparing neurometabolite levels between participants with and without MDD were as follows: (1) the review and conference abstracts; (2) the subjects were nonhuman; (3) the study did not include healthy controls; (4) the study was not written in English or in Chinese; (5) the MDD patients had comorbidities with other mental disorders, except anxiety disorder, because research has presented the high comorbidity rate of the MDD patients and anxiety disorder.

### The vigabatrin-associated brain abnormalities on MRI and their differential diagnosis [^1152Hih8]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Vigabatrin is an anti-epileptic drug that inhibits the enzyme γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-transaminase. The anticonvulsant effect of vigabatrin involves increasing GABA levels and attenuating glutamate-glutamine cycling. Vigabatrin is indicated for infantile spasms and refractory focal seizures. Despite having a significant role in pediatric epileptology, vigabatrin has adverse effects, including retinal toxicity in up to 30% of patients after one year of use and brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The percentage of patients with brain abnormalities on MRI varies between 22% and 32% for children using vigabatrin to treat infantile spasms.

Risk factors for these imaging abnormalities include cryptogenic infantile spasms, age under 12 months, high dosage, and possible concomitant hormonal therapy. Clinically, these abnormalities are usually asymptomatic. Histopathological analysis reveals white matter vacuolation and intramyelinic oedema. The typical findings of vigabatrin-associated brain abnormalities on MRI are characterized by bilateral and symmetrical hyperintense signals on T2-weighted imaging, with diffusion restriction often compromising the globi pallidi, thalami, subthalamic nuclei, cerebral peduncles, midbrain, dorsal brainstem (including the medial longitudinal fasciculi), and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum.

In this article, the authors review the clinical manifestations, histopathological features, imaging aspects, and differential diagnosis of vigabatrin-associated brain abnormalities on MRI.

### Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease [^115bvj5o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Imbalance of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and related modulators has been implicated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND). In this context, the role and mechanism of action of gabapentin and baclofen have been extensively investigated, although with conflicting results. This is the first systematic review to assess clinical trials of GABA modulators for the treatment of ALS.

- **Objectives**: To examine the efficacy of gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators in delaying the progression of ALS, and to evaluate adverse effects of these interventions.

- **Search methods**: On 16 August 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and LILACS. In addition, we checked the bibliographies of the trials found to identify any other trials, and contacted trial authors to identify relevant unpublished results or additional clinical trials. On 30 August 2016, we searched two clinical trials registries.

- **Selection criteria**:
	- **Types of studies**: Double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs.
	- **Types of participants**: Adults with a diagnosis of probable or definite ALS.
	- **Types of interventions**: Gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators compared with placebo, no treatment, or each other.
	- **Primary outcome**: Survival at one year from study enrollment.
	- **Secondary outcomes**: Individual rate of decline of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), expressed as…

### Are hallucinations due to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory influences on the brain [^111mNRfM]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

This review from the International Consortium on Hallucinations Research intends to question the pertinence of the excitatory-to-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis as a model for hallucinations. A large number of studies suggest that subtle impairments of the E/I balance are involved in neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. Emerging evidence also points to a role of the E/I balance in maintaining stable perceptual representations, suggesting it may be a plausible model for hallucinations.

In support, hallucinations have been linked to inhibitory deficits as shown by impairment of gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor plasticity, reductions in gamma-frequency oscillations, hyperactivity in sensory cortices, and cognitive inhibition deficits. However, the mechanisms by which E/I dysfunctions at the cellular level might relate to clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits remain unclear. Given recent data advances in the field of clinical neuroscience, it is now possible to conduct a synthesis of available data specifically related to hallucinations. These findings are integrated with the latest computational frameworks of hallucinations, and recommendations for future research are provided.

### NG2 glia-derived GABA release tunes inhibitory synapses and contributes to stress-induced anxiety [^1113LmAb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

GABA, as well as glutamate, is one of the most prevalent neurotransmitters released mainly by inhibitory neurons and is crucial for maintaining brain network functionality. The change in GABA neurotransmitter levels in the synaptic cleft can be mainly caused by:

1. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65/67 biosynthesis.
2. Glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle.
3. GABA uptake through GABA transporters.

Our results indicate that the enhancement of mIPSCs frequency onto interneurons by NG2 glia photoactivation is not mainly regulated through a GABA transport mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 15). Instead, our data provide evidence that NG2 glia activation favors GABA signaling transmission through a GAD67 synthetase and VAMP-2-containing vesicular assembly machinery, thus enhancing the inhibitory synaptic activity directly onto local, adjacent GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal CA1 region (Figs. 2–5). Therefore, our results presented in the study demonstrate that adult NG2 glia has the capability of releasing the neurotransmitter GABA, in addition to the secretion of growth factor FGF2, indicating an additional source of GABA from NG2 glia besides inhibitory neurons in the brain.

Anxiety disorders are a category of mental illnesses with an estimated prevalence of ~7.3% of the world population characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear. We hypothesize that altered GABA transmission and E-I imbalance largely contribute to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders in humans and rodents as well. In the hippocampus, complex spiking of pyramidal cells and their synchronized activity is hypothesized to be influenced by this altered transmission.

### Therapies in stiff-person syndrome: Advances and future prospects based on disease pathophysiology [^116n2PTR]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is an autoimmune disorder resulting from impaired inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission, associated with high-titer antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) — the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Approximately 5–10% of patients with SPS also experience cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, or nystagmus, forming part of the GAD-antibody–spectrum disorders (GAD-SD), which include autoimmune epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis, and myoclonus. SPS-SD is a potentially treatable group of autoimmune diseases unified by GAD-antibody–associated neuronal excitability. Among all the SPS-SD, however, SPS is the most common and challenging because it presents slowly with complex symptoms that delay diagnosis and treatment. This issue is critical as SPS is a steadily progressive disease characterized by impaired reciprocal inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission and autoimmunity, necessitating a combination of specific long-term therapeutic strategies from the outset. The autoimmunity against inhibitory neurotransmission in SPS-SD is exacerbated by the presence of other synaptic antibodies, including those against glycine-a1 receptor, amphiphysin, and gephyrin as seen in paraneoplastic SPS.

The purpose of this article was to outline the rationale and merits of various therapeutic strategies and discuss how best to improve patient outcomes and design new clinical trials.

### Modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [^111nw5zF]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Although the precise mechanisms underlying the CNS degeneration of patients with glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) deficiency are still the subject of intense debate, many studies have highlighted that excitotoxicity plays a fundamental role in the neuropathology of this disease, particularly involving the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Modulation of the glutamatergic system by these compounds involves an inhibition of glutamate uptake into synaptosomes and synaptic vesicles, and a decrease in glutamate binding. Furthermore, glutaric and 3-hydroxyglutaric acids inhibit glutamate decarboxylase, the key enzyme of GABA synthesis, and striatal GABAergic medium-spiny neurons are highly vulnerable to 3-hydroxyglutaric acid-induced neurotoxicity. In conclusion, glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid induce an imbalance in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission.

### Basic concepts of neurotransmission [^116Vx18k]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

An understanding of synaptic neurotransmission is fundamental to the understanding of various neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders. It is also essential in the discovery of pharmacologic agents that modulate neurotransmission to alleviate such symptoms and conditions. Various aspects of the process of neurotransmission — including synthesis, release, reuptake, or destruction — are all potential events for the action of therapeutic drugs. This article reviews the basic aspects of relevant neuroanatomy, neurotransmission, and major neurotransmitter systems.

### Therapies in stiff-person syndrome: Advances and future prospects based on disease pathophysiology [^116Twdqf]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The impaired GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission in patients with SPS is supported and explained by the following fundamental findings: (1) reduction of brain GABA, shown by magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies; (2) concomitant reduction of GABA levels in the CSF; and (3) dysfunction of supraspinal GABAergic neurons resulting in motor cortex hyperexcitability based on transcranial magnetic stimulation studies. This explains the stimuli-induced muscle rigidity and spasms. GABA, being the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain with 25%–35% of synapses being GABAergic, is involved in muscle tone, fear, anxiety, autonomic responses, and epileptogenesis, all of which are symptoms seen in SPS.

The consequences of the impaired reciprocal GABAergic inhibition and cortical hyperexcitability are clinically expressed by the following four critical SPS symptoms we aim to target with GABA-enhancing drugs:

- **Stiffness of the truncal and proximal limb muscles**: This is prominent in the thoracolumbar paraspinals and abdominal muscles, causing difficulty turning and bending forward, hyperlordotic posture, and increased thoracolumbar curvature. In chronic and severe cases, it can be associated with hypertrophy of the lumbar paraspinals or resembles an S-shape thoracolumbar spine formation, as depicted in the X-rays.

- **Spasms in the tibialis anterior and posterior**: These can often result in painful spastic foot inversion and toe extension or claw-toe formation that prevents full-step initiation.

- **Gait dysfunction and falls**: This causes slow walking.

The management of these symptoms is crucial for improving patient outcomes.

### Precision of metabolite-selective MRS measurements of glutamate, GABA and glutathione: A review of human brain studies [^113ow7QC]. NMR in Biomedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SV 1 H-MRS) is an in vivo noninvasive imaging technique used to detect neurotransmitters and metabolites. It enables repeated measurements in living participants to build explanatory neurochemical models of psychiatric symptoms and to test therapeutic approaches. Given the tight link among glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutathione, and glutamine within the cellular machinery, MRS investigations of neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders must quantify a network of metabolites simultaneously to capture the pathophysiological states of interest.

Metabolite-selective sequences typically provide improved metabolite isolation and spectral modelling simplification for a single metabolite at a time. Non-metabolite-selective sequences provide information on all detectable human brain metabolites but feature many signal overlaps and require complicated spectral modelling. Although there are short-echo time (TE) MRS sequences that do not use spectral editing and are optimized to target either glutamate, GABA, or glutathione, these approaches usually imply a precision tradeoff for the remaining two metabolites.

Given the interest in assessing psychiatric and neurocognitive diseases that involve excitation-inhibition imbalances along with oxidative stress, there is a need to survey the literature on the quantification precision of metabolite-selective MRS techniques. In this review, we locate and describe 17 studies that report on the quality of simultaneously acquired MRS metabolite data in the human brain.

### GABA and glutamate in pediatric migraine [^111CFL9c]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

The primary neurochemicals associated with inhibition and excitation in the brain are GABA and glutamate, respectively. These can be measured in vivo noninvasively using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A recent review of MRS studies showed that, in adults with migraine, GABA and glutamate levels are increased in multiple brain areas. For example, adults with migraine show increased glutamate and increased GABA levels in the visual cortex, as well as increased glutamate in the thalamus.

Despite indirect evidence of abnormal cortical excitability in children with migraine, GABA and glutamate levels remain uninvestigated. The GABA/glutamate ratio may be used to index the inhibitory/excitatory balance and may show a stronger effect than changes in either neurochemical alone. Using advanced MRS methods, this study compares GABA and glutamate in the thalamus, sensorimotor, and visual cortices of children with and without migraine. Although the most predominant symptom of migraine is severe headache, 20% of migraine sufferers experience visual disturbances, known as aura, which is associated with increased responsiveness of the visual cortex. Subsequently, GABA and glutamate levels in the visual cortex were compared between children with migraine with and without aura, and children without migraine. Finally, this study explores the association between these neurochemical levels and migraine characteristics to improve our understanding of pediatric migraine.

### Glutamatergic and GABAergic reactivity and cognition in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and healthy volunteers: A randomized double-blind 7-Tesla pharmacological MRS study [^111nrQys]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) measurements were performed on a MAGNETOM 7T MR scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using a single-channel transmit/32-channel receiving head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA). Spectra were acquired with a stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence using the following parameters: TE = 6.0 ms, TM = 10.0 ms, TR = 5.0 s, NA = 64, flip angle = 90°, radio frequency (RF) bandwidth = 4.69 kHz, RF centered at 2.4 ppm, receive bandwidth = 4.0 kHz, vector size = 2048, 16-step phase cycling, acquisition time = 5:20 min.

Water suppression was achieved by variable power RF pulses with optimized relaxation delays. In addition, a complete phase cycle of measurements was acquired without the water suppression RF pulses to record a water peak reference for eddy correction and absolute metabolite concentration calibration.

Spectroscopic voxels of interest were manually placed by a trained operator at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (voxel size = 25 × 20 × 17 mm³) and the right striatum (voxel size = 20 × 20 × 20 mm³). Prior to the spectroscopy measurements, a 3D-GRE dual-echo field map (TE 1 = 1.00 ms, TE 2 = 2.98 ms, TR = 20.0 ms, flip angle = 8°, voxel size = 3 mm isotropic, matrix size = 84 × 84 × 56, bandwidth = 1450 Hz/pixel, acquisition time = 2:24 min) was acquired and used to calculate the shim currents required to homogenize the static magnetic field in the spectroscopic voxels of interest.

### Glycine receptor autoantibodies disrupt inhibitory neurotransmission [^112WxJvt]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Over the past 15 years, autoantibodies to extracellular epitopes of neuronal surface proteins have been described in patients with a spectrum of acquired neuropsychiatric diseases. The discovery of such autoantibodies has revolutionized neurological practice since, in contrast to autoantibodies against intracellular epitopes, these autoantibodies have the potential to be directly pathogenic and the associated diseases often respond to immunomodulatory therapies.

Knowledge that an autoantibody to a neuronal surface protein is pathogenic facilitates prompt clinical recognition of patients likely to respond to early immunotherapy aimed at reducing the levels of the antibodies (e.g. plasmapheresis) and suppressing the pathogenic immune response. Nonetheless, responses to treatment may be incomplete, and agents with substantial risk of adverse effects are often required. In some cases, prolonged periods of intensive care and rehabilitation are necessary before the treatment effects are seen. For individual patients, it is therefore crucial to establish a definite diagnosis of antibody-mediated neurological disease, ensuring that systemic and sustained immunotherapies are used if required.

While specific autoantibodies to exposed epitopes in the CNS are identified in an increasing proportion of patients presenting with neurological disorders, it is sometimes unclear whether the autoantibodies are pathogenic or whether they occur as an epiphenomenon, for example, as a result of neuronal damage due to degenerative processes or seizures.

### Charting brain GABA and glutamate levels across psychiatric disorders by quantitative analysis of 121H-MRS studies [^116sJ4DL]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The biological hypothesis for psychiatric disorders is primarily focused on neurotransmitter systems. Glutamate (Glu) is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glu is crucial for brain functionality and development, and it binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which are critical for neuronal communication. Glutamatergic dysfunction has been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and schizophrenia. Evidence supporting Glu's role in psychiatric disease includes synergistic interaction between monoamines and antidepressants, elevated prefrontal Glu concentrations in MDD, dysregulated modulation of striatal dopamine neurotransmission, and NMDAR hypofunction in schizophrenia, as well as altered gut-microbiota-mediated Glu metabolism noted in ASD. Therefore, glutamatergic dysregulation may affect the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders.

GABA plays a crucial role in neural-network dynamics via GABAergic interneurons. Beyond its structural contributions, GABA has instrumental roles in physiological processes such as neural plasticity and stress reactivity. GABAergic inhibition plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychotic disorders.

### Pathological glutamatergic neurotransmission in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome [^114LbAz8]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a hereditary neuropsychiatric movement disorder with reported abnormalities in the neurotransmission of dopamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Spatial focal alterations in the excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory neurochemical ratios within specific functional subdivisions of the basal ganglia may lead to the expression of diverse motor and non-motor features manifested in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Treatment strategies are often unsatisfactory, thus provoking the need for further elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology.

In view of the close spatio-temporal synergy exhibited between excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory neurotransmitter systems; the crucial role played by glutamate (Glu) in tonic/phasic dopaminergic signalling; and the interdependent metabolic relationship exhibited between Glu and GABA via glutamine (Gln), we postulated that glutamatergic signalling is related to the pathophysiology of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. As such, we examined the neurochemical profile of three cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical regions in 37 well-characterized, drug-free adult patients and 36 age/gender-matched healthy control subjects via magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T. To interrogate the influence of treatment on metabolite concentrations, spectral data were acquired from 15 patients undergoing a 4-week treatment with aripiprazole. Test-retest reliability measurements in 23 controls indicated high repeatability of voxel localization and metabolite quantitation. We report significant reductions in the specified metrics.

### Translating glutamate: From pathophysiology to treatment [^115wmr6R]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The neurotransmitter glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain and is responsible for most corticocortical and corticofugal neurotransmission. Disturbances in glutamatergic function have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, drug abuse and addiction, autism, and depression, which were until recently poorly understood. Nevertheless, improvements in basic information regarding these disorders have yet to translate into Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments. Barriers to translation include the need not only for improved compounds but also for improved biomarkers sensitive to both structural and functional target engagement and for improved translational models. Overcoming these barriers will require unique collaborative arrangements between pharma, government, and academia. Here, we review a recent Institute of Medicine-sponsored meeting, highlighting advances in glutamatergic theories of neuropsychiatric illness as well as remaining barriers to treatment development.

### GABAergic signaling linked to autophagy enhances host protection against intracellular bacterial infections [^111gPBuK]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and has been extensively studied in neurological disorders such as epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. In neuronal cells, GABA is produced from glutamic acid by the action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD67. In turn, GABA is broken down by GABA transaminase to be recycled through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to form glutamic acid. The optimal regulation of GABA-glutamic acid circuits is critical for the physiological function of the central nervous system, and its imbalance may trigger a myriad of symptoms associated with numerous neurological disorders. Therefore, GABAergic medications that correct dysregulated GABAergic neurotransmission are being used to treat epilepsy, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia, as well as in anesthesia.

A growing body of evidence has shown that a variety of peripheral immune cells express functional GABAergic components, including GABA-A ion channels, the GABA-B receptor, GABA transporters, and enzymes involved in GABA synthesis or degradation. Preclinical studies suggest the potential application of GABA or GABAergic (agonistic) drugs as new therapeutics against autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including type 1 diabetes, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and collagen-induced arthritis. Nonetheless, given the potential role for GABA in the modulation of innate immune responses, it is poorly understood whether and how GABAergic signaling regulates antimicrobial host defenses.

### Excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric disorders: Therapeutic implications [^116jfPMi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Neurological and psychiatric disorders are leading contributors to the global disease burden, seriously impacting the quality of life of both patients and their relatives. Although the molecular events underlying these heterogeneous diseases remain poorly understood, some studies have raised the idea of common mechanisms involved. In excitotoxicity, there is an excessive activation of glutamate receptors by excitatory amino acids, leading to neuronal damage. Thus, the excessive release of glutamate can lead to a dysregulation of Ca²⁺ homeostasis, triggering the production of free radicals and oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventually cell death.

Although there is a consensus in considering excitotoxicity as a hallmark in most neurodegenerative diseases, increasing evidence points to the relevant role of this pathological mechanism in other illnesses affecting the central nervous system. Consequently, antagonists of glutamate receptors are used in treatments or clinical trials for both neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, drugs modulating other aspects of the excitotoxic mechanism could be more beneficial. This review discusses how excitotoxicity is involved in the pathogenesis of different neurological and psychiatric disorders and explores the promising strategies targeting the excitotoxic insult.

### Gaba and glutamate deficits from frontotemporal lobar degeneration are associated with disinhibition [^112VMmcx]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Murley et al. use ultra-high field (7T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure in vivo glutamate and GABA in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes and show that deficits in these neurotransmitters are associated with behavioural disinhibition.

### GABA and glutamate in pediatric migraine [^115RKoS1]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Many suggest that hormonal changes are a pivotal factor in migraine due to dramatic changes in prevalence between males and females. Before puberty, there is a slightly higher prevalence of migraine in males, whereas after puberty, prevalence increases dramatically in females, affecting approximately two females to one male. However, the mechanism behind this change is not clear. We suggest the aforementioned GABA and glutamate changes are important factors. Due to the narrow age range used in this study, the majority of participants were classified as being in the pre/early stages, using the pubertal status questionnaire. Therefore, although it is likely that puberty has a modulatory effect on brain development and migraine, these effects are minimized here.

In addition to higher glutamate, a recent systematic review demonstrated that adults with migraine showed higher levels of GABA in various cortical and subcortical regions. In the thalamus, we found GABA/Glx to be higher in the migraine group, primarily driven by higher GABA, although group comparisons did not reach statistical significance. Higher GABA levels are thought to reflect an increased inhibitory tone. Indeed, there is evidence of reduced thalamic activity in adults with migraine between attacks, which may be due to an increase in inhibition. Within the migraine group, we found an association between higher GABA levels and higher migraine burden (measured by the PedMIDAS) in all three areas, although only the sensorimotor cortex reached statistical significance. This indicates that children with higher GABA levels are more affected by their migraines.

### Increased excitatory to inhibitory synaptic ratio in parietal cortex samples from individuals with Alzheimer's disease [^116A1yjT]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Synaptic disturbances in excitatory to inhibitory (E/I) balance in forebrain circuits are thought to contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia, although direct evidence for such imbalance in humans is lacking. We assessed anatomical and electrophysiological synaptic E/I ratios in post-mortem parietal cortex samples from middle-aged individuals with AD (early-onset) or Down syndrome (DS) by fluorescence deconvolution tomography and microtransplantation of synaptic membranes. Both approaches revealed significantly elevated E/I ratios for AD, but not DS, versus controls. Gene expression studies in an independent AD cohort also demonstrated elevated E/I ratios in individuals with AD as compared to controls. These findings provide evidence of a marked pro-excitatory perturbation of synaptic E/I balance in the AD parietal cortex, a region within the default mode network that is overly active in the disorder, and support the hypothesis that E/I imbalances disrupt cognition-related shifts in cortical activity, which contribute to the intellectual decline in AD.

### Glutamate and anxiety disorders [^111wtEEZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, yet they pose a significant challenge for treatment. Standard first-line treatments, such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and buspirone, achieve significant response rates for a majority of patients. However, their unfavorable side effect profiles or the risk of dependency may limit their use among anxious patients, who often have low thresholds for medication discontinuation. Novel pharmacologic agents that modulate specific receptors, ion channels, or transporters relevant to glutamatergic neurotransmission may offer a new approach to treating anxiety disorders, with generally more favorable side effect profiles. Although the role of glutamate in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is still being elucidated, the use of these agents in treating anxiety disorders and frequently comorbid conditions, such as substance abuse and mood disorders, is expected to increase.

### Cortical glutamate and GABA are related to compulsive behaviour in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder and healthy controls [^115mchsD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

There has been little analysis of neurochemical correlates of compulsive behaviour to illuminate its underlying neural mechanisms. We use 7-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) to assess the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission by measuring glutamate and GABA levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) of healthy volunteers and participants with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

Within the SMA, trait and clinical measures of compulsive behaviour are related to glutamate levels, whereas a behavioural index of habitual control correlates with the glutamate:GABA ratio. Participants with OCD also show the latter relationship in the ACC while exhibiting elevated glutamate and lower GABA levels in that region. This study highlights SMA mechanisms of habitual control relevant to compulsive behaviour, common to the healthy sub-clinical and OCD populations. The results also demonstrate additional involvement of the anterior cingulate in the balance between goal-directed and habitual responding in OCD.

### Molecular basis of human GABA transporter 3 inhibition [^112o6Vou]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter and plays an essential role in the function and maturation of the central nervous system (CNS). Upon release from synaptic vesicles, GABA activates receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, lowering the probability of triggering an action potential. Malfunctions in GABA signaling are involved in a range of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, autism, anxiety, and schizophrenia, among others. GABA transporters (GATs) remove GABA from the synaptic cleft and maintain the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.

In mammals, four different sodium (Na⁺) and chloride (Cl⁻) dependent GABA transporters, GAT1–3 and the betaine/GABA transporter (BGT1), have been identified and characterized for their physiological role. GAT1 and GAT3 are exclusively expressed in the CNS, whereas GAT2 and BGT1 are expressed in various other tissues, including the kidney, liver, and blood-brain barrier.

### Association study between GABA receptor genes and anxiety spectrum disorders [^1115DKYq]. Depression and Anxiety (2009). Low credibility.

Human anxiety disorders are complex diseases with relatively unknown etiology. Dysfunction of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system has been implicated in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including anxiety and depressive disorders. In this investigation, we explored four GABA receptor genes for their possible associations with genetic risk for anxiety disorders and depression.

- **Methods**: Our study sample consisted of 589 cases and 539 controls selected from a large population-based twin registry based upon a latent genetic risk factor shared by several anxiety disorders, major depression, and neuroticism. We subjected these to a two-stage protocol, in which all candidate genetic markers were screened for association in stage 1 (N = 376), the positive results of which were tested for replication in stage 2 (N = 752). We analyzed data from 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from four GABA receptor genes: GABRA2, GABRA3, GABRA6, and GABRG2.

- **Results**: Of the 26 SNPs genotyped in stage 1, we identified two markers in GABRA3 that met the threshold (P ≤ .1) to be tested in stage 2. Phenotypic associations of these two markers failed to replicate in stage 2.

- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest that common variation in the GABRA2, GABRA3, GABRA6, and GABRG2 genes does not play a major role in liability to anxiety spectrum disorders.

### Neuropsychiatric adverse effects from CFTR modulators deserve a serious research effort [^114BJi99]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), and chloride is so central to its proper function that the GABA-A receptor is commonly categorized as a ligand-gated chloride channel. Upon binding of GABA to its receptor, a synaptic pore opens that allows chloride anions to pass, leading to hyperpolarization or inhibition of the neuron. Just as chloride balance dysfunction is a core mechanism of CF, proper chloride balance is a core mechanism of normal brain function, particularly in the regulation of anxiety and depression. For example, the antianxiety and antidepressive actions of benzodiazepines are exerted by binding to the GABA-A receptor and modulating GABA-induced chloride current.

Specific emotion regulation brain circuits and structures are particularly reliant upon GABA — and therefore chloride — function. For example, the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is an emotion regulation hub whose function is disrupted in multiple psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety. Neuroimaging studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have repeatedly shown that reduced GABA concentration in rACC is associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Loss of GABAergic function disinhibits the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which is thought to be a central mechanism of anxiety and depression. Relatedly, inflammation-related activation of glial cells (the resident immune cells of the central nervous system) causes the release of proinflammatory and neuroexcitatory mediators, including glutamate.

### Understanding the genetic mechanisms and cognitive impairments in Down syndrome: Towards a holistic approach [^111v8zjw]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters heavily regulate neuronal cortical and subcortical circuits, and the disruption of the balance between excitation and inhibition is a proposed etiological mechanism for a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders. At a neuronal level, the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons is important for processing and transmitting information; therefore, such processes must remain well-regulated and controlled.

Based on research available at the time of writing, there are several key regulators to maintain this balance, such as intrinsic neuronal excitability, neuronal plasticity, and synaptic transmission. On a more cellular level, glutamatergic excitatory neurons and GABAergic inhibitory neurons are the key contributors to balance. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the developed brain. Given the inhibitory effect of GABA on the brain, an excess of GABA in a mature brain can result in sedation, while a GABA synapse blockade can result in seizures.

GABA performs its actions by binding ion-gated GABA-A receptors and metabotropic GABA-B receptors. GABA-A receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels composed of five subunits. A total of 19 possible subunits have been identified, with the most common isoform consisting of two alpha subunits, two beta subunits, and a gamma subunit. When GABA is released into synaptic clefts and binds to GABA-A receptors, it generates a dependent potential, influenced by the difference between the equilibrium potential of chloride anions (Cl−) and the resting potential of the postsynaptic neuron.

### Gaba and glutamate in pediatric migraine [^111TJ8hv]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Migraine often begins in childhood, with roughly 20% of sufferers experiencing their first attack before 5 years of age. Early intervention can decrease migraine frequency, with those receiving earlier interventions more likely to achieve remission. However, treatment strategies for children are limited, in part due to limited knowledge about pediatric migraine biology. Migraine is often managed similarly in children as in adults, despite evidence that children with migraine present with different symptoms. Standard medications to prevent migraine in adults have been shown to be no more effective than placebo in children and may carry side effects. To improve treatments for children, understanding the underlying biology of pediatric migraine is essential.

There is compelling evidence that adult migraine results from an imbalance of excitation/inhibition in the brain, which changes cyclically until a migraine occurs, known as the migraine cycle. During the interictal period, cortical excitability increases proportionally with time until the next attack. During the ictal period, or shortly thereafter, the brain returns to baseline activity and begins the cycle again. Neurophysiological studies suggest this cortical hyperexcitability results from abnormal thalamic control, resulting in altered communication in thalamocortical networks, which underlie important processes in multisensory integration; this altered communication is associated with clinical migraine symptoms. Excitability of the sensory cortices is set by activity in these thalamocortical loops.

### The emerging differential roles of GABAergic and antiglutamatergic agents in bipolar disorders [^116hHPT1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment options to relieve the diverse symptoms encountered in patients with bipolar disorders include not only mood stabilizers but also anxiolytics, new anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. These agents have widely varying mechanisms of action, which contribute to the heterogeneity of clinical effects seen in practice. Several of these medications, especially those with anticonvulsant effects, enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission and/or attenuate glutamate excitatory neurotransmission. We review the efficacy and tolerability of these diverse treatment options in bipolar disorders and explore possible relationships between clinical effects and GABAergic and antiglutamatergic mechanisms of action.
