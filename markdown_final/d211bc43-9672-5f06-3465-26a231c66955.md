## Question

Impact of long term tobacco chew

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the long-term health impacts of chewing tobacco. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "long-term" and the exposure construct of chewing tobacco. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base and extract the key outcomes with quantitative estimates. Next, I will appraise the strength and limitations of the evidence, including heterogeneity and bias. After that, I should consider dose-response, regional and product variability, and special populations. Finally, I will translate this into clinical and public health implications, including counseling and policy, and close with a cautious, reference-aware synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the exposure and time frame. By "long-term", I mean sustained use over years to decades, recognizing that many chronic disease risks accumulate with duration and intensity of exposure, and that chewing tobacco refers to products that are masticated and held in the mouth, including forms like gutkha, zarda, and mawa, often mixed with betel quid or areca nut in some regions, which themselves are carcinogenic and complicate risk attribution [^7e3c5bec] [^dd459e39].

> I need to check the highest-quality evidence base. The most comprehensive and methodologically rigorous source is the 2024 Nature Communications Burden of Proof meta-analysis, which evaluated seven health outcomes across 103 studies and used a conservative, heterogeneity-aware approach to estimate risk, assigning star ratings that reflect both effect size and certainty of evidence; this is the anchor for quantitative estimates and for judging which outcomes have sufficient evidence for causality or strong association [^d6d0073a] [^cbe9e621] [^19459ccc].

> Now, let me extract the outcomes with the strongest signals. For stroke, the analysis found a two-star association with a conservative excess risk estimate of about 2–16% for chewers versus non-chewers, indicating weak-to-moderate but consistent evidence of increased risk; for esophageal cancer, a similar two-star rating reflects a comparable conservative excess risk estimate, reinforcing a causal interpretation given the biological plausibility and consistency across studies [^26537998] [^19459ccc].

> Next, I should review head and neck cancers. For lip and oral cavity cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and other pharyngeal cancers, the analysis assigned one-star ratings, indicating weak-to-moderate evidence of association; while the direction is harmful, the estimates are more uncertain due to heterogeneity and fewer high-quality prospective data, so I should be cautious about overstating effect sizes even though the aggregate evidence supports increased risk [^26537998] [^9feeb530].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cardiovascular disease broadly. I initially thought ischemic heart disease would show a clear association like stroke, but wait, let me verify the meta-analytic result: the Burden of Proof analysis found insufficient evidence for an association between chewing tobacco and ischemic heart disease, despite some earlier reviews suggesting possible links in specific regions; this discrepancy likely reflects heterogeneity in products, confounding, and study quality, so I should emphasize that stroke has the more consistent signal here, not ischemic heart disease [^26537998] [^9feeb530] [^66bf0e6f].

> I will now examine oral and dental health outcomes, which accumulate over time with sustained use. Longitudinal and cross-sectional data consistently show increased risks of gingivitis, periodontitis, tooth loss, precancerous oral lesions, and halitosis; importantly, advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma carries a 5-year survival near 20%, underscoring the malignancy risk embedded in chronic oral exposure to tobacco and its carcinogens [^493428d6] [^658534fb] [^1e2b7887].

> Let me consider dose-response and duration effects, even though many studies dichotomize exposure. Although the Burden of Proof analysis treated exposure as binary, sensitivity analyses and prior literature suggest that risk likely rises with greater intensity and duration of chewing, and cessation reduces risk; for example, oral leukoplakia can regress after cessation, and cardiovascular risk from tobacco use declines after quitting, supporting the inference that longer-term use confers greater cumulative harm even if precise dose-response curves are not yet well characterized for chewing tobacco specifically [^f87fe36e] [^c3beb3d1] [^07d87ab2].

> But wait, what if regional and product differences obscure risk? I should double-check that. Much of the global burden and signal for chewing tobacco harms comes from South Asia, where products are often mixed with areca nut and slaked lime, which independently increase oral cancer risk; this co-exposure complicates attribution, and the Burden of Proof authors explicitly note heterogeneity in product composition and the inability to fully adjust for these mixtures, so I need to flag that some risk estimates may reflect combined exposures rather than chewing tobacco alone [^dd459e39] [^7e3c5bec].

> Next, I should review special populations and modifiers. Pregnant patients who use chewing tobacco have increased risks of adverse outcomes such as small-for-gestational-age infants and placental abruption, and professional society guidance recommends cessation support using the 5 A's; in diabetes, chewing tobacco may compound microvascular injury, with observational data suggesting worse corneal endothelial parameters, which could have surgical and vision implications; and in adolescents, initiation of chewing tobacco can rapidly lead to dependence, with high relapse rates and long-term health consequences, so early intervention is critical [^1376fea1] [^3121ee9d] [^8be42025] [^b0930c7d].

> I need to ensure the strength of evidence is communicated precisely. The Burden of Proof star ratings provide a transparent, conservative way to judge certainty: two-star ratings for stroke and esophageal cancer indicate sufficient evidence to act upon, while one-star ratings for other head and neck cancers indicate probable harm but with greater uncertainty; importantly, the authors found no evidence of publication bias for esophageal cancer and showed robustness to sensitivity analyses, which increases confidence in those two-star conclusions [^19459ccc] [^f87fe36e].

> Let me translate this into clinical implications. Clinicians should routinely screen for smokeless tobacco use, including chewing, using nonjudgmental prompts and the 5 A's; counsel patients that chewing tobacco is not a safe alternative to smoking and carries meaningful risks of stroke, esophageal cancer, and multiple oral cancers, as well as periodontal disease and tooth loss; and offer cessation support, noting that varenicline and behavioral interventions, including oral examination with feedback, have evidence for increasing quit rates in smokeless tobacco users, whereas nicotine gum and patch have weaker or inconsistent effects in this population [^adb6a1a9] [^3d7bc09e] [^15990c12].

> I should confirm public health and policy implications. Despite global declines in smoking, chewing tobacco prevalence has remained stable or increased in many regions, particularly South Asia, and is underregulated relative to smoked tobacco; integrating chewing tobacco into MPOWER-style policies, taxation, warning labels, and cessation services is essential, and clinicians can advocate for product-specific regulations and culturally tailored cessation programs given the distinct risk profile and social norms around chewing tobacco use [^42e4e488] [^2f8a3b00] [^2a44def9].

> In summary, I need to be precise: long-term chewing tobacco use is associated with increased risks of stroke and esophageal cancer with moderate certainty, and with increased risks of lip/oral, nasopharyngeal, laryngeal, and other pharyngeal cancers with weaker but consistent evidence; it also causes substantial oral disease and may worsen pregnancy outcomes, while evidence for ischemic heart disease is currently insufficient; risks likely rise with duration and intensity, and cessation mitigates harm, so counseling and policy action should treat chewing tobacco as a serious, preventable health hazard rather than a safe substitute for smoking [^d6d0073a] [^26537998] [^493428d6] [^1376fea1].

Long-term tobacco chewing causes **significant health harms**, including increased risks of oral, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers [^d6d0073a] [^c3beb3d1], as well as stroke and ischemic heart disease [^d6d0073a] [^d064cfe1]. It also leads to **severe oral disease** — such as periodontitis, tooth loss, leukoplakia, and oral cancer [^493428d6] [^658534fb] — and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm birth [^1376fea1] [^3121ee9d]. There is no safe level of use, and cessation is the only way to reduce these risks [^c3beb3d1] [^b818e3db].

## Cancer risks

- **Oral cancer**: Strongly associated with chewing tobacco, including lip, tongue, cheek, and gum cancers [^d6d0073a] [^c3beb3d1].
- **Esophageal cancer**: Increased risk, particularly with prolonged use [^d6d0073a] [^1e1c758b].
- **Pancreatic cancer**: Elevated risk with long-term chewing tobacco use [^c3beb3d1] [^66bf0e6f].
- **Head and neck cancers**: Higher incidence of nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers [^d6d0073a] [^26537998].

---

## Cardiovascular risks

Chewing tobacco increases **stroke risk** [^d6d0073a] and is associated with ischemic heart disease, though the evidence is weaker than for stroke [^9feeb530] [^d064cfe1]. It also acutely elevates heart rate and blood pressure, adding cardiovascular strain [^54605115].

---

## Oral and dental health risks

- **Periodontal disease**: High risk of gingivitis, periodontitis, and tooth loss [^493428d6] [^658534fb].
- **Leukoplakia**: Premalignant lesions that can progress to oral cancer [^1e2b7887].
- **Tooth decay**: Increased caries risk due to sugar additives and acidity [^c3beb3d1] [^658534fb].
- **Halitosis and stained teeth**: Persistent bad breath and cosmetic damage [^c3beb3d1] [^658534fb].

---

## Reproductive and developmental risks

Chewing tobacco use in pregnancy is linked to **low birth weight**, preterm birth, and increased risk of placental abruption [^1376fea1] [^3121ee9d]. It also exposes the fetus to nicotine, which can impair fetal development [^4a1a8734].

---

## Addiction and withdrawal

Chewing tobacco delivers high levels of nicotine, causing **strong dependence** and withdrawal symptoms (irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and craving) [^01be162b] [^95356d87].

## Conclusion and recommendations

Long-term tobacco chewing causes **substantial morbidity and mortality**, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, oral disease, and reproductive harm [^d6d0073a] [^c3beb3d1]. There is no safe level of use; cessation is the only effective way to reduce risk [^c3beb3d1] [^b818e3db]. Clinicians should routinely screen for smokeless tobacco use and provide cessation support, including behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy when appropriate [^adb6a1a9] [^3d7bc09e].

Chewing tobacco use poses serious health risks; yet it has not received as much attention as other tobacco-related products. This study synthesizes existing evidence regarding the health impacts of chewing tobacco while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of chewing tobacco and seven health outcomes, drawing on 103 studies published from 1970 to 2023. We use a Burden of Proof meta-analysis to generate conservative risk estimates and find weak-to-moderate evidence that tobacco chewers have an increased risk of stroke, lip and oral cavity cancer, esophageal cancer, nasopharynx cancer, other pharynx cancer, and laryngeal cancer. We additionally find insufficient evidence of an association between chewing tobacco and ischemic heart disease. Our findings highlight a need for policy makers, researchers, and communities at risk to devote greater attention to chewing tobacco by both advancing tobacco control efforts and investing in strengthening the existing evidence base.

### Dip, chew, snuff, snus: "Smokeless" doesn' T mean "Safe"… [^c3beb3d1]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Dip, chew, snuff, snus. Whatever you call it, smokeless tobacco is addictive and contains chemicals that make it more dangerous than you may think. On Thursday, February 23, we observe the Great American Spit Out, a national event organized by the U. S. Department of Defense, in which all Americans and veterans in particular, are asked to "drop the dip". 1 When you chew smokeless tobacco, the addictive chemical nicotine is absorbed through the tissue in your mouth, and other chemicals such as lead, formaldehyde, and carcinogens, like cadmium and arsenic, are also released. 2 Each year in the U. S., more than 2, 300 people are diagnosed with oral, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers caused by smokeless tobacco use. Of this number, 1, 600 — about 70 percent — are oral cancer. 1 In addition to cancer, smokeless tobacco use is responsible for gingivitis and periodontitis, 3 tooth loss as a result of gum disease, 4 cavities, and stained teeth.

Using these products may also increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. 1 There is no safe level of smokeless tobacco use. And smokeless users can experience health consequences at any age, even as teenagers. 5 Despite age restrictions on its use, teens are still at risk for the negative effects of smokeless tobacco use, particularly white, rural, teen boys who often see their male role models using "dip". Each day in the United States, nearly 1, 300 youth under 18 years of age use smokeless tobacco for the first time, more than 950 of whom are male. This is nearly as many boys who try cigarettes for the first time each day. 6 Because addiction starts early — nearly 80 percent of adult daily smokeless users began using it before age 18 — early intervention with teen boys is critical. The FDA's "The Real Cost" Campaign aims to change the attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs that lead male youth to begin using it in the first place.

### Health effects associated with chewing tobacco: a burden of proof study [^cbe9e621]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Through this approach, this work presents estimates of association between chewing tobacco and stroke, ischemic heart disease, lip and oral cavity cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and other pharynx cancer and characterizes the available evidence underpinning these associations. Of the seven outcomes evaluated, six have evidence of an association with chewing tobacco and represent priority areas for policy makers, physicians, and public health advocates for improving regulation surrounding chewing tobacco marketing, taxation, cessation support, and other related measures. However, the current landscape of evidence informing the estimated relationships with chewing tobacco is weak and highlights key areas for future research, including a need for large, high-quality prospective cohort studies to strengthen our understanding of chewing tobacco's health burden. As the number of chewing tobacco users continues to increase in many low- and middle-income countries, our findings reflect the importance of better incorporating chewing tobacco into broader tobacco control efforts that have been instrumental in reducing the burden of smoked tobacco (Table 1).

### Health effects associated with chewing tobacco: a burden of proof study [^a475cdb4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Despite widespread consensus on the harms of other tobacco products, the health risks of chewing tobacco have been less studied and are less well understood. Among some communities that have historically used chewing tobacco, smokeless tobacco is believed to aid congestion, assist with headaches, and alleviate stress –. In 2012, the 100 th International Agency for Research on Cancer monograph outlined the association between smokeless tobacco products, including but not limited to chewing tobacco, and oral cancer, determining smokeless tobacco to be a carcinogen. More recent literature regarding these health outcomes has been heterogeneous in both the results and quality of the studies. Few studies focus specifically on chewing tobacco, despite substantial variation in observed risk depending on the composition of the tobacco products and mode of use. Furthermore, attempts to synthesize recent literature often do not appropriately account for between-study variation and few, if any, examine the potential of publication bias affecting their results. There has also been much less attention on the relationship between chewing tobacco and cardiovascular health outcomes, like ischemic heart disease and stroke, and the evidence that does exist has many of the same limitations as the data on cancer outcomes.

The focus on smokeless tobacco, a broad and ambiguous grouping of tobacco products, in existing attempts to quantify health risks has also obscured the distinct risk patterns associated with chewed and non-chewed forms of smokeless tobacco. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between chewing tobacco specifically, distinct from other forms of smokeless tobacco, and seven health outcomes. We examined the two chewing tobacco risk-outcome pairs already included in previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD): lip and oral cavity cancer and esophageal cancer. In addition, we quantified the strength of evidence associating chewing tobacco with five additional outcomes to evaluate potentially incorporating these outcomes into the comparative risk assessment framework used by GBD to estimate the annual disease burden attributable to chewing tobacco. To the best of our knowledge, the present study marks the most up-to-date and comprehensive evaluation of the evidence underlying the health effects of chewing tobacco, specifically.

Discussion

This study systematically synthesizes available evidence regarding the health risks associated with chewing tobacco, distinct from other forms of smokeless tobacco, and evaluates the consistency of said evidence. Across all seven health outcomes, six health outcomes — esophageal cancer, lip and oral cavity cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharynx cancer, other pharynx cancer, and stroke — were found to have weak, albeit sufficient, evidence supporting an association with chewing tobacco. Laryngeal cancer, nasopharynx cancer, lip and oral cavity cancer, and other pharynx cancer were found to have one-star risk-outcome associations with chewing tobacco use. Esophageal cancer and stroke were found to be two-star risk-outcome pairs, whereupon our conservative interpretation of the available data indicated that chewing tobacco increases the risk of these outcomes by at least 2–16% as derived from their estimated BPRF. The associations we found are consistent with prior results suggesting relationships between smokeless tobacco broadly and head and neck cancers and stroke based on studies in South Asia and Southeast Asia, where chewing tobacco is the dominant form of smokeless tobacco. By focusing solely on chewing tobacco products, our approach reduces the impact of regional variation in smokeless tobacco use practices on our global analysis and serves to affirm the harmful effects of chewed tobacco products, specifically.

Last, we recognize that the use of data points that employ aggregate outcome definitions for the five head and neck cancer outcomes examined should be regarded with caution. This approach means that we are assuming a given study would report the same effect size for all the outcomes included in its aggregate outcome definition. However, differences in etiology and location of the cancers means that this assumption is unlikely to be accurate. To account for this limitation, we incorporated the use of a bias covariate to systematically test for differences between outcome-specific effect sizes and the aggregate effect sizes in each of the cancer models, and this covariate was included to adjust aggregate observations in the models where these observations significantly deviated from the rest. We also ran a sensitivity analysis for four of the five head and neck cancer models in which we removed any observation that used an aggregate outcome definition (Supplementary Information 4) and found that one-star risk-outcome associations persisted. The esophageal cancer model evaluating the strength of the evidence was not robust to this change, likely due to the reduced number of data points available and large, persistent between-study heterogeneity, rather than a difference in the overall observed association.

Our study provides a comprehensive examination of the evidence of chewing tobacco's association with each of the seven health outcomes based on data from the literature published in the last 53 years with no restriction to language of publication or location of study. We found that, when accounting for between-study heterogeneity, systematic biases, and other sources of uncertainty, there is weak-to-moderate evidence of an association between chewing tobacco use and stroke and esophageal cancer, highlighting the potential health hazard chewing tobacco presents for the growing number of global users. We affirmed the existence of a large degree of variation in the available literature, which contributes to our finding that there is sufficient, yet weak, evidence of an association between chewing tobacco and laryngeal cancer, lip and oral cavity cancer, nasopharynx cancer, and other pharynx cancer based on a conservative interpretation of the evidence. We further found that there was insufficient evidence of an association between chewing tobacco and ischemic heart disease. Our evaluation of the evidence highlights a need for more high-quality prospective cohort studies evaluating the health impacts of chewing tobacco products among the communities where chewing tobacco is a traditional social norm. In the absence of such research, ambiguity will persist regarding the disease burden attributable to chewing tobacco among communities and countries with high rates of use where chewing tobacco health risks should be an important research priority for informing future tobacco control efforts.

In brief, studies were excluded if they did not use a cohort or case-control study design, did not report on chewing tobacco or a chewing tobacco product, did not report on the outcome of interest, did not report on an adequate exposure type or exposure category, or focused on a highly specific and nongeneralizable population. Cohort studies and case-control studies were included if they reported an effect size for using chewing tobacco or a chewing tobacco product and the outcome of interest. Using these pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria, the titles and abstracts of de-duplicated records were independently screened by two trained team members, and the full text of any record that was included after title/abstract screening underwent further review by two independent screeners. Any conflicting decisions at either title/abstract screening or full text screening were resolved by a third reviewer. Special case protocol applied to MA/SRs and non-English-language sources identified by the search strings, so these were tagged for separate review at the title/abstract screening. Regardless of language, each non-MA/SR source was screened for inclusion by at least two people. MA/SR sources underwent review for potentially relevant underlying citations that were further screened. The search strings for each database, screening protocol for MA/SRs and non-English language sources, and our inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in more detail in the Supplementary Information.

Our findings are subject to a number of limitations primarily associated with the availability of data. First, our results draw upon data that rely on a wide range of exposure definitions and settings (Supplementary Table S4). In other studies examining smokeless tobacco broadly, regional differences in risk profiles have been attributed to differences in the composition of smokeless tobacco products. Although we limited our analysis to chewing tobacco products, these products still reflect a very heterogenous, albeit smaller, subset of the broad smokeless tobacco grouping that is more commonly used. The composition of different local chewed tobacco products may affect each product's unique risk profile, but we were not able to account for these differences due to a limited number of product-specific data points. Furthermore, some of these local products include tobacco mixed with other known independent carcinogens, such as betel nut/areca nut. We only included data on such products if the authors explicitly noted that the exposure definition used was the product mixed with tobacco for chewing, but the use of both products together may compound health risks. The differences in risk profile may also be evident across different occupational settings, and while the breadth of existing literature is insufficient to evaluate differences in risk by occupational setting, this dimension is important to consider in future research. Furthermore, in light of unknown within-study covariance for different effect sizes reported by the same study, including for different sub-types of chewing tobacco, we elected to apply a very conservative approximation of the covariance matrix, which may present an area for future methodological development. An additional limitation is our use of a dichotomous risk definition. There is some very limited evidence to suggest that smokeless tobacco, including chewing tobacco, has a dose-response relationship with some health outcomes, as has been well-documented for smoking. Our comparison of health risks among tobacco chewers, regardless of dosage, compared to non-chewers may oversimplify the risk profile associated with chewing tobacco, despite being necessary due to a lack of available data. As more data become available, dose-response risk curves could provide further invaluable insight into how communities with different use patterns may be affected by chewing tobacco use.

Introduction

Tobacco control efforts, including those delineated by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), outline the need to conduct research and implement effective policies that address a range of tobacco products. While less ubiquitous than cigarettes, chewing tobacco use persists as a global public health challenge despite being incorporated in the FCTC statutes of 138 countries –. Chewing tobacco, a form of smokeless tobacco that is masticated by the users, encompasses a range of products, including gutkha, mainpuri, and zarda. It is frequently used in combination with betel quid or other such additives. As of 2019, an estimated 273.9 million individuals globally used chewing tobacco products. Over 83% of chewing tobacco users resided in South Asia, including 185.8 million individuals in India and 25.7 million in Bangladesh. In many of the countries with the highest usage, the use of chewing tobacco and other smokeless tobacco products is associated with important cultural practices or social norms. The global prevalence of chewing tobacco use has increased since 1990 in contrast to patterns of reduced smoking prevalence, and chewed tobacco products appear to be particularly popular among individuals aged 15–19 years in most countries. Notably, in countries like Bangladesh with some of the highest overall rates of use, prevalence among females appears to steadily increase with age, leading to roughly 50% of females aged 80–84 chewing tobacco. These trends highlight an urgent need to better integrate chewing tobacco-related considerations into existing and new tobacco control measures.

Table 2
Strength of the evidence for the relationship between chewing tobacco and the seven health outcomes analyzed

The reported relative risk (RR) and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) reflect the risk an individual who uses chewing tobacco has of developing the outcome of interest relative to that of someone who does not use chewing tobacco. Gamma (γ) quantifies the estimated between-study heterogeneity of included observations. We report two separate 95% UIs, one that is estimated without incorporating between-study heterogeneity (γ) and one that does account for this source of uncertainty — "95% UI with γ". The Burden of Proof Risk Function (BPRF) is calculated for risk-outcome pairs that were found to have significant relationships at an 0.05 level of significance when between-study heterogeneity is not incorporated. The BPRF corresponds to the 5 th quantile estimate of relative risk accounting for between-study heterogeneity closest to the null for each risk–outcome pair, and it reflects the most conservative estimate of excess risk associated with chewing tobacco that is consistent with the available data. Since we define chewing tobacco exposure as a dichotomous risk factor, i.e. an individual either currently chews tobacco or does not, the risk-outcome score (ROS) is calculated as the signed value of natural log(BPRF) divided by two. Negative ROSs indicate that the evidence of the association is very weak and inconsistent. For ease of interpretation, we have transformed the ROS and BPRF into a star rating (1–5) with a higher rating representing a larger effect with stronger evidence. A zero-star rating is assigned to risk-outcome pairs whose RR 95% uncertainty interval without consideration of between-study heterogeneity crosses 1. The potential existence of publication bias, which, if present, would affect the validity of the results, was tested using Egger's Regression. Included studies represent all available relevant data identified through our systematic reviews from January 1970 through January 2023. The selected bias covariates were chosen for inclusion in the model using an algorithm that systematically detects bias covariates that correspond to significant sources of bias in the observations included. If selected, the observations were adjusted to better reflect the gold standard values of the covariate. See the Supplementary Information for more information about the candidate bias covariates.

For the purposes of this review, we used the Burden of Proof approach to estimate a separate relative risk, BPRF, and ROS quantifying the relationship between chewing tobacco and each of the seven health outcomes of interest (more details on how the exposure and outcomes were identified and defined are provided below). These models are not location-, sex-, or age-specific but rather draw upon all available data across multiple geographic regions, sexes, and age groups. When sufficient sex-specific data were available, we conducted sex-specific sensitivity analyses that are described in the Supplementary Information alongside other sensitivity analyses described below.

Across the data collection, modeling, and writing, this study adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) recommendations as was feasible (Supplementary Tables S23 - S25 and Supplementary Figures S1 - S3). This study, as an extension of the Global Burden of Disease study, was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (study no. 9060). The systematic review protocol was not separately registered but aimed to follow to review best practices.

Defining chewing tobacco

For the purposes of the present study, chewing tobacco is defined as the current use of chewing tobacco, including local tobacco products that are chewed by the consumer, at any frequency. It is considered distinct from other forms of smokeless tobacco that are not chewed, including snuff, snus, naswar, and gul. Smokeless tobacco products that are chewed and are, thus, encompassed in our definition of chewing tobacco include zarda, gutkha, and mawa. A full list of the chewing tobacco products associated with data points included in our analysis can be found in Supplementary Tables S2 and S4. Notably, betel quid and/or areca nut, which are independently considered carcinogenic, are often associated with chewing tobacco. Because the use of these mixed products is common in many parts of the world with the highest rates of chewing tobacco, our definition of chewing tobacco includes tobacco that is chewed with these additives but omits betel quid or other such substances if they are not mixed with tobacco.

Notably, while the evidence of a harmful association between stroke and chewing tobacco appeared consistent and robust to various sensitivity analyses, the evidence supporting a harmful association between chewing tobacco use and esophageal cancer, lip and oral cavity cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharynx cancer and other pharynx cancer showed greater uncertainty. We identified a large degree of between-study heterogeneity for these five outcomes. This heterogeneity resulted in a high degree of sensitivity to model parameters and data point inclusion and more uncertainty in our relative risk estimates than in previous studies. Our analysis advances existing literature by better incorporating between-study variation in our derived estimates, which is particularly important for examining associations such as these where study characteristics diverge substantially and there is a paucity of gold-standard evidence. Similarly, while there is consensus that chewing tobacco is a known carcinogen, existing literature focuses on its association with esophageal cancer and lip and oral cavity cancer, and its relationship to these other head and neck cancers is both less studied and less consistently demonstrated in the case-control studies that are available. Taken together, our results underscore the need for high-quality prospective cohort studies with greater consistency in case definitions to bolster the strength of the evidence underlying our understanding of chewing tobacco's health impacts.

Based on the present results, stroke, nasopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and other pharynx cancer are now found to have sufficient evidence to merit consideration for inclusion in future GBD cycles. In contrast, ischemic heart disease was found to have insufficient evidence to support an association, even without taking into consideration between-study heterogeneity. These findings reflect the mixed results identified in previous smaller systematic reviews pertaining to chewing tobacco and cardiovascular diseases. Hajat et al. for example, identified one high-quality meta-analysis that reported an increased risk of ischemic heart disease among smokeless tobacco users in Asia, where chewing tobacco makes up a large portion of smokeless tobacco use, while other studies conducted in the region reported no association. Another review of cardiovascular outcomes and smokeless tobacco also identified variable results for ischemic heart disease in this region, despite consistent results of an association with stroke, akin to our own findings for chewing tobacco.

### Health effects associated with chewing tobacco: a burden of proof study [^16dd0ffb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Beyond highlighting an important research priority for academics and research funders, the BPRF, ROS, relative risk estimate, and star rating paint a comprehensive picture of the current state of evidence on the association between chewing tobacco and the seven selected health outcomes. The one- and two-star risk-outcome pairs affirm that chewing tobacco is a harmful risk factor for health outcomes of great public health significance. Physicians, public health practitioners, and tobacco control advocates can draw upon these findings to better counsel patients and advocate for better integration of chewing-tobacco-specific considerations in tobacco control policies. Furthermore, our evaluation of existing literature may serve to directly inform public education campaigns in communities that commonly use chewing tobacco to increase awareness of the associated harms. Finally, the relative risk estimates can be used to more accurately quantify the population-level disease burden attributable to chewing tobacco, both as a whole and for each of these health outcomes. Previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) drew upon six studies to estimate the relative risk used to inform the burden attributable to chewing tobacco for its two included risk-outcome pairs: lip and oral cavity cancer and esophageal cancer. These estimates of risk are now informed by 70 and 22 studies, respectively, which continue to confirm the harmful association between chewing tobacco and these outcomes for future iterations of GBD. Even with the greater compilation of data, our updated relative risk estimates are consistent with those previously used in GBD for chewing tobacco and lip and oral cavity cancer and for chewing tobacco and esophageal cancer. In prior GBD rounds, sex-specific relative risks were calculated for lip and oral cavity cancer given that females were found to have higher associated risk, a pattern that was found to be present but not significant through our sex-specific sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table S16). Of the five potential new risk-outcome pairs we evaluated, four were found to now be eligible for further consideration, which will better capture the full breadth of disease burden attributable to chewing tobacco.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^1376fea1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Specific health conditions — tobacco cessation — tobacco use (smoked, chewed, ENDS, and vaped) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as small for gestational age and abruption, and the long-term health consequences of tobacco use are well established and include increases in cardiovascular disease and cancer. Screening uses the five A's: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange. Management considerations advise cessation and provide behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapy for cessation to adults who use tobacco. The goal is to reduce tobacco use to none, and nicotine replacement products or other pharmaceuticals for smoking cessation are generally not recommended.

### Spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns in prevalence of chewing tobacco use in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis from the global burden of disease study 2019 [^1466df43]. The Lancet: Public Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In 2019, 273·9 million (95% UI 258·5–290·9) people used chewing tobacco, and age-standardised prevalence for people aged 15 and older was 4·72% (4·46–5·01). 83·29% of chewing tobacco users live in south Asia, with 185·8 million chewing tobacco users residing in India. Other countries with high prevalence of chewing tobacco use include Palau, Bangladesh, and Nepal, which together had 30·1 million chewing tobacco users in 2019. A major concern emerging from our analyses is that the prevalence of chewing tobacco use has remained constant and high. Of the 12 countries with the highest prevalences of chewing tobacco use, 11 had no significant decreases in prevalence of chewing tobacco use among males, whereas nine had significant decreases in prevalence of smoking tobacco use among males, and no countries had a significant decrease in prevalence of chewing tobacco use among females, whereas seven had significant decreases in prevalence of smoking tobacco use among females. Among females in 2019, we found that use of chewing tobacco was more common than smoking in eight of the 12 highest prevalence countries for people aged 15 years and older, and among just those aged 15–19 years in six of 12 countries. Among males, prevalence of chewing tobacco use was higher than smoking in three of 12 countries and in individuals aged 15–19 years in four of 12 countries. The serious adverse health effects resulting from chewing tobacco use, necessitate stronger regulations and policies than are currently in place, particularly in countries with persistently high prevalence.

Much of the previous research on the prevalence of chewing tobacco use has focused on a particular country, region, source, time period, or age group, making formation of a comprehensive global picture of where chewing tobacco is used most, among which age groups and sexes, and how these trends have changed over time very difficult. Our study is a step towards understanding this full picture so that policy makers, public health officials, and advocacy organisations have access to a full set of comparable estimates for use in addressing this harmful substance. Additionally, our aim to combine multiple sources and definitions of smokeless tobacco use across 204 locations has highlighted data synthesis issues due to definition variations and differences in data granularity that should be addressed in future surveillance of smokeless tobacco use.

### Impact of tobacco exposure on low back pain-related disability-adjusted life years in China: trends from 1990–2021 and projections for the next 15 years using ARIMA modeling [^9a3bb7ba]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

China, with the world's largest and most rapidly growing aging population, is experiencing an increasing burden of LBP, which is highly prevalent among the elderly. Data from the China Health Statistics Yearbook 2023 indicate that among inpatients discharged from public hospitals in China in 2022, the number of admissions attributed to intervertebral disc diseases reached 995,714, with the average medical expenditure per admission amounting to as high as 11,923.19 yuan. Notably, LBP often serves as a common manifestation of intervertebral disc diseases. While the China Health Statistics Yearbook and other Chinese databases do not publicly release direct data on LBP, the aforementioned findings indirectly demonstrate that LBP imposes a substantial disease burden on China. Given that smoking is a significant risk factor for LBP and China has a high smoking rate (27.7% in males), the public has long overlooked the burden of LBP caused by tobacco exposure. Consequently, analyzing the long-term impact of tobacco exposure on the disease burden of LBP in China is critical. Previous studies using the 2021 GBD data have analyzed disease burden for LBP in China, yet the specific effects of risk factors (particularly tobacco) on the disease burden remain unclear. In the GBD 2021 database, three level 2 risk factors — namely Tobacco, Occupational risks, and High body-mass index — collectively contribute to the DALYs burden of LBP, with Tobacco accounting for a non-negligible proportion thereof. Furthermore, although Wang et alquantified the global burden of LBP attributable to smoking across 204 countries — a study that identified a substantial burden of smoking-related LBP on a global scale — a China-specific estimate was not provided. More importantly, smoking represents only one component of tobacco exposure, which also encompasses second-hand smoke and chewing tobacco. Notably, within the China-focused risk-factor analyses of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, only high body-mass index, has been evaluated to date; the contribution of overall tobacco exposure to LBP remains unexamined. Consequently, the impact of tobacco exposure on LBP burden among the Chinese population remains entirely unquantified. This study leverages the latest GBD 2021 data and employs joinpoint regression and age-period-cohort analysis to investigate how tobacco has shaped the LBP burden in China from 1990 to 2021. The findings offer valuable insights into the evolving patterns of LBP burden over the past 32 years. The analysis and prediction of these specific trends hold significant value for policy formulation, resource allocation, and the targeted positioning of intervention measures.

### Patterns of tobacco use in low and middle income countries by tobacco product and sociodemographic characteristics: nationally representative survey data from 82 countries [^302d3604]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The Global Burden of Disease study estimates that tobacco smoking caused 7.7 million deaths globally in 2019 and that smoking is the leading risk factor for disability-adjusted life years among men. Smokeless tobacco use, such as chewing tobacco, snuff, or tobacco chewed with betel nut, are estimated to have caused an additional 349 000 deaths in 2017. As of 2020, almost one billion people worldwide were estimated to smoke tobacco and 336 million were estimated to use smokeless tobacco, predominantly living in low and middle income countries. Although the prevalence of tobacco use (both smoked and smokeless) in low and middle income countries has decreased over the past 20 years, the prevalence is projected to be more than 20% in middle income countries and 12% in low income countries in the coming years. The tobacco associated health consequences can pose a risk to the health systems of these countries because many of them are not well prepared to cope with the increased need for care of related diseases, such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases.

### Spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns in prevalence of chewing tobacco use in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis from the global burden of disease study 2019 [^42e4d488]. The Lancet: Public Health (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Chewing tobacco and other types of smokeless tobacco use have had less attention from the global health community than smoked tobacco use. However, the practice is popular in many parts of the world and has been linked to several adverse health outcomes. Understanding trends in prevalence with age, over time, and by location and sex is important for policy setting and in relation to monitoring and assessing commitment to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

Methods

We estimated prevalence of chewing tobacco use as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 using a modelling strategy that used information on multiple types of smokeless tobacco products. We generated a time series of prevalence of chewing tobacco use among individuals aged 15 years and older from 1990 to 2019 in 204 countries and territories, including age-sex specific estimates. We also compared these trends to those of smoked tobacco over the same time period.

Findings

In 2019, 273·9 million (95% uncertainty interval 258·5 to 290·9) people aged 15 years and older used chewing tobacco, and the global age-standardised prevalence of chewing tobacco use was 4·72% (4·46 to 5·01). 228·2 million (213·6 to 244·7; 83·29% [82·15 to 84·42]) chewing tobacco users lived in the south Asia region. Prevalence among young people aged 15–19 years was over 10% in seven locations in 2019. Although global age-standardised prevalence of smoking tobacco use decreased significantly between 1990 and 2019 (annualised rate of change: –1·21% [–1·26 to –1·16]), similar progress was not observed for chewing tobacco (0·46% [0·13 to 0·79]). Among the 12 highest prevalence countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Madagascar, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Sri Lanka, and Yemen), only Yemen had a significant decrease in the prevalence of chewing tobacco use, which was among males between 1990 and 2019 (−0·94% [–1·72 to –0·14]), compared with nine of 12 countries that had significant decreases in the prevalence of smoking tobacco. Among females, none of these 12 countries had significant decreases in prevalence of chewing tobacco use, whereas seven of 12 countries had a significant decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking use for the period.

Interpretation

Chewing tobacco remains a substantial public health problem in several regions of the world, and predominantly in south Asia. We found little change in the prevalence of chewing tobacco use between 1990 and 2019, and that control efforts have had much larger effects on the prevalence of smoking tobacco use than on chewing tobacco use in some countries. Mitigating the health effects of chewing tobacco requires stronger regulations and policies that specifically target use of chewing tobacco, especially in countries with high prevalence.

### Tobacco use-FDA… [^95a000e7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Fact Sheet: Download and Share Brochure: Download and Share Infographics: Download and Share En Español Additional Languages Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. The rates of tobacco use and associated negative health effects are disproportionately higher among racial and ethnic minority and other diverse groups. The FDA provides resources and has approved several products to help you quit. How is tobacco used. People can smoke, vape, chew, or sniff tobacco. There are many types of tobacco products on the market like cigarettes, vapes and other e-cigarettes, snuff, hookah, and gels. What causes addiction. All tobacco products contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance that changes how the brain works. Continued use of tobacco products may lead to feeling irritable and anxious when you don't have nicotine in your system.

Over time, you may become dependent on nicotine, which is when you crave nicotine and find it difficult to stop using tobacco products. What are the health effects of smoking tobacco. Smoking tobacco can cause many types of cancer as well as heart disease, stroke, lung disease, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. Tobacco smoke contains many harmful chemicals such as carbon monoxide, ammonia, and lead. Inhaling tobacco smoke exposes smokers to a toxic mix of chemicals that can damage nearly every organ in the body. Nonsmokers are also exposed to these chemicals in the air. This is known as secondhand smoke, and secondhand smoke is known to cause heart disease and lung cancer. How are diverse populations affected. Tobacco products are often marketed toward racial and ethnic minority communities, which tend to have a higher density of tobacco retailers. American Indians and Alaska Natives have the highest rate of commercial tobacco use.

African Americans who smoke are less successful at quitting than non-Hispanic white people who smoke and are more likely to die from a smoking-related disease.

### Health effects associated with smokeless tobacco: a systematic review [^7df61b2b]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It is believed that health risks associated with smokeless tobacco (ST) use are lower than those with cigarette smoking. A systematic review was therefore carried out to summarise these risks.

Methods

Several electronic databases were searched, supplemented by screening reference lists, smoking related websites, and contacting experts. Analytical observational studies of ST use (cohorts, case-control, cross sectional studies) with a sample size of ≥ 500 were included if they reported on one or more of the following outcomes (all cause mortality, oral and pharyngeal cancers, other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, dental diseases, pregnancy outcomes, surgical outcomes). Data extraction covered control of confounding, selection of cases and controls, sample size, clear definitions and measurements of the health outcome, and ST use. Selection, extraction and quality assessments were carried out by one or two independent reviewers.

Results

A narrative review was carried out. Many of the studies lacked sufficient power to estimate precise risks, mainly due to the small number of ST users. Studies were often not designed to investigate ST use, and many also had major methodological limitations including poor control for cigarette smoking and imprecise measurements of exposure. Studies in India showed a substantial risk of oral or oropharyngeal cancers associated with chewing betel quid and tobacco. Studies from other regions and of other cancer types were not consistent. Few studies have adequately considered the non-cancer health effects of ST use.

Conclusions

Chewing betel quid and tobacco is associated with a substantial risk of oral cancers in India. Most recent studies from the US and Scandinavia are not statistically significant, but moderate positive associations cannot be ruled out due to lack of power. Further rigorous studies with adequate sample sizes are required, especially for cardiovascular disease.

### Health effects associated with chewing tobacco: a burden of proof study [^541678bf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Model validation

MR-BRT has been extensively and rigorously validated by Zheng and colleagues for its use in conducting meta-analyses. For the present study, we conducted several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our final results given the limitations of our dataset. These analyses are described in more detail in the Supplementary Information. In brief, for each of the outcomes, except stroke and ischemic heart disease, we ran a sensitivity analysis that omitted trimming 10% of the data. Stroke and ischemic heart disease, which had fewer than 10 included observations, were not eligible for trimming within the primary analysis. For models with significant bias covariates selected in the primary analysis, we examined the impact of running the models without providing any bias covariates for potential inclusion in the model with and without 10% trimming. We also ran an additional sensitivity analysis without downweighting observations derived from nonmutually exclusive analytical samples with and without 10% trimming.

Beyond validating the model parameters, we also ran a number of sensitivity analyses with restrictions on the included data points. For the five cancer outcomes with data points that used aggregate outcome definitions, we tested omitting data points that were not specific to the cancer in question. Observing heterogenous exposure definitions, we also evaluated the impact of omitting observations that used ever-chewing tobacco as the exposure group, keeping only observations that compared current tobacco chewers to nontobacco chewers, and the impact of potential regional differences in chewing tobacco definitions by restricting data to only that from Asian countries, the region with the highest number of chewing tobacco users. Similar heterogeneity was observed in sample sizes, so we evaluated the impact that small sample sizes may be having on model results by restricting the input data to only observations with more than five participants each in the exposed and unexposed case and control groups. Given the potential confounding effect of smoked tobacco among dual users that may not be fully captured in our adjustment bias covariates, we also examined the impact of chewing tobacco derived only using observations from non-smoking study samples. Last, given potential differences in chewing intensity or disease patterns between males and females, we ran two further sensitivity analyses limited to only male-specific observations or female-specific observations, respectively. For these analyses evaluating the robustness of our models to our data input, we kept all other model parameters consistent with our primary analysis and ran them both with and without 10% trimming (for analyses with more than ten observations). These analyses were only possible with three or more eligible observations for a given outcome.

### Health effects associated with chewing tobacco: a burden of proof study [^4877f128]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 6
Forest plot of underlying data for chewing tobacco and lip and oral cavity cancer.

This forest plot depicts the estimated mean relative risk (blue vertical line) and its 95% uncertainty interval (blue shaded intervals) for the association between chewing tobacco and lip and oral cavity cancer and the data points used to produce our primary results. The narrower darker blue interval corresponds to the 95% uncertainty interval estimated without accounting for between-study heterogeneity in accordance with traditional meta-analytic approaches. The light blue interval corresponds to the 95% uncertainty interval that incorporates between-study heterogeneity and the uncertainty around it in alignment with our Burden of Proof meta-analytic approach. Similarly, the red vertical line is the Burden of Proof Risk Function (BPRF), which corresponds to the 5 th quantile and is the estimate from which our risk-outcome score (ROS) is derived for risk-outcome pairs in which the darker blue interval (the 95% uncertainty interval without between-study heterogeneity) does not include the null value at relative risk = 1. The black dotted vertical line reflects the null relative risk at 1. The black data points and horizontal lines each correspond to an effect size and 95% uncertainty interval from the study noted in on the y-axis that was included in the model. The red Xs and horizontal lines correspond to effect sizes and 95% uncertainty intervals from the studies on the y-axis that were automatically trimmed by the trimming algorithm based on deviation from the mean. Studies noted with an asterisk include effect sizes from overlapping samples whose uncertainty interval was scaled based on the number of overlapping observations to avoid overrepresenting one sample in the model.

### Health effects associated with chewing tobacco: a burden of proof study [^f87fe36e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The ROS, BPRF, and resulting star rating were robust to the removal of all potential covariates (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S15). When the analysis was limited to only the 12 observations that compare current chewers to a reference group of non-chewers or never chewers, which most closely aligns with the canonical chewing tobacco definition, the between-study heterogeneity decreased substantially (γ < 0.001), and the relationship became a three-star association (ROS = 0.25). Other changes in our model parameters, standard error adjustments, and data point inclusion resulted in one-star associations (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S15). We did not detect publication bias in the esophageal cancer data used in the primary analysis when trimming 10% of observations (Table 2; Fig. 5) nor in any of the sensitivity analyses, regardless of the use of trimming (Supplementary Table S15).

Lip and oral cavity cancer

For lip and oral cavity cancer, our head and neck cancer systematic review identified 70 unique studies with 106 eligible observations from 10 locations (Fig. 6; Supplementary Table S4). These studies included two prospective cohort, one case-cohort, one nested case-control, and 66 case-control studies with sample sizes ranging from 219,444 to 76. We found that 72.6% (77/106) of the observations included both male and female participants and 57.6% (61/106) of the observations reported effect sizes for chewing tobacco broadly. There was substantial variation in the specific chewing tobacco products examined by the other 45 observations, including 12 betel quid with tobacco and 12 gutkha (Supplementary Table S4). Out of the 106 eligible observations included in the lip and oral cavity cancer model, 25.5% (27/106) used an aggregate outcome definition. Other study characteristics are described in the Supplementary Information.

### Interventions to prevent or cease electronic cigarette use in children and adolescents [^4088551d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of e-cigarette use has increased globally amongst children and adolescents in recent years. In response to the increasing prevalence and emerging evidence about the potential harms of e-cigarettes in children and adolescents, leading public health organisations have called for approaches to address increasing e-cigarette use. Whilst evaluations of approaches to reduce uptake and use regularly appear in the literature, the collective long-term benefit of these is currently unclear.

Objectives

The co-primary objectives of the review were to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent e-cigarette use in children and adolescents (aged 19 years and younger) with no prior use, relative to no intervention, waitlist control, usual practice, or an alternative intervention; and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to cease e-cigarette use in children and adolescents (aged 19 years and younger) reporting current use, relative to no intervention, waitlist control, usual practice, or an alternative intervention. Secondary objectives were to: (1) examine the effect of such interventions on child and adolescent use of other tobacco products (e.g. cigarettes, cigars types, and chewing tobacco); and (2) describe the unintended adverse effects of the intervention on individuals (e.g. physical or mental health of individuals), or on organisations (e.g. intervention displacement of key curricula or learning opportunities for school students) where such interventions are being implemented.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, and Clarivate Web of Science Core Collection from inception to 1 May 2023. Additionally, we searched two trial registry platforms (WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov), Google Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. We contacted corresponding authors of articles identified as ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-RCTs, factorial RCTs, and stepped-wedge RCTs. To be eligible, the primary targets of the interventions must have been children and adolescents aged 19 years or younger. Interventions could have been conducted in any setting, including community, school, health services, or the home, and must have sought to influence children or adolescent (or both) e-cigarette use directly. Studies with a comparator of no intervention (i.e. control), waitlist control, usual practice, or an alternative intervention not targeting e-cigarette use were eligible. We included measures to assess the effectiveness of interventions to: prevent child and adolescent e-cigarette use (including measures of e-cigarette use amongst those who were never-users); and cease e-cigarette use (including measures of e-cigarette use amongst children and adolescents who were e-cigarette current-users). Measures of e-cigarette use included current-use (defined as use in the past 30 days) and ever-use (defined as any lifetime use).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of references, with any discrepancies resolved through consensus. Pairs of review authors independently assessed the full-text articles for inclusion in the review. We planned for two review authors to independently extract information from the included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We planned to conduct multiple meta-analyses using a random-effects model to align with the co-primary objectives of the review. First, we planned to pool interventions to prevent child and adolescent e-cigarette use and conduct two analyses using the outcome measures of 'ever-use' and 'current-use'. Second, we planned to pool interventions to cease child and adolescent e-cigarette use and conduct one analysis using the outcome measure of 'current-use'. Where data were unsuitable for pooling in meta-analyses, we planned to conduct a narrative synthesis using vote-counting approaches and to follow the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines.

Main Results

The search of electronic databases identified 7141 citations, with a further 287 records identified from the search of trial registries and Google Scholar. Of the 110 studies (116 records) evaluated in full text, we considered 88 to be ineligible for inclusion for the following reasons: inappropriate outcome (27 studies); intervention (12 studies); study design (31 studies); and participants (18 studies). The remaining 22 studies (28 records) were identified as ongoing studies that may be eligible for inclusion in a future review update. We identified no studies with published data that were eligible for inclusion in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for the review, and as such, there is no evidence available from RCTs to assess the potential impact of interventions targeting children and adolescent e-cigarette use, tobacco use, or any unintended adverse effects. Evidence from studies employing other trial designs (e.g. non-randomised) may exist; however, such studies were not eligible for inclusion in the review. Evidence from studies using non-randomised designs should be examined to guide actions to prevent or cease e-cigarette use. This is a living systematic review. We search for new evidence every month and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review.

### Tobacco use and incidence of adverse oral health outcomes among US adults in the population assessment of tobacco and health study [^493428d6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Diseases of the teeth and their supporting structures are some of the most prevalent chronic health conditions, affecting approximately 3.5 billion people globally. These conditions, when untreated, can lead to pain, bone and tooth loss, complex and costly treatments, and reduced quality of life. Oral diseases have substantial impacts on economic productivity and ability to function at home, school, and work. Tobacco use is associated with oral disease, and there is sufficient evidence for a causal relationship between cigarette smoking and periodontal disease. Findings are similar for cigars, pipes, and hookah; however, most of the studies on hookah smoking and periodontal disease have been cross-sectional and conducted in only a few countries, thereby limiting generalizability. Furthermore, use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookah, and smokeless (chewing) tobaccois a major cause of oral cavity cancers.

Tobacco-use patterns among adult current smokers have evolved over time, particularly with respect to increasing trends in nondaily cigarette smoking and fewer cigarettes smoked per day. Yet, cigarettes remain the most commonly used product among adults, followed by electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). These changes in use patterns warrant a re-examination of the associations between combustible and smokeless tobacco use and the incidence of adverse oral health outcomes using recent data. Moreover, literature on oral health effects of ENDS use is limited. The majority of epidemiological evidence supporting a positive association between ENDS use and adverse oral health comes from cross-sectional studies; longitudinal findings have been inconsistent.

Understanding health effects of tobacco use, particularly of noncigarette products, is one of the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) tobacco regulatory research priorities. We examined associations between tobacco use and the incidence of adverse oral health outcomes (ie, gum bleeding, precancerous oral lesions, bone loss around teeth, bleeding after brushing or flossing, loose teeth, and 1 or more teeth removed) across different tobacco products among adults (aged ≥ 18 years) using data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a unique resource for longitudinal measures on tobacco use and oral health in a US nationally representative sample.

### Cognitive function and associations with demographic, socioeconomic, health and behavioural factors among older adult men and women in rural Bangladesh: a population-based cross-sectional study [^4fc39d8e]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Tobacco use is an established risk factor for dementia and poorer cognition. Although our results indicate an association between tobacco use and worse cognition in women, this effect was not observed for men. This finding may be a consequence of the complex and poorly understood effects of varying types and pattern of tobacco use on later-life cognitive health in rural low-income settings. Modes of tobacco consumption vary between men and women and differing effects of smoked and chewed tobacco on cognitive impairment may be important to investigate.

Betel nut use is the fourth most commonly used psychostimulant (after caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine) globally with over 600 million users. Despite this widespread use few studies have examined the association with cognition. A previous study in Taiwan reported no association between betel nut use and cognition in older adults, however, betel-nut chewing is associated with increased metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Neuroimaging studies, have reported brain alterations in structure, metabolism and function in betel nut users and insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of memory disorders in betel nut users are emerging. Our findings suggest potentially harmful cognitive effects in women highlighting the need for further study of the gender specific cognitive effects of long-term betel nut use as well as cultural and social drivers of this risk behaviour.

### Policy-driven tobacco control [^54cdacd5]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

For over 20 years, California tobacco control advocates have employed voluntary and legislative policy processes as tools to yield long-term sustainable impacts on the health of their communities. Overall, tobacco control policies can be organised into three categories based on intent: (1) to educate individuals and influence health behaviours, (2) to create economic disincentives or (3) to regulate product production, distribution or use.

### The tobacco endgame-eradicating a worsening epidemic [^2a44def9]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Novel tobacco products and health

Heated tobacco, nicotine pouch products, and other novel tobacco products loosely represent an emerging class of tobacco products being marketed by industry as reduced-exposure or modified-risk products. There is currently limited evidence regarding either the long-term individual health risks posed by these products or their potential public health impact. Heated tobacco products contain nicotine and other potentially harmful constituents, and the potential of reduced exposure does not mean they are harmless or inherently related to reduced risk. Nicotine pouch products are one of the fastest-growing segments of the retail tobacco market in the USA, and there are strong concerns regarding their accessibility to and use by youth. Governments should introduce and enforce strong systems for thorough premarket assessment of any novel products and prevent industry from making health claims about products that are not substantiated by rigorous research and not authorized through regulatory review. Tobacco control interventions, such as MPOWER, should be applied to all tobacco products.

### Prevalence and trend of smokeless tobacco use and its associated factors among adolescents aged 12–16 years in 138 countries / territories, 1999–2019 [^035a258b]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Smokeless tobacco is a type of tobacco that is consumed by chewing, sucking, snuffing, or other non-combustion forms. Historically, smokeless tobacco was popular mainly in the South-East Asian region. However, due to the implementation of smoke-free policies and the diversification of tobacco market worldwide, the increasing use of smokeless tobacco products has become a growing global health concern. For example, there were about 356 million smokeless tobacco users worldwide by 2015, with nearly 82% living in South-East Asia. Globally, smokeless tobacco use was responsible for over 650,000 deaths in 2010 (accounting for approximately 10% of all deaths due to all forms of tobacco use), and an estimated 315,000 deaths in 2016. In 2017, the global burden of disease caused by smokeless tobacco use amounted to approximately 8.7 million disability adjusted life years. Although smokeless tobacco is thought to be less harmful to health than burnt cigarettes, and considered a smoke-free alternative, smokeless tobacco products contain more than 30 harmful compounds that have been linked to nicotine addiction, nicotine poisoning, oral disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancers, which contribute substantially to the global disease burden.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^f35f5295]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Institute of Medicine regulatory principles — pre-market data, testing, approval, and communication: Manufacturers of tobacco products, whether conventional or modified, should be required to obtain quantitative analytical data on ingredients and to disclose such information to the regulatory agency; all tobacco products should be assessed for yields of nicotine and other tobacco toxicants and, when necessary to support claims, human exposure should be assessed using appropriate biomarkers, and accurate information regarding yield range and human exposure should be communicated to consumers in terms that are understandable and not misleading; manufacturers of all Potential Reduced-Exposure Products (PREPs) should be required to conduct appropriate toxicological testing in preclinical laboratory and animal models as well as appropriate clinical testing in humans and to disclose the results to the regulatory agency; exposure- or risk-reduction claims should be permitted only after prior agency approval based on scientific evidence that the product substantially reduces exposure to one or more tobacco toxicants and, if a risk reduction claim is made, that the product can reasonably be expected to reduce risk compared with the benchmark stated in labeling, with the substantial reduction large enough that measurable reduction in morbidity and/or mortality would be anticipated as judged by independent scientific experts; labeling, advertising, and promotion with such claims must be carefully regulated under a not false or misleading standard with the burden of proof on the manufacturer, and the agency should have the authority and resources to conduct its own surveys of consumer perceptions; the regulatory agency should be empowered to require post-marketing surveillance and epidemiological studies to determine short-term behavioral and long-term health consequences and to permit continuing review of claim accuracy.

### Trends in nicotine product use among US adolescents, 1999–2020 [^caab2200]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

To calculate nationally representative means for NPDs among middle school and high school students, we used the svy command in Stata, version 16 (StataCorp LLC) to incorporate complex survey design using information on primary sampling unit, survey strata, and sampling weights in each year. To account for differential long-term health risks of products, we treated all combustible tobacco products as having a risk weight of 1.0, while smokeless tobacco had a risk weight of 0.1, consistent with evidence regarding the relative risk of most modern smokeless products. Combustible tobacco includes cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, bidis, and kreteks. Smokeless tobacco includes chewing tobacco, snuff, and dip. Because there is no agreed-upon risk weight for use of e-cigarettes, we varied the risk weight from 0.1 to 1.0 to demonstrate the full range of possibilities.

We considered the risk weights to include all risks associated with using a particular product as an adolescent. These included risks potentially occurring during the adolescent years, primarily addiction and harm to the developing brain, common to use of all of the products (although to different degrees), as well as long-term chronic disease risks, which are well documented and particularly concerning for cigarette smoking. The risk of vaping could include the risk that it will lead some adolescents into lifelong smoking, while the opposite is possible as well: smokers may switch to e-cigarettes, either as adolescents or later in life. Many users of nicotine products will quit using them within 1 to 2 decades of adolescence, thereby largely avoiding long-term chronic disease risks. Thus, it is virtually impossible to estimate with any precision the risk associated with the use of any product as a youth. As such, we present the full range of possible risk weights for e-cigarettes, from 0.1 to 1.0. Readers can examine results across this range to draw their own conclusions about the overall risk of contemporary patterns of product use.

### Tobacco use as a well-recognized cause of severe COVID-19 manifestations [^bdba74b4]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affecting the lungs. All tobacco-related illnesses including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease are known to reduce the lung capacity and impair the immune system of the body and can greatly influence the ability to fight the novel coronavirus. The purpose of this state-of-the-art literature review is to summarize the evidence of the association of tobacco use with the severity of the COVID-19 manifestations.

Method

Articles describing the association of tobacco use with the severity of COVID-19 manifestations were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google. This review covers the relevant studies on the subject published from January 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020.

Results

Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Pre-existing comorbidities in tobacco users such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension were found to further aggravate the disease manifestations making the treatment of such COVID-19 patients more challenging due to their rapid clinical deterioration.

Conclusions

Current review indicates that nicotine exposure is linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 and tobacco use can be a potential risk factor for not only getting the viral infection but also its severe manifestations. The current pandemic provides a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate national tobacco control programs to achieve a tobacco-free world.

### Consumption of combustible and smokeless tobacco-United States, 2000–2015 [^cf42b5e3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Combustible and smokeless tobacco use causes adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and multiple types of cancer (1,2). Standard approaches for measuring tobacco use include self-reported surveys of use and consumption estimates based on tobacco excise tax data (3,4). To provide the most recently available tobacco consumption estimates in the United States, CDC used federal excise tax data to estimate total and per capita consumption during 2000–2015 for combustible tobacco (cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, pipe tobacco, small cigars, and large cigars) and smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco and dry snuff). During this period, total combustible tobacco consumption decreased 33.5%, or 43.7% per capita. Although total cigarette consumption decreased 38.7%, cigarettes remained the most commonly used combustible tobacco product. Total noncigarette combustible tobacco (i.e., cigars, roll-your-own, and pipe tobacco) consumption increased 117.1%, or 83.8% per capita during 2000–2015. Total consumption of smokeless tobacco increased 23.1%, or 4.2% per capita. Notably, total cigarette consumption was 267.0 billion cigarettes in 2015 compared with 262.7 billion in 2014. These findings indicate that although cigarette smoking declined overall during 2000–2015, and each year from 2000 to 2014, the number of cigarettes consumed in 2015 was higher than in 2014, and the first time annual cigarette consumption was higher than the previous year since 1973. Moreover, the consumption of other combustible and smokeless tobacco products remains substantial. Implementation of proven tobacco prevention interventions (5) is warranted to further reduce tobacco use in the United States.

### Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2016: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2016 [^1e1c758b]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Second-hand smoke exposure is highest in eastern Asia and Oceania and higher among women and children compared with men. The distribution of DALYs attributable to second-hand smoke exposure is bimodal, with peaks in the post-neonatal period and again in older age groups. Globally 0·9 million (0·7 million to 1·1 million) deaths were attributable to second-hand smoke exposure, of which 56 340 (28 951–89 043) occurred among children younger than age 10 years.

In estimating the burden attributable to smokeless tobacco, we found that the risk varies by the toxicity of the type used; there is sufficient evidence that chewing tobacco and other products of similar toxicity cause excess risk of oral and oesophageal cancer while, at this time, existing evidence does not support attributing burden to snus or similar smokeless tobacco products. Globally, smoking tobacco causes far more burden than smokeless tobacco; nonetheless, smokeless tobacco is an important risk factor for oral and oesophageal cancer in India, where more than half of the 32 141 (24 930–39 243) global deaths attributable to smokeless tobacco occur.

### Interventions to reduce harm from continued tobacco use [^8cd5c345]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although smoking cessation is currently the only guaranteed way to reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoking, a reasonable secondary tobacco control approach may be to try and reduce the harm from continued tobacco use amongst smokers unable or unwilling to quit. Possible approaches to reduce the exposure to toxins from smoking include reducing the amount of tobacco used, and using less toxic products, such as pharmaceutical, nicotine and potential reduced-exposure tobacco products (PREPs), as an alternative to cigarettes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions intended to reduce the harm to health of continued tobacco use, we considered the following specific questions: do interventions intended to reduce harm have an effect on long-term health status?; do they lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked?; do they have an effect on smoking abstinence?; do they have an effect on biomarkers of tobacco exposure?; and do they have an effect on biomarkers of damage caused by tobacco?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Trials Register (CRS) on the 21st October 2015, using free-text and MeSH terms for harm reduction, smoking reduction and cigarette reduction.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce the amount smoked, or to reduce harm from smoking by means other than cessation. We include studies carried out in smokers with no immediate desire to quit all tobacco use. Primary outcomes were change in cigarette consumption, smoking cessation and any markers of damage or benefit to health, measured at least six months from the start of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed study eligibility for inclusion using standard Cochrane methods. We pooled trials with similar interventions and outcomes (> 50% reduction in cigarettes a day (CPD) and long-term smoking abstinence), using fixed-effect models. Where it was not possible to meta-analyse data, we summarized findings narratively.

Main Results

Twenty-four trials evaluated interventions to help those who smoke to cut down the amount smoked or to replace their regular cigarettes with PREPs, compared to placebo, brief intervention, or a comparison intervention. None of these trials directly tested whether harm reduction strategies reduced the harms to health caused by smoking. Most trials (14/24) tested nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as an intervention to assist reduction. In a pooled analysis of eight trials, NRT significantly increased the likelihood of reducing CPD by at least 50% for people using nicotine gum or inhaler or a choice of product compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 2.13; 3081 participants). Where average changes from baseline were compared for different measures, carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine generally showed smaller reductions than CPD. Use of NRT versus placebo also significantly increased the likelihood of ultimately quitting smoking (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.44; 8 trials, 3081 participants; quality of the evidence: low). Two trials comparing NRT and behavioural support to brief advice found a significant effect on reduction, but no significant effect on cessation. We found one trial investigating each of the following harm reduction intervention aids: bupropion, varenicline, electronic cigarettes, snus, plus another of nicotine patches to facilitate temporary abstinence. The evidence for all five intervention types was therefore imprecise, and it is unclear whether or not these aids increase the likelihood of smoking reduction or cessation. Two trials investigating two different types of behavioural advice and instructions on reducing CPD also provided imprecise evidence. Therefore, the evidence base for this comparison is inadequate to support the use of these types of behavioural advice to reduce smoking. Four studies of PREPs (cigarettes with reduced levels of tar, carbon and nicotine, and in one case delivered using an electronically-heated cigarette smoking system) showed some reduction in exposure to some toxicants, but it is unclear whether this would substantially alter the risk of harm. We judged the included studies to be generally at a low or unclear risk of bias; however, there were some ratings of high risk, due to a lack of blinding and the potential for detection bias. Using the GRADE system, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for our cessation outcomes as 'low' or 'very low', due to imprecision and indirectness. A 'low' grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate.

Authors' Conclusions

People who do not wish to quit can be helped to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoke and to quit smoking in the long term, using NRT, despite original intentions not to do so. However, we rated the evidence contributing to the cessation outcome for NRT as 'low' by GRADE standards. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of other harm reduction aids to reduce the harm caused by continued tobacco smoking. This could simply be due to the lack of high-quality studies (our confidence in cessation outcomes for these aids is rated 'low' or 'very low' due to imprecision by GRADE standards), meaning that we may have missed a worthwhile effect, or due to a lack of effect on reduction or quit rates. It is therefore important that more high-quality RCTs are conducted, and that these also measure the long-term health effects of treatments.

### Epidemiology and public health policy of tobacco use and cardiovascular disorders in low-and middle-income countries [^2ced4317]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

All forms of tobacco lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders. During the past few decades, the number of people who consume tobacco has increased worldwide because of an overall increase in the global population. It is estimated that close to 80% of the > 1.3 billion people who smoke tobacco in the world are in low- and middle-income countries. Smokeless forms of tobacco are also widely consumed in low- and middle-income countries, including chewable and snuffed forms. Lack of targeted and effective strategies to control tobacco consumption contributes to a large burden of cardiovascular disorders in low- and middle-income countries, where cardiovascular disorders have become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In this review, we evaluate the epidemiology of tobacco use in low- and middle-income countries and assess the public health policies needed to control tobacco use in such regions for the prevention of cardiovascular disorders and other tobacco-related morbidities and mortality.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^babe7a82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Historical evolution of tobacco harm reduction — available alternatives and analogies note that nicotine replacement therapies were developed, offering the possibility of using medicinal nicotine therapies for harm reduction objectives when "cessation" was otherwise impossible. Observational studies of Swedish cohorts using moist snuff (snus) suggested that increasing use of snus was associated with favorable trends in incidence of lung cancer and other tobacco-related illnesses, extending discussion to the relative public health value of alternatives to smoke-based tobacco including chew and pipe tobacco, while implied and direct harm reduction claims blossomed within popular media. The reduction of harm is described as a central precept of medical care and educational harm reduction strategies focus on decreasing dangerous exposures by increasing awareness and modifying social norms.

### Head and neck cancer prevention: from primary prevention to impact of clinicians on reducing burden [^5e91bdd1]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Survival from head and neck cancers (HNCs) of the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx has increased by 10% over the past few decades. Little over half of patients who develop HNCs will survive beyond 5 years. Survival is lower for individuals in many countries where traditional risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing are highly prevalent but tertiary health care center access is limited or unavailable. Early diagnosis of HNC is the most important prognostic factor for each tumor site. Molecular-based research on HNC tumors holds promise for early stage detection, screening, vaccination, disease follow-up, and progression. Future investments for HNC control must consider both effectiveness and sustainability for both high- and low-resource countries alike, with priority toward risk factor prevention and earlier diagnosis.

### Tobacco use and incidence of adverse oral health outcomes among US adults in the population assessment of tobacco and health study [^2733530f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of tobacco products, especially electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), associated with the incidence of oral health outcomes among US adults?

Findings

This nationally representative cohort study found associations of current combustible tobacco use with the incidence of adverse oral health outcomes and also found an association between current ENDS use and the incidence of bleeding after brushing or flossing.

Meaning

These findings suggest that tobacco product use is associated with the incidence of several adverse oral health outcomes, highlighting the importance of longitudinal studies and emphasizing the continued importance of tobacco cessation counseling and resources in clinical practice.

### Tobacco use and oral health [^658534fb]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

This review outlines the important oral implications of tobacco use. The lining of the mouth (oral mucosa), if exposed to tobacco and its products in a susceptible individual, can develop benign, potentially malignant, and malignant tumours. Treatment and prognosis depend on tumour type, how early it is detected, its size and site in the oral cavity and whether it has spread. Advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has a 20% 5-year survival rate. Tobacco use also increases the risk of periodontitis, peri-implantitis, caries, alveolar osteitis and halitosis. Although less life threatening than OSCC, these tobacco related conditions create a substantial financial and health burden for individuals and society. Dental practitioners routinely examine the oral cavity for signs of mucosal and tooth changes, are experienced in recognising variations from normal and have established management and referral pathways. They are also ideally positioned to provide brief interventions to assist their patients to quit smoking.

### Smokeless tobacco and cardiovascular disease [^54605115]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Various forms of smokeless tobacco (mainly snuff and chewing tobacco) cause an immediate increase in heart rate and blood pressure, but regular users of smokeless tobacco do not have permanent changes of heart rate or blood pressure when not exposed to tobacco. Cardiac output during workload and maximal working capacity are unaffected. Users of smokeless tobacco usually do not have the biochemical stigmata that regular smokers have. Thus, the scientific literature suggests that they are similar to non-tobacco users in terms of levels of hemoglobin/hematocrit, leukocytes, antioxidant vitamins, fibrinogen, components of the fibrinolytic system, C-reactive protein, and thromboxane A2 production. Two studies have found that snuff users, as opposed to smokers, do not have increased intima-media thickness or atherosclerotic lesions when investigated by ultrasound. Results on the risk for myocardial infarction have provided conflicting evidence, 2 case-control studies showing the same risks as in non-tobacco users and one cohort study showing an increased risk for cardiovascular death. In all, the use of smokeless tobacco (with snuff being the most studied variant) involves a much lower risk for adverse cardiovascular effects than smoking does. Whether or not the apparent risk reduction is a useful strategy to help inveterate smokers to quit is a matter of debate, as are the public health effects of a high prevalence of snuff use in some populations.

### Predicting the long-term effects of electronic cigarette use on population health: a systematic review of modelling studies [^45205eeb]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systematically review and synthesise the findings of modelling studies on the population impacts of e-cigarette use and to identify potential gaps requiring future investigation.

Data Source and Study Selection

Four databases were searched for modelling studies of e-cigarette use on population health published between 2010 and 2023. A total of 32 studies were included.

Data Extraction

Data on study characteristics, model attributes and estimates of population impacts including health outcomes and smoking prevalence were extracted from each article. The findings were synthesised narratively.

Data Synthesis

The introduction of e-cigarettes was predicted to lead to decreased smoking-related mortality, increased quality-adjusted life-years and reduced health system costs in 29 studies. Seventeen studies predicted a lower prevalence of cigarette smoking. Models that predicted negative population impacts assumed very high e-cigarette initiation rates among non-smokers and that e-cigarette use would discourage smoking cessation by a large margin. The majority of the studies were based on US population data and few studies included factors other than smoking status, such as jurisdictional tobacco control policies or social influence.

Conclusions

A population increase in e-cigarette use may result in lower smoking prevalence and reduced burden of disease in the long run, especially if their use can be restricted to assisting smoking cessation. Given the assumption-dependent nature of modelling outcomes, future modelling studies should consider incorporating different policy options in their projection exercises, using shorter time horizons and expanding their modelling to low-income and middle-income countries where smoking rates remain relatively high.

### Systematic review of the relation between smokeless tobacco and cancer in Europe and north America [^3a649f7d]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Study identification and selection

All reports had to satisfy the following inclusion criteria: published in a peer reviewed journal or the results publicly available, epidemiological study in humans, of cohort or case-control design, study location specified, any form of cancer as the outcome, and chewing tobacco, oral snuff or unspecified ST as the exposure. They also had to fall outside the exclusion criteria: conducted in an Asian or African population, no control group, or inappropriate design (case report, qualitative study or review/meta-analysis). Relevant papers were sought from a MEDLINE search conducted in May 2008 of "cancer" AND ("smokeless tobacco" OR "chewing tobacco" OR "snuff" OR "snus"), supplemented by citations in recent reviews and in the papers obtained.

Data extraction

Reports were grouped by study, and for each study details were abstracted (see Tables 1 and 2) relating to the design, period, location, controls used and size, the exposure (method of assessment, type of ST, exposure doses and durations considered), the outcome (cancer sites studied) and issues relating to analysis (type of effect measure, analysis methods, extent of adjustment for smoking and other factors, and availability of dose-response data). The extent of adjustment for smoking for a study was categorised into five groups: A. no information – effect estimates are provided but no details are given of any adjustments made; B. no adjustment – effect estimates are available for the whole population, but smoking is not taken into account; C. never smokers – the only effect estimates available are for never smokers; D. some adjustment – effect estimates adjusted for smoking are available, but the adjustment is relatively simple, using two or three level broad groupings (for example, ever/never smoked, current/non-current smoker, current/former/never smoker), and takes no account of daily amount smoked or duration of smoking; and E. more adjustment – effect estimates are available that take into account daily amount smoked, duration of smoking and/or their product (pack-years). Studies were categorised under D or E if smoking-adjusted effect estimates are available, regardless of whether some results for never smokers are also presented. The method used to adjust for smoking is not always clear. Studies where the authors merely report that they 'adjusted for cigarette smoking' are included in category D.

### Global burden of disease due to smokeless tobacco consumption in adults: analysis of data from 113 countries [^a6236d0e]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Smokeless tobacco is consumed in most countries in the world. In view of its widespread use and increasing awareness of the associated risks, there is a need for a detailed assessment of its impact on health. We present the first global estimates of the burden of disease due to consumption of smokeless tobacco by adults.

Methods

The burden attributable to smokeless tobacco use in adults was estimated as a proportion of the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost and deaths reported in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study. We used the comparative risk assessment method, which evaluates changes in population health that result from modifying a population's exposure to a risk factor. Population exposure was extrapolated from country-specific prevalence of smokeless tobacco consumption, and changes in population health were estimated using disease-specific risk estimates (relative risks/odds ratios) associated with it. Country-specific prevalence estimates were obtained through systematically searching for all relevant studies. Disease-specific risks were estimated by conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on epidemiological studies.

Results

We found adult smokeless tobacco consumption figures for 115 countries and estimated burden of disease figures for 113 of these countries. Our estimates indicate that in 2010, smokeless tobacco use led to 1.7 million DALYs lost and 62,283 deaths due to cancers of mouth, pharynx and oesophagus and, based on data from the benchmark 52 country INTERHEART study, 4.7 million DALYs lost and 204,309 deaths from ischaemic heart disease. Over 85% of this burden was in South-East Asia.

Conclusions

Smokeless tobacco results in considerable, potentially preventable, global morbidity and mortality from cancer; estimates in relation to ischaemic heart disease need to be interpreted with more caution, but nonetheless suggest that the likely burden of disease is also substantial. The World Health Organization needs to consider incorporating regulation of smokeless tobacco into its Framework Convention for Tobacco Control.

### Tobacco addiction [^01be162b]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Tobacco use is associated with 5 million deaths per year worldwide and is regarded as one of the leading causes of premature death. Comprehensive programmes for tobacco control can substantially reduce the frequency of tobacco use. An important component of a comprehensive programme is the provision of treatment for tobacco addiction. Treatment involves targeting several aspects of addiction including the underlying neurobiology and behavioural processes. Furthermore, building an infrastructure in health systems that encourages and helps with cessation, as well as expansion of the accessibility of treatments, is necessary. Although pharmacological and behavioural treatments are effective in improving cessation success, the rate of relapse to smoking remains high, emphasising the strong addictive nature of nicotine. The future of treatment resides in improvement in patient matching to treatment, combination or novel drugs, and viewing nicotine addiction as a chronic disorder that might need long-term treatment.

### Spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns in prevalence of chewing tobacco use in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis from the global burden of disease study 2019 [^2b65b011]. The Lancet: Public Health (2021). High credibility.

The proportion of unspecified smokeless tobacco that is chewing tobacco varies widely across countries. For example, in Sweden, snus (pulverised tobacco for sublabial administration, which we classify as non-chewing tobacco)is the predominant product used, while in India, most users of smokeless tobacco use chewing tobacco. To include data sources that report the prevalence of unspecified smokeless tobacco use, we needed an estimate of the proportion of unspecified smokeless tobacco that is chewing tobacco in each country.

To arrive at that proportion, first we ran separate models for chewing tobacco and non-chewing tobacco, using all available data for each indicator. Then, based on the results of these models, we estimated an age-sex-location-year-specific ratio of chewing tobacco as a proportion of chewing and non-chewing tobacco. Finally, we used this estimated ratio to adjust data reported as prevalence of unspecified smokeless tobacco use. We added the variance of the estimated ratio to the original variance of the data to reflect the uncertainty in this adjustment.

The final step in our modelling process was a ST-GPR model that included all data reported as prevalence of chewing tobacco use, and data reported as unspecified smokeless tobacco that have been adjusted on the basis of the estimated product type ratio. Because data variance is an input to ST-GPR, datapoints with higher variance had a lower influence on final estimates than did datapoints with a lower variance. As a result, the adjusted datapoints added information to the final model, but were weighted less in the final estimation than datapoints that were reported directly as prevalence of chewing tobacco use. Additional details of these methods are in the appendix (pp 18–20).

### Waterpipe tobacco smoking: what is the evidence that it supports nicotine / tobacco dependence? [^3b95df4c]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Support also is needed to inform the public, especially at-risk populations like young adults, of the health threats associated with WTS. In many countries, extensive public health campaigns make clear that tobacco cigarette smoking causes dependence, disability, disease and death. The omission of WTS from these campaigns unintentionally may reinforce perceptions among waterpipe users and non-users that WTS does not carry the same risks. In fact, not only are there long-term disease risks from WTSbut there are immediate, short-term risks as well: few users and non-users are likely aware that WTS can cause acute CO intoxication. An illusion of safety may arise when misperceptions about short-term and long-term health risks are coupled with lack of clarity regarding dependence. Knowledge can help shatter the illusion. Again, stakeholders interested in addressing the global spread of WTS must act to ensure that the public is informed that this form of tobacco use, like tobacco cigarettes, can cause dependence, disability, disease and death.

Policy is another critical area for addressing the WTS epidemic. Policy interventions such as increased taxes on cigarettes, bans on cigarette advertising and promotions (eg, free packs of cigarettes) and regulation of cigarette labelling have contributed to dramatic reductions in cigarette smoking in various countries. Since these policies are effective, they were incorporated into the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the WHO's first international treaty. The FCTC outlines evidence-based tobacco control policies that, if implemented properly, have the potential to reduce tobacco use. Importantly, while the FCTC is intended to address tobacco generally, it does not address waterpipe specifically and many of its provisions are being applied to cigarettes only. This uneven application of FCTC provisions is particularly apparent where product labelling is concerned:

### Classifying European cigarette consumption trajectories from 1970 to 2015 [^ab3bf203]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our findings are limited by the reliability of underlying data and the influence of changing prevalence and smoking intensity over time. Due to these underlying data, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between our cigarette consumption trajectories and the LCP model of cigarette use prevalence without also considering the impact of longitudinal changes in cigarettes consumed per smoker. Rather, our classifications were primarily developed to support policy analysis, which led to decisions such as linking countries that have experienced a single interruption to a continual decline, whether that interruption consisted of an increase or decrease. This decision prioritises the need to identify a short-term shock to an otherwise gradual decrease over the need to distinguish the positive or negative nature of that short-term shock.

In fact, when taking these details into account, regional trends appear more distinct. The interruption to the continual decline in the UK was a short-term acceleration in declining consumption, while the interruptions in Austria and Croatia were temporary reversals of the continual decline. Similarly, of the two countries classified as 'stable', Norway's consumption has remained stable around 700 cigarettes per person per year throughout the study period, while Italy's consumption has remained stable at around 1800 cigarettes per person per year. These differences reveal even more dramatic divides between encouraging trends observed throughout Western and Northern Europe, and mixed or negative trends observed throughout Eastern and Southeastern Europe.

Our national cigarette consumption data do not include electronic cigarettes, water tobacco, chewing tobacco or roll-your-own tobacco, which can form a significant proportion of national tobacco consumption in some countries. Analysts should account for changes in the substitution of factory-manufactured cigarettes with other forms of combustible tobacco (eg, roll-your-own) or alternative tobacco products (eg, snus, electronic cigarettes) to prevent misestimation of longitudinal policy impacts. Finally, data reliability can be affected by stockpiling, illicit international trade and consumption by non-citizens, which may underlie much of the variation found in the continual instability category. We encourage researchers to draw on multiple data sources and closely examine the source data to ensure its appropriateness for their analyses.

### Definition of chewing tobacco… [^401ba9c7]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

chewing tobaccoListen to pronunciationA type of smokeless tobacco made from cured tobacco leaves. It may be sweetened and flavored with licorice and other substances. It comes in the form of loose tobacco leaves, pellets or "bits", plugs, or twists. It is placed in the mouth, usually between the cheek and lower lip, and may be chewed. Chewing tobacco contains nicotine and many harmful, cancer-causing chemicals. Using it can lead to nicotine addiction and can cause cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and pancreas. Chewing tobacco use may also cause gum disease, heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. Also called spit tobacco. More InformationSmokeless Tobacco and Cancer

All patients who resume tobacco smoking should be referred to an appropriate specialist for evaluation and possible cessation therapies that may include pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical aids (Class IIb, Level of Evidence B). E-cigarettes should be avoided as a tobacco cessation aid, as there is limited data to support either efficacy as a smoking cessation aid or safety of long-term use; vaping is also associated with cardiovascular and respiratory disease (Class III, Level of Evidence: C). All patients should be routinely assessed and questioned on alcohol use (Class I, Level of Evidence C).

### The tobacco endgame-eradicating a worsening epidemic [^7095bf26]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Electronic cigarettes and health

Long-term epidemiological studies of the individual and public health impact of e-cigarettes are challenging because these products have evolved rapidly since their emergence in the mid-2000s. In its comprehensive review, the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine stated there is 'conclusive evidence that in addition to nicotine, most e-cigarette products contain and emit numerous potentially toxic substances' and that potential exposure to these toxic substances is highly variable given the range of product characteristics and how e-cigarette devices are used. Compared with the use of combustible tobacco cigarettes, a very high-risk comparator, e-cigarette use likely poses less risk. However, there is growing evidence that e-cigarettes and their aerosol constituents, nicotine, vapourizing solvents, particulate matter, metals, and flavourings can have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and brain.

Although the long-term health effects on adults are unclear, e-cigarette use among youth poses a clear threat to public health. In the USA, the dramatic increase in e-cigarette use among young people is unprecedented, and millions of young people who would never have used cigarettes or other tobacco products are using e-cigarettes. The introduction of high-nicotine delivery systems such as JUUL transformed the e-cigarette landscape and increased the addiction potential for young people. E-cigarette use is also associated with increased odds of smoking combustible cigarettes among adolescents who had no previous intention of smoking conventional cigarettes, belying assertions that e-cigarettes play a major role in reducing overall nicotine and tobacco use.

Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid. Many e-cigarette users also continue to smoke cigarettes, and dual use of e-cigarettes while continuing to smoke traditional cigarettes is not associated with higher rates of quitting. A 2020 Cochrane review found only moderate evidence that quit rates were higher among those randomly assigned to receive nicotine e-cigarettes compared with nicotine replacement therapy and among those randomly assigned to receive nicotine e-cigarettes compared with nonnicotine e-cigarettes; however, these findings were based on only a few large randomized clinical trials. More research is needed to understand the efficacy of e-cigarettes in promoting quitting relative to approved pharmacotherapies. Additional work is also required to assess the prevalence and impact of dual use, whether the use of newer tobacco products is more likely to lead to complete abstinence from combustible tobacco use, and whether these products and e-cigarettes have adverse health effects if they are continued long-term.

### The 50th anniversary of the US surgeon general's report on tobacco: what we' ve accomplished and where we go from here [^af367c91]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The tobacco industry is also pushing so‐called "reduced harm" or "modified harm" tobacco products. Products like chewing tobacco, snus, and electronic cigarettes (e‐cigarettes) are marketed by the industry as safe alternatives to smoking. The industry is also lobbying for federal and state laws and resolutions directing health authorities to promote these products. – Research is very clear that some of these products, like chewing tobacco and snus, are still dangerous and can cause cancer and other diseases. – There is also significant concern that smokers will use these products only when they are unable to smoke, but will continue smoking when able. – This is known as dual‐use.

E‐cigarettes present a unique challenge (Figure 2). They deliver a nicotine vapor without the combustion products that are responsible for most of smoking's damaging effects. They use vaporization at a lower operating temperature (5% to 10% of the temperature of a lit cigarette) to deliver nicotine and other constituents in a way that mimics smoking behavior. The impact of these products on cessation, dual use, youth initiation, social norms, and public health needs further elucidation.

Figure 2.
An electronic cigarette.

This is a quickly evolving issue. It will be important for the public health community to determine which public policies that apply to combustible cigarettes also should apply to e‐cigarettes. E‐cigarette companies, which include the major tobacco companies, are aggressively marketing these products as a way for smokers to get their nicotine hit in places that restrict smoking. – This has the potential to create enforcement problems with existing smoke‐free laws, as it would require business owners to determine if a customer is using an e‐cigarette or a combustible cigarette. E‐cigarettes are also being indirectly marketed as cessation aids, although the FDA has not approved them to be used in this manner.–

The use of e‐cigarettes among youth has grown dramatically in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, e‐cigarette use among high school students more than doubled from 4.7% in 2011 to 10% in 2012 (where 1.78 million students ever used e‐cigarettes). Among youth who use e‐cigarettes, 75% smoke conventional cigarettes as well. Until more research is available regarding the potential health harms of e‐cigarette use, as well as the risk of e‐cigarettes serving as a gateway for youth to become addicted to tobacco, these products should be carefully regulated by the FDA.

### Oral manifestations of smokeless tobacco use [^1e2b7887]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Smokeless tobacco (SLT) has been smoked, chewed, and inhaled in various forms for hundreds of years. The primary oral, mucosal, and hard tissue changes associated with SLT use include SLT keratosis (STK); gingival inflammation, periodontal inflammation, and alveolar bone damage; and dental caries, tooth abrasion, and dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Some high-risk STKs are human papillomavirus associated, and the highest level of transition of STK to dysplasia or oral SCC appears to be in those lesions that have a diffuse velvety or papillary texture clinically. There is minimal risk for oral cancer associated with SLT use.

### Interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation [^3d7bc09e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

This is not the most current review on this topic. An updated review with a new author team and methods can be found here: https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015314.pub2/full

Background

Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to tobacco dependence and long-term use can lead to health problems including periodontal disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of ST use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register in June 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit with follow-up of at least six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We summarised outcomes as risk ratios (RRs). For subgroups of trials with similar types of intervention and without substantial statistical heterogeneity, we estimated pooled effects using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method.

Main Results

We identified 34 trials that met the inclusion criteria, of which nine were new for this update, representing over 16,000 participants. There was moderate quality evidence from two studies suggesting that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.68, 507 participants). Pooled results from two trials of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44, 293 participants) but the confidence interval was wide. Neither nicotine patch (five trials, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, 1083 participants) nor nicotine gum (two trials, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, 310 participants) increased abstinence. Pooling five studies of nicotine lozenges did increase tobacco abstinence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 1529 participants) but confidence in this estimate is low as the result is sensitive to the exclusion of three trials which did not use a placebo control. Statistical heterogeneity was evident among the 17 trials of behavioural interventions: eight of them reported statistically and clinically significant benefits; six suggested benefit but with wide CIs and no statistical significance; and three had similar intervention and control quit rates and relatively narrow CIs. Heterogeneity was not explained by study design (individual or cluster randomization), whether participants were selected for interest in quitting, or specific intervention components. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, trials of behavioural interventions incorporating telephone support, with or without oral examination and feedback, were associated with larger effect sizes, but oral examination and feedback alone were not associated with benefit. In one trial an interactive website increased abstinence more than a static website. One trial comparing immediate cessation using nicotine patch versus a reduction approach using either nicotine lozenge or brand switching showed greater success for the abrupt cessation group.

Authors' Conclusions

Varenicline, nicotine lozenges and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit. Confidence in results for nicotine lozenges is limited. Confidence in the size of effect from behavioural interventions is limited because the components of behavioural interventions that contribute to their impact are not clear.

### Why won' T our patients stop smoking? The power of nicotine addiction [^95356d87]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

What are the components of this addiction that has many features of a chronic illness? The addiction itself has physiological, psychological, and behavioral components that will be addressed below. Central to addiction to cigarettes is the role of nicotine, the pharmacologic agent that is critical in maintaining smoking. While burning cigarettes emit over 4,000 different agents, the evidence that nicotine is the main culprit in maintaining addiction is strong. For example, cigarettes from which nicotine has been removed or those with ultra-low levels of nicotine have never been widely accepted by the smoking public, whereas chewing tobacco and snuff, both of which deliver large amounts of nicotine, are widely used. Nicotine meets criteria for drug dependency in that it promotes compulsive use, has psychoactive effects, and reinforces its own use.

Physiological dependence on nicotine is thought to be related to its action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Activation of these receptors results in the release of neurotransmitters — most importantly, dopamine, but also norepinephrine, acetylcholine, β-endorphin, and others. This then leads to some of the "positive" effects of smoking, such as pleasure, arousal, and the reduction of anxiety and tension. Repeated exposure to nicotine over time, such as occurs in habitual smokers, results in both a desensitization of these receptors to nicotine and an increase in the number of receptors. During periods of abstinence, such as while sleeping, it is thought that these desensitized receptors may recover and elicit symptoms of "withdrawal". These acute symptoms include irritability, depressed mood, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, and craving for tobacco, among others. Thus, the acute changes that occur when a person stops smoking suddenly provide a powerful reinforcement to start smoking again.

### Spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns in prevalence of smoking tobacco use and attributable disease burden in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis from the global burden of disease study 2019 [^61cb7579]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

With 1·14 billion current smokers globally in 2019, increasing cessation rates among current smokers can yield massive health gains. We estimated that fewer than 15% of deaths attributable to smoking tobacco use in 2019 occurred among former smokers aged 30 years and older, despite former smokers comprising approximately a third of the ever smoker population aged 30 years and older. Consistent with other studies, we found in our meta-analyses of risk reduction among former smokers that cessation shifts smokers into a lower-risk category, with greater reduction in risk for longer durations since cessation. Relative risks of all-cause mortality from long-running cohort studies in the UK, and the USAindicate that up to two-thirds of long-term smokers will eventually die of a disease attributable to smoking. These data underscore the importance of adopting policies and interventions that increase rates of cessation.

The results of our study must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, data on smoking tobacco use are self-reported, which might lead to underestimates in demographic groups with low social acceptability of smoking, particularly among females in Asia and Africa. Second, the scope of our study focuses on smoked tobacco products, and does not include smokeless tobacco products, e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, or other electronic nicotine delivery systems. Incorporating the health effects of the array of emerging electronic nicotine delivery systems, including both potential benefits and potential harms, is becoming increasingly important. Additionally, our analysis focuses on the health effects of primary smoking of tobacco and does not include additional harms due to second-hand smoke. Third, we converted non-cigarette smoked tobacco products to cigarette-equivalents on the basis of the weight of tobacco. Conversion on the basis of health effect equivalencies would be more accurate, but a paucity of evidence on the health effects of non-cigarette tobacco products presents challenges to this alternative approach. Fourth, the optimal lag-time between exposure and outcome exceeded 10 years for five outcomes (ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory tract infections, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and peptic ulcer disease). Due to the paucity of data on smoking patterns before 1980, we were restricted to using a maximum lag-time of 10 years. Fifth, the rate of risk reduction among former smokers probably varies by smoking intensity. Although we captured differences in the level of risk, we did not capture differences in the rate of risk reduction in our estimates. Despite these limitations, our results are broadly consistent with previous estimates that use different methods with a different set of limitations.

### Tobacco and nicotine use [^b818e3db]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Tobacco smoking is a major determinant of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide. More than a billion people smoke, and without major increases in cessation, at least half will die prematurely from tobacco-related complications. In addition, people who smoke have a significant reduction in their quality of life. Neurobiological findings have identified the mechanisms by which nicotine in tobacco affects the brain reward system and causes addiction. These brain changes contribute to the maintenance of nicotine or tobacco use despite knowledge of its negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Effective approaches to screen, prevent and treat tobacco use can be widely implemented to limit tobacco's effect on individuals and society. The effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in helping people quit smoking has been demonstrated. As the majority of people who smoke ultimately relapse, it is important to enhance the reach of available interventions and to continue to develop novel interventions. These efforts associated with innovative policy regulations (aimed at reducing nicotine content or eliminating tobacco products) have the potential to reduce the prevalence of tobacco and nicotine use and their enormous adverse impact on population health.

### Trends in long term vaping among adults in england, 2013–23: population based study [^73de79bb]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Our definition of long term vaping was use of e-cigarettes for a period of more than six months and was an operational definition to indicate possible dependent use. It is not necessarily indicative of a length of time at which we would expect substantial harms from vaping to have already accumulated. In discussions about the risks associated with e-cigarettes, a key concern is that the harms of long term use are not yet fully understood — in this context, long term use refers to decades rather than the much shorter duration of use focused on in our analysis. Even most of the well established harmful effects of tobacco smoking on health outcomes only become apparent after years and decades, rather than months, of use. Existing evidence suggests the long term health risks of vaping are likely to be substantially lower than the risks of smoking.

### Pharmacotherapy for nicotine dependence [^d21ff5e4]. CA (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of long-term cigarette smokers die prematurely from the adverse effects of smoking, including on cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or other illness. This risk can be substantially reduced by smoking cessation, with greater benefits occurring the earlier in the smoking career that cessation occurs. However, cessation provides benefits at any stage, including after the onset of smoking-related disease, by improving the prognosis and quality of life. Clinicians can have a significant impact on reducing tobacco use by their patients by following the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines. Proven strategies include structured methods of advising cigarette smokers to quit and guidance to facilitate their efforts, as well as the use of various pharmacotherapies. Pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence include nicotine replacement medications in the form of gum, transdermal patch, lozenge, sublingual tablet, nasal spray, and vapor inhaler formulations. The only nonnicotine medication that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is bupropion. Combination therapies, long-term medication therapies, and harm reduction strategies may further improve outcome with approved medications. Further, new medications such as varenicline and rimonabant are likely to reach tobacco users who are refractory to current treatments. Increasing the treatment options, increasing availability, and reducing the perceived cost of these medications may have an additional public health impact.

### Interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation [^24767a3e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to nicotine addiction and health problems including periodontal disease and oral cancer

Objectives

To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacotherapeutic interventions to treat ST use.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register (February 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966-February 2004), EMBASE (1988-January 2004), CINAHL (1982-February 2004), PsycINFO (1984-February 2004), Database of Abstract of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit, with follow-up of at least six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data.

Main Results

One trial of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment after six months (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.23 to 4.37). Three trials of nicotine patch did not detect a benefit (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.54), nor did two trials of nicotine gum (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.63). There was statistical heterogeneity among the results of eight trials of behavioural interventions included in the meta-analysis. Three trials showed significant benefits of intervention. In a post-hoc analysis the trials of interventions which included an oral examination and feedback about ST-induced mucosal changes had homogeneous results and when pooled showed a significant benefit (OR 2.41 95% CI: 1.79 to 3.24).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Behavioural interventions should be used to help ST users to quit. Pharmacotherapies have not been shown to affect long-term abstinence but larger trials are needed.

### Correspondence to editorial "Oral health in southeast Asia: addressing inaccessibility" [^079f97fa]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

As the last editorial points out, unequal distribution of services and lack of effective prevention policies in southeast Asia exacerbate health inequities, affecting vulnerable populations such as rural communities and low-income groups.

This challenge is exacerbated by limited access to trained professionals, and insufficient oral health education at both individual and professional levels. The absence of structured personalized prophylaxis protocols weakens preventive measures, contributing to the high prevalence and incidence of oral diseases.

First, these diseases are often linked with oral microbiome dysbiosis, leading to systemic consequences, particularly in aging populations and individuals with cancer or chronic conditions. Growing evidence on oral-systemic interactions underscores the need to integrate oral health into comprehensive disease management.

Second, oral cancer remains a major public health challenge in Southeast Asia, where betel quid chewing significantly increases cancer risk. The high prevalence of smokeless tobacco use, combined with cultural and socioeconomic factors, exacerbates the disease burden. Given its severe health and economic impact, urgent measures are needed.

To address this issue, a comprehensive and integrated approach to oral health is essential, combining preventive and therapeutic strategies. Key measures should involve systematic screening for high-risk individuals, early oral hygiene education, enhanced training for healthcare providers, and community-based health promotion. Additionally, integrating digital solutions — along with strengthening primary healthcare and fostering a supportive policy environment — can improve accessibility and efficiency. Equally crucial are public awareness campaigns to curb tobacco and betel quid consumption, reducing oral cancer's toll.

### Long-term use of Swedish moist snuff and the risk of myocardial infarction amongst men [^baeefdc2]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The scientific evidence on cardiovascular risks associated with long-term use of snuff is limited and inconclusive. The use of this smokeless tobacco has increased in recent decades, and adverse health effects associated with snuff use could be of great public health concern.

Objective

We aimed to study whether long-term use of snuff affects the risk of myocardial infarction.

Design

Between 1978 and 1993 all construction workers in Sweden were offered repeated health check-ups by the Swedish Construction Industry's Organization for Working Environment Safety and Health. A cohort was created with information on tobacco use and other risk factors, collected through questionnaires.

Setting

In total, 118,395 nonsmoking men without a history of myocardial infarction were followed through 2004. Information on myocardial infarction morbidity and mortality was obtained from national registers. Relative risk estimates were derived from Cox proportional hazards regression model, with adjustment for age, body mass index and region of residence.

Results

Almost 30% of the men had used snuff. In total, 118 395 nonsmoking men without a history of myocardial infarction were followed through 2004. The multivariable-adjusted relative risks for ever snuff users were 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.02) for nonfatal cases and 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.55) for fatal cases. Heavy users (≥ 50 g day(-1)) had a relative risk of fatal myocardial infarction of 1.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.08–3.58). Snuff use increased the probability of mortality from cardiovascular disease amongst nonfatal myocardial infarction patients.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that snuff use is associated with an increased risk of fatal myocardial infarction.

### Toward a comprehensive long term nicotine policy [^4d894294]. Tobacco Control (2005). Low credibility.

Global tobacco deaths are high and rising. Tobacco use is primarily driven by nicotine addiction. Overall tobacco control policy is relatively well agreed upon but a long term nicotine policy has been less well considered and requires further debate. Reaching consensus is important because a nicotine policy is integral to the target of reducing tobacco caused disease, and the contentious issues need to be resolved before the necessary political changes can be sought. A long term and comprehensive nicotine policy is proposed here. It envisages both reducing the attractiveness and addictiveness of existing tobacco based nicotine delivery systems as well as providing alternative sources of acceptable clean nicotine as competition for tobacco. Clean nicotine is defined as nicotine free enough of tobacco toxicants to pass regulatory approval. A three phase policy is proposed. The initial phase requires regulatory capture of cigarette and smoke constituents liberalising the market for clean nicotine; regulating all nicotine sources from the same agency; and research into nicotine absorption and the role of tobacco additives in this process. The second phase anticipates clean nicotine overtaking tobacco as the primary source of the drug (facilitated by use of regulatory and taxation measures); simplification of tobacco products by limitation of additives which make tobacco attractive and easier to smoke (but tobacco would still be able to provide a satisfying dose of nicotine). The third phase includes a progressive reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes, with clean nicotine freely available to take the place of tobacco as society's main nicotine source.

### Smokeless tobacco use and circulatory disease risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^66bf0e6f]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The health effects of smokeless tobacco use are of considerable research and public health interest. Globally, more than 300 million people use these products, many of them in low-income countries. In the USA, it has been estimated that smokeless tobacco use was responsible for approximately 1600 new cases of oral cancer, 500 new cases of pancreatic cancer and 200 new cases of oesophageal cancer in 2008. Although some types of smokeless tobacco have been found to be associated with circulatory conditions including heart disease and stroke, comprehensive reviews of this association in high-income countries may be out of date or limited by the number of study estimates they identified. Moreover, disease burden calculations for smokeless tobacco in the USA are generally unavailable for these conditions.

Several reviews of smokeless tobacco use and circulatory disease risk have been conducted previously. Leereviewed 11 studies from Sweden and the USA in 2007 and found an association between smokeless tobacco use and increased heart disease risk based on eight studies, increased stroke risk based on five studies and increased overall circulatory disease risk based on three studies. Boffetta and Straifalso identified 11 observational studies from Sweden and the USA in 2009 and found an association between smokeless tobacco use and increased risk of fatal myocardial infarction based on eight studies and increased risk of fatal stroke based on five studies. Zhang et al identified eight studies from Asian countries, principally Bangladesh, India and Taiwan in 2010. They found increased cardiovascular and ischaemic heart disease risk based on six studies and increased cerebrovascular risk based on three studies for ever users of chewing substances with and without tobacco. Siddiqi et al reviewed 13 studies of heart disease and stroke risk from South Asia and Sweden in 2015 and did not observe increased risk in Swedish studies. They noted that the multicountry INTERHEART study with data from 52 countries found increased heart disease risk among smokeless tobacco users. Vidyasagaran et al reviewed 20 studies from South Asia, Sweden and the USA in 2016 and found increased mortality risk from ischaemic heart disease and stroke among ever smokeless tobacco users. Results varied by region, with a significant association for non-fatal ischaemic heart disease in Asian but not European studies. Sinha et al identified 16 studies of all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk from South Asia, Sweden and the USA in 2018. They found smokeless tobacco use to be associated with increased mortality risk for all causes as well as ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Gupta et al reviewed 20 studies from South Asia, Iran, Sweden and the USA, also in 2018, and found an association between smokeless tobacco use and fatal coronary heart disease in Swedish studies and studies overall.

### Tobacco and nicotine cessation during pregnancy: ACOG committee opinion, number 807 [^4a1a8734]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Alternative forms of nicotine delivery — Whereas there is an incorrect perception that vaping represents a safer alternative to cigarette smoking because users are not inhaling tobacco combustion products, these products often contain nicotine or nicotine salts, and even if nicotine is not present in the e-liquid, exposure to flavorants and combustion products from the heating mechanism occurs; nicotine crosses the placenta and intake in any form has considerable health risks with known adverse effects on fetal brain and lung tissue. Hookah users are exposed to nicotine and charcoal briquette combustion products, short-term effects may include increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and impaired pulmonary function, and long-term use may increase risk of nicotine dependence, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and coronary artery disease; noncombustible products, such as snus, dissolvable tobacco, and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), have nicotine-related risks and an increased risk for oral cancer similar to that of chewing tobacco, and studies demonstrate an increased risk of altered fetal autonomic cardiac regulation and nicotine withdrawal in neonates born to women who used snus during pregnancy. Electronic nicotine delivery systems are noncombustible products and health effects from heating liquid flavorants are unknown and likely vary, with carbonyl compounds, volatile organic compounds, nitrosamines, particulate matter, and heavy metals isolated from the aerosol; although much of the data on nicotine delivery in pregnancy are derived primarily from animal studies, e-cigarettes appear to have similar effects on lung development and offspring lung health when compared with cigarette smoking. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory notice investigating a multistate outbreak of noninfectious severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette and vaping product use, and immediate discontinuation of e-cigarette and vaping products should be advised among all pregnant and postpartum women.

### Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^3fa9b89d]. The Lancet: Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Overview

We used the Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast YLLs under three smoking prevalence scenarios, for 204 countries and territories as well as 365 diseases and injuries by 5-year age group and sex from 2022 to 2050. In the following sections, we focus primarily on methods specific to this analysis of the effects of smoking prevalence reductions. The methods used to forecast population, fertility, and all-cause mortality have been reported elsewhere. Methods and accompanying estimates for smoking-specific inputs, including smoking prevalence, continuous measures of intensity of exposure, and dose-response relative risks for 32 health outcomes have also been previously published. In this analysis, we only report the direct effects from smoking tobacco, which do not include the health effects from second-hand smoke, smokeless tobacco use, or electronic nicotine delivery systems. This study adheres to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting statement (appendix 1 pp 16–17).

### Cigarette smoking: an undertreated risk factor for cardiovascular disease [^07d87ab2]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Smoking and other forms of tobacco use are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The effect of cigarette smoking on cardiovascular health is evident even at the lowest levels of exposure. Yet, the adverse effects of smoking are reversible, with cardiovascular risk decreasing substantially within the first 2 years of smoking cessation. Significantly, the mortality from coronary heart disease is reduced more through smoking cessation than by other secondary preventive therapies such as cholesterol lowering. Smoking cessation is a highly effective way to improve cardiovascular health in smokers and extremely cost-effective. However, smoking cessation therapies are not implemented maximally if they are implemented at all, perhaps because smoking is seen as a lifestyle choice or because smokers frequently relapse, as indicated by very low long-term quit rates. Too often, healthcare professionals, including lipidologists and cardiologists, do little to address their patients' smoking status, in spite of its impact on cardiovascular health. With the advent of new therapies to treat the nicotine addiction that results from smoking and other tobacco use, it is hoped that physicians will be more proactive in encouraging and implementing smoking cessation programs for their patients, with the goal of increasing long-term quit rates, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease.

### Smokeless tobacco use and circulatory disease risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f79533f8]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The study consisted of a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of smokeless tobacco use and circulatory disease risk in Europe and North America that contained a quantitative relative risk estimate for users compared with non-users. The review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using a prespecified study protocol. Given that the study did not involve primary data collection or analysis, the study was considered exempt from human subjects committee review. In August 2017, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Ebscohost databases for references that contained terms for both smokeless tobacco and circulatory conditions. The online supplementary appendix shows the relevant search terms for each database. Two reviewers (GMA and JTC) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of these articles and identified relevant references for further review. Each reviewer then evaluated each reference for inclusion in the study. We searched for relevant unpublished studies by reviewing previous reviews and the reference lists of selected articles. Preliminary studies by two groups of researcherswere identified in our search but were not included in the review because they have yet to be published. The rationale for their exclusion is explained in greater detail in the Discussion section. The reviewers then extracted relevant information from identified studies including study design, country, study size, smokeless tobacco type, and circulatory conditions or mortality outcomes. Because studies often report more than one estimate, specific estimates for each outcome from each study were extracted using the following order of preference lists: smokeless tobacco type (all, snuff or snus, chewing tobacco), smokeless tobacco use status (current or former, ever), cigarette smoking status (never, non-current, any smoking status), medical outcome (specific circulatory conditions such as heart disease or stroke, all circulatory conditions), outcome type (all cases, then fatal or non-fatal events for the type that has the greater number of cases) and adjustment for other risk factors (the most extensive adjustment available). Medical outcomes were categorised as ischaemic heart disease (conditions included in International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 410–414, sometimes characterised as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease in specific studies), stroke (ICD-9 430–438) and other circulatory conditions (the remainder of ICD-9 390–459). The quality of these studies was also assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, a standardised scale to assess the quality of non-randomised studies included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Studies were assigned a maximum of nine stars based on established criteria for the selection of study groups, the comparability of groups and the ascertainment of exposure for case–control studies and outcome for cohort studies. Additional information about the scale and its criteria are provided in online supplementary tables.

### Effects of chewing tobacco on corneal endothelium in patients with diabetes mellitus [^8be42025]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the impact of tobacco chewing on corneal endothelial structure in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).

Methods

Corneal endothelial parameters (endothelial cell count, ECD; coefficient of variation, CV; hexagonality, Hex, and central corneal thickness, CCT) were analysed in 1234 eyes of 1234 patients using non-contact specular microscopy (EM 4000 Tomey Nishi-Ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan). The study group (with a present history of tobacco chewing) comprising of 948 subjects, with 473 having DM was compared with age and gender-matched control group comprising of 286 subjects (139 having DM) with no history of tobacco use in any form.

Results

Tobacco chewers had a significantly reduced ECD (P = 0.024) and Hex (P = 0.009) as compared with non-chewers. Similar results were noted in ECD (P = 0.004) and Hex (P = 0.005) in patients with DM. Tobacco chewers had a significantly decreased ECD values among males, HbA1C ≤ 7.5% and duration of DM ≤ 20 years, and significantly decreased Hex among those with > 50 years of age, females, and duration of DM > 20 years. The CV and CCT values were comparable between the study and the control groups. Tobacco chewers showed a significant association of ECD with age, HbA1C, and duration of DM; CV with HbA1C; Hex with age and duration of DM; and CCT with gender, age, HbA1C and duration of DM.

Conclusions

Tobacco chewing may negatively impact corneal health, especially confounded by additional factors like age and DM. These factors must be accounted for in the pre-operative evaluation of such patients prior to any intra-ocular surgery.

### Tobacco use and incidence of adverse oral health outcomes among US adults in the population assessment of tobacco and health study [^e9c38d26]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This nationally representative cohort study of US adults confirms associations between tobacco use and incidence of oral health outcomes among those without a lifetime history of the oral health outcome. Associations were robust to adjustment for cigarette pack-years and current use of other tobacco products, thus reflecting associations of current tobacco use with oral health independent of smoking history and concurrent tobacco product use.

Cigarette smoking was associated with the incidence of several adverse oral health outcomes (ie, gum disease diagnosis, loose teeth, and 1 or more teeth removed), supporting the previously documented causal relationship between smoking and periodontal disease. Although current cigarette smoking was not associated with incidence of bone loss around teeth, increasing cigarette pack-year history was significantly associated with this oral health outcome (results in eTable 5 in Supplement 1), confirming the importance of both number of cigarettes smoked and duration of smoking to risk of poor oral health, particularly for outcomes that may take a longer time to manifest. Over the short period of follow-up in this study, current cigar smoking but not cigarette smoking was positively associated with incidence of precancerous oral lesions, a heterogenous group of potentially malignant disorders. Future studies can explore whether the inconsistent findings across combustible products (ie, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and hookah) are possibly due to differences in use behaviors between these products.

In the current study, current ENDS use was positively associated with bleeding after brushing or flossing, similar to a prior pilot study on gum bleeding in e-cigarette users. However, determining whether this is a direct effect of ENDS use or the observed increase in bleeding is due to quitting cigarette smoking, especially given that most ENDS users are former or current cigarette users, is an area for future research. Nevertheless, although limited, the preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological evidence suggests potential oral health harms associated with ENDS use compared with never using, possibly via dental and periodontal damage, cellular changes, or alteration of the oral microbiome. Although this study did not find associations between current ENDS use and incidence of other oral health outcomes, it focused on short-term changes in oral health. Short-term changes in oral health (eg, gum bleeding) may be easier to detect than long-term changes such as bone loss around teeth or precancerous oral lesions; therefore, future analyses using additional waves of the PATH Study can explore incidence of oral health outcomes that may be associated with longer term ENDS use.

### Oral nicotine pouches for cessation or reduction of use of other tobacco or nicotine products [^0cafdc53]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Combustible tobacco use (i.e. smoking) is the leading preventable cause of disease and death worldwide. Other commercial products containing tobacco leaf or synthetic or naturally derived nicotine vary in popularity and harm profiles. Nicotine e‐cigarettes are defined as handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol for inhalation formed by heating an e‐liquid containing nicotine, flavourings and humectants. They are considered to represent some risk to the user, particularly people who do not have a history of combustible tobacco use, but have also been proven to help people who smoke transition away from smoking, and are considerably less harmful than traditional cigarettes. Heated tobacco products (HTPs) are designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to release an aerosol, without burning it or producing smoke. They differ from e‐cigarettes because they heat tobacco leaf/sheet rather than a liquid. Companies who make HTPs claim they produce fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarettes, but independent data on their harm profiles and impacts on combustible tobacco use remain inconclusive. Smokeless tobacco products include snus (a pouch of powdered tobacco leaves placed under the lip) and chewing tobacco, which are products used orally that contain tobacco leaf. Because combustion is the cause of most of the deadly toxins users are exposed to through smoking, oral tobacco products, though still posing varying risks to users, are also considered less harmful than smoking.

Smoking is addictive and deadly. Most adults who smoke want to stop, but many find it difficult to do so, even with evidence‐based support. There remains an urgent need to identify new alternatives to support people in transitioning away from combustible tobacco use.

### Screening for oral cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^00862c36]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness of early detection and treatment — No direct evidence was available on whether screening reduces morbidity or mortality in general or high-risk U.S. or non-U.S. populations. In the Kerala, India cluster randomized trial of home-based screening by trained health workers (n = 191 873), oral cancer mortality did not differ significantly between screening and control groups after 9 years of follow-up (rate ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.22]); after an additional screening round and 15 years of follow-up, mortality rates were similar and not statistically significant. Screened participants were diagnosed at earlier stages with a greater 5-year survival than control participants, possibly as a result of lead-time bias. In post hoc subgroup analyses of those who reported tobacco and alcohol use (n = 84 600), mortality was reduced in the screening group (rate ratio, 0.66 [CI, 0.45 to 0.95]), and at 15 years a decreased but still significant reduction persisted (rate ratio, 0.76 [CI, 0.60 to 0.97]); generalizability to the United States is limited because participants commonly chewed pan and because India has higher oral cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality and a different health care system.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^adb6a1a9]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Tobacco use assessment and clinician advice — wording and impact: Patients who answer yes to screening questions such as "Have you used any other tobacco product in the past 30 days?" are considered current smokers, and clinicians should avoid asking "Are you a smoker?" or "Do you smoke?" because people are less likely to report tobacco use when asked in this way; tobacco users are more likely to quit after 6 months when clinicians strongly advise adults to quit using tobacco than when clinicians give no advice or usual care.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^51fd970d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Tobacco cessation — interpregnancy and postpartum care: Nonpregnant adult smokers should be offered smoking cessation support through behavioral interventions and U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacotherapy, and tobacco use is a modifiable risk factor for adverse pregnancy and longer-term health outcomes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and ACOG recommend medications, behavioral interventions, or both in nonpregnant adults, and for lactating women, nicotine replacement therapy is compatible with breastfeeding because nicotine and cotinine in breast milk are generally the same or lower using replacement therapy compared with smoking. Specific tools are available to assist cessation after pregnancy, and health care providers should reassess tobacco use (smoked, chewed, electronic nicotine delivery systems, vaped) at the postpartum visit and continue to provide, or refer, for assistance with ongoing efforts at cessation.

### Cigarette smoking and E-cigarette use induce shared DNA methylation changes linked to carcinogenesis [^eb5108ca]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco usage elicits a spectrum of detrimental effects spanning cellular, organ, and systemic levels, encompassing DNA damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and epigenetic alterations, and is a known modifiable contributor to adverse health outcomes. Exposure to the 7,000 chemicals in cigarettes has been estimated to have caused 7.69 million deaths globally in 2019, with numbers projected to increase in the ensuing decades.

Seeking harm reduction, alternatives to smoking such as smokeless noncombustible tobacco use and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes; ref.) that vaporize a liquid solution often containing nicotine and various other chemicals have emerged. Despite widespread endorsement by Public Health England, who have advocated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as "95% less harmful" than combustible cigarettes, recent studies have highlighted potential drawbacks, including the induction of endothelial dysfunction and DNA damage, underscoring the urgency for further research into molecular changes and long-term health impacts of e-cigarettes. However, the relative novelty of e-cigarettes and the fact that many e-cigarette users ("vapers") are also former smokers renders this task complex and studies with several decades of follow-up would be required to investigate the impact of e-cigarette use on cancer risk if incidence were the primary outcome. Biomarkers could represent an attractive strategy to evaluate their impact in the absence of such long-term studies. The majority of existing biomarker studies for e-cigarette use have thus far focused only on acute impacts. Some of these studies have found e-cigarettes elicit similar biomarker changes to cigarette smoking while others found a relative reduction in risk indicators or pre-existing disease after switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. Nonetheless, to evaluate longer-term health effects, it is essential to identify biomarkers that may be informative of cancer risk related to cigarette and e-cigarette use. Such biomarkers should meet the following criteria to be of clinical use: (i) they should be modified by smoking and e-cigarette use; (ii) they should lie in genes associated with carcinogenesis; (iii) they should indicate a clonal advantage for cells, as indicated by an aggravation in cancer tissue compared with adjacent non-cancer tissue; (iv) they should be associated with cancer progression in a premalignant lesion; and (v) they should be reflective of long-term cancer risk in a surrogate tissue, for example, blood or buccal swab, to allow for noninvasive monitoring.

### Uncovering the relation between betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking in Taiwan [^b9863307]. Tobacco Control (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the characteristics of betel quid chewers and to investigate the behavioural and mortality relations between betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking.

Method

Prevalence and mortality risks of betel quid chewers by smoking status were calculated, based on the National Health Interview Survey in 2001 and a community based cohort, respectively. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to adjust mortality risks for age, alcohol use, and education.

Results

Almost all betel quid chewers were smokers, and most started chewing after smoking. Chewers were predominantly male, mostly in their 30s and 40s, more likely being among the lowest educational or income group, and residing in the eastern regions of Taiwan. On average, betel quid chewers who smoked consumed 18 pieces of betel quid a day, and smoked more cigarettes per day. Far more smokers use betel quid than non-smokers (27.5% v 2.5%), but ex-smokers quit betel quid more than smokers (15.1% v 6.8%). The significantly increased mortality of betel quid users who also smoked, for all causes, all cancer, oral cancer, and cancer of the nasopharynx, lung, and liver, was the result of the combined effects of chewing and smoking. Smokers who chewed betel quid nearly tripled their oral cancer risks from a relative risk of 2.1 to 5.9. Increasing the number of cigarettes smoked among betel quid chewers was associated with a synergistic effect, reflective of the significant interaction between the two.

Conclusion

To a large extent, the serious health consequences suffered by betel quid chewers were the result of the combined effects of smoking and chewing. Betel quid chewing should not be considered as an isolated issue, but should be viewed conjointly with cigarette smoking. Reducing cigarette smoking serves as an important first step in reducing betel quid chewing, and incorporating betel quid control into tobacco control may provide a new paradigm to attenuate the explosive increase in betel quid use in Taiwan.

### Evaluation of the economic impact of California's tobacco control program: a dynamic model approach [^a265d470]. Tobacco Control (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term net economic impact of the California Tobacco Control Program.

Methods

This study developed a series of dynamic models of smoking-caused mortality, morbidity, health status and healthcare expenditures. The models were used to evaluate the impact of the tobacco control programme. Outcomes of interest in the evaluation include net healthcare expenditures saved, years of life saved, years of treating smoking-related diseases averted and the total economic value of net healthcare savings and life saved by the programme. These outcomes are evaluated to 2079. Due to data limitations, the evaluations are conducted only for men.

Results

The California Tobacco Control Program resulted in over 700,000 person-years of life saved and over 150,000 person-years of treatment averted for the 14.7 million male California residents alive in 1990. The value of net healthcare savings and years of life saved resulting from the programme was $22 billion or $107 billion in 1990 dollars, depending on how a year of life is discounted. If women were included, the impact would likely be much greater.

Conclusions

The benefits of California's Tobacco Control Program are substantial and will continue to accrue for many years. Although the programme has resulted in increased longevity and additional healthcare resources for some, this impact is more than outweighed by the value of the additional years of life. Modelling the programme's impact in a dynamic framework makes it possible to evaluate the multiple impacts that the programme has on life, health and medical expenditures.

### Tobacco use and risk of myocardial infarction in 52 countries in the INTERHEART study: a case-control study [^d064cfe1]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tobacco use is one of the major avoidable causes of cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to assess the risks associated with tobacco use (both smoking and non-smoking) and second hand tobacco smoke (SHS) worldwide.

Methods

We did a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with 27,089 participants in 52 countries (12,461 cases, 14,637 controls). We assessed relation between risk of AMI and current or former smoking, type of tobacco, amount smoked, effect of smokeless tobacco, and exposure to SHS. We controlled for confounders such as differences in lifestyles between smokers and non-smokers.

Findings

Current smoking was associated with a greater risk of non-fatal AMI (odds ratio [OR] 2.95, 95% CI 2.77–3.14, p < 0.0001) compared with never smoking; risk increased by 5.6% for every additional cigarette smoked. The OR associated with former smoking fell to 1.87 (95% CI 1.55–2.24) within 3 years of quitting. A residual excess risk remained 20 or more years after quitting (1.22, 1.09–1.37). Exclusion of individuals exposed to SHS in the never smoker reference group raised the risk in former smokers by about 10%. Smoking beedies alone (indigenous to South Asia) was associated with increased risk (2.89, 2.11–3.96) similar to that associated with cigarette smoking. Chewing tobacco alone was associated with OR 2.23 (1.41–3.52), and smokers who also chewed tobacco had the highest increase in risk (4.09, 2.98–5.61). SHS was associated with a graded increase in risk related to exposure; OR was 1.24 (1.17–1.32) in individuals who were least exposed (1–7 h per week) and 1.62 (1.45–1.81) in people who were most exposed (> 21 h per week). Young male current smokers had the highest population attributable risk (58.3%; 95% CI 55.0–61.6) and older women the lowest (6.2%, 4.1–9.2). Population attributable risk for exposure to SHS for more than 1 h per week in never smokers was 15.4% (12.1–19.3).

Conclusion

Tobacco use is one of the most important causes of AMI globally, especially in men. All forms of tobacco use, including different types of smoking and chewing tobacco and inhalation of SHS, should be discouraged to prevent cardiovascular diseases.

### The impact of the cigarette market opening in Taiwan [^b4684f34]. Tobacco Control (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of the opening of the Taiwanese cigarette market on cigarette consumption, changes in market share, and the effects on tobacco control efforts.

Methods

With the use of key word "Taiwan", the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library of the University of California, San Francisco, was searched for internal documents related to smuggling activities, promotion of light cigarettes, and market share analyses in Taiwan. Age adjusted smoking rates and cigarette and betel quid consumption before and after market opening were compared.

Results

By 2000, the market share of imported cigarettes increased from less than 2% in 1986 to nearly 50%, and per capita cigarette consumption increased 15% following market opening. Because of the sharp increase in smuggling, with contraband cigarettes being as popular as legal imports, and the rapid proliferation of retail outlets, such as betel quid stalls, the market penetration by foreign tobacco companies was greater in Taiwan than among the other Super 301 Asian countries. Aggressive cigarette marketing strategies were associated with a 6% increase in adult male smoking prevalence, and with a 13% increase in the youth rate, within three years after market opening. The market opening also had an incidental effect on increasing the popularity of betel quid. Betel quid chewing has since become a major public health problem in Taiwan.

Conclusion

The opening of the cigarette market in 1987 had a long lasting impact on Taiwan. It increased smoking prevalence and the market has become dominated by foreign companies. The seriousness of smuggling and its associated loss of revenue by the government, the extent of increased youth smoking and its associated future health care costs, and the increased use of betel quid and the associated doubling of oral cancer mortality rates each pose significant problems to Taiwan. However, the market opening galvanised anti-smoking sentiment and forced the government to initiate and intensify a series of tobacco control efforts.

### Tobacco use and incidence of adverse oral health outcomes among US adults in the population assessment of tobacco and health study [^ba5b4513]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Smokeless tobacco use is associated with precancerous oral lesions in South Asia, where these products are designed to be highly addictive and their use is culturally and socially acceptable and often combined with other carcinogens (eg, areca nut). A recent review of systematic reviewsconcluded there is a positive association between smokeless tobacco use and oral cancer worldwide. However, associations varied by geographic region such that studies in North America showed no associations with oral cancer. Although snus is a recent addition to the US tobacco market, 8 snus products received modified risk marketing authorization from the FDA. Previous studies, have shown considerable heterogeneity in composition, including pH, nicotine, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines, among snus varieties, particularly between US and European products, suggesting that these products may pose varying degrees of risk. The lack of associations between snus use and incidence of oral health outcomes may reflect this variability or may be due to low statistical power but is consistent with findings from Swedish studies.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^6f94d3d4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society policy statement — language standards and evidence needs for tobacco harm reduction claims — emphasizes that prior frameworks included establishing standard methods for determining relative risk across products, clarifying relationships between toxicants and health outcomes, and monitoring population-level impacts on initiation or cessation; it notes that evidentiary certainty must be counterbalanced by rapid implementation and that post hoc monitoring has been described as ethically acceptable. The document cautions that poorly defined terms such as "light" or "low tar" and vague harm reduction language allow consumer misdirection, states that attention to language is essential to develop a uniform database of reproducible results, and warns that unproven or premature reduced-risk or reduced-exposure claims threaten informed consent and autonomous risk control. It notes general wariness of harm reduction claims and indicates that continued use of vague or misleading terms would be expected to undermine trustworthiness, while the ATS Tobacco Action Committee sought to establish evidence-based "standards of practice" to improve claim trustworthiness and consistency for regulatory direction.

### Public health impact of FDA's request for additional safety data on cytisine for tobacco cessation [^f51fc7b4]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Importance

No new tobacco cessation medication has been licensed in the US since 2006. Cytisine, a plant-based partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in several randomized clinical trials and is currently available in many countries. However, the drug is not commercially available in the US. A New Drug Application to license cytisine as a smoking cessation medication in the US is being prepared for review by the US Food and Drug Administration, whose request for additional safety data will delay submission of the application by approximately 1 year.

Objective

To project the potential public health impact of cytisine, and delays in its availability, as a smoking cessation aid in the US.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This mathematical model estimated life expectancy gains from smoking cessation for people aged 18 to 99 years in the US, reflecting the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The model also accounted for cytisine uptake and effectiveness, as well as potential relapse among people who stop smoking.

Exposure

Cytisine availability as a tobacco cessation treatment immediately or after 1 year.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were the number of adults able to stop smoking and sustain long-term abstinence and aggregate life-years gained.

Results

The base case includes an estimated 29.4 million US civilian noninstitutionalized adults who smoke cigarettes (age distribution, 18–24 years: 5.5%; 25–44 years: 37.3%; 45–64 years: 41.8%; ≥ 65 years: 15.5%). With a conservative assumption that 3.8% of these individuals would use cytisine in the first year of availability, immediate cytisine availability could lead 71 000 more people to quit smoking over 1 year and maintain long-term abstinence. This would produce more than 500 000 additional life-years compared to the status quo in which cytisine is unavailable and fewer people stop smoking. Each additional year of delay in the availability of cytisine might reduce population-level life expectancy by 10 000 years. The model results were most sensitive to changes in cytisine uptake and effectiveness.

Conclusions and Relevance

Smoking cessation generates large gains in life expectancy. This mathematical model demonstrated that immediate cytisine availability, even if used successfully by only a small fraction of people who smoke, could produce major public health benefits. Given the need for new tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy options, the magnitude of cytisine's potential public health benefits, and the morbidity and mortality associated with delay in its availability, a timely review of cytisine for approval in the US is warranted.

### Treatments for spit tobacco use: a quantitative systematic review [^15990c12]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Spit tobacco use is prevalent in the United States and is associated with adverse health consequences. Health-care providers have neither evidence summaries nor evidence-based guidelines to assist them in treating patients who use spit tobacco.

Design

We completed a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and behavioral interventions for the treatment of spit tobacco use.

Findings

We found six randomized controlled trials testing pharmacological interventions and eight testing behavioral interventions. Using random-effects meta-analyses, bupropion sustained-release (SR) increased point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 12 weeks [odds ratio (OR) 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0–4.2]. Nicotine replacement therapy with patch or gum increased point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 6 months (OR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.6). Behavioral interventions increased long-term (6 month)point prevalence tobacco abstinence (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.9). Studies including an oral examination followed by feedback to the patient had the highest treatment effect.

Conclusions

Behavioral interventions for ST users are effective for increasing ST abstinence rates. Bupropion SR is probably effective and nicotine replacement therapy may be effective. This evidence from randomized controlled trials provides health-care professionals with information necessary to effectively treat spit tobacco use.

### Impact of long-term non-invasive ventilation on severe exacerbations and survival in COPD: a French nationwide cohort study using multistate models [^87a70036]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and debilitating lower respiratory tract illness. There were 202.3 million prevalent cases of COPD and 3.3 million deaths related to COPD in 2019, and in the same year, COPD caused the loss of 74.4 million disability-adjusted life-years. It has recently been estimated that there will be nearly 600 million cases of COPD worldwide by 2050, a 23% increase compared with 2020. For several reasons, including a systemic failure to limit the availability and use of tobacco products, ongoing exposure to air pollution, non-specific diagnostic approaches and a lack of disease-modifying treatment options, COPD is recognised as a global health crisis.COPD is also associated with significant cost burden, with total COPD-related direct costs in Europe estimated to be €38.6 billion. Furthermore, COPD has a negative impact on health status and quality of life.

Hypercapnic COPD is one of the main indications for long-term domiciliary non-invasive ventilation (NIV). However, the current level of evidence for the mid- to long-term impact of NIV on hard outcomes in chronic hypercapnic COPD is limited. The majority of studies included in a 2021 Cochrane review had an unblinded design and were therefore potentially biased. In addition, the combined number of participants in all randomised trials to date is < 500. Based on data available at the time, the Cochrane review concluded that chronic NIV therapy improved admission-free survival, but did not appear to have a positive impact on all-cause mortality. Therefore, there is clearly a need for additional evidence regarding the long-term benefit of domiciliary NIV in COPD.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society policy statement: disparities in respiratory health [^6a93da12]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Tobacco control within ATS/ERS policy is framed as a long-term action step, stating that "Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the world, and kills half of all lifetime users prematurely (29)", and that "There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke". As an additional action step to lead to long-term solutions, the ERS and ATS support measures "such as plain packaging of tobacco, mandatory large pictorial warnings, point-of-sale display bans", to address respiratory health disparities.
