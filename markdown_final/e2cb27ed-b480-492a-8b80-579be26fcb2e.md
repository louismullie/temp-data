## Question

Is a prescription for terbinafine appropriate for vaginal candidiasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prescribing terbinafine is appropriate for vaginal candidiasis and, if not, what the appropriate approach should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about terbinafine's mechanism of action and its FDA-approved indications. Then, I should verify its spectrum against Candida and whether clinical efficacy has been established. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), examine available clinical trial data, and consider pharmacologic and safety factors. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence, correct any premature assumptions, and outline practical, guideline-concordant alternatives for both acute and recurrent VVC, including special situations such as severe disease, non‑albicans Candida, and pregnancy [^112VL6ed] [^112xeTif] [^117AmTxu].

> Let me first confirm terbinafine's core profile. Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase, and its labeled uses are for dermatophyte infections such as tinea corporis and tinea cruris, and for onychomycosis; some product listings also include tinea versicolor, but I should be careful to anchor on the specific SPL/FDA source at hand rather than assumptions from memory [^112VL6ed] [^1121YbzD] [^113iuy4i] [^116Qiotq]. Wait, let me verify vaginal candidiasis on the label; there is no FDA approval for VVC anywhere on the terbinafine labeling, which immediately raises concern for off-label use without supportive evidence [^112VL6ed].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about Candida coverage. The FDA label notes in vitro activity against Candida albicans with satisfactory MICs, but explicitly states that safety and efficacy for clinical Candida infections have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials, which is a key caution against extrapolating laboratory susceptibility to clinical effectiveness [^112VL6ed]. I should double-check that there are no clinical VVC trials with terbinafine in the provided dossier; I do not see any, reinforcing that there is no efficacy basis for VVC treatment with terbinafine here [^112VL6ed].

> Next, I should review guidelines so I don't rely on inference. The IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline recommends topical azoles as first-line therapy for uncomplicated VVC and recognizes oral fluconazole 150 mg once as an alternative, with severe disease treated by fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses and recurrent VVC by an induction course followed by weekly fluconazole suppressive therapy for 6 months [^112xeTif] [^114ovmXp] [^116Uyo2q] [^116WHsAp]. The CDC 2021 STI guideline lists butoconazole, terconazole, and oral fluconazole as standard options, while the IUSTI/WHO 2018 guideline supports a single-dose azole (oral or vaginal) for uncomplicated VVC, and none of these guidelines include terbinafine for VVC treatment [^117AmTxu] [^113FU8WY].

> I will now examine the interventional evidence base to ensure I am not overlooking data. The clinical trials in VVC across the documents evaluate azoles such as terconazole, butoconazole, and tioconazole, and newer oral agents like ibrexafungerp and oteseconazole, but there are no evaluated VVC trials for terbinafine in the provided sources, which aligns with the label caveat regarding absent clinical evidence for Candida infections [^113nmAKN] [^117CGxrx] [^1114K48s] [^1159iYMd] [^112VL6ed]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup or refractory context mentions terbinafine; I do not find such indications or trials, so the evidence gap remains [^112VL6ed].

> But wait, what if the causative pathogen profile influences drug choice. VVC is predominantly due to Candida albicans in roughly 85–95% of cases, and established therapies target ergosterol pathway enzymes effectively utilized against Candida species, whereas terbinafine's clinical strengths are against dermatophytes rather than Candida in vivo, and azole class agents inhibit lanosterol demethylase, a Candida-relevant target leveraged by both established and emerging VVC therapies [^112rc4Hd] [^114FNcZs] [^114i4yKR] [^112VL6ed]. I should confirm there is no niche where terbinafine is preferred for Candida vaginitis; there is none recommended by major guidelines or supported by trials here [^112xeTif] [^117AmTxu] [^113FU8WY].

> I need to ensure safety considerations do not mistakenly favor terbinafine for VVC. Oral terbinafine has hepatic metabolism and a nontrivial adverse effect profile, including gastrointestinal effects and transaminase elevations, and there is limited pregnancy safety experience; using a systemic agent without proven benefit in VVC would expose patients to risk without expected gain, which is not defensible when established, safer, and effective local or systemic options exist for this indication [^116jzyqW] [^114b9MYN]. Hold on, I should verify whether topical terbinafine could be used intravaginally; there is no guideline or labeling support for intravaginal terbinafine products for VVC here [^112VL6ed] [^117AmTxu].

> Synthesizing this, a prescription for terbinafine is not appropriate for vaginal candidiasis because it lacks FDA approval for VVC, has no supportive clinical trial evidence in this condition, and is not recommended by IDSA, CDC, or IUSTI/WHO guidelines, which collectively direct clinicians toward azoles or newer Candida‑active agents with established efficacy and safety for VVC [^112VL6ed] [^112xeTif] [^117AmTxu] [^113FU8WY]. Let me double-check that no exceptional scenario is suggested; I find none in the provided references that would justify terbinafine for VVC [^112xeTif] [^117AmTxu].

> Now, I should outline evidence-based alternatives. For uncomplicated VVC, options include topical azoles or fluconazole 150 mg orally once, with severe acute VVC treated with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 2–3 doses, and recurrent VVC managed with induction therapy followed by fluconazole 150 mg weekly for 6 months, all consistent with IDSA and CDC guidance and FDA labeling for fluconazole [^114ovmXp] [^116Uyo2q] [^116WHsAp] [^117AmTxu] [^1148SBmz] [^1119xY3U]. For azole-resistant or intolerant cases, ibrexafungerp is FDA‑approved for VVC and reduction in RVVC, with phase 3 data showing higher clinical cure and mycological eradication versus placebo, and oteseconazole is approved for RVVC prevention with supportive phase 3 evidence, providing non‑azole or selective azole alternatives where appropriate [^112FXk7N] [^112zwvtH] [^112e7Ymv] [^1159iYMd].

> I will now examine management of special scenarios. In suspected Candida glabrata vulvovaginitis unresponsive to oral azoles, intravaginal boric acid for 14 days is a guideline‑supported alternative, though counseling on proper use and avoidance in pregnancy is essential due to toxicity risk if ingested, and this remains a niche option within expert guidance rather than first‑line therapy [^114MYugG]. Also, amphotericin B is explicitly not indicated for noninvasive infections such as vaginal candidiasis in immunocompetent patients, so it should not be used for routine VVC management despite potent systemic antifungal activity [^113VGXzd].

> Let me not forget diagnostic stewardship and pregnancy. Many women who self-treat presumed "yeast infections" do not actually have VVC, so confirming the diagnosis improves outcomes and avoids misuse of antifungals, and in pregnancy, topical azoles are preferred and better studied than systemic alternatives for symptomatic infection, further underscoring that terbinafine has no role here based on the available evidence and labeling [^112bg4hH] [^112Ky6Pn]. I should confirm guidelines emphasize microscopy or culture when uncertainty exists; IUSTI/WHO recommends microscopy as the best test when needed, which aligns with careful diagnostic confirmation rather than empiric off‑label therapy [^114nfuvL].

> In conclusion, I should reiterate the clinical bottom line. Terbinafine should not be prescribed for vaginal candidiasis given lack of approval, absence of clinical efficacy data in VVC, and no guideline endorsement, while proven therapies include topical azoles and oral fluconazole for acute disease, ibrexafungerp as a non‑azole oral option, oteseconazole for RVVC prevention, and boric acid intravaginal therapy for selected non‑albicans or azole-refractory cases, all aligned with high‑quality guideline and regulatory sources [^112VL6ed] [^112xeTif] [^117AmTxu] [^112FXk7N] [^1159iYMd] [^114MYugG]. If candidiasis is suspected, I need to ensure diagnosis is confirmed and therapy tailored to severity, species, pregnancy status, and recurrence pattern rather than defaulting to an agent without evidence for this indication [^114nfuvL] [^116Uyo2q] [^116WHsAp].

Terbinafine is **not recommended for vaginal candidiasis** because it lacks clinical efficacy against Candida species [^112VL6ed] and is not included in clinical guidelines for this indication [^112xeTif]. Standard therapy is a single 150 mg oral dose of **fluconazole** [^1148SBmz] or a **topical azole** [^113FU8WY]; **terbinafine should not be prescribed for vaginal candidiasis**.

---

## Pharmacological properties of terbinafine

Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase, disrupting ergosterol synthesis and leading to fungal cell death via squalene accumulation [^112VL6ed]. It is fungicidal against dermatophytes (e.g. Trichophyton spp.) and has **limited activity against Candida species** [^112VL6ed].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding terbinafine and candida species

Although terbinafine shows some in vitro activity against Candida albicans [^112VL6ed], **clinical efficacy for Candida infections, including vaginal candidiasis, is not established**. No adequate clinical trials support its use for vaginal candidiasis, and no clinical guidelines recommend it [^117AmTxu] [^114ovmXp].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for vaginal candidiasis

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) **recommend azole antifungals as first-line therapy** for vaginal candidiasis [^117AmTxu], including **Fluconazole** 150 mg orally as a single dose [^114ovmXp] [^1148SBmz] and **Topical azoles** such as clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, or butoconazole [^112xeTif], whereas terbinafine is **not mentioned or recommended** in these guidelines.

---

## Clinical studies evaluating terbinafine for vaginal candidiasis

No published clinical studies or randomized controlled trials evaluate terbinafine for vaginal candidiasis, and its use for this indication is **unsupported by clinical evidence**.

---

## Safety profile and potential side effects

Terbinafine is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash, and elevated liver enzymes [^116jzyqW]. Rare serious adverse effects include hepatotoxicity and severe skin reactions. These risks are **unjustified given the lack of efficacy** for vaginal candidiasis.

---

## Alternative antifungal treatments

Effective alternatives for vaginal candidiasis include:

- **Fluconazole**: 150 mg orally, single dose [^114ovmXp] [^1148SBmz].
- **Topical azoles**: clotrimazole, miconazole, terconazole, butoconazole [^112xeTif] [^117AmTxu].
- **Ibrexafungerp**: a novel oral antifungal for acute and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112FXk7N] [^112zwvtH].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Terbinafine is **not recommended for vaginal candidiasis** because it lacks clinical evidence and guideline support [^112xeTif]. Azole antifungals remain the standard of care; terbinafine should not be prescribed for this indication.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^112VL6ed]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, by inhibiting the squalene epoxidase enzyme. This inhibition results in fungal cell death, primarily due to increased membrane permeability mediated by the accumulation of high concentrations of squalene, rather than due to ergosterol deficiency. Depending on the concentration of the drug and the fungal species tested in vitro, terbinafine hydrochloride may be fungicidal. However, the clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown.

- **Active strains**: Terbinafine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections:
	- Trichophyton mentagrophytes
	- Trichophyton rubrum

- **In vitro data**: The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. In vitro, terbinafine exhibits satisfactory minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against most strains of the following microorganisms. However, the safety and efficacy of terbinafine in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:
	- Candida albicans
	- Epidermophyton floccosum
	- Scopulariopsis brevicaulis

- **Methods: Study design and patients**: Enrolled patients were ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of symptomatic moderate-to-severe acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) determined by a vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) score of ≥ 7. Other eligibility criteria included a positive microscopic examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a vaginal sample revealing yeast forms (hyphae/pseudohyphae) or budding yeasts and a vaginal pH of ≤ 4.5.

Exclusion criteria included patients with any vaginal condition that would interfere with the diagnosis and evaluation of VVC, such as suspected or confirmed causes of vulvovaginitis and/or cervicitis including bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas, active herpes virus or human papillomavirus infection, positive tests for Neisseria gonorrheae or Chlamydia trachomatis, or other mixed infections; the use of antifungal treatments (topical or systemic) within 28 days of the baseline visit; vaginal contraceptives; use of CYP3A4/3A5 inducers and strong time-dependent CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors 14 days before enrollment and during treatment; strong or moderate reversible CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors including azoles or grapefruit juice 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment; select CYP2C8 substrates (i.e. amiodarone, amodiaquine, paclitaxel, repaglinide, montelukast, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone) within 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment; or select P-gp substrates (i.e. digoxin, colchicine) 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment. Patients menstruating at the baseline visit, patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, or active cervical or vaginal cancer were also excluded.

### Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112bg4hH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate what proportion of symptomatic women purchasing over-the-counter antifungal products for immediate treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis actually have vulvovaginal candidiasis or other genitourinary conditions.

- **Methods**: A time-location sample of 95 symptomatic women who purchased and presented with an over-the-counter antifungal product for immediate and personal treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis were evaluated by clinical examination and pertinent laboratory tests. The percentage of women diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis or other conditions was assessed. Comparisons were made between groups with and without a prior diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis, and groups that read or did not read the over-the-counter package label.

- **Results**: The actual diagnoses for women who self-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis were as follows: vulvovaginal candidiasis 33.7%, bacterial vaginosis 18.9%, mixed vaginitis 21.1%, normal 13.7%, other diagnoses 10.5%, and trichomonas vaginitis 2.1%. Women with a previous clinically based diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis were not more accurate in diagnosing vulvovaginal candidiasis than women without a prior clinical diagnosis (chi(2) = 0.27, P = .6). Women who read the package label were no more likely to have vulvovaginal candidiasis than women who did not read the label (Fisher's exact test, P = .39).

- **Conclusion**: Many women who self-diagnose and use an over-the-counter product for the treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis do not have vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### Amphotericin B [^113VGXzd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Amphotericin B for Injection USP should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, potentially life-threatening fungal infections. This potent drug should not be used to treat noninvasive fungal infections, such as oral thrush, vaginal candidiasis, and esophageal candidiasis in patients with normal neutrophil counts.

Amphotericin B for Injection USP is specifically intended to treat potentially life-threatening fungal infections such as aspergillosis, cryptococcosis (torulosis), North American blastomycosis, systemic candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and zygomycosis, including mucormycosis due to susceptible species of the genera Absidia, Mucor, and Rhizopus. It is also effective against infections due to related susceptible species of Conidiobolus and Basidiobolus, as well as sporotrichosis.

Amphotericin B may be useful in the treatment of American mucocutaneous leishmaniasis; however, it is not the drug of choice as primary therapy.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women, with no comprehensive systematic review of treatments having been published. The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. A secondary objective was to evaluate patient preference for treatment options.

- **Search methods**: We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, with the search date set on 6 October 2021. We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of these trials, along with experts in RVVC and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments over at least six months in women experiencing four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or those taking immunosuppressant medication but included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. A diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by the presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies, along with partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- Number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy)
- Proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period
- Adverse events

### A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered VT-1161 in the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^114i4yKR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Lanosterol demethylase is an enzyme essential for fungal growth. It catalyzes an early step in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, a sterol required for fungal cell membrane formation and integrity. This enzyme is the molecular target of the class of drugs referred to as "azole antifungals". VT-1161 is a novel, oral, selective inhibitor of fungal lanosterol demethylase and is being developed for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Objective**: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of four dosing regimens of oral VT-1161 compared with placebo in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as at least three symptomatic episodes of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis within a 12-month period.

- **Study design**: Two hundred fifteen women with a documented history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, who at screening were experiencing an episode of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms score of ≥ 3 and a positive potassium hydroxide test for yeast), were enrolled. After treating the acute infection with fluconazole, subjects were randomly assigned to one of five treatment regimens:

1. VT-1161 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly for 11 weeks, followed by a once-weekly dose of placebo for 12 weeks.
2. VT-1161 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly for 11 weeks, followed by a once-weekly dose of placebo for 12 weeks.
3. VT-1161 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly for 23 weeks.
4. VT-116…

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^117VaVXP]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). High credibility.

A total of 376 patients from the United States were randomly assigned to receive ibrexafungerp (n = 249) or placebo (n = 127) in the VANISH 303 study; of these, 286 patients were included in the mITT population (ibrexafungerp, n = 188; placebo, n = 98). In the VANISH 306 study, 449 patients from Bulgaria or the United States were randomly assigned to receive ibrexafungerp (n = 298) or placebo (n = 151); of these, 272 patients were included in the mITT population (ibrexafungerp, n = 188; placebo, n = 84). The pooled mITT population included 376 patients who received ibrexafungerp and 182 patients who received placebo. The pooled safety population included 545 patients who received ibrexafungerp and 275 who received placebo.

- **Patient disposition**: Five patients experienced a TEAE not related to ibrexafungerp that led to study discontinuation (bacterial vaginosis, n = 4; diabetes mellitus, n = 1). mITT, modified intention to treat; TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event.

Demographics and baseline characteristics of the mITT population are presented. Overall, baseline characteristics of the ibrexafungerp and placebo groups were well balanced. Fewer than 8% of patients in each treatment group had diabetes mellitus, and over 90% of patients had a baseline severity score of ≥ 7. All patients had a positive culture for at least one Candida species at baseline, with over 85% of patients testing positive for Candida albicans in both treatment groups. Similar baseline severity scores were observed.

### Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of oteseconazole in the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infections [^1159iYMd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis affects nearly 138 million women globally each year. In the United States, fluconazole is considered the standard of care for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. However, until recently, there was no US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. Oteseconazole is a novel oral selective inhibitor of fungal lanosterol demethylase (sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450, an enzyme required for fungal growth) approved for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Objective**: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral oteseconazole (VT-1161) in the prevention of culture-verified acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes through 50 weeks in participants with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and to compare the efficacy of oteseconazole and fluconazole in the treatment of the presenting acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episode.

- **Study design**: Women and postmenarcheal girls aged ≥ 12 years with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (N = 219) were enrolled at 38 US sites. Eligible participants presenting with an active vulvovaginal candidiasis infection entered an induction phase in which they were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive 600 mg oral oteseconazole on day 1 and 450 mg on day 2, with matching placebo capsules. Alternatively, they received three sequential 150-mg oral doses (once every 72 hours) of fluconazole, with matching placebo capsules. Following the 2-week induction phase, the 185 participants with resolved acute vulvovaginal candidiasis infection…

### Executive summary: Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114qefkc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) remains a challenge to manage in clinical practice. Recent epidemiologic studies indicate that non-albicans Candida spp. are more resistant to conventional antifungal treatment with azoles and are considered causative pathogens of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed and Scopus for studies that reported clinical evidence on the intravaginal use of boric acid for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Results**: We identified 14 studies (2 randomized clinical trials [RCTs], 9 case series, and 4 case reports) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Boric acid was compared with nystatin, terconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, buconazole, and miconazole. As monotherapy, boric acid was studied in 7 studies. The mycologic cure rates varied from 40% to 100% in patients treated with boric acid; 4 of the 9 included case series reported statistically significant outcomes regarding cure (both mycologic and clinical) rates. None of the included studies reported statistically significant differences in recurrence rates. Regarding the adverse effects caused by boric acid use, vaginal burning sensation (< 10% of cases), water discharge during treatment, and vaginal erythema were identified in 7 studies.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that boric acid is a safe, alternative, economic option for women with recurrent and chronic symptoms of vaginitis when conventional treatment fails because of the involvement of non-albicans Candida spp. or azole-resistant strains.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112dYcBx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Efficacy measurements included the collection of clinical signs (erythema, edema, excoriation) and symptoms (itching, burning, irritation) of vulvovaginitis using a scoring scale of 0–3 (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for each sign or symptom, resulting in a total severity score of 0–18. Additionally, a KOH wet mount test and vaginal fungal culture were performed at each visit.

- **Primary efficacy outcome**: The proportion of participants with therapeutic cure, defined as both clinical and mycological cure, at the TOC day 28 visit. Mycological cure was defined as a negative fungal culture for Candida species. Clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of signs and symptoms related to VVC, or any new sign or symptom observed at the TOC visit determined by the investigator not to be related to VVC.

- **Secondary efficacy outcome measures**: The proportion of participants with the following:
	- Clinical cure at day 28.
	- Mycological cure at days 7, 14, and 28.
	- Clinical improvement, where every individual VVC sign and symptom score that was 0, 1, or 2 at baseline was a score of 0 at day 28, and scores of 3 at baseline were scores of 0 or 1 at day 28.
	- Clinical relapse, defined as clinical cure at day 28 with signs and symptoms total severity score > 0 at day 84 or day 168.
	- Mycological reinfection or recurrence, defined as a negative fungal culture at day 28 and a positive fungal culture for Candida species at day 84 or day 168.
	- Modified clinical cure, defined as a total VVC severity score of ≤ 1 at day 28.
	- Modified therapeutic cure, defined as both modified clinical cure and mycological cure at day 28.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112yR1jK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Based on patient convenience, efficacy, and safety data in this study, ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day was the dosage selected for further evaluation in phase 3 studies. Our study suggested comparable clinical cure rates between ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day and fluconazole at TOC. In this phase 2 study, we found it encouraging that certain parameters, such as improved and sustained VSS scores, mycological eradication at day 25, and the need for rescue medication appeared to be improved with ibrexafungerp compared with fluconazole. Because our study was not statistically powered, these initial findings will need further study to see if the observed differences are meaningful.

In 2019, the FDA provided pharmaceutical industry guidance for drug development in the treatment of VVC and recommended clinical cure, defined as the complete absence of all VSS, as the primary efficacy endpoint. In our study, a clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of VSS (VSS score = 0) by the TOC visit without the need for further antifungal treatment. Mycological eradication was not a primary endpoint, as Candida is normally found in the vagina. Given variations in efficacy outcome definitions in previous studies of VVC, historical comparisons are difficult. However, some previous studies have reported a decreased sustained response with azole treatment from day 14 to day 35. In comparison, the percentage of patients receiving ibrexafungerp with no VSS increased from 51.9% at TOC to 70.4% at day 25 in our study, suggesting continued improvement and sustained effectiveness.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^11262HXR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

At screening, 41 isolated cultures (89%) were Candida albicans, 9 isolated cultures (7%) were Candida parapsilosis, 1 culture (2%) was Candida tropicalis, and 1 culture (2%) was Candida lusitanea. Candida glabrata was isolated from a single participant while on-study. Based on the MIC susceptibility results, VT-1161 was shown to have potent activity against the Candida strains obtained in the study. When all 60 Candida spp. isolates collected throughout the study were considered, the MIC ranges for VT-1161 and fluconazole were < 0.001–1.0 and < 0.125–64 µg/mL, respectively. The MIC 50 (defined as the minimum concentration to inhibit 50% of the strains tested) was 0.002 µg/mL for VT-1161 and 0.25 µg/mL for fluconazole, whereas the MIC 90 (defined as the minimum concentration to inhibit 90% of the strains tested) was 0.004 µg/mL for VT-1161 and 1.0 µg/mL for fluconazole. Overall, the VT-1161 MIC values were approximately 100-fold lower than those of fluconazole. Importantly, the MIC of VT-1161 against the fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata was 64-fold lower than the fluconazole MIC.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The median t max of VT-1161 was 4.0 hours (range, 3.1–5.0) and 5.5 hours (range, 4.0–8.0) for the 300- and 600-mg doses, respectively. On day 1, C max was 407 ng/mL for the 300-mg dose and 968 ng/mL for the 600-mg dose. The AUC (0–8) values on day 1 averaged 1870 and 4230 hours × ng/mL for the 300- and 600-mg doses, respectively.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113nmqLE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for invasive candidiasis, particularly with respect to antifungal therapy, the IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend administering fluconazole IV or PO, 800 mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, followed by 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily as an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin. This is suggested as initial therapy in selected patients with invasive candidiasis, including non-critically ill patients and those unlikely to have a fluconazole-resistant Candida species.

### Candidiasis (vulvovaginal) [^114FNcZs]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis, with Candida albicans accounting for 85–90% of cases.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aiming to answer several clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, as well as alternative or complementary treatments, for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of drug treatments, as well as alternative or complementary treatments, for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in cases of symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? Lastly, what are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other significant databases up to October 2006. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. Relevant harms alerts from organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) were included.

- **Results**: We identified 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. A GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions was performed.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, the evaluation of existing research provides crucial insights into treatment strategies for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^1114K48s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral non-azole treatment options available for patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). This absence negatively impacts VVC treatment options for patients with azole-resistant organisms, those not responding to or not tolerating fluconazole, or for whom its use is contraindicated. New agents should ideally have broader fungal coverage, minimal adverse effects, no risk of fetal harm, and limited drug-to-drug interactions.

Ibrexafungerp (formerly SCY-078) is a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal. Similar to the echinocandins, its mechanism of action targets the glucan synthase enzyme, resulting in decreased (1,3)-β-D-glucan polymers, which weakens the fungal cell wall leading to fungal cell lysis and death. Due to its unique structure, ibrexafungerp binds to a site on glucan synthase that only partially overlaps with the echinocandin binding site. As a non-azole antifungal, ibrexafungerp exerts broad-spectrum activity against an extensive range of Candida isolates, including many with fks1 and fks2 point mutations that cause echinocandin resistance among C. glabrata and Candida auris. Because glucan synthase is uniquely found in fungal cell walls and not human cells, there is less chance of off-target effects (e.g. cytochrome P450 interactions) as observed with azole treatments.

### Diflucan [^1148SBmz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dosage of Diflucan for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

- **Multiple dose**: Since oral absorption is rapid and almost complete, the daily dose of Diflucan (fluconazole) is the same for oral (tablets and suspension) and intravenous administration. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to achieve plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy. The daily dose for infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided, as an inadequate treatment period may lead to a recurrence. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

- **Oropharyngeal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage of Diflucan for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least two weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

- **Esophageal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage of Diflucan for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg per day may be used based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy.

### Cd101 topical compared with oral fluconazole for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis: A randomized controlled trial [^1132axxq]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is an infection of the vagina's mucous membranes, caused by Candida albicans in more than 90% of acute VVC. Several topical and oral azole agents are available in a variety of formulations, and all seem to have similar effectiveness. Azoles are fungistatic, meaning that the fungi are inhibited from growth or replication but are not eradicated. Reinfection and developing azole resistance demonstrate a significant need for alternative treatments.

- **Materials and methods**: One hundred twenty-six women were randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment cohorts: CD101 3% gel (n = 50) applied intravaginally on days 1 and 2, CD101 6% ointment (n = 50) applied intravaginally on day 1, or oral fluconazole 150 mg (n = 26) on day 1. Primary outcomes of clinical and mycological cure, as demonstrated by changes in the vaginal scores and mycological culture, were assessed on day 7 (± 2 days), day 14 (± 2 days), and day 28 (± 7 days). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events.

- **Results**: Ninety-nine women with positive Candida culture remained in the modified intent-to-treat population with 40 in each CD101 arm and 19 in the fluconazole arm. In the CD101 gel, CD101 ointment, and oral fluconazole groups, 35%, 30%, and 52.6% demonstrated clinical cure and 45%, 40%, and 57.9% had mycological cure at day 28, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: CD101 3% gel and CD101 6% ointment were well tolerated and produced similar rates of clinical and mycological cure in patients with an acute, moderate-to-severe episode of VVC. However, the cure rates remain a consideration for further research.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^116ghHAD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019, together with reference checking and citation searching.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials published in any language, comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding, or diabetic.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2), Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1), and one trial across multiple European countries.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^116DbBPA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Between August 2017 and May 2018, 293 patients were screened for eligibility, and 186 were enrolled and randomized into one of six treatment groups. A total of 153 patients had a confirmed culture for yeast at baseline and were included in the mITT population. All patients included in the mITT population had moderate to severe VVC with VSS scores ranging from 7.0 to 16.0.

Based on patient convenience with one-day dosing, and our results demonstrating an increase in gastrointestinal treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with larger doses without a corresponding increase in efficacy, ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for one day was selected as the dose in phase 3 studies. Therefore, results reported here will be limited to ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for one day and fluconazole. A total of 62 patients were enrolled in these two treatment groups (ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for one day, n = 30; fluconazole, n = 32); 51 patients were included in the mITT population (ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for one day, n = 27; fluconazole, n = 24). Results for the other treatment groups are provided in the supplement. Overall, there were no differences between treatment groups for baseline characteristics.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112bWNDD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy outcome, therapeutic cure at day 28, was observed in the majority of participants across all treatment groups. Secondary outcome analyses showed results similar to the primary efficacy outcome. Generally, there was no statistical difference between VT-1161 and fluconazole treatment groups; however, the study was not prospectively powered for the primary endpoint, and sample sizes were small.

While the preliminary study did not differentiate between acute or recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (reVVC) participants, requiring only an acute episode at presentation, analyses at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits found no indication of mycological recurrence in the VT-1161 groups. In contrast, 29% and 46% of participants in the fluconazole group experienced mycological recurrence at 3 and 6 months, respectively. During the 6-month trial, a higher percentage of fluconazole-treated participants reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) compared to VT-1161–treated participants.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: A phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112zwvtH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is largely limited to azole therapy. Ibrexafungerp is a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal with broad-spectrum anti-Candida fungicidal activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrexafungerp compared with placebo in patients with acute VVC.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive ibrexafungerp (300 mg twice for 1 day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms [VSS] = 0) at test-of-cure (day 11 ± 3). Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with mycological eradication, overall success (clinical cure and mycological eradication), clinical improvement (VSS ≤ 1) at test-of-cure, and symptom resolution at follow-up (day 25 ± 4).

- **Results**: Patients receiving ibrexafungerp had significantly higher rates of clinical cure (50.5% [95/188] vs. 28.6% [28/98]; p = 0.001), mycological eradication (49.5% [93/188] vs. 19.4% [19/98]; p = 0.005), and overall success. The results demonstrated higher clinical improvement and symptom resolution rates in patients above age 35 (54.5% [24/44] and 68.2% [30/44], respectively) compared with overall rates.

This study indicates that ibrexafungerp may provide a superior treatment option for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis compared to traditional azole therapies. The outcomes suggest promising results for increased rates of clinical cure and mycological eradication, particularly significant in older age demographics.

### Topical treatment for vaginal candidiasis (thrush) in pregnancy [^112Ky6Pn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Vaginal candidiasis (moniliasis or thrush) is a common and frequently distressing infection for many women, and it is even more common during pregnancy. There is no evidence that thrush in pregnancy is harmful to the baby.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of different methods of treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register was searched. In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR) was searched, with the last search conducted in March 2001.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of any treatment for vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Ten trials were included. Based on five trials, imidazole drugs were more effective than nystatin when treating vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.29). Nystatin was as effective as hydrargaphen in one trial (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.05–1.84). A trial of clotrimazole showed it to be more effective than a placebo (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.31). Single-dose treatment was no more or less effective than three or four days of treatment. However, two trials involving 81 women showed that treatment lasting for four days was less effective than treatment for seven days (odds ratio 11.7, 95% confidence interval 4.21 to 29.15). Based on two trials, treatment for seven days was no more or less effective than treatment for 14 days (odds ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval not fully provided).

### Diflucan [^1119xY3U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Diflucan (fluconazole) is indicated for the treatment of several fungal infections:

- **Vaginal candidiasis**: Vaginal yeast infections due to Candida.
- **Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis**: Open, noncomparative studies with relatively small numbers of patients have shown Diflucan to be effective for Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections, including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
- **Cryptococcal meningitis**: Before prescribing Diflucan for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please refer to the clinical studies section. Studies comparing Diflucan to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

- **Prophylaxis**: Diflucan is also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be initiated before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^115P15ZQ]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). High credibility.

VVC is a common infection that negatively impacts the quality of life of affected women and is associated with meaningful direct and indirect costs. After more than 20 years without new treatment choices, women and their health care providers now have a new oral therapeutic option. Ibrexafungerp, a first-in-class nonazole triterpenoid, provides a new safe and effective oral treatment for VVC with the convenience of 1-day dosing. This pooled analysis strengthens and confirms the efficacy and safety data presented in VANISH 303 and VANISH 306.

Patient subgroup analyses suggest that race, BMI, baseline VSS scores, and C. albicans infections do not adversely affect ibrexafungerp efficacy, thereby making ibrexafungerp an appropriate therapy for patients with acute VVC. Unlike azole treatments for patients with severe VVC (VSS score ≥ 7) at baseline, which usually require more than one day of therapy, ibrexafungerp provides significant clinical cure rates with just one day of treatment.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^117PidSY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis affects approximately 75% of women in their lifetime. Approved treatment options are limited to oral or topical azoles. Ibrexafungerp, a novel, first-in-class oral triterpenoid glucan synthase inhibitor, has demonstrated broad fungicidal Candida activity and a favorable tolerability profile. The primary objective of this dose-finding study was to identify the optimal dose of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Methods**: Patients with vulvovaginal signs and symptoms score ≥ 7 were randomized equally into six treatment groups: five treatment doses of oral ibrexafungerp or oral fluconazole 150 mg. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms) at the test-of-cure visit (day 10).

- **Results**: Overall, 186 patients were randomized into the six treatment groups. Results, using the modified intent-to-treat population (baseline positive culture), are reported for ibrexafungerp 300 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 day (n = 27), which was the dose selected for phase 3 studies, and fluconazole 150 mg for 1 day (n = 24). At day 10, the clinical cure rates for ibrexafungerp and fluconazole were 51.9% and 58.3%, respectively; at day 25, patients with no signs or symptoms were 70.4% and 50.0%, respectively. During the study, ibrexafungerp patients required less antifungal rescue medications compared with fluconazole (3.7% vs 29.2%, respectively). Ibrexafungerp was well tolerated, with the most common treatment-related adverse events being mild gastrointestinal issues.

### Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113kzSD8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Frequently ignored by the medical community, chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are relatively common and can be frustrating for both patients and physicians. Establishing a proper diagnosis will lay the foundation for an effective therapeutic plan. Fungal cultures are an important component of the work-up.

- **Common causes**: The most common causes of chronic vaginal symptoms are recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, and irritant dermatitis. In patients with RVVC caused by Candida albicans, host factors may play an important role. Long-term oral antifungal therapy can break the pattern of recurrence in many patients. Infections caused by other species of yeast may be more resistant to standard treatment approaches.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^115p8mCR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The study population consisted of healthy, nonpregnant female participants aged 18 to 64 years with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Participants had a positive baseline potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount from a vaginal smear, revealing filamentous hyphae/pseudohyphae or budding yeast cells. Additionally, they exhibited at least one vulvovaginal sign and symptom, along with a composite severity score of 6 or greater.

Vaginal swabs were obtained at the screening visit and at subsequent study visits. Candida species were characterized and stored frozen for susceptibility testing at study completion. Inclusion criteria required participants to present with a clinical diagnosis of acute VVC without differentiation between acute and recurrent VVC.

Participants did not have any clinically significant major organ system disease or infection (except for VVC) and were not taking medications that would interfere with study assessments. They completed a review of pertinent medical history, vital signs, and body measurements; underwent a symptom/sign evaluation, physical examination including a speculum examination of the vagina; and had a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear.

### Probiotics for oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis: A review [^116wHzU6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Dermatologists commonly prescribe medications such as antibiotics and corticosteroids that can increase the risk for candidiasis. Though conventional antifungals are often effective against candidiasis, they are not without side effects, and species of Candida are gaining resistance. Probiotics help treat conditions such as post-antibiotic diarrhea and infectious diarrhea, and thus have the potential to help with Candida infections as well.

For this reason, we provide an overview of therapies prescribed in dermatology that may increase the risk for candidiasis, and we review the literature on whether probiotics are useful in the treatment and prevention of oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis to help dermatologists treating the condition be better informed about their supplemental use with conventional antifungals.

### New antifungals for vulvovaginal candidiasis: What is their role [^111JCUg5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

New antifungals, ibrexafungerp and oteseconazole, are now available for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Both have novel antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties and offer advantages over fluconazole, although comparative trials have involved only placebo. In the absence of allergy, intolerance, and resistance, it is unclear whether these antifungals will replace fluconazole.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: A phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112rc4Hd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common cause of vaginitis and is attributed to infection caused by Candida albicans in 85%–95% of women. Fifty percent of all women will experience at least one episode of VVC by 25 years of age, and approximately 75% will experience a VVC episode in their lifetime, with two or more episodes occurring in 40%–45% of women. Comorbid conditions, including uncontrolled diabetes, genetic predisposition, immunocompromising conditions, and medications (e.g. antibiotics), have been linked to VVC. The wide availability of over-the-counter therapies often results in patient self-treatment instead of seeking professional care, causing the incidence of VVC to be grossly underreported.

Historically, VVC treatments have predominantly been limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents. Routine treatments include topical azole formulations, which may be used for up to a week, or oral fluconazole given as a 150-mg single dose. These treatments have limitations, such as possible intolerance to topical formulations, idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity with fluconazole, and the risk of fetal harm if fluconazole is taken during pregnancy. Due to the lack of approved non-azole therapies, treatment options for VVC have been constrained in cases of azole-resistant organisms or for patients intolerant to azoles or where their use is contraindicated. New oral treatments are needed, especially those with broad fungal coverage, a good safety profile (particularly with no risk of fetal harm), and limited drug-drug interactions.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^115Zj77E]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Patients were randomized in equal allocations (at a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of six treatment groups: oral ibrexafungerp at doses of 750 mg on day 1; 300 mg BID for 1 day; 450 mg BID for 1 day; 150 mg BID on days 1–3; 300 mg BID on days 1–3; or fluconazole 150 mg on day 1. Randomization was completed electronically through an interactive web response system. Fluconazole capsules were encapsulated to maintain treatment blinding. All randomized patients received matching ibrexafungerp placebo tablets and/or matching fluconazole placebo capsules based on treatment assignment, in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion. Both active and placebo ibrexafungerp tablets were manufactured by Corealis Pharma; fluconazole active tablets were manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals and encapsulated by Corealis Pharma for blinding purposes. All site and sponsor personnel were blinded to treatment assignment except for a sponsor representative who was involved in safety assessments.

- **Study assessments**: Vulvovaginal samples for 10% KOH microscopic assessment (assessed locally) and fungal culture (assessed by a central laboratory) were collected at baseline, test-of-cure (TOC, day 10), and follow-up (day 25) visits. Susceptibility testing was performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A3 guidelines for all cultures positive for Candida species. A vulvovaginal sample was also assessed at baseline for pH and other pathogens (e.g. bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, N. gonorrheae, C. trachomatis). VSS were assessed using a standardized, predefined scale for which each sign.

Despite therapeutic advances, vulvovaginal candidosis remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society. Understanding of anti-candida host defense mechanisms in the vagina has developed slowly and, despite a growing list of recognized risk factors, a fundamental grasp of pathogenic mechanisms continues to elude us. The absence of rapid, simple, and inexpensive diagnostic tests continues to result in both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of vulvovaginal candidosis. The review explores the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this infection and discusses management strategies.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^116hjfo3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is common among women, but azole antifungal treatments are often associated with safety and resistance issues. VT-1161 (oteseconazole) is an oral agent with increased selectivity for fungal CYP51. In this phase 2 clinical study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of VT-1161 vs. fluconazole in participants with moderate to severe acute VVC.

- **Methods**: Participants presenting with an acute episode of VVC (n = 55) were randomized to receive VT-1161 300 mg once daily (q.d.) for 3 days, 600 mg q.d. for 3 days, or 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 days, or to receive a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg (FDA-approved dose to treat acute VVC). Participants were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with a therapeutic (clinical and mycological) cure at day 28.

- **Results**: A larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (78.6%) groups vs. the fluconazole group (62.5%); differences were not statistically significant. At 3 and 6 months, no participants in the VT-1161 groups vs. 28.5% and 46.1% in the fluconazole group, respectively, had evidence of mycological recurrence. No serious adverse events or treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of participants across all treatment groups achieved therapeutic cure at day 28. VT-1161 was well tolerated at all dose levels through 6 months of follow-up.

Regarding the use of terbinafine hydrochloride PO (also known as Lamisil AT) in patients with eGFR 20–50 mL/min/1.73 m², the maximal dose is 250 mg and should not exceed a frequency of q48h. For individuals with CrCl of 50 mL/minute or less, the use of oral terbinafine has not been adequately studied, as oral terbinafine clearance is reduced by approximately 50% compared to normal volunteers.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112a7NfN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Currently, women with uncomplicated acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) are treated with single-dose or short-course treatments. Those with complicated, resistant, or recurring VVC (up to 20% of women) require therapy for ≥ 5–7 days and possibly maintenance therapy. Topical agents are limited by local side effects, especially burning, and are messy to apply. Therefore, most women prefer oral regimens. Systemically administered available azoles, such as fluconazole, can exhibit toxicity and drug-drug interaction (DDI) issues and come with reproductive warnings. Furthermore, resistance surveillance studies have found that azole therapies can have poor activity against C. glabrata, and cross-resistance among azole antifungal agents has been observed.

In a previous study that compared a 6-month weekly maintenance fluconazole regimen to placebo in patients with recurrent VVC (reVVC), the percentage of fluconazole-treated patients who had a recurrence (defined as a clinical severity score of ≥ 3 and vaginal culture positive for yeast) at the 6-month end of the maintenance phase visit was 9%. At the 9-month and 12-month observation phase visits, this percentage increased to 27% and 57%, respectively. This trend of increasing recurrence rates in the 6 months following fluconazole treatment is similar to the mycological recurrence rates observed in fluconazole-treated participants in this trial and highlights the unmet medical need for these patients.

We have previously reported the potential clinical utility of VT-1161 in women with reVVC. Overall, recurrence rates of culture-proven VVC were only 4% in the 169 VT-1161–treated participants compared to the outcomes with fluconazole.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^114k8mdh]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Low credibility.

Safety and tolerability results in this pooled analysis were similar to those reported in the VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 studies, with mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) being the most commonly reported.

Our study limitations included a very limited enrollment of patients under 18 or 65 years of age and older. Although our inclusion criteria permitted females 12 years of age and older, no one under 18 years of age received ibrexafungerp. Furthermore, only five patients aged 65 years or older, combined from both VANISH studies, were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. Future studies should continue to maintain eligibility criteria for patients 12 years of age and older to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in the younger and older patient populations.

Our results are also limited by the exclusion of patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c ≥ 7), which resulted in approximately 7% of patients with diabetes mellitus being enrolled in the ibrexafungerp and placebo groups. In comparison, historical fluconazole studies have either excluded patients with diabetes mellitus or have treated only a small proportion of patients (4.5% [14 of 309]) with single-dose or two sequential doses of fluconazole. Because diabetes mellitus has been associated with VVC infection, future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of ibrexafungerp in patients with diabetes mellitus, regardless of how well their disease is controlled.

A final limitation of our study was the lack of an active comparator. However, FDA industry guidance for the development of drugs for the treatment of VVC advised for the appropriate comparison.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114fKqy9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety, and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

- **Search strategy**: The following sources were searched for the original review: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000), and the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted. For the update, CENTRAL (January 2000 to August 2006), PubMed (January 2000 to August 2006), EMBASE (January 2000 to August 2006), and the Cochrane STD Group Specialised Register were searched in August 2006. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials published in any language were included. Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis were included. The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis was to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and/or microscopy for yeast). Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding, or dia.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^117SiQr5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

This was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three dose levels of oral VT-1161 compared with a single dose of fluconazole, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved regimen. The study was conducted at eight sites in the United States between October 2013 and September 2014.

The available data suggested that VT-1161 plasma exposures of 1–1.5 µg/mL should be clinically effective; thus, this exposure target was chosen to guide the selection of the low-dose arm. Given the safety profile of VT-1161, the mid-dose arm regimen would provide higher exposures (approximately two-fold greater than the low-dose arm) and would allow for the assessment of PK/pharmacodynamic relationships. The study design also included the opportunity to escalate to a higher-dose arm.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following dose regimens: VT-1161 300 mg once daily (q.d.) for three days (low dose), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. for three days (mid dose), or VT-1161 600 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for three days (high dose) or fluconazole 150 mg administered orally in a single dose (administered blinded to match the VT-1161 dose regimens).

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113XR548]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), more commonly known as vaginal yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vaginitis. In 80%–95% of women, VVC is caused by *Candida albicans*, with fewer remaining infections caused by non-albicans *Candida* species, including *Candida glabrata*, *Candida parapsilosis*, *Candida tropicalis*, *Candida krusei*, or other fungi. Approximately 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40%–45% of women will experience two or more episodes. By the age of 25 years, an estimated 50% of all women will have experienced at least one episode of VVC after the onset of sexual activity. Treatment options for VVC are predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents and include short courses of topical formulations of various agents or oral fluconazole given as a 150-mg single or multiple-dose regimen.

Limitations of available treatments include concerns of intolerance, adverse events (AEs), and with fluconazole, a potential risk of miscarriage and fetal harm. More recent VVC treatment limitations include an increasing prevalence of fluconazole resistance and intrinsic resistance or low susceptibility of non-albicans *Candida* species to azole antifungals.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: A phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112e7Ymv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is largely limited to azole therapy. Ibrexafungerp is a first-in-class triterpenoid antifungal with broad-spectrum anti-Candida fungicidal activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrexafungerp compared with placebo in patients with acute VVC.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ibrexafungerp (300 mg twice for 1 day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure, defined as the complete resolution of vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS = 0) at the test-of-cure visit (day 11 ± 3). Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with mycological eradication, overall success (both clinical cure and mycological eradication), clinical improvement (VSS ≤ 1) at test-of-cure, and symptom resolution at follow-up (day 25 ± 4).

- **Results**: Patients receiving ibrexafungerp had significantly higher rates of clinical cure (50.5% [95/188] vs. 28.6% [28/98]; p = 0.001) and mycological eradication (49.5% [93/188] vs. 19.4% [19/98]; p = 0.001). The clinical improvement was observed in a large subset of patients, with some showing rates as high as 54.5% [24/44] and 68.2% [30/44], respectively, compared to the overall results.

### Oral ibrexafungerp for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: An analysis of VANISH 303 and VANISH 306 [^111UnKvB]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Low credibility.

Historical comparisons of ibrexafungerp and fluconazole are challenging due to varying study methodologies. Several pivotal studies evaluating fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) reported that 52%–65% of patients had severe VVC. In a prior study of fluconazole, baseline Vaginal Symptoms Score (VSS) scores ≥ 7 were associated with reduced response rates to single-dose fluconazole when treating severe VVC compared to mild disease. In this pooled analysis, we confirm that race (White and Black) did not affect efficacy outcomes with ibrexafungerp. Further analysis in other racial groups is warranted. Additionally, body mass index (BMI) did not appear to be a predictor of response to ibrexafungerp, as indicated by fluctuations in relative risk across various BMI categories.

Patients with baseline infections of non-albicans Candida species exhibited lower clinical responses, highlighting the need for additional research in this subgroup.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^111EcZJ1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Participant demographics and disposition**: Between October 2013 and September 2014, 55 female participants were randomized into the study. Participants were followed for approximately 6 months, which included up to 3 days for screening, 3 days for study drug administration, and a final follow-up visit 6 months after starting treatment. The study had a high rate of completion across all groups: VT-1161 300 mg q.d. 12/14 (85.7%); VT-1161 600 mg q.d. 10/12 (83.3%); VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. 13/14 (92.9%); and fluconazole 150 mg single dose, 13/15 (86.7%). No participant withdrew from the study due to an adverse event. All protocol deviations were considered minor and did not affect study outcomes. The average age of participants was 32.7 years, and baseline characteristics were similar across the groups.

- **Efficacy**: The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic cure at the day 28 test-of-cure (TOC) visit. These data are summarized for all populations (per-protocol, modified intention-to-treat, and intention-to-treat). A larger proportion of participants in the per-protocol population experienced therapeutic cure in the VT-1161 300 mg q.d. (6/8, 75.0%), VT-1161 600 mg q.d. (6/7, 85.7%), and VT-1161 600 mg b.i.d. (11/14, 78.6%) treatment groups compared to the fluconazole 150 mg group (5/8, 62.5%). No statistically significant difference was observed for any of the VT-1161 treatment groups versus the fluconazole group.

The secondary efficacy outcome measures included the proportion of participants…
