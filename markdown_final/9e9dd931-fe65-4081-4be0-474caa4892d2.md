## Question

July 3, 2030 is a Wednesday. What day of the week is July 14, 2030?
(A) Wednesday
(D) Monday
(B) Saturday
(C) Sunday

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what day of the week July 14, 2030 falls on, given that July 3, 2030 is a Wednesday. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the number of days between July 3 and July 14. Then, I should verify how many weeks and extra days that span represents. Next, I will map the remainder to the day-of-week sequence starting from Wednesday. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and confirm the answer against the options provided.

> Let me first confirm the date span. From July 3 to July 14 inclusive is 12 days, but wait, let me verify whether we should count inclusively or exclusively. If I count inclusively, that would be 12 days; if exclusively, it would be 11 days. Hold on, I should verify the convention for day-of-week calculations. Standard modular arithmetic for weekdays treats the difference as exclusive, so July 3 to July 14 is 11 days, not 12. I initially thought 12, but that would be incorrect for this method, so I will correct to 11 days.

> Next, I should review how weeks and remainders work. Eleven days equals 1 week plus 4 extra days, because 7 days make a complete week and 11 minus 7 equals 4. I need to ensure I'm using modulo 7 logic correctly: the day of the week advances by the remainder when the day count is divided by 7.

> Now, I will map the remainder to the weekday sequence. Starting from Wednesday, advancing 4 days takes me to Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and then Sunday. So, 4 days after Wednesday is Sunday. Wait, let me double-check that mapping: Wednesday + 1 = Thursday, +2 = Friday, +3 = Saturday, +4 = Sunday. Yes, that checks out.

> I should confirm the final answer against the options. The correct day is Sunday, which corresponds to option C. Options A, B, and D are Wednesday, Saturday, and Monday, respectively, so they do not match the calculation.

---

The correct answer is **Sunday**. July 3, 2030 is a Wednesday, so July 14, 2030 is 11 days later. Because 11 days is 1 week and 4 days, the day of the week shifts forward by 4 days: Wednesday → Thursday → Friday → Saturday → **Sunday**.

---

## Calculation of the day of the week

- **Start date**: July 3, 2030 (Wednesday)
- **Target date**: July 14, 2030
- **Difference in days**: 14–3 = 11 days
- **Weeks and remaining days**: 11 ÷ 7 = 1 week and 4 days
- **Day shift**: 4 days forward from Wednesday

---

## Step-by-step day shift

Starting from Wednesday and moving forward 4 days:

| **Day shift** | **Day of the week** |
|-|-|
| 0 | Wednesday |
| 1 | Thursday |
| 2 | Friday |
| 3 | Saturday |
| 4 | Sunday |

---

Therefore, July 14, 2030, is a **Sunday**.

Associations of time with MHW

Figure 1 shows the predicted trajectories over time for each outcome and their 95% confidence intervals (full results are in online supplemental table S3). After controlling for covariates, there was evidence for a nonlinear relationship between time and MHW. Although the differences across time were small, outcomes were consistently best early in the day (lowest depressive and anxiety symptoms and loneliness and highest happiness, life satisfaction and worthwhile ratings) and worst late at night. Worthwhile ratings had the most variation, peaking early in the morning, then reducing until midday, followed by a second lower peak in the evening, and a sharp decrease to its lowest at midnight.

Figure 1
Predicted changes over time from linear mixed-effects model for each outcome (covariates fixed at reference values): (a) depressive symptoms, (b) anxiety symptoms, (c) happiness, (d) life satisfaction, (e) worthwhile and (f) loneliness. std, standardised.

There was some inconsistent evidence that day of the week was associated with MHW (figure 2). For example, compared with Sunday, depressive symptoms were higher on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Anxiety symptoms were higher on all days versus Sunday except Fridays. Happiness, life satisfaction and worthwhile ratings were all higher on Mondays and Fridays than Sundays, and happiness was also higher on Tuesdays. However, there was no evidence that loneliness differed across days of the week.

Reference categories were Sunday (day), winter (season) and 2020 (year).

There was much more consistent evidence for a seasonal effect. Compared with winter, individuals tended to have lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and loneliness, and higher levels of happiness, life satisfaction and worthwhile in other seasons. MHW was best in the summer across all outcomes. Moreover, survey year was associated with all outcomes, indicating steady improvements in MHW since 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Attendance levels were reduced throughout the 24-hour period (figure 3). The largest decrease was seen on Monday to Wednesday, previously the busiest days of the week (table 1).

Figure 3
Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System attendances by hour of day and day of week during the 2019 pre-COVID-19 and 2020 COVID-19 periods (based on the periods 14 March 2019 to 28 April 2019 and 12 March 2020 to 26 April 2020, respectively, matched on day of the week).

Syndromic indicators showed that the greatest reductions were in non-respiratory indicators. While there was only a 4% reduction in acute respiratory infections, non-respiratory indicators fell by 44–67% during COVID-19 (table 1).

Weekday-dependent delay

Because of the different availability of testing resources during a week, we further delay a fraction of persons, depending on the day of the week (left blue box in Fig. 4). We model the fraction η t of delayed tests on a day t in a recurrent fashion, meaning that if a certain fraction gets delayed on Saturday, these same individuals can still get delayed on Sunday (Eq. (44)). The fraction η t is drawn separately for each individual day. However, the prior is the same for certain days of the week d (Eq. (45)): we assume that few tests get delayed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, using a prior with mean 0.67% (Eq. (48)), whereas we assume that more tests might be delayed on Monday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Hence compared to, we obtain slightly more delayed numbers of cases, which now include a weekday-dependent delay:

The parameter r d is defined such that it models the mean of the Beta distribution of Eq. (45), whereas e models the scale of the Beta distribution. r d is then transformed to an unbounded space by the sigmoid(Eq. (46)). This allows to define the hierarchical prior structure for the different weekdays. We chose the prior offor Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday such that only a small fraction of cases are delayed during the week. The chosen prior in Eq. (48) corresponds to a 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of r d of [0%; 5%]. For the other days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday), the chosen prior leaves a lot of freedom for inferring the delay. Equation (49) corresponds to a 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of r d of [0%; 72%]. The robustness of the other priors σ r and e is explored in Supplementary Fig. S17.

### Will things feel better in the morning? A time-of-day analysis of mental health and wellbeing from nearly 1 million observations [^1116mzFY]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Mood is known to change over seasons of the year, days of the week, and even over the course of the day (diurnally). But although broader mental health and well-being also vary over months and weeks, it is unclear whether there are diurnal changes in how people experience and report their mental health.

Objective

To assess time-of-day association with depression, anxiety, well-being and loneliness.

Methods

The study analysed data from 49 218 adults drawn from the University College London COVID-19 Social Study, which gathered detailed repeated measurements from the same participants across time over a 2-year period (March 2020–March 2022, 18.5 observation per person). Data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models.

Findings

There is a clear time-of-day pattern in self-reported mental health and well-being, with people generally waking up feeling best and feeling worst around midnight. There is also an association with day of the week and season, with particularly strong evidence for better mental health and well-being in the summer. Time-of-day patterns are moderated by day, with more variation in mental health and individual well-being during weekends compared with weekdays. Loneliness is relatively more stable.

Conclusions

Generally, things do seem better in the morning. Hedonic and eudemonic well-being have the most variation, and social well-being is most stable.

Clinical implications

Our findings indicate the importance of considering time, day and season in research design, analyses, intervention delivery, and the planning and provision of public health services.

### What's the healthiest day? circaseptan (weekly) rhythms in healthy considerations [^111pAAGv]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Biological clocks govern numerous aspects of human health, including weekly clocks-called circaseptan rhythms-that typically include early-week spikes for many illnesses.

Purpose

To determine whether contemplations for healthy behaviors also follow circaseptan rhythms.

Methods

We assessed healthy contemplations by monitoring Google search queries (2005–2012) in the U.S. that included the word healthy and were Google classified as health-related (e.g., healthy diet). A wavelet analysis was used in 2013 to isolate the circaseptan rhythm, with the resulting series compared by estimating ratios of relative query volume (healthy versus all queries) each day (e.g., (Monday-Wednesday)/Wednesday).

Results

Healthy searches peaked on Monday and Tuesday, thereafter declining until rebounding modestly on Sunday. Monday and Tuesday were statistically indistinguishable (t = 1.22, p = 0.22), but their combined mean had 30% (99% CI = 29, 32) more healthy queries than the combined mean for Wednesday-Sunday. Monday and Tuesday query volume was 3% (99% CI = 2, 5) greater than Wednesday, 15% (99% CI = 13, 17) greater than Thursday, 49% (99% CI = 46, 52) greater than Friday, 80% (99% CI = 76, 84) greater than Saturday, and 29% (99% CI = 27, 31) greater than Sunday. We explored media-based (priming) motivations for these patterns and they were consistently rejected.

Conclusions

Just as many illnesses have a weekly clock, so do healthy considerations. Discovery of these rhythms opens the door for a new agenda in preventive medicine, including implications for hypothesis development, research strategies to further explore these rhythms, and interventions to exploit daily cycles in healthy considerations.

### Will things feel better in the morning? A time-of-day analysis of mental health and wellbeing from nearly 1 million observations [^115HkGpM]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Exposures

Exposure variables included time of day (continuous from 6am to midnight), day of the week (categorical, Monday to Sunday), astronomical season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter based on equinoxes and solstices, see online supplemental table S2) and survey year (2020, 2021, 2022), all of which were generated from timestamps when participants completed each survey. Time was restricted to typical waking hours between 6:00am and midnight as only a small number of people responded outside these hours (see online supplemental figure S1).

Covariates

Covariates were all measured at baseline, including age groups (18–29, 30–45, 46–59, 60+ years), gender (woman, man), ethnicity (non-White, White), education (low: General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) or below, medium: A levels or equivalent, high: degree or above), employment status (employed, other), residential area (rural, urban), diagnosed physical health condition (yes, no) and diagnosed mental health condition (yes, no).

Analysis

Data were analysed using linear mixed-effects models, testing the effect of time of day (time), day of the week, season and year on each of the six outcomes in separate models. Quadratic and cubic terms of time were included to allow for nonlinear trajectories. Models were adjusted for all time-invariant covariates (see Statistical modelling in the online supplemental materials for technical explanations). Further, we tested whether the association of time with each outcome differed according to day of the week, astronomical season and survey year. We tested this by adding an interaction term between time and each potential moderator.

To account for the non-random nature of the sample, the sample was weighted using entropy balancing weightsfor the English population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity and education obtained from the Office for National Statistics. All analyses were conducted using Stata V18.

### Will things feel better in the morning? A time-of-day analysis of mental health and wellbeing from nearly 1 million observations [^113Asy9h]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Data

This study analysed data from the University College London (UCL) COVID-19 Social Study (CSS), a large panel study of over 73 000 adults (aged 18+ years) in the UK. The study commenced on 21 March 2020 with weekly then monthly follow-ups until November 2021, and additional follow-ups in November 2021, and January and March 2022. Participants were recruited through existing mailing lists (including large databases of adults who had previously consented to be involved in health research), print and digital media coverage, and social media. This was supplemented by targeted recruitments focusing on underrepresented groups via advertising/recruitment companies, and third-sector organisations. Full details of sample recruitment are published elsewhere. Participants provided an email address on first enrolment, which was used for receiving invites for follow-up surveys. During the weekly follow-up stage, survey invites were sent at the same time of day 1 week after the last survey completion. At the start of the monthly follow-up stage, participants were randomly allocated into four groups to receive their first monthly invite in different weeks on Monday morning (8:30am–12:30pm). Monthly follow-up survey invites were sent at the same time 4 weeks after last survey completion. At the additional follow-up stages, survey invites were sent on 22 November 2021 (Monday, 11:00am–12:00pm), 4 January 2021 (Tuesday, 9:30am–10:30am) and 21 March 2022 (Monday, 8:00am–9:30am). For each survey, a daily reminder was sent out automatically up to two times for those who did not respond to the initial invite. If participants did not complete the survey following the two reminders they would stop receiving future invites.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2025–26 influenza season [^111Wn9b5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Recommendations for influenza vaccination for the 2025–26 season — routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have a contraindication to vaccination continues to be recommended, and for most persons who require only 1 dose vaccination should ideally be offered during September or October, with vaccination continuing after October and throughout the influenza season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. Vaccination during July and August is not recommended for most groups, although vaccination during July or August may be considered for any recipient if there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. For most adults (particularly those aged ≥ 65 years) and pregnant women in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who did not receive ≥ 2 trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine doses before July 1, 2025, or whose history is unknown, require 2 doses for the season; these children should receive the first dose as early as possible, including during July and August if vaccine is available, to permit the second dose, which must be administered ≥ 4 weeks later, ideally by the end of October. For children who require only 1 influenza vaccine dose, vaccination during July and August can be considered for children of any age who need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season.

### How many days of pedometer monitoring predict weekly physical activity in adults? [^115iaLya]. Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The study purpose was to establish the number (and type) of days needed to estimate mean pedometer-determined steps/day in a field setting.

Methods

Seven days of data were collected from 90 participants (33 males, age = 49.1 ± 16.2 years, BMI = 27.2 ± 4.1 kg/m²; 57 females, age = 44.8 ± 16.9 years, BMI = 27.0 ± 5.9 kg/m²). Mean steps/day were computed for all 7 days (the criterion), each single day, and combinations of days. Analyses included repeated measures ANOVA, intra-class correlations (ICC), and regression.

Results

There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between days. The difference was limited to Sunday and accounted for 5% of the variance. ICC analyses indicated a minimum of 3 days is necessary to achieve a reliability of 0.80. The adjusted R² was 0.79 for a single day (specifically Wednesday), 0.89 for 2 days (Wednesday, Thursday), and 0.94 for 3 days (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday). Sunday was the last day to enter the model.

Conclusions

Although there is a statistical difference between days, there is little practical difference, and the primary distinction appears limited to Sunday. Although a single day of collection is not acceptable, any 3 days can provide a sufficient estimate.

### A simulation based digital twin approach to assessing the organization of response to emergency calls [^114KpgJC]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The organizational hypotheses evaluated in this study were therefore based on collaboration between these three categories of EMCC. The methodology followed is based on call flow simulations performed on digital twin of incoming call reception, initial decision and referral processes in the three EMCCs. Each digital twin of each real EMCC was constructed from observations, interviews, and was powered by real production data from emergency phone calls made between January 1 and December 31, 2021, amounting to 1,200,000 calls in all. More precisely, the average number of incoming calls arriving in the three EMCCs of the study on each week of 2021 was 22,591. Since 2021 was heavily affected by COVID-19, we focused the study on the week of July 12 to 18 which turned out to be the busiest week of 2021 in terms of the number of calls in the three EMCCs owing to a seasonality effect (summer holidays) and the bank holidays on Wednesday July 14 which was the busiest day of the year. For this specific week, the number of incoming calls was 32,480 (+43% compared with the weekly average value). The data was collected under conditions of system stress that were also observed at other times of the year. Furthermore, the analysis of incoming calls over the year highlights a weekly periodicity that is substantially synchronous for the three EMCCs. Figure 5 focuses on 11 particularly busy weeks in summer (Monday, May 31 to Sunday, August 15). The incoming-call peaks which appear more at the end of each week (on Saturday or on Sunday) highlight this weekly periodicity. The blue zone highlights the week of highest activity considered for this study (Monday 12 to Sunday 18 of July). Whatever the week, call peaks appear on the same days at the three EMCCs, which could suggest that decompartmentalizing calls would not bring any gain since all the EMCCs seem to be simultaneously overloaded. This study will verify this by evaluating two possible decompartmentalization scenarios: (1) interconnection and (2) virtualization.

### Association of holidays and the day of the week with suicide risk: multicounty, two stage, time series study [^1113iKj6]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study provides evidence regarding the association of the day of the week and national holidays with suicide risk using multicountry data with 1.7 million suicide cases. Suicide risk peaked on Mondays during weekdays across all countries, and the effect of weekends was heterogeneous among the countries. New Year's and the consecutive days were universally associated with an increased risk of suicide. Our findings contribute to the implications for national and global suicide prevention strategies in both industrialized and less-industrialized countries considering public health resource allocation and mobilisation.

### A comparison of laboratory values in pediatric hemodialysis patients: does day of the week matter? [^116gd7ZX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI) guidelines recommend the delivered dose of hemodialysis (HD) be measured no less than monthly by checking Kt/V (K is effective urea clearance, t is minute and V is urea distribution). To date, no studies have explored whether the day of the week for checking maintenance HD laboratory studies impacts dialysis dosing.

Methods

Data were collected at two HD facilities on 19 patients, ages ≤ 21 years receiving maintenance HD thrice weekly over a consecutive 6-month period. Data obtained from the Monday and Wednesday of each full third week of the month included dialysis vintage, ultrafiltration volume, serum electrolytes, hemoglobin and clearances.

Results

Kt/V and K+ were significantly different between Monday and Wednesday (P = 0.013 and P = 0.047, respectively).

Conclusion

Due to variability in values based on the day of laboratory evaluations, the dialysis provider must consider the impact of this on the quality of patient care when prescribing dialysis. Research on a larger scale needs to be conducted to allow for better decision-making capabilities in the chronic HD population.

### SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in New York city during March 2020-August 2023 [^114XuyKN]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and processing

For the model-inference system, we utilized multiple sources of epidemiologic data, including confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases, ED visits, deaths, vaccination, and variant proportions –. As done and described previously –, we aggregated all COVID-19 confirmed and probable cases, COVID-19-associated ED visits, and COVID-19-associated deathsreported to the NYC Health Department by age group (< 1, 1–4, 5–14, 15–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65–74, and 75+ year-olds), neighborhood of residence (42 United Hospital Fund neighborhoods in NYC), and week of occurrence. For mortality, we note a change in COVID-19-associated death definitions. From March 1, 2020 – April 2, 2023, COVID-19-associated deaths included (1) deaths occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. confirmed COVID-19-associated death) at any point (March 1, 2020–July 23, 2020), within 60 days (July 24, 2020–August 2, 2021), or within 30 days (August 3, 2021–April 2, 2023) of diagnosis; and (2) deaths with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 or a similar term listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death but without laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 (i.e. probable COVID-19-associated death). From April 3, 2023 through the week of August 27, 2023 (i.e. end of this study), COVID-19-associated deaths included any death where the death certificate included COVID-19 or a common variation of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, etc. For vaccinations, we included all available vaccine doses to date (i.e. 1 st to 5 th dose), and aggregated data for each vaccine dose to the same age/neighborhood strata, by date of vaccination.

### The association between the day of the week of milestones in the care pathway of patients with hip fracture and 30-day mortality: findings from a prospective national registry-the national hip fracture database of england and wales [^1149r3KP]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Following simultaneous adjustment for the exposures of interest (month of admission, day of the week of admission and surgery, out-of-hours surgery, and time to surgery) the association between the day of the week of admission and mortality was attenuated, whilst the association between the day of the week of surgery and mortality persisted, as did the association between the time to surgery from admission (Additional file 2: Table S7).

Grouping days of the week of surgery with similar associations (Wald test that Monday–Saturday are equal to one another P = 0.4) demonstrated that Sunday surgery was associated with a 9.4% increase in the odds of 30-day mortality. There was no effect of out-of-hours surgery. Surgery more than 24 hours after admission resulted in a 9.4% increase in mortality (Table 3).

### A novel approach to junior doctor induction: a near-peer based curriculum developed and delivered by outgoing foundation year doctors [^1128NN9Q]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Problem

There is a 4–12% reported increase in mortality in the month following the start of Foundation Year 1 doctors (FY1 – first year postgraduation) in the UK. This has gained the media title of "Black Wednesday" as changeover occurs on the first Wednesday in August. Similar concerns have been reported in the USA and is known there as the "July phenomenon". The reported increase in mortality has been linked to the movement of most trainee doctors to unfamiliar environments around the UK on the same day. Lack of familiarity with the new working environment and unfamiliarity with local practices all contribute to doctors potentially feeling unprepared for their new jobs.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine daylight saving time (DST) position — "these seasonal time changes should be abolished in favor of a fixed, national, year-round standard time". Transitions to and from DST "contribute to misalignment between the circadian biological clock and the light/dark cycle (or photoperiod)", resulting in "significant public health and safety risks", including "increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, mood disorders, and motor vehicle crashes". In the United States, DST begins "the second Sunday in March at 2:00 AM" and ends "the first Sunday in November at 2:00 AM", and internationally the "European Parliament voted to end the mandatory DST change by 2021".

### Association of holidays and the day of the week with suicide risk: multicounty, two stage, time series study [^113coWm8]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To assess the short term temporal variations in suicide risk related to the day of the week and national holidays in multiple countries.

Design

Multicountry, two stage, time series design.

Setting

Data from 740 locations in 26 countries and territories, with overlapping periods between 1971 and 2019, collected from the Multi-city Multi-country Collaborative Research Network database.

Participants

All suicides were registered in these locations during the study period (overall 1701286 cases).

Main Outcome Measures

Daily suicide mortality.

Results

Mondays had peak suicide risk during weekdays (Monday-Friday) across all countries, with relative risks (reference: Wednesday) ranging from 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10) in Costa Rica to 1.17 (1.09 to 1.25) in Chile. Suicide risks were lowest on Saturdays or Sundays in many countries in North America, Asia, and Europe. However, the risk increased during weekends in South and Central American countries, Finland, and South Africa. Additionally, evidence suggested strong increases in suicide risk on New Year's day in most countries with relative risks ranging from 0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.14) in Japan to 1.93 (1.31 to 2.85) in Chile, whereas the evidence on Christmas day was weak. Suicide risk was associated with a weak decrease on other national holidays, except for Central and South American countries, where the risk generally increased one or two days after these holidays.

Conclusions

Suicide risk was highest on Mondays and increased on New Year's day in most countries. However, the risk of suicide on weekends and Christmas varied by country and territory. The results of this study can help to better understand the short term variations in suicide risks and define suicide prevention action plans and awareness campaigns.

### Will things feel better in the morning? A time-of-day analysis of mental health and wellbeing from nearly 1 million observations [^116VBa1s]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Overall, among all MHW outcomes, there was a general curvilinear pattern across the day. However, there were subtle differences across psychological domains when testing how time-of-day patterns differed by day of the week. Measures of mental health were worst mid-week, with morning relief from depressive and anxiety symptoms not found on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. When compared with evidence that suicide risk peaks on Monday, it is surprising that we did not also find elevated mental health symptoms on Monday. However, in line with our findings, suicide risk remains elevated across weekdays and is lowest Friday to Sunday. Previous research has linked changes in MHW across the week to work stress, with employment leading to reductions in MHW during weekdays compared with weekends. Supporting the hypothesis that work may be driving these results, we found less time-of-day variation in eudemonic well-being (feeling life was worthwhile) at the start of the working week, as it did not have the morning peak found at the weekend and later in the week. Hedonic well-being measures (happiness and life satisfaction) showed clearer differentiation between the weekend and weekdays, with scores peaking first thing in the morning only at the weekend. This could be in anticipation of a day of leisure, as the weekend peak in MHW is associated with doing more social leisure activities at the weekendand the difference in time spent with friends or family between weekends and weekdays.

### Minimum days estimation for reliable dietary intake information: findings from a digital cohort [^113CyMZX]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

In the analysis of minimum days estimation below, we focused on the longest sequence of at least 7 consecutive days for each participant. Days with total energy intake below 1000 kcal were excluded from analysis. This approach was chosen for several reasons: First, it allowed us to include the vast majority of participants (958 out of 1014), with only 56 participants excluded due to insufficient data. Second, the use of consecutive days eliminated the need to account for data gaps. Third, a full week of data enabled us to investigate potential day-of-the-week effects on dietary patterns. For participants with data sequences exceeding 7 days, we calculated the mean intake per weekday to maintain consistency across the sample. Figure 1A, B shows respectively the distribution of days per subject before and after doing the aggregation by mean for the seven days of the week. The remaining 958 participants were 55% female and 45% male. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 65 years, with 46% participants aged below 35, and 18% participants aged above 50. BMI categories included 68% participants with a BMI between 18–25, and 29% participants with a BMI of 25 or higher. Figure 1C shows the counts for tracking days for all participants by month, colored by the average temperature for each month during the study period (from 2019 to 2023). Temperature data were obtained from MeteoSwiss, which provides monthly mean temperatures of Switzerland. The demographic proportions for age, BMI and sex are shown in Fig. 1D.

### COVID-19 vaccine safety in adolescents aged 12–17 years-United States, December 14, 2020-July 16, 2021 [^117EZ5kP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Review of v-safe Data

During December 14, 2020–July 16, 2021, v-safe enrolled 66,350 adolescents aged 16–17 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Table 3). After Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized for adolescents aged 12–15 years (beginning May 10, 2021), v-safe enrolled 62,709 adolescents in this age group. During the week after receipt of dose 1, local (63.9%) and systemic (48.9%) reactions were commonly reported by adolescents aged 12–15 years; systemic reactions were more common after dose 2 (63.4%) than dose 1 (48.9%). Reporting trends were similar for adolescents aged 16–17 years: systemic reactions were reported among 55.7% after dose 1 and 69.9% after dose 2. For each dose and age group, reactions were reported most frequently the day after vaccination. The most frequently reported reactions for both age groups after either dose were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia.

TABLE 3
Reactions reported by adolescents aged 12–17 years (N = 129,059) who completed at least one v-safe health check-in survey on days 0–7 after receiving Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine — United States, December 14, 2020–July 16, 2021

* Percentage of enrollees who reported a reaction or health impact at least once during days 0–7 post-vaccination.

During the week after receipt of dose 2, approximately one third of adolescents in both age groups reported fever. Nearly one quarter of adolescents in both age groups reported they were unable to perform normal daily activities the day after dose 2. Fewer than 1% of adolescents aged 12–17 years required medical care in the week after receipt of either dose; 56 adolescents (0.04%) were hospitalized.

Position statement: daylight saving time — conclusions state that existing data support the elimination of seasonal time changes in favor of a fixed, year-round time. Daylight saving time (DST) can cause misalignment of the human circadian biological clock and environmental clock, resulting in significant health and public safety-related consequences. A change to permanent standard time is best aligned with human circadian biology and has the potential to produce beneficial effects for public health and safety.

### Assessing the association between social gatherings and COVID-19 risk using birthdays [^116HrynK]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Many policies designed to stop the spread of COVID-19 address formal gatherings, such as workplaces and dining locations. Informal social gatherings are a potentially important mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but studying their role in transmission is challenged by data and methodological limitations; birthdays offer an opportunity to empirically quantify the potential role of small social gatherings in COVID-19 spread.

Objective

To assess the association between social gatherings and SARS-CoV-2 transmission by studying whether COVID-19 rates increase after birthdays in a household.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used nationwide data from January 1 to November 8, 2020, from 2.9 million US households with private insurance to compare COVID-19 infections between households with and without a birthday in the preceding 2 weeks, stratified according to county-level COVID-19 prevalence in that week and adjusting for household size and both week- and county-specific differences. The study also compared how birthday-associated infection rates differed by type of birthday (eg, child vs adult birthday, or a milestone birthday such as a 50th birthday), county-level precipitation on the Saturday of each week (which could move gatherings indoors), political leanings in the county, and state shelter-in-place policies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Household-level COVID-19 infection.

Results

Among the 2.9 million households in the study, in the top decile of counties in COVID-19 prevalence, households with a birthday in the 2 weeks prior had 8.6 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 6.6–10.7 per 10 000 individuals) compared with households without a birthday in the 2 weeks prior, a relative increase of 31% above the county-level prevalence of 27.8 cases per 10 000 individuals, vs 0.9 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 0.6–1.3 per 10 000 individuals) in the fifth decile (P < .001 for interaction). Households in the tenth decile of COVID-19 prevalence had an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses of 15.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 11.7–19.9 per 10 000 persons) after a child birthday, compared with an increase of 5.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 3.7–7.9 per 10 000 persons) among households with an adult birthday (P < .001 in a test of interactions). No differences were found by milestone birthdays, county political leaning, precipitation, or shelter-in-place policies.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study suggests that birthdays, which likely correspond with social gatherings and celebrations, were associated with increased rates of diagnosed COVID-19 infection within households in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence.

### Minimum days estimation for reliable dietary intake information: findings from a digital cohort [^1136YJj1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Minimum days and optimal combination estimation

In order to extract the best (and worst) collection day combinations for each nutrient or food group, we used another approach wherein we compare the ICC of different day combinations to the mean intake of the entire dataset (consisting of a 7 day week). Hence, under the assumption of an entire week being sufficient in capturing the nutritional variation, this method allows to elucidate which days of the week (or their combinations) lead to highest (or lowest) ICC values when comparing to the full week.

Figure 4 highlights the best and worst day combinations at different number of days across various nutritional features (for the full set of nutrition features, see Supplementary Figs. 6, 7). Since the assumption of one week being sufficient to capture variation already loses some precision, we set the ICC threshold in the assessment below at 0.9, indicating excellent reliability. In order to achieve this threshold, carbohydrate intake required 3 days that were spread across the week (Monday, Wednesday and Saturday) for the best combination. The worst combination of 3 days also reached the 0.9 threshold, but the days were continuous weekdays from Monday to Wednesday. Similarly, for protein and fat intake, it required 3 days minimum for the best combination to cross the 0.9 threshold and included two weekdays and one weekend day (Saturday for both protein and fat), while their worst 3 day combination was below the 0.9 threshold. For fiber, the best combination of 2 days (Monday and Wednesday) attained the 0.9 threshold precisely, although with 3 days, even the worst combination was above the excellent reliability threshold. For alcohol, the alternating day combination at 3 days resulted in being the best combination which surpassed the threshold, while the worst combination at even 4 days - which were all continuous weekdays - was below the threshold. Eaten quantity and water intake required only one day of collection (Wednesday) to reach the reliability threshold. The same can be observed for non-alcoholic beverages group (Supplementary Fig. 6) Coffee intake nearly achieved this threshold with just one day of data (Tuesday). Interestingly, when adopting a more conservative approach by increasing the collection period to 2 days, the optimal combination for all four nutritional features (eaten quantity, water, non-alcoholic beverages and coffee) was consistently Monday and Friday. Similarly, extending to a 3 day collection period, the best combination was Monday, Tuesday, and Friday for all these features (except for non-alcoholic beverages).

Results

During January 1–July 8, 2023, weekly rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 65 years decreased 86%, from a high of 42.2 to 5.9 per 100,000, the lowest level since July 2021. Rates then increased to 6.8 for the week ending July 15 and continued to increase during subsequent weeks, to 16.4 for the week ending August 26, 2023 (Figure 1); during that week, the rate among adults aged ≥ 65 years was nine times as high as that among adults aged 18–64 years (1.8) and 16 times as high as that among persons aged < 18 years (1.0). Among adults aged ≥ 65 years, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates were highest among those aged ≥ 85 years (42.2) and lowest among adults aged 65–74 years (8.6).

### Minimum days estimation for reliable dietary intake information: findings from a digital cohort [^1125Ajq5]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Consumption patterns across days of the week

It has been documented that nutrient intake can vary strongly across different days of the week. To analyze the association of different days of the week and nutrient intake, we used the linear mixed models approach described in the methods section. The results are plotted as a heatmap (Fig. 1E) where the p-values indicate the statistical significance of the coefficients, with thresholds set at < 0.001 (red), < 0.01 (orange), < 0.05 (yellow), and ≥ 0.05 (gray). The numerical values within the cells represent the coefficients of the day of the week for each nutrient, indicating the change in nutrient intake compared to the intercept (with Monday as reference). Furthermore, the results are segmented into groups as follows: all participants (Fig. 1E), age groups (Supplementary Fig. 1), BMI groups (Supplementary Fig. 2), sex groups (Supplementary Fig. 3) and cold/warm seasons (Supplementary Fig. 4) in order to observe the variations of dietary daily habits with respect to age and BMI.

We observed significant variations across different days for several nutrients and food groups, as shown in Fig. 1E. Alcohol intake showed notable increases from Wednesday through Sunday (all p < 0.001). Similarly, carbohydrate intake increases significantly throughout the week, peaking on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (increase of 15 g, 29 g and 22 g respectively; p < 0.001). Energy intake followed a similar pattern, with substantial increases on all days, particularly on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (+202 kcal, +371 kcal, and +250 kcal respectively, p < 0.001). The intake of sodium and sugar also increased significantly on the weekend, with sugar increasing by roughly 10 g on Saturday and Sunday, respectively (p < 0.001). These observations reflect more indulgent dietary habits towards the end of the week. In contrast, non-alcoholic beverages, especially water and coffee, exhibited a significant decrease from Friday to Sunday (p < 0.001). Notably, dairy was the only food group for which there was no significant difference across all days of the week, even when considering subgroups (Supplementary Figs. 1–4).

### Hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 among children and adolescents-COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1, 2020-August 14, 2021 [^116u6UNz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Although COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths have occurred more frequently in adults, † COVID-19 can also lead to severe outcomes in children and adolescents (1,2). Schools are opening for in-person learning, and many prekindergarten children are returning to early care and education programs during a time when the number of COVID-19 cases caused by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is increasing. § Therefore, it is important to monitor indicators of severe COVID-19 among children and adolescents. This analysis uses Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) data to describe COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among U.S. children and adolescents aged 0–17 years. During March 1, 2020-August 14, 2021, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was 49.7 per 100,000 children and adolescents. The weekly COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate per 100,000 children and adolescents during the week ending August 14, 2021 (1.4) was nearly five times the rate during the week ending June 26, 2021 (0.3); among children aged 0–4 years, the weekly hospitalization rate during the week ending August 14, 2021, was nearly 10 times that during the week ending June 26, 2021. During June 20-July 31, 2021, the hospitalization rate among unvaccinated adolescents (aged 12–17 years) was 10.1 times higher than that among fully vaccinated adolescents. Among all hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19, the proportions with indicators of severe disease (such as intensive care unit [ICU] admission) after the Delta variant became predominant (June 20-July 31, 2021) were similar to those earlier in the pandemic (March 1, 2020-June 19, 2021). Implementation of preventive measures to reduce transmission and severe outcomes in children is critical, including vaccination of eligible persons, universal mask wearing in schools, recommended mask wearing by persons aged ≥ 2 years in other indoor public spaces and child care centers, †† and quarantining as recommended after exposure to persons with COVID-19. §§.

CDC Yellow Book — melatonin timing for circadian adjustment emphasizes dosing and scheduling details. Take melatonin 90 min before bed to assist your natural rise in melatonin, and taking melatonin when it is already naturally high is not effective. Not recommended to take high-dose melatonin (> 5mg) because this can cause excess melatonin to be present at the wrong time of day as it is metabolized. Because melatonin is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, the amount of melatonin may vary from what is printed on the label. Similar to timed light exposure, recommendations on timing and duration of melatonin for eastward and westward flights is based on the number of time zones crossed, and jet lag calculators often offer recommendations on melatonin usage based on trip schedules.

Procedures

After completing consent and downloading the study app, the wearable devices started to record daily step count and time spent asleep. Participants were prompted to report their daily mood (a score of 1 corresponded to the lowest and a score of 10 corresponded to the highest mood) every day at a user-specified time between 5 PM and 10 PM (default was 8 PM) in the study app. In addition to collecting data, the study app aggregated and displayed visual summaries of participant's historical data, including daily step count, sleep minutes and mood score, through a dashboard which participants could access at any time via the app (see Supplementary Fig. 1). Separate from the competition component of the app, each user also had a 50/50 chance each day to receive a push notification at 3 pm which contained a message summarizing their personalized data feedback, a relevant fact or tip for improving mental health and well-being, or a general supportive statement. Furthermore, baseline and quarterly follow-up surveys were administered through the app.

The competition intervention was conducted for 12 weeks (Monday 6 July 2020, to Sunday 27 September 2020). Each team was randomly assigned to competition (intervention) and non-competition arm during each competition episode. Four competition-related smartphone push notifications were sent to participants in each competition week: (1) an alert of competition type (steps or sleep) and opponent team (Sunday 9 pm prior to the competition week), (2) two competition score updates (Wednesday 9 pm and Saturday 11 am during the competition week), and (3) the final competition results (Monday 12 pm following the competition week). Examples of messages are included in Supplementary Table 1. Participants could view their current competition scoreboard and competition history at any time via the Intern+ app. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows three representative screenshots of the app interface involving competition.

### Sleep is essential to health: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^1152aKCz]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Healthy People 2030 sleep objectives and baseline sleep sufficiency — These recommendations provide benchmarks for the Healthy People 2030 objectives to increase the proportion of children, high school students, and adults in the U.S. who get enough sleep. Baseline data from surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) show that 34.1% of children, 74.6% of high school students, and 32.5% of adults fail to get a sufficient duration of sleep on a regular basis. Other Healthy People 2030 sleep objectives are to reduce the rate of motor vehicle crashes due to drowsy driving and to increase the proportion of adults with sleep apnea symptoms who get evaluated by a health care provider, infants who are put to sleep on their backs, infants who are put to sleep in a safe sleep environment, and secondary schools with a start time of 8:30 am or later.

### New COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among adults, by vaccination status-new york, may 3-July 25, 2021 [^116Tagcs]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

After a period of phased COVID-19 vaccine eligibility based on age, occupation, setting, or comorbidities beginning in December 2020, all New York residents aged ≥ 60 years were eligible for vaccination by March 10, 2021; eligibility was expanded to persons aged ≥ 30 years by March 30, and to all adults aged ≥ 18 years by April 6. § To allow time for a large portion of vaccinated persons to achieve full immunity, this study was restricted to the week beginning May 3 through the week beginning July 19, 2021.

Breakthrough infections were defined as new cases among persons who were fully vaccinated on the day of specimen collection. Hospitalizations among persons with breakthrough infection were defined as new hospital admissions among persons fully vaccinated on the reporting day. The total adult state population that was fully vaccinated and unvaccinated was assessed for each day and stratified by age group (18–49 years, 50–64 years, and ≥ 65 years). Persons who were partially vaccinated were excluded from analyses. For each week and age group, the rates of new cases and hospitalizations were calculated among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, by respectively dividing the counts for each group by the fully vaccinated and unvaccinated person-days in that week. Age-adjusted VE each week was estimated as the population-weighted mean of the age-stratified VE. The interval between completing vaccination and positive SARS-CoV-2 test result date was summarized using the median, interquartile range (IQR), and percentage tested ≥ 7 days from being fully vaccinated. †† The ratio of hospitalizations to cases was computed for each vaccination group to understand the relative severity of cases. Statistical testing was not performed because the study included the whole population of interest and was not a sample.

Admissions by period (March–April 2019 vs. March–April 2020) and day of the week

Fig. 2
Admissions per day of the week, seven most common diagnoses. The category "hot gallbladder" includes acute cholecystitis and intractable biliary colic. SBO small bowel obstruction, CRC colorectal cancer

Of the 6263 patients, 74.3% were admitted during the working days, while only 25.7% were admitted during the weekends.

Gender distribution, average age, ASA class and distribution of frailty score did not change during the weekend with respect to working days (Table 1). However, our data showed that the distribution of frailty score was significantly different between 2019 and 2020, both during weekdays and weekends (Table 1).

The general profile of admissions during the week is quite constant, but for each day of the week there is an evident difference in the number of admissions between March–April 2019 and March–April 2020. This different is pretty much constant for the whole week (Monday − 30.5%, Tuesday − 35.3%, Wednesday − 31.7%, Thursday − 30.7%, Friday − 42.5%, Saturday − 45.2%, Sunday − 33.4%) (Fig. 1). The average reduction of admissions between 2019 and 2020 was 34.2% during workdays and 39.7% during weekends (p = 0.143).

The seven most common diagnoses were: (1) hot gallbladder, (2) acute appendicitis, (3) small bowel obstruction (SBO), (4) diverticulitis, (5) complicated inguinal hernia, (6) pancreatitis, (7) complicated colorectal (CRC) cancer (Table 2). Their distribution did not show any significant difference between weekends and working days (Table 2), although the number of admitted hot gallbladders tends to be highest on Mondays and then progressively reduces to become lowest on Sundays (Fig. 2).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116zXBQ9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Standard Days Method (SDM) — use with different menstrual cycle lengths: For menstrual cycles of 26–32 days, the patient may use the method, provide a barrier method for protection on days 8–19 if they want one, and if unprotected sexual intercourse occurred during days 8–19, consider the use of emergency contraception if appropriate. If two or more cycles of < 26 or > 32 days occur within any 1 year of SDM use, advise that the method might not be appropriate because of a higher risk for pregnancy and help them consider another method. The probability of pregnancy when using SDM is increased when the cycle is outside 26–32 days even if unprotected sexual intercourse is avoided on days 8–19; a study examining 7,600 menstrual cycles concluded theoretical effectiveness is greatest with cycles of 26–32 days and less effective with cycles consistently outside this range, and daily hormonal measurements show the timing of the 6-day fertile window varies greatly, even among women with regular cycles.

### Trends in outbreak-associated cases of COVID-19-Wisconsin, March-November 2020 [^111q4sUT]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

During September 3–November 16, 2020, daily confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) increased at a rate of 24% per week, from a 7-day average of 674 (August 28–September 3) to 6,426 (November 10–16). The growth rate during this interval was the highest to date in Wisconsin and among the highest in the United States during that time. To characterize potential sources of this increase, the investigation examined reported outbreaks in Wisconsin that occurred during March 4–November 16, 2020, with respect to their setting and number of associated COVID-19 cases.

Outbreaks were defined as the occurrence of two or more confirmed COVID-19 cases * among persons who worked or lived together or among persons who attended the same facility or event, did not share a household, and were identified within 14 days of each other (by symptom onset date or sample collection date). During March 4–November 16, local and tribal health departments in Wisconsin reported suspected COVID-19 outbreaks to WDHS using established reporting criteria †; 5,757 reported outbreaks meeting the outbreak definition were included in the analysis. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 that were linked § to these outbreaks were analyzed by symptom onset date (or sample collection date), the reported setting of the associated outbreak or outbreaks during three periods: before and during Wisconsin's Safer At Home order (March 4–May 12), summer and return-to-school (May 13–September 2), and the exponential growth phase †† (September 3–November 16). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted in a manner consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. §§

Pregnant women in the third trimester — vaccination during July and August can be considered for women who are in the third trimester during these months because it has been associated with reduced risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months after birth; for pregnant women in the first or second trimester during July and August, waiting until September or October to vaccinate is preferable unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible.

### Arrival by ambulance explains variation in mortality by time of admission: retrospective study of admissions to hospital following emergency department attendance in england [^113697AU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Association between crude risk of mortality and day and time of attendance

Of all 3 027 946 patients admitted to hospital following attendance at A&E, the majority (1 907 920, 63.0%) attended A&E during daytime, while the remaining 1 120 026 (37.0%) attended at night (table 1, column 1).

Table 1
Association of day and time of attendance with risk-adjusted mortality within 30 days of admission

The crude mortality rates are higher for patients attending A&E during the day compared with at night (table 1, column 3); 3.66% of patients attending on Wednesday daytime die within 30 days compared with 3.48% of patients attending on Wednesday night-time. The crude mortality rates are highest for those attending on Sunday daytime (4.12%) and Saturday (4.00%) daytime, and lowest for those attending on Friday night (3.28%) and Saturday night (3.32%).

The higher crude mortality rates during daytime reflect the higher proportions of patients in the highest risk quintile (as measured using the standard risk-adjustment model) among those arriving during daytime compared with those arriving at night (figure 1). Over the whole week, 20.9% of daytime arrivals were in the highest risk quintile compared with 18.5% for night arrivals. Daytime arrivals on Sundays contained the highest proportion of patients in the highest risk quintile (21.59%), followed by daytime arrivals on Saturdays (21.38%) and Fridays (20.89%). The proportions of patients in the highest risk quintile among those arriving at night were similar across the days of the week, with the highest proportions on Mondays (18.97%) and Wednesdays (18.9%) and the lowest proportion on Saturdays (17.62%).

### Is day of surgery associated with adverse clinical and economic outcomes following primary total knee arthroplasty? [^112swrt2]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

As orthopedics transition to value-based purchasing, hospitals and providers are incentivized to identify inefficiencies of care delivery. In our experience, weekends are characterized by decreased staffing of ancillary services to coordinate patient discharges, which can lead to prolonged hospital stays for many of our primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) admissions.

Methods

We identified 115,053 patients who underwent primary TKA on a weekday between 2009 and 2013 in New York State. We used mixed effects regression models to compare length of stay (LOS), 90-day readmission, and cost according to the day of TKA.

Results

Mean LOS was significantly higher for surgeries performed on Wednesday (P < .001), Thursday (P < .001), and Friday (P < .001). There was no significant difference in 90-day readmission risk according to day of surgery. Mean cost was significantly higher for surgeries performed on Wednesday (P < .001), Thursday (P < .001), and Friday (P < .001). When LOS was held constant across every day of the week, the mean cost of TKA decreased by $247 for Wednesday, $627 for Thursday, and $394 for Friday.

Conclusion

Primary TKA performed later in the week is associated with an increased LOS and increased costs of admission, but a similar risk of 90-day readmission. Preferential scheduling of primary TKA cases early in the week, as well as the development of standardized clinical care pathways with appropriate weekend staffing of social work and rehabilitation services, could help to decrease the daily variation in LOS and increase the value of TKA episodes.

### A phase II trial of naxitamab plus stepped-up dosing of GM-CSF for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma in first complete remission [^115ZQC72]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Naxitamab is a humanized form of the murine anti-GD2 mAb 3F8. In an international trial, naxitamab + GM-CSF was effective against chemoresistant high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB), leading to approval by the FDA. We now report results with patients in first complete remission (CR).

Patients and Methods

The primary objective of this phase II protocol 16–1643 (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03033303) was to assess event-free survival of patients with HR-NB in first CR treated with naxitamab + GM-CSF plus isotretinoin. HR-NB was defined as MYCN-amplified disease (any age) or metastatic disease at age > 18 months. Cycles of immunotherapy were administered monthly up to five cycles and comprised (i) subcutaneously administered priming doses of GM-CSF 250 μg/m²/day on days -4 to -0 (Wednesday-Sunday), followed by a step-up to 500 μg/m²/day on days +1 to +5 (Monday-Friday) and (ii) naxitamab infused intravenously (30–90") on days +1, +3, and +5 (Monday-Wednesday-Friday, i.e., three doses/cycle). The dosage of naxitamab was 3 mg/kg/infusion (9 mg/kg/cycle, i.e., ∼270 mg/m²/cycle). The dosage of isotretinoin was 160 mg/m²/day started after cycle 2, ×14 days/course, and ×6 courses.

Results

Fifty-nine patients with HR-NB (53 stage 4, 6 stage 3) were enrolled from February 2017 to July 2020. At 36 months, event-free/overall survival rates were 73%/93%, but 50 of 59 patients received after protocol treatment (vaccine and/or difluoromethylornithine). Six of 18 relapses were isolated in the central nervous system. Longer time from diagnosis to enrollment was a significantly adverse prognostic factor (P = 0.04). Twenty-one of 59 patients took no isotretinoin. Treatment was tolerable allowing outpatient administration.

Conclusions

Naxitamab + GM-CSF is a good option to consolidate first CR of patients with HR-NB, including those who did not undergo autologous stem-cell transplantation. Efforts to prevent central nervous system relapse are warranted.

### Reactivity to accelerometer measurement of children and adolescents [^111GwtSE]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2014). Low credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 2081 children were included in the analysis. An average of 588 ± 173 cpm·d⁻¹ (95% CI = 314–989 cpm) was recorded over the measurement period. Adherence to wearing the device dropped with the duration of the study. All children wore their device on the first measurement day, whereas 1115 children (54%) wore their device on the seventh measurement day (Fig. 1). The days of the week measured were evenly represented in the measurements. Most children started the measurements on Wednesday or Thursday (both 21%), whereas only a few children started their measurements on Monday (5%) or Sunday (9%).

FIGURE 1
Number of children measured according to the measurement day (first to seventh day) and the day of the week (Monday to Sunday).

Main model

The measurement day was significantly related to accelerometer measured PA (P < 0.05) in the main model (Fig. 2; see also Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which shows bootstrap estimates with standard errors of coefficient as numbers). The first measurement day was the most active day, and counts per minute were significantly higher than on the second to the sixth day, but not on the seventh day. Differences in the age-adjusted means between the first and consecutive days ranged from 23 to 45 cpm (3.6%–7.1%). The day of the week was significantly related to PA (P < 0.001), with counts per minute on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday being significantly lower than on Tuesday through Friday. The start day was significantly related to PA (P < 0.05), with a difference of 39.3 cpm (6.3%), depending on whether the measurements started on a Wednesday (highest PA estimates) or on a Saturday (lowest PA estimates).

### Increased incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease among children after COVID-19 pandemic, england [^115oH8F4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The Study

We compared IPD cases during July–December 2021 to July–December 2020 and July–December in 3 prepandemic years (2017–2019) by using national enhanced surveillance data for England. In brief, National Health Service (NHS) hospitals electronically report notifiable infections and routinely submit invasive pneumococcal isolates for serotyping to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). For confirmed cases, the UKHSA sends general practitioners a questionnaire regarding risk factors, clinical characteristics, vaccination history, and patient outcomes. To calculate incidence, we used mid-year Office of National Statistics population estimates as denominators, using 2020 data for 2021 because 2021 data were not yet available.

During July–December 2021, a total of 1,632 IPD cases were reported to UKHSA, compared with a mean of 2,403 during July–December of 3 prepandemic years, 2017–2019 (Figure 1, panels A, B). Among children < 15 years of age, the number of IPD and incidence (cases per 100,000 children) declined by 50% (n = 71) during July–December 2020 but gradually increased in February 2021 and remained above the 3-year prepandemic mean of 145 cases (incidence 1.43, 95% CI 1.21–1.68) during July–December 2021 (n = 200; 1.96, 95% CI, 1.70–2.25) (Figure 1, panel B). Case rates rose earlier in younger age groups (Figure 1, panel C) among whom incidence was highest during this period: 10.63 (95% CI 8.19–13.58) among < 1-year-olds; 3.22 (95% CI 2.57–3.98) among 1–4-year-olds; 1.02 (95% CI 0.71–1.41) among 5–9-year-olds; and 0.44 (95% CI 0.24–0.72) among 10–14-year-olds. Cases also increased (n = 1,432) among persons > 15 years age during February–December 2021 (Figure 1, panel A), but the incidence during July–December 2021 remained lower (2.60, 95% CI 2.47–2.74) than the prepandemic mean during July–December in 2017–2019 (4.14, 95% CI 3.97–4.32).

### DIET @ NET: best practice guidelines for dietary assessment in health research [^115FHGyc]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

3.1 Are you interested in 'actual'/short-term (hours or several days, up to one week) or 'usual'/long-term intake (e.g. Months or years)? consider what reference period (e.g. Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) would be best suited to your dietary component of interest (essential)

Long-term average intake or the usual/habitual pattern differs from intake reported for a single day or a few days. Short-term intake (e.g. over a single day), such as a 24HR, only represents a snapshot in time but may provide less biased dietary data. More than one day of dietary information is preferred to estimate usual intake, since it can assess both within- and between-person variation. Nevertheless, to assess a mean population-level food or nutrient intake, one day of intake on a large sample will be adequate. Non-consecutive days may capture more individual variability. A single 24HR may not be sufficient to describe participants' long-term usual intake, in part because of social desirability bias and also day-to-day variation with reports of energy intake being higher on a weekend than on a weekday. Two recalls were found to be better than one, and three minimised the mean difference between reported and objectively measured intakes. However, self-report has been challenged in terms of suitability for measurement of energy intake, although it may be useful for adjustment of other nutrients to improve risk estimates.

### The global comparators project: international comparison of 30-day in-hospital mortality by day of the week [^112igXJY]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

When compared with emergency admissions to US hospitals on a Monday (table 5), the sample of English, Australian and Dutch hospitals showed significant lower adjusted odds of 30-day death on a Thursday, Sunday and Saturday, respectively.

In contrast to procedure-specific risk, we observed an overall homogeneous distribution of diagnosis-specific risk among the days of the week, that is, there were no significant differences in the diagnosis-specific risk distribution between weekdays and weekends for admitted emergency patients.

As highlighted by other studies, intercountry differences in the process of healthcare and variation in diagnostic coding systems make intercountry comparison of health outcomes challenging at best. Previous studies of mortality per day of the week have been limited to a specific patient population, either by region or by patient type (such as patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) or patients who had major trauma). Within the USA, a study in the non-elective settingreported a significant weekend effect (10.5% higher mortality on weekends compared with weekdays) while a veteran affairs study for non-emergency surgical procedures revealed 17% higher adjusted odds of death for patients admitted postoperatively to regular hospital floors on Fridays compared with a Monday-to-Wednesday (inclusive) admission. Interestingly, ICUs have also shown a weekend effect; in Australia, a study showed that out-of-hours and weekend admissions to ICU for elective surgery were associated with higher mortality (20% on weekends vs 14% during weekdays); in the Netherlands, a study of admissions to ICU showed increased mortality during out-of-hours and at weekends.

To ensure consistency and coordination, data collection days were set to fall on the first or second Wednesday every month, meaning that all organisations collected their data on the same date. The choice of Wednesday was not problematic for data collection in acute settings as, typically, the case mix of patients in hospitals on a Wednesday did not differ systematically from that on other days.

In community settings, however, the data collection day was consequential for the sample of patients included. Because community nurses do not see every patient on their case load every day, they only recorded patients who they visited that day. Community staff found this challenging, because they knew that patients with different needs were seen on different days. For example, patients who were more unwell would need to be seen daily or three times a week (typically Monday, Wednesday and Friday), whereas patients who were less unwell would be seen twice-weekly. Community nurses felt that the majority of their overall case load was these twice-weekly, less unwell patients, but that the patients seen on a Wednesday, and therefore captured in the NHS-ST data collection, were more likely to be the acutely ill patients, which might skew the data and lead to disproportionate numbers of harms being recorded.

If patients are seen twice weekly it's normally Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday, because Wednesday is a very obscure day really. And [patients seen on Wednesday] would only be seen the three days a week or daily. If you were actually looking at the whole caseload it may give you more validated data really, because all you are asking for is patients seen today. Well, it's not telling you anything. (Site C, Front-line Staff 3)

The day of the week that data were collected had an impact on front-line and senior staff's view of the data's credibility and representativeness.

In addition, several participants mentioned that they felt the NHS-ST was open to 'gaming' or the potential for purposefully skewing figures to meet CQUIN or local improvement targets, particularly if organisations were concerned about trying to avoid oversampling acutely ill patients. This possibility undermined trust in the data.

### Mortality risks associated with emergency admissions during weekends and public holidays: an analysis of electronic health records [^113bnWrU]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Table
Cohort characteristics

Using model A, all the factors adjusted for in previous published analyses or studies of administrative datasets had an independent effect on 30-day mortality (C-statistic 0.88; appendix pp 9, 12), as did weekend emergency admission (adjusted relative risk [aRR] for Saturday vs Wednesday 1.08 [95% CI 1.03–1.14], aRR for Sunday vs Wednesday 1.09 [1.03–1.14]; figure 2). This excess mortality was slightly larger when we fitted the identical model to emergency admissions with all 15 test results (aRR for Saturday vs Wednesday 1.11 [95% CI 1.05–1.17], aRR for Sunday vs Wednesday 1.11 [1.05–1.18]; C-statistic 0.84; figure 2, appendix p 12), but we found no evidence of heterogeneity (p interaction = 0.18). There was no evidence that admissions with complete test results had higher adjusted mortality than those without all test results (aRR 1.01 [95% CI 0.98–1.04], p = 0.40). Absolute mortality risks, and excess risks associated with weekend admission, were greatest in the first 2–5 days after admission (figure 3).

### Weekend specialist intensity and admission mortality in acute hospital trusts in england: a cross-sectional study [^1163c2MJ]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first report of differences between weekend and weekday medical specialist staffing in a health-care system. Our findings show that emergency admissions to English hospitals on a Sunday collectively receive on average less than half the input (hours per ten emergency admissions) from specialists (consultants) of patients admitted on a Wednesday. In terms of numbers of specialists present and attending to patients who had been admitted as emergencies, no hospital achieved even 50% of Wednesday's staffing on a Sunday. Moreover, there was considerable variation between hospitals in specialist input on either a Sunday or a Wednesday, which was not a function of hospital size. The information from the point prevalence survey is supported by that from the directorate-level questionnaire focused on acute specialties: variation in daily ward rounds and gaps in consultant rotas are a source of concern for implementation of 7 day services.

With Wednesday as the reference point, we recorded a 13% excess mortality associated with Sunday admission in the 2013–14 Hospital Episodes Statistics dataset, and 9% on Saturday. However, there was no association between the Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratio and the weekend to weekday mortality ratio. The absence of an association in this preliminary cross-sectional study does not mean that we can discard the hypothesis that the weekend effect is attributable to insufficient presence of specialists, but it does require confirmation from the HiSLAC longitudinal study (phase 2) of concurrent secular changes in intensity and mortality. Caution must be exercised in attributing the weekend effect to a single component in a complex system.

Limitations of our study reflect the methodological challenges of doing health policy research in real time. To improve response rates by replacing surveys with time and motion studies of specialist involvement in the care of acutely ill patients would be prohibitively expensive and carry the risk of the Hawthorne effect, whereas repeated point prevalence surveys would generate respondent fatigue. Hospital Episodes Statistics data do not allow complete casemix adjustment. These limitations have several implications for our results.

### Reducing mortality from hip fractures: a systematic quality improvement programme [^114moFEa]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Weekend effect

The so called "weekend effect" for surgical patients has now been well publicised and debated in the public forum. We set out to investigate whether this effect applied to our patients. We audited over 1000 patients from April 2009 to September 2011 to compare mortality in our unit between weekday and weekends. There was no significant difference between our weekday and weekend mortality, although it was surprising that patients admitted on a Wednesday had the highest mortality at 9.2%. Patients admitted on a Wednesday to our trust are normally operated on a Thursday. The patients are not routinely reviewed by the junior doctors post operatively due to teaching. These patients may decompensate over the weekend since they are not seen by the physiotherapists or doctors; historically we prioritise those patients who are day one post-op for review over the weekend.

We implemented a quality improvement programme from 2012 to 2013 with the following interventions:

Physiotherapist to review our day two post-op (patient admitted on Wednesday) patients at weekends
Nurses to sit up these patients at weekends
Email trail highlighting these patients
Junior doctors to return to ward from teaching to review same day post-op, and we also implemented a change in our proforma to allow same day post op review for all our patients

Jet lag — timed light exposure guidance explains that intentional light exposure (or avoidance) at appropriate times of day can help facilitate circadian adaptation to the destination time zone, and when crossing time zones, light can play a key role in decreasing the duration of circadian desynchrony. Exposure to bright light in the morning following the circadian nadir (approximately 2–4 hours prior to habitual wake time) promotes phase advances, while exposure in the evening generally promotes phase delays. The optimal timing for light exposure is based on the direction of travel and the number of time zones crossed; consider using a jet lag calculator for individualized recommendations, and appropriately timed light exposure in combination with melatonin may further facilitate adaptation.

### Daylight saving time affects European mortality patterns [^112rjqeq]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

End-of-week patterns: a Sunday or Monday effect?

This study finds a peculiar, weekly pattern of mortality. It is defined as a significant decrease every Sunday (nadir) followed by a significant increase every Monday (peak), regardless of the season and throughout the year. This pattern only affects men and women aged above 40.

Scarce evidence exists in the literature that could account for this finding. A group of studies examining the temporal distribution of certain diseases that are prone to circadian and septadian rhythmicity distinctly point to an increased risk of MI, IS, sudden deaths, acute aortic dissections (AAD), and cardiac arrests on Mondays –. Challenging these established conclusions, recent data looking at sudden cardiac deaths and AAD suggest however that such temporal distribution either fades or become no longer significant, as psychosocial stressors — prominent triggers of cardiovascular accidents — tend to be more evenly distributed across the entire week. Significant associations with the first day of the week have also been reported for suicide, road traffic and workplace accidents –.

The greater incidence of mortality on Mondays could also be explained by a possible weekend effect, that is, an altered patient outcome — namely an increased mortality risk — if hospital admissions or interventions occur during the weekend –. Although causal pathways have always proved particularly difficult to determine, it has long been attributed to suboptimal senior staffing, systematic workflow disruptions, and characteristics of patients admitted on weekends (i.e. sicker) compared to weekdays –. Yet some authors have merely failed to identify such an effect, emphasising that it may only be clinically relevant in certain geographic locations, hospital settings, periods of the year, subgroups of patients, etc. In the context of a weekend effect, it is worth mentioning that the frequency of death has not been associated with any specific day of the week.

### The association of the day of the week with outcomes of infrainguinal lower extremity bypass [^113Qf4tY]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The day of the week (DOW) for performing procedures and operations has been shown to affect clinical and resource utilization outcomes. Limited published data are available on vascular surgery operations. Our primary objective was to assess outcomes by DOW for infrainguinal lower extremity bypass (LEB) performed for claudication or rest pain. The secondary objective was to assess outcomes by DOW for LEBs performed for tissue loss.

Methods

The Vascular Quality Initiative was queried from 2003 to 2018 for all elective index infrainguinal LEBs performed for claudication or rest pain. Cases performed for acute limb ischemia as well as concomitant peripheral vascular intervention, nonelective LEBs, sequential grafts, and weekend cases were excluded. LEBs were grouped by DOW: Monday-Tuesday (early weekdays) versus Wednesday-Friday (later weekdays). Baseline data, operative details, and outcomes were collected. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. LEBs performed for claudication/rest pain were analyzed together while tissue loss was assessed separately.

Results

There were 12,084 LEBs identified-44.5% performed on Monday-Tuesday and 55.5% on Wednesday-Friday. Overall, the mean age was 65.6 years, 68.6% were male, and 82.8% were Caucasian. LEBs were performed for claudication in 57.4% of cases. An autogenous great saphenous vein was used in 58.8% of cases, whereas a prosthetic graft was used in 35.1% of cases. The most common bypass origin was the femoral artery (94.1%), and target was the popliteal artery (70.1%). Significant differences between Monday-Tuesday versus Wednesday-Friday, respectively, were mean body mass index (27.8 kg/m² vs. 28 kg/m²), preoperative aspirin use (74.2% vs. 72.5%), continuous vein harvest technique (41.9% vs. 44%), and mean operative time (mins) (216.2 vs. 222.6) (all P < 0.05). Univariate postoperative outcomes were significantly different between Monday-Tuesday versus Wednesday-Friday, respectively, for mean length of stay (LOS) (days) (3.9 vs. 4.3), cardiac complications (myocardial infarction/dysrhythmia/congestive heart failure) (3.5% vs. 4.9%), stroke (0.3% vs. 0.6%), and respiratory complications (0.8% vs. 1.3%) (all P < 0.05). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that LEBs performed on Wednesday-Friday versus Monday-Tuesday for claudication/rest pain were independently associated with cardiac complications and prolonged LOS. There were also 8,491 LEBs performed for tissue loss which overall had similar findings to LEBs performed for claudication/rest pain such as increased LOS for LEBs performed for tissue loss on Wednesday-Friday (P < 0.001) and similar likeliness for respiratory complication, wound complication, return to the operating room, and mortality (all P > 0.05). However, LEBs performed for tissue loss on Wednesday-Friday versus Monday-Tuesday had similar cardiac complications (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Elective LEBs performed on later weekdays for claudication/rest pain were associated with cardiac complications and prolonged LOS, whereas tissue loss confirmed association with prolonged LOS. Further investigations are needed to identify whether increased resources or allocation of resources should be focused on later weekdays to optimize patient outcomes.

### Patterns of U.S. firearm injury emergency department visits by month, day, and time during 2018 to 2023 [^111brvZk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Monitoring temporal trends in firearm injury-related emergency department (ED) visits is challenging because traditional surveillance systems lack detailed temporal information.

Objective

To describe temporal patterns of ED visits for firearm injury using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Firearm Injury Surveillance Through Emergency Rooms (FASTER) program.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of firearm injury-related ED visits.

Setting

9 states (Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia) and the District of Columbia from 1 January 2018 to 31 August 2023.

Patients

ED visits for firearm injury (n = 93022) from CDC's FASTER program.

Measurements

ED visits for firearm injury per 100000 ED visits, analyzed by time of day (in 30-minute intervals), day of the week, day of the year, and holidays.

Results

From January 2018 through August 2023, there were 93022 firearm injury ED visits (73.9 per 100000 ED visits), or approximately 1 firearm injury every 30 minutes overall. Rates of firearm injury ED visits were highest between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m. and lowest between 10:00 and 10:30 a.m. Nighttime peaks and daily rates were highest on Friday and Saturday. Monthly rates were highest in July and lowest in February; daily rates were disproportionately high on most holidays, especially Independence Day and New Year's Eve.

Limitations

Data are limited to 9 states and the District of Columbia and are not nationally representative. The analysis of ED visits for firearm injury does not distinguish injury intent and is based on arrival time rather than actual injury time.

Conclusion

Distinct temporal patterns in firearm injury ED visits highlight resource allocation considerations for prevention and response efforts.

Between April 24 and July 10, the national number of ICU beds occupied was somewhat stable, but contributions by state fluctuated, with New York falling from 7,456 (95% CI, 5,191–9,722) on April 24 to 4,859 (95% CI, 3,009–6,708) on July 10. The number of ventilators in use by patients with COVID-19 showed strong contrast between states at the start and the end of the period. Again, New York had the highest number of ventilated patients with COVID-19 with 3,600 (95% CI, 2,477–4,724) on April 24, but this fell substantially to 216 (95% CI, 108–323) on July 10.

Jet lag — timed melatonin use notes that melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland in the brain during darkness and it is suppressed during the day with light exposure. Under a typical sleep-wake schedule without rapid travel across time zones, melatonin is secreted for approximately 12 hours at night — melatonin secretion starts to increase in the early evening about 2 hours before normal bedtime and peak plasma concentration occurs at approximately 3–4 a.m. Taking melatonin when the internal clock thinks it is morning will result in a phase delay which can facilitate adaptation to westward travel, whereas taking it when the internal clock thinks it is early evening will result in a phase advance which can facilitate adaptation to eastward travel. It is important to appropriately plan melatonin as taking it at the wrong time can increase misalignment, and taking melatonin when endogenous melatonin is high (body clock time 12–5 a.m.) is not as effective. Melatonin dosages vary, but 0.5–1 mg is often sufficient to produce a circadian shift.

### Weekend specialist intensity and admission mortality in acute hospital trusts in england: a cross-sectional study [^11564pvn]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Increased mortality rates associated with weekend hospital admission (the so-called weekend effect) have been attributed to suboptimum staffing levels of specialist consultants. However, evidence for a causal association is elusive, and the magnitude of the weekend specialist deficit remains unquantified. This uncertainty could hamper efforts by national health systems to introduce 7 day health services. We aimed to examine preliminary associations between specialist intensity and weekend admission mortality across the English National Health Service.

Methods

Eligible hospital trusts were those in England receiving unselected emergency admissions. On Sunday June 15 and Wednesday June 18, 2014, we undertook a point prevalence survey of hospital specialists (consultants) to obtain data relating to the care of patients admitted as emergencies. We defined specialist intensity at each trust as the self-reported estimated number of specialist hours per ten emergency admissions between 0800 h and 2000 h on Sunday and Wednesday. With use of data for all adult emergency admissions for financial year 2013–14, we compared weekend to weekday admission risk of mortality with the Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratio within each trust. We stratified trusts by size quintile.

Findings

127 of 141 eligible acute hospital trusts agreed to participate; 115 (91%) trusts contributed data to the point prevalence survey. Of 34 350 clinicians surveyed, 15 537 (45%) responded. Substantially fewer specialists were present providing care to emergency admissions on Sunday (1667 [11%]) than on Wednesday (6105 [42%]). Specialists present on Sunday spent 40% more time caring for emergency patients than did those present on Wednesday (mean 5.74 h [SD 3.39] vs 3.97 h [3.31]); however, the median specialist intensity on Sunday was only 48% (IQR 40–58) of that on Wednesday. The Sunday to Wednesday intensity ratio was less than 0.7 in 104 (90%) of the contributing trusts. Mortality risk among patients admitted at weekends was higher than among those admitted on weekdays (adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.11; p < 0.0001). There was no significant association between Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratios and weekend to weekday mortality ratios (r −0.042; p = 0.654).

Interpretation

This cross-sectional analysis did not detect a correlation between weekend staffing of hospital specialists and mortality risk for emergency admissions. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whole-system secular change during the implementation of 7 day services. Policy makers should exercise caution before attributing the weekend effect mainly to differences in specialist staffing.

### Weekend specialist intensity and admission mortality in acute hospital trusts in england: a cross-sectional study [^117RaFcE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Specialist intensity at each trust is defined as the self-reported estimated number of specialist hours per ten emergency admissions between 0800 h and 2000 h on Sunday and Wednesday. The emergency admission rate was obtained from thedataset and calculated as the mean for that day (Sunday or Wednesday, 24 h) throughout the financial year 2013–14. The imperfect correspondence between time windows for numerator and denominator takes into account the fact that specialists would have been attending emergency patients who had been admitted throughout the entire 24 h, not just those admitted during the day, and the absence of a time stamp in Hospital Episode Statistics data. Because not all specialists responded to the questionnaire, and in view of variable response rates between trusts, estimates of total specialist hours from the point prevalence survey were scaled up with the reciprocals of the survey response rates in each trust.

### The menstrual cycle is influenced by weekly and lunar rhythms [^115Mj4Te]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study whether the menstrual cycle has a circaseptan (7 days) rhythm and whether it is associated with the lunar cycle (also defined as the synodic month, it is the cycle of the phases of the Moon as seen from Earth, averaging 29.5 days in length).

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Subjects

A total of 35,940 European and North American women aged 18–40 years.

Exposure

Data were collected in real-life conditions.

Intervention

No intervention was performed.

Main Outcome Measure

The onset of menstruation was assessed in prospectively measured menstrual cycles (311,064 cycles) over 3 full years (2019–2021). Associations were calculated between the onset of menstruation and the day of the week, and between the onset of menstruation and the lunar phase.

Results

In this large data set, a circaseptan (7-day) rhythmicity of menstruation was observed, with a peak (acrophase) of menstrual onset on Thursdays and Fridays. This circaseptan rhythm was observed in every age group, in every phase of the lunar cycle, and in all seasons. This feature was most pronounced for cycle durations between 27 and 29 days. In winter, the circaseptan rhythm was found in cycles of 27–29 days, but not in other cycle lengths. A circalunar rhythm was also statistically significant, but not as clearly defined as the circaseptan rhythm. The peak (acrophase) of the circalunar rhythm of menstrual onset varied according to the season. In addition, there was a small but statistically significant interaction between the circaseptan rhythm and the lunar cycle.

Conclusion

Although relatively small in amplitude, the weekly rhythm of menstruation was statistically significant. Menstruation occurs more often on Thursdays and Fridays than on other days of the week. This is particularly true for women whose cycles last between 27 and 29 days. Circalunar rhythmicity was also statistically significant. However, it is less pronounced than the weekly rhythm.

### Incidence of monkeypox among unvaccinated persons compared with persons receiving ≥ 1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose-32 U.S. jurisdictions, July 31-September 3, 2022 [^112bfRwc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Weekly monkeypox incidence during July 31–September 3 was higher among unvaccinated persons than among those who had received their first JYNNEOS vaccine dose ≥ 14 days earlier (Figure). Average IRR comparing unvaccinated persons with those who received 1 dose of vaccine ≥ 14 days earlier was 14.3 (95% CI = 5.0–41.0). A sensitivity analysis expanding the estimated number of persons eligible for vaccination yielded similar trends but lower average IRR (Supplementary Figure). A sensitivity analysis examining changes to IRR assuming 50% or 100% of persons with unknown vaccination date received their vaccine dose ≥ 14 days before illness onset yielded similar trends but lower average IRR (Supplementary Table).

### Pre-to-post COVID-19 pandemic trends in time from emergency department arrival to inpatient floor arrival: door to floor time [^11596pWy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Boarding of admitted patients in the Emergency Department (ED) changes both the setting and teams providing care during the initial phase of admissions. We measured the waiting time from ED door arrival to inpatient floor arrival for 17,944 admissions to internal medicine services over a 5-year period from 2018 to 2023 and propose this as a metric for the total delay in care associated with ED boarding, termed "Door to Floor" (DTF) time. We find a sustained increase as well as significant seasonal and day-of-the-week variation in DTF times. DTF times increased over weekends and peaked on Monday suggesting a contribution from reduced number of discharges on weekends. The majority of DTF time arises from time in the ED after the disposition decision is made. Determining patterns in boarding time as well as of which phases of care contribute to boarding time can be used inform and track interventions.

### Weekend specialist intensity and admission mortality in acute hospital trusts in england: a cross-sectional study [^113Bb1Ly]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Increased mortality rates associated with weekend hospital admission (the so-called weekend effect) have been attributed to suboptimum staffing levels of specialist consultants. However, evidence for a causal association is elusive, and the magnitude of the weekend specialist deficit remains unquantified. This uncertainty could hamper efforts by national health systems to introduce 7 day health services. We aimed to examine preliminary associations between specialist intensity and weekend admission mortality across the English National Health Service.

Methods

Eligible hospital trusts were those in England receiving unselected emergency admissions. On Sunday June 15 and Wednesday June 18, 2014, we undertook a point prevalence survey of hospital specialists (consultants) to obtain data relating to the care of patients admitted as emergencies. We defined specialist intensity at each trust as the self-reported estimated number of specialist hours per ten emergency admissions between 0800 h and 2000 h on Sunday and Wednesday. With use of data for all adult emergency admissions for financial year 2013–14, we compared weekend to weekday admission risk of mortality with the Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratio within each trust. We stratified trusts by size quintile.

Findings

127 of 141 eligible acute hospital trusts agreed to participate; 115 (91%) trusts contributed data to the point prevalence survey. Of 34,350 clinicians surveyed, 15,537 (45%) responded. Substantially fewer specialists were present providing care to emergency admissions on Sunday (1667 [11%]) than on Wednesday (6105 [42%]). Specialists present on Sunday spent 40% more time caring for emergency patients than did those present on Wednesday (mean 5.74 h [SD 3.39] vs 3.97 h [3.31]); however, the median specialist intensity on Sunday was only 48% (IQR 40–58) of that on Wednesday. The Sunday to Wednesday intensity ratio was less than 0.7 in 104 (90%) of the contributing trusts. Mortality risk among patients admitted at weekends was higher than among those admitted on weekdays (adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.11; p < 0.0001). There was no significant association between Sunday to Wednesday specialist intensity ratios and weekend to weekday mortality ratios (r -0.042; p = 0.654).

Interpretation

This cross-sectional analysis did not detect a correlation between weekend staffing of hospital specialists and mortality risk for emergency admissions. Further investigation is needed to evaluate whole-system secular change during the implementation of 7 day services. Policy makers should exercise caution before attributing the weekend effect mainly to differences in specialist staffing.

### Association of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and outcomes with the day of the week that patients undergo a repair or receive a diagnosis [^1153Tunn]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Because variation in care on weekends has been reported in many surgical fields, it is of interest if variations were noted for care patterns of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRDs).

Objective

To assess the association between modality of RRD repair and day of the week that patients receive a diagnosis or undergo RRD repair.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective claims-based cohort analysis was performed of primary RRD surgery for 38 144 commercially insured patients in the United States who received a diagnosis of incident RRD between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016, and underwent repair within 14 days of diagnosis. Multinomial regression models were used to assess patients' likelihood of repair with different modalities, logistic regression models were used to assess patients' likelihood of reoperation, and linear regression models were used to assess time from diagnosis to repair. Data analysis was performed from March 9 to September 5, 2019.

Exposures

Day of the week that the patient received a diagnosis of RRD or underwent RRD repair.

Main Outcome and Measures

Modality of repair, time from diagnosis to repair, and 30-day reoperation rate.

Results

Among the 38 144 patients in the study (23 031 men [60.4%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 56.8 [13.4] years), pneumatic retinopexy (PR) was more likely to occur when patients received a diagnosis of RRD on Friday (relative risk ratio [RRR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.17–1.60), Saturday (RRR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36–2.20), or Sunday (RRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.08–2.17) compared with Wednesday. Pneumatic retinopexy was more likely to be used for surgical procedures on Friday (RRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.33–1.80), Saturday (RRR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.61–2.56), Sunday (RRR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.55–3.35), or Monday (RRR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.46–1.98). Patients undergoing PR on Sundays were more likely to receive another procedure (PR, scleral buckle, or pars plana vitrectomy) within 30 days (odds ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.07–2.45). An association between the need for reoperation for repairs performed via scleral buckle or pars plana vitrectomy and the day of the week of the initial repair was not identified. Patients who received a diagnosis on a Friday waited a mean of 0.28 days (95% CI, 0.20–0.36 days) longer for repair than patients who received a diagnosis on a Wednesday.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that management of RRD varies according to the day of the week that diagnosis and repair occurs, with PR disproportionately likely to be used to repair RRDs during the weekend. Ophthalmologists should be aware that these results suggest that patients undergoing PR on Sundays may be more likely to require reoperation within 30 days.

During February 29–June 1, 2020, a total of 203,792 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed and reported § among residents of NYC, including 54,211 (26.6%) in persons known to have been hospitalized and 18,679 (9.2%) in persons who died. The age-adjusted cumulative citywide incidences were 2,263 cases, 582 hospitalizations, and 198 deaths per 100,000 population. Case counts increased rapidly from a weekly mean of 274 diagnosed cases per day during the week of March 8 to a peak weekly mean of 5,132 cases per day by the week of March 29 (Figure 1). Hospital admissions also peaked the week of March 29 (weekly mean = 1,566 admissions per day). Deaths peaked during the week of April 5 (weekly mean = 566 per day). The median duration of hospitalization was 6 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 3–11 days). Among decedents with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the median interval from diagnosis to death was 8 days (IQR = 4–16 days). Among hospitalized patients, 32.1% were known to have died. The weekly proportion of hospitalized patients who died was highest among those admitted during March 22–April 5 (mean = 36.4%; range = 33.5%–38.2%).

### Comparison of pregnancy preferences preceding vs year 1 of the COVID-19 pandemic [^116UUXu3]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic affected people's desire to avoid pregnancy is essential for interpreting the pandemic's associations with access to reproductive health care and reproductive autonomy. Early research is largely cross-sectional and relies on people's own evaluations of how their desires changed.

Objective

To investigate longitudinal changes in pregnancy desires during the year before and the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cohort study, participants reported their pregnancy preferences at baseline and quarterly for up to 18 months between March 2019 and March 2021. An interrupted time series analysis with mixed-effects segmented linear regression was used to examine population-averaged time trends. People were recruited from 7 primary and reproductive health care facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Participants were sexually active, pregnancy-capable people aged 15 to 34 years who were not pregnant or sterilized. Data analysis was performed from September 2021 to January 2022.

Exposures

Continuous time, with knots at the onset of the first (July 1, 2020, summer surge) and second (November 1, 2020, fall surge) COVID-19 cases surges in the Southwest.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Preferences around potential pregnancy in the next 3 months, measured using the validated Desire to Avoid Pregnancy (DAP) scale (range, 0–4, with 4indicating ahigher desire to avoid pregnancy).

Results

The 627 participants in the analytical sample had a mean (SD) age of 24.9 (4.9) years; 320 (51.0%) identified as Latinx and 180 (28.7%) as White. Over the year before the first case surge in the US Southwest in summer 2020, population-averaged DAP scores decreased steadily over time (-0.06 point per quarter; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.04 point per quarter; P < .001). During the summer 2020 surge, DAP scores stopped declining (0.05 point per quarter; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.13 point per quarter; change in slope, P < .001). During the fall 2020 surge, however, DAP scores declined again at -0.11 point per quarter (95% CI, -0.26 to 0.04 point per quarter; change in slope, P = 0.10). Participants aged 15 to 24 years and those who were nulliparous and primiparous experienced greater declines in DAP score before the summer surge, and greater reversals of decline between summer and fall 2020, than did those who were aged 25 to 34 years and multiparous.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic onset was associated with the stalling of a prior trend toward greater desire for pregnancy over time, particularly for people earlier in their reproductive lives.

### Changing age distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic-United States, may-August 2020 [^111327vh]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

CDC examined age trends during May–August for 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) using three indicators: 1) COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits; 2) positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results; and 3) confirmed COVID-19 cases. COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits, reported by health facilities to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), † had fever with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing in the chief complaint text or a discharge diagnostic code for COVID-19 and no diagnostic codes for influenza. § Analyses of COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits were based on the ED visit date.

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results were obtained from COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting data submitted by state health departments (37 states) and, when age was unavailable in state-submitted data, from data submitted directly by public health, commercial, and reference laboratories (13 states and DC). Data represent the number of specimens tested, not individual persons who received testing. Analyses were based on the specimen collection date or test order date. The daily percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (percent positivity) was calculated as the number of positive test results divided by the sum of positive and negative test results.

Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from individual-level case reports submitted by state health departments ††; analyses were based on the date the case was reported to CDC. §§ Confirmed COVID-19 cases had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result. Case data represent individual persons (some of whom might have had multiple positive test results). Monthly incidence was calculated using 2018 U.S. Census population estimates.

National case counts, percentage distributions, and estimated incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases were calculated by 10-year age increments and by month (May–August). The weekly median age of persons with COVID-19–like illness-related ED visits, positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as that of persons for whom all SARS-CoV-2 tests were conducted, were plotted nationally for the four U.S. Census regions. To minimize the impact of testing availability on findings, the early pandemic period (January–April) was excluded.

2.3 External Genital Warts

Imiquimod Cream should be applied 3 times per week to external genital/perianal warts. Imiquimod Cream treatment should continue until there is total clearance of the genital/perianal warts or for a maximum of 16 weeks. Examples of 3 times per week application schedules are: Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Imiquimod Cream should be applied prior to normal sleeping hours and left on the skin for 6–10 hours, after which time the cream should be removed by washing the area with mild soap and water. The prescriber should demonstrate the proper application technique to maximize the benefit of Imiquimod Cream therapy.

It is recommended that patients wash their hands before and after applying Imiquimod Cream.

A thin layer of Imiquimod Cream should be applied to the wart area and rubbed in until the cream is no longer visible. The application site should not be occluded. Following the treatment period the cream should be removed by washing the treated area with mild soap and water.

Local skin reactions at the treatment site are common [see Adverse Reactions (6.3, 6.5)]. A rest period of several days may be taken if required by the patient's discomfort or severity of the local skin reaction. Treatment may resume once the reaction subsides. Non-occlusive dressings such as cotton gauze or cotton underwear may be used in the management of skin reactions.

Imiquimod Cream is packaged in single-use packets which contain sufficient cream to cover a wart area of up to 20 cm²; use of excessive amounts of cream should be avoided.

### Weekends affect mortality risk and chance of discharge in critically ill patients: a retrospective study in the Austrian registry for intensive care [^112Rqmk6]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

A total of 13,887 (9.2%) patients died in the ICU, and 137,381 (90.8%) were discharged. Overall, 20,537 (13.7%) hospital deaths and 129,147 hospital discharges were observed. Both unadjusted hospital and ICU mortality differed between weekdays and weekends. Eight per cent of patients admitted on a Wednesday died in the ICU, while 13.1% of patients admitted on Saturdays and 13.4% of patients admitted on Sundays died in the ICU. A total 12.4% of patients admitted to the ICU on Wednesday died in hospital; 18.5% of patients admitted to the ICU on Saturdays and 19.4% of patients admitted on Sundays died during their hospital stay. The observed-to-expected (O/E, (95% CI)) ratio for hospital mortality was 0.71 (0.69–0.73) on Wednesdays compared with 0.78 (0.75–0.80) on Saturdays and 0.79 (0.77–0.82) on Sundays. Table 1 presents detailed patient demographics and outcome data. Additional file 1: Table S2 describes reasons for admission in depth.

Patients admitted to the ICU at weekends had higher summative TISS-28 scores than patients admitted during the week, yet there was no discernible difference in these scores between individual days of admission (Table 1).

### SARS-CoV-2 serial interval variation, Montana, USA, March 1-July 31, 2020 [^117AVxHo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

We report mean severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serial intervals for Montana, USA, from 583 transmission pairs; infectors' symptom onset dates occurred during March 1-July 31, 2020. Our estimate was 5.68 (95% CI 5.27–6.08) days, SD 4.77 (95% CI 4.33–5.19) days. Subperiod estimates varied temporally by nonpharmaceutical intervention type and fluctuating incidence.
