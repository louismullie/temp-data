## Question

Osteoporosis with pericarditis in adult patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage pericarditis in an adult patient who also has pre-existing osteoporosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging the pericarditis. Then, I should assess severity and identify high-risk features. Next, I will review the baseline osteoporosis status and fracture risk. After that, I need to outline a corticosteroid-sparing anti-inflammatory strategy and consider when to escalate to IL-1 blockade. Finally, I will integrate osteoporosis management, exercise restrictions, monitoring, and referral pathways to ensure comprehensive, guideline-concordant care.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and categorize the pericarditis phenotype because treatment hinges on this framework. Typical pericarditis features include pleuritic chest pain, pericardial rub, new diffuse ST elevation or PR depression, pericardial effusion, and elevated inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR, so I should verify these against the updated ACC criteria and ensure the episode is acute, incessant, or recurrent based on duration and symptom-free intervals, as this guides duration of therapy and taper strategy [^114RAFkU] [^111qFfrY] [^115bhvie].

> Wait, let me verify severity and complications before I jump into therapy, because large effusions, tamponade physiology, or suspected constriction alter urgency and choice of interventions. I should obtain an echocardiogram to assess effusion size and hemodynamics, consider cardiac MRI if inflammation is uncertain or constriction is suspected, and screen for autoimmune, infectious, or neoplastic etiologies if atypical features are present, as this will shape escalation and duration of therapy [^11529vFA] [^112heSAf] [^111i7gik].

> Next, I should review the osteoporosis baseline because pre-existing bone disease mandates a corticosteroid-sparing approach and early osteoporosis-specific therapy. I need to check the most recent DEXA T-scores, document prior fragility fractures, assess calcium and vitamin D sufficiency, and stratify fracture risk using FRAX to guide pharmacologic intensity and urgency, keeping in mind that antiresorptives and anabolic agents have distinct roles and time horizons for benefit [^112RR2VL].

> Hold on, I should verify first-line anti-inflammatory therapy for pericarditis and its compatibility with osteoporosis. Dual therapy with high-dose aspirin or NSAIDs plus colchicine is recommended as first-line for acute and recurrent pericarditis, with colchicine continued for 3 months after the first episode and at least 6 months after a recurrence, as colchicine significantly reduces recurrences and hospitalizations without increasing serious adverse events in randomized data, which is especially valuable in someone with high fracture risk [^115UKyoS] [^113JDYw2].

> I need to ensure GI protection because high-dose NSAIDs increase ulcer risk, so concomitant proton pump inhibitor therapy is prudent, and I should confirm dosing adjustments for colchicine in renal impairment or with interacting medications that inhibit P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 to mitigate toxicity, while still delivering the evidence-based recurrence-prevention dose [^116pMNfn] [^113JDYw2].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a bisphosphonate and needs to avoid NSAIDs due to GI risk or contraindications. In that scenario, I should prioritize colchicine as monotherapy initially, acknowledging that stand-alone colchicine for acute pericarditis has weaker direct evidence and that clinical judgment must weigh recurrence prevention against analgesic needs and bleeding risk, with close monitoring and early reassessment of response [^1168YuNR].

> I will now examine the inflammatory phenotype because this steers whether to escalate to IL-1 blockade versus cautiously consider corticosteroids. An elevated hs-CRP above about 10 mg/L suggests an autoinflammatory phenotype in which anti–IL-1 agents such as anakinra or rilonacept are preferred as steroid-sparing second-line therapy after failure or intolerance of NSAIDs and colchicine, whereas low or normal CRP points toward a non-inflammatory phenotype where low-to-medium dose corticosteroids may be considered, albeit with heightened vigilance for bone loss [^1167TFfR] [^112Ggz4W] [^112FQ4uU].

> Let me consider specific anti–IL-1 options and practicalities. Anakinra 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 100 mg/day is effective and allows rapid on/off control with relatively short half-life, while rilonacept 320 mg loading followed by 160 mg weekly achieved large reductions in recurrence in RHAPSODY and supports prolonged therapy when needed, with both ACC and ESC endorsing these agents as steroid-sparing options in appropriately selected patients, and with pre-treatment screening for latent TB, HIV, and hepatitis B/C before initiation [^11534TLw] [^112Ggz4W] [^1112M2Xh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought steroids were broadly contraindicated here, but I should correct that. While pre-existing osteoporosis argues strongly against steroids, guidelines allow cautious, low-to-medium dose prednisone at 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day with a very slow taper over months only when anti–IL-1 agents are unavailable, contraindicated, or declined, and only if accompanied by aggressive osteoporosis prophylaxis and the lowest effective dose, given the high risk of iatrogenic fractures and steroid dependence [^114oqDja] [^113uFs4L] [^112LRMxa].

> I need to ensure comprehensive osteoporosis therapy is initiated or optimized in parallel with pericarditis management. First-line antiresorptives such as oral bisphosphonates for up to 5 years or IV bisphosphonates for up to 3 years should be started, with denosumab 60 mg every 6 months as an alternative when bisphosphonates are contraindicated or not tolerated, and calcium 1000–1200 mg/day plus vitamin D 800–1000 IU/day should be ensured; in very high-risk patients with multiple vertebral fractures or T-score ≤ −3.0, anabolic therapy such as teriparatide or abaloparatide for up to 2 years followed by an antiresorptive is appropriate to rebuild bone and reduce fractures, with attention to cardiovascular risk when considering romosozumab [^112RR2VL].

> Next, I should review exercise and activity guidance because cardiopulmonary load can aggravate pericarditis and should be restricted during active disease. All patients should restrict physical activity during active symptoms and for at least 30 days after diagnosis or a flare, keeping heart rate below 100 bpm, which I should reinforce alongside medication adherence and symptom tracking at each visit [^114PL9fn] [^113JDYw2].

> I will now examine monitoring cadence to detect recurrence early and mitigate treatment toxicities. Follow-up should include symptom assessment, ECG, inflammatory markers such as CRP, and echocardiography at intervals aligned with disease activity, with many programs using 3-month nurse-led reviews and 6-month specialist visits, and with earlier imaging if symptoms recur or new effusion is suspected; this structured approach supports timely taper adjustments and early detection of steroid-related complications if steroids are used [^111i7gik] [^112heSAf].

> Hold on, I should verify referral triggers and multidisciplinary coordination. Referral to a pericardial diseases center is reasonable for recurrent or incessant disease, complicated effusions, suspected constriction, or when considering anti–IL-1 therapy or pericardiectomy, and co-management with endocrinology for osteoporosis, rheumatology for autoimmune etiologies, infectious disease for TB or HIV, and cardiothoracic surgery for refractory cases ensures comprehensive care and access to advanced therapies [^112heSAf] [^115uMhnb] [^111i7gik].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios that could change management. In tuberculous pericarditis, adjunctive corticosteroids may be considered in selected HIV-negative patients to reduce constriction risk, but this must be balanced against bone toxicity and coordinated with full antituberculous therapy. In pregnancy, colchicine and cautious corticosteroids are preferred over NSAIDs. And in post–cardiac injury syndromes, colchicine and aspirin-based regimens are favored while avoiding routine NSAIDs early after MI, with IL-1 blockade considered for refractory cases [^112FaQga] [^114hCdGP] [^112sJ8Nj] [^111tyu9k].

> Finally, I should double-check that the patient education plan covers adherence, taper discipline, and red flags. Emphasizing that abrupt steroid taper increases recurrence risk, that colchicine must be continued for the full recommended duration, and that new dyspnea, syncope, or escalating chest pain warrant urgent evaluation helps align expectations and reduce complications, while reinforcing osteoporosis safety measures and fracture prevention strategies throughout [^11627W8o] [^113JDYw2] [^112RR2VL].

In adults with osteoporosis and pericarditis, **colchicine plus NSAIDs is first-line** [^115UKyoS] to reduce recurrence and avoid glucocorticoids [^1111H4mk]; if steroids are unavoidable, use the lowest effective dose with a slow taper [^114oqDja] and start osteoporosis prophylaxis (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates) [^112RR2VL]. Anti–IL-1 agents (anakinra, rilonacept) are preferred second-line for recurrent or steroid-dependent cases to minimize steroid exposure [^116Hjfzb] [^111GtRaU]. Monitor bone density, fracture risk, and adverse effects at regular intervals, and coordinate care with cardiology, rheumatology, and endocrinology [^112heSAf].

---

## Pathophysiological connection

Osteoporosis and pericarditis are linked through **chronic inflammation and corticosteroid use**. Chronic inflammation increases bone resorption and impairs bone formation, while corticosteroids — often used for pericarditis — accelerate bone loss and increase fracture risk [^112LRMxa].

---

## Clinical implications

### Diagnostic considerations

- **Bone density assessment**: Baseline and periodic DEXA scans to monitor osteoporosis progression and fracture risk [^notfound].

- **Inflammatory markers**: Regular CRP and ESR to guide therapy and detect flares [^113JDYw2].

- **Imaging**: Echocardiography and cardiac MRI to assess pericarditis activity and complications [^111i7gik].

---

### Therapeutic challenges

Balancing effective pericarditis control with **minimizing bone loss** is the key challenge; corticosteroids, while effective, significantly increase osteoporosis risk and fracture incidence [^112LRMxa] [^114oqDja].

---

## Management strategies

### Pharmacological management

#### Pericarditis treatment

- **First-line therapy**: NSAIDs plus colchicine [^115UKyoS] to reduce recurrence and avoid glucocorticoids [^116LN87g].

- **Second-line therapy**: Anti–IL-1 agents (anakinra, rilonacept) for recurrent or steroid-dependent cases to minimize steroid exposure [^112Ggz4W] [^111GtRaU].

- **Glucocorticoids**: Use only if necessary, at the lowest effective dose, with a slow taper and concurrent osteoporosis prophylaxis [^114oqDja].

---

#### Osteoporosis management

- **Calcium and vitamin D**: Foundation therapy for all patients [^notfound].

- **Bisphosphonates**: First-line antiresorptive therapy to reduce fracture risk [^112RR2VL].

- **Denosumab**: Alternative when bisphosphonates are contraindicated or ineffective [^notfound].

- **Parathyroid hormone analogs**: For severe osteoporosis or when antiresorptives are inadequate [^112RR2VL].

---

### Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological management emphasizes **lifestyle modifications** — weight-bearing and resistance exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation — to support bone health and reduce fracture risk [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should include **bone density monitoring** with periodic DEXA scans to assess treatment response and adjust therapy [^notfound]. Cardiovascular monitoring should track pericarditis recurrence, complications, and medication adverse effects [^111i7gik]. Ongoing assessment of fracture risk should guide therapy adjustments [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A coordinated approach involving **cardiology, rheumatology, and endocrinology** ensures optimal management of both conditions [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Aspect** | **Pericarditis management** | **Osteoporosis management** |
|-|-|-|
| First-line | NSAIDs + colchicine [^115UKyoS] | Calcium + vitamin D [^notfound] |
| Second-line | Anti–IL-1 agents [^113uFs4L] | Bisphosphonates [^notfound] |
| Steroids | Lowest effective dose + slow taper [^114oqDja] | Avoid if possible |
| Monitoring | Echocardiography, CRP, ESR [^111i7gik] | DEXA scans, fracture risk [^notfound] |
| Multidisciplinary | Cardiology, rheumatology | Endocrinology |

---

Management of osteoporosis with pericarditis in adults requires a **careful balance** between controlling inflammation and preserving bone health. Prioritize NSAIDs plus colchicine, reserve steroids for refractory cases with bone protection, and use anti–IL-1 agents to reduce steroid exposure, with regular monitoring and multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes [^113uFs4L].

14.3		Recurrent Pericarditis

The efficacy and safety of ARCALYST were evaluated in the Phase 3 study RHAPSODY (NCT03737110), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, multinational study. The study consisted of a 12-week run-in followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period.

In the run-in period, adult patients received a loading dose of ARCALYST 320 mg followed by 160 mg weekly. Patients between 12 and 17 years of age received a loading dose of ARCALYST 4.4 mg/kg (up to 320 mg) followed by 2.2 mg/kg (up to 160 mg) weekly. During the run-in period, patients tapered and discontinued standard-of-care therapies.

In the withdrawal period, patients were randomized 1:1 to remain on ARCALYST 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. The randomized withdrawal period continued until the pre-specified number of primary efficacy endpoint events (pericarditis recurrence) had accrued.

Patients recorded scores for pericarditis pain in a daily diary using the 0 to 10 NRS scale. Measurements of CRP, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms were conducted at intervals during study visits and to assess pericarditis recurrence

### Recurrent pericarditis in older adults: clinical and laboratory features and outcome [^112MaVtN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pericarditis refer to the general adult population. Few and fragmentary data regarding recurrent pericarditis in older adults exist.

Objective Of The Study

Given the absence of specific data in scientific literature, we hypothesized that there might be clinical, laboratory and outcome differences between young adults and older adults affected by idiopathic recurrent pericarditis.

Materials and Methods

We performed an international multicentric retrospective cohort study analyzing data from patients affected by recurrent pericarditis (idiopathic or post-cardiac injury) and referring to tertiary referral centers. Clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were compared between patients younger than 65years (controls) and patients aged 65 or older.

Results

One hundred and thirty-three older adults and 142 young adult controls were enrolled. Comorbidities, including chronic kidney diseases, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes, were more present in older adults. The presenting symptom was dyspnea in 54.1% of the older adults versus 10.6% in controls (p < 0.001); pain in 32.3% of the older adults versus 80.3% of the controls (p < 0.001). Fever higher than 38°C was present in 33.8% versus 53.5% (p = 0.001). Pleural effusion was more prevalent in the older adults (55.6% vs 34.5%, p < 0.001), as well as severe pericardial effusion (> 20mm) (24.1% vs 12.7%, p = 0.016) and pericardiocentesis (16.5% vs 8.5%, p = 0.042). Blood leukocyte counts were significantly lower in the older adults (mean+SE: 10,227+289/mm³ vs 11,208+285/mm³, p = 0.016). Concerning therapies, NSAIDS were used in 63.9% of the older adults versus 80.3% in the younger (p = 0.003), colchicine in 76.7% versus 87.3% (p = 0.023), corticosteroids in 49.6% versus 26.8% (p < 0.001), and anakinra in 14.3% versus 23.9% (p = 0.044).

Conclusions

Older adults affected by recurrent pericarditis show a different clinical pattern, with more frequent dyspnea, pleural effusion, severe pericardial effusion, and lower fever and lower leukocyte count, making the diagnosis sometimes challenging. They received significantly less NSAIDs and colchicine, likely due to comorbidities; they were also treated less commonly with anti-IL1 agents, and more frequently with corticosteroids.

### IL-1 pathway inhibition in recurrent pericarditis management: real-world adoption of corticosteroid sparing in RESONANCE [^111GtRaU]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 40,000 patients in the United States have recurrent pericarditis (RP), a chronic autoinflammatory disease mediated by interleukin (IL)-1; of these, approximately 14,000 experience multiple recurrences. RP involves episodic flares characterized by debilitating chest pain, and patients experience substantial morbidity and reduced health-related quality of life due to the multiple flares and fear of future recurrences.

RP is a persistent and burdensome disease which often warrants several years of treatment. For patients with incomplete response to first-line therapy (ie, high-dose [500–1000 mg every 6–8 hours] aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and/or colchicine), the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommended corticosteroids as second-line therapy. Advanced targeted therapy (ie, IL-1 pathway inhibition) was restricted to third-line therapy (only after patients had failed or had not tolerated corticosteroids), based on the limited evidence available at the time. Corticosteroid use over the duration of the disease, however, entails serial tapering regimens which may increase the frequency of future recurrences and predispose patients to osteoporosis, worsening of diabetes, hypertension, and health-related quality of life consequences. These complications underscore the need for an updated treatment algorithm utilizing corticosteroid-sparing strategies.

Clinical evidence reported after these guidelines had been published showed that IL-1α and IL-1β mediate the pathophysiology of RP through the inappropriate induction and activation, respectively, of the innate immune system in a self-perpetuating cycle of autoinflammation. The phase 3 trial RHAPSODY (Rilonacept Inhibition of Interleukin-1 Alpha and Beta for Recurrent Pericarditis: a Pivotal Symptomatology and Outcomes Study) demonstrated that rilonacept (IL-1α and IL-1β cytokine trap) effectively treated RP and, as monotherapy, reduced risk of recurrence in both third-line (after corticosteroids) and second-line (instead of corticosteroids) use, which led to the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) expansion of therapeutic indications for rilonacept in March 2021 to include treatment of RP and reduction in risk of recurrence regardless of prior treatment. Subsequently, increased emphasis has been placed on IL-1 pathway inhibition as a potential second-line corticosteroid-sparing therapy, consistent with this clinical trial evidence.

Assumptions and definitions — pericardial entities are defined to guide diagnosis and management: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium leading to characteristic pleuritic chest pain which can be accompanied by pericardial rub, typical electrocardiogram changes, new or worsening pericardial effusion, and elevated inflammatory markers; pericardial effusion is fluid accumulation in the pericardial space visible on imaging such as echocardiography; cardiac tamponade is compression of the heart by abnormal fluid accumulation causing impaired cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise; constrictive pericarditis is loss of elasticity with often abnormal pericardial thickening that impairs diastolic filling and leads to heart failure symptoms and can be transient/subacute (predominantly inflammatory and reversible) or advanced/chronic (often calcified and irreversible); effusive constrictive pericarditis is persistent constrictive physiology even after drainage of pericardial effusion.

### Recurrent pericarditis: new and emerging therapeutic options [^1113QiEU]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pericarditis is one of the most common and troublesome complications after an episode of pericarditis, and affects 20–50% of patients treated for pericarditis. In most of these patients, the pericarditis remains idiopathic, although an immune-mediated (either autoimmune or autoinflammatory) pathogenesis is often presumed. The mainstay of therapy for recurrences is aspirin or NSAIDs, with the adjunct of colchicine. Corticosteroids are a second-line option to be considered for specific indications, such as connective tissue disease or pregnancy; contraindications or intolerance to aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or colchicine; or insufficient response to these medications. Furthermore, corticosteroids can be added to NSAIDs and colchicine in patients with persistent symptoms. In patients who do not respond adequately to any of these conventional therapies, alternative treatment options include azathioprine, intravenous human immunoglobulins, and anakinra. An improved understanding of how recurrent pericarditis develops after an initiating event is critical to prevent this complication, and further research is needed into the pathogenesis of recurrences. We discuss the aetiology and diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis, and extensively review the treatment options for this condition.

### Complicated pericarditis: understanding risk factors and pathophysiology to Inform Imaging and treatment [^11529vFA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients with acute pericarditis have a benign course and a good prognosis. However, a minority of patients develop complicated pericarditis, and the care of these patients is the focus of this review. Specifically, we address risk factors, multimodality imaging, pathophysiology, and novel treatments. The authors conclude that: 1) early high-dose corticosteroids, a lack of colchicine, and an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein are associated with the development of complicated pericarditis; 2) in select cases, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may aid in the assessment of pericardial inflammation and constriction; 3) given phenotypic similarities between recurrent idiopathic pericarditis and periodic fever syndromes, disorders of the inflammasome may contribute to relapsing attacks; and 4) therapies that target the inflammasome may lead to more durable remission and resolution. Finally, regarding future investigations, the authors discuss the potential of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to inform treatment duration and the need to compare steroid-sparing treatments to pericardiectomy.

Anti–IL–1 therapy and adjuncts in recurrent pericarditis — For patients with an autoinflammatory process, these agents should be considered the preferred option over corticosteroids; other anti‑inflammatories may be sequentially weaned after anti–IL–1 initiation (prednisone, then NSAID, then colchicine), with colchicine sometimes continued for additive or synergistic benefit, particularly with anakinra. Recurrence while on therapy is very low, but many patients (~50%–75%) recur after discontinuation, and a long‑term extension of RHAPSODY supports prolonged therapy beyond 18 months. Low‑dose corticosteroids are typically utilized when there is no inflammatory phenotype. Azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulins may also be considered after failure of corticosteroids and anti–IL–1 agents. If radical pericardiectomy on cardiopulmonary bypass is pursued as a last‑resort or alternative option at high‑volume experienced centers, anti‑inflammatory medications may be continued until surgery and for 3 to 6 months when indicated for ongoing pericardial inflammation.

Pericarditis epidemiology and distribution — burden, demographics, and setting-specific causes are as follows: Pericarditis accounts for 0.1% of hospital admissions and 5% of emergency department evaluations for chest pain, and approximately 0.2% of all cardiovascular admissions are attributable to acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis occurs more commonly in men aged 16 to 65 years and declines by an estimated 51% per 10-year increase in age, whereas recurrent pericarditis is more common in women. Pericarditis is classified based on etiology, clinical course, morphology, and associated impact of fluid characteristics, size, and hemodynamics. Idiopathic and viral etiologies are the most common cause of pericarditis in high-income countries, whereas tuberculosis, often HIV-associated, is the most common cause in low-income countries.

### A network medicine approach to study comorbidities in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115kA5Ds]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

These comorbidity profiles might be influenced by age, sex, time of visit, or time relative to HF diagnosis. We therefore investigated whether these factors influence the assignment of these 100 comorbidities to HF subtype by fitting a series of logistic regression models in different data subsets (Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods). We found that the derived comorbidity profiles of HFpEF and HFrEF yielded mostly consistent patterns independent of these factors (Additional file 1: Fig. S4).

The HFpEF profile (15 disease categories) was more diverse than the HFrEF profile (10 disease categories) and included comorbidities from the digestive disease, hematopoietic and neoplastic disease categories (Fig. 2 C). Cardiovascular disease was the most important category in both profiles, accounting for 48.2% of the sum of parameter estimates in HFrEF and 38.3% in HFpEF. In HFpEF, important comorbidities included hypertensive and pulmonary heart disease, essential hypertension, inflammatory cardiac conditions (pericarditis, myocarditis), sleep apnea, osteopenia, neoplasms (multiple myeloma, breast cancer, metastasis in digestive systems), and rheumatoid disorders. The HFrEF comorbidity profile was characterized among others by myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, tobacco abuse, mitral valve disease, coma and cardiogenic shock, neurological disorders (vascular dementia, cerebral edema), chronic kidney disease, and diabetes type II (Fig. 2 D, Additional file 1: Fig. S3).

In conclusion, the observed variation in comorbidity profiles between HFpEF and HFrEF was analyzed by interpreting patient classifiers. The derived features captured known subtype associations such as typical etiologies of HF including hypertensive heart disease (with HFpEF) and ischemic heart disease (with HFrEF) but also more novel and understudied comorbidities associated with HFpEF such as breast cancer or rheumatoid arthritis with HFpEF.

Pericarditis after myocardial infarction — persistent/late symptom therapy and cautions: Given the rarity of post-MI pericarditis (0.1% to 0.5%) in the era of early coronary reperfusion therapy, high-dose aspirin 500–1000 mg every 6–8 h until symptoms improve and colchicine 0.5–0.6 mg once or twice daily for 3 mo are listed as additional therapy. Daily dosing should be used in patients who weigh < 70 kg and further adjusted in patients with stage 4–5 kidney disease, severe hepatic impairment, or with concomitant P-glycoprotein and/or moderate and severe CYP3A4 inhibitors. Routine use of high-dose aspirin or colchicine is not indicated for the management of asymptomatic pericardial effusions, and glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (other than aspirin) are potentially harmful due to possible increase in risk of recurrent MI or impaired myocardial healing and risk of rupture.

Discussion

IRP is widely regarded as a single system cardiac disease, and current ESC guidelines for the diagnosis of IRP and for recognition of disease recurrence focus solely on pericardial inflammation. However, our findings illustrate that systemic inflammation and localized extrapericardial inflammation, most notably serositis, are common features of the disease, reframing IRP within the spectrum of systemic inflammatory diseases. Indeed, we observe an association between the presence of extrapericardial effusion(s) and corticosteroid dependence, suggesting that a more comprehensive approach is indicated when assessing disease activity.

While corticosteroid dependence is known to carry serious risks of complications and impact significantly on patient quality of life, corticosteroids remain the second‐line treatment recommendation in European guidelines after low‐dose colchicine. Notably, the second most common comorbidity among all patients with IRP in this cohort was iatrogenic osteoporosis or osteopenia. Moreover, in our cohort, a history of corticosteroid dependence was associated with chronic chest pain and fatigue. There is a complete lack of data on whether pharmacological treatment of symptoms, in the absence of objective evidence of inflammation, is beneficial, because such cases have been excluded from trials (Table 1). Indeed, the association we observe between corticosteroid dependence and chronic pain may be, in part, driven by the inappropriate treatment of noninflammatory symptoms. This, together with the low early uptake of colchicine in our cohort, with less than half of those presenting with acute pericarditis after publication of the 2015 ESC guidelines receiving colchicine at diagnosis, a finding replicated in a recent US study, further highlight the current barriers to adoption of evidence‐based treatment. Accordingly, there is a need to understand the mechanisms underlying both the disease and its complications to guide earlier use of targeted interventions, thereby minimizing iatrogenic harm and reducing the risk of chronic sequelae.

Recurrent pericarditis treatment algorithm — Initial management is NSAID or aspirin plus colchicine, progressing to tapering if stable; if an inflammatory phenotype is present, add anti–IL–1 agent (rilonacept, anakinra, goflikicept) and consider corticosteroid, whereas without the inflammatory phenotype add corticosteroid and consider an anti–IL–1 agent; refractory cases warrant consideration of radical pericardiectomy at high‑volume surgical centers. Footnotes specify anti–IL–1 agent duration (rilonacept ≥ 12 months; anakinra and goflikicept ≥ 12 months, can be years or long‑term) and corticosteroid initiation and tapering (start at moderate dose, slow taper over months), and define NSAID as nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drug and IL‑1 as interleukin‑1.

### A novel mutation in the proteoglycan 4 gene causing CACP syndrome: two sisters report [^11363gZc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Radiographically, the most common findings include coxa vara deformity, osteopenia, osteoporosis, increased joint space, and a wide and short femoral neck. Spine involvement also occurs, with the exception of the cervical spine. Coxa vara is present in 50–100% of cases and is progressive. Non-inflammatory pericarditis probably occurs due to the lack of surface lubrication between the visceral and parietal pericardium layers, and is reported in 6–30% of patients with CACP syndrome. Pericarditis has wide clinical variability, from a self-limiting course to constrictive pericarditis requiring surgical intervention. Recurrent episodes of pericarditis can cause constrictive pericarditis, which is indicated based on signs of heart failure.

CACP syndrome can be confused with inflammatory arthropathies in many ways. CACP syndrome patients are often mistakenly diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis due to the early onset of progressive arthritis and multi-joint involvement, and then receive anti-inflammatory therapy, which does not provide any benefit in the long-term. In a cohort of 35 CACP syndrome patients reported by Yılmaz et al. mean age at diagnosis was 12 years; therefore, clinical differentiation of CACP syndrome and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is essential. In patients with CACP syndrome, inflammatory parameters are normal, in contrast to JIA patients. Flattening of the metacarpal and phalangeal heads, periarticular osteopenia, osteoporosis, a short femoral neck, short iliac wings, coxa vara with wide and irregular femoral heads, and large intraosseous fluid-filled cysts are radiological findings considered to be specific to CACP syndrome. In addition, consanguineous parents, family members with a similar disease, early-onset camptodactyly, bilateral arthropathy, and blood or joint fluid samples with normal levels of inflammatory markers can be used to differentiate CACP syndrome from JIA.

### Erdheim-Chester disease: consensus recommendations for evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment in the molecular era [^115czeAQ]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare histiocytosis that was recently recognized as a neoplastic disorder owing to the discovery of recurrent activating MAPK (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) pathway mutations. Typical findings of ECD include central diabetes insipidus, restrictive pericarditis, perinephric fibrosis, and sclerotic bone lesions. The histopathologic diagnosis of ECD is often challenging due to nonspecific inflammatory and fibrotic findings on histopathologic review of tissue specimens. Additionally, the association of ECD with unusual tissue tropism and an insidious onset often results in diagnostic errors and delays. Most patients with ECD require treatment, except for a minority of patients with minimally symptomatic single-organ disease. The first ECD consensus guidelines were published in 2014 on behalf of the physicians and researchers within the Erdheim-Chester Disease Global Alliance. With the recent molecular discoveries and the approval of the first targeted therapy (vemurafenib) for BRAF-V600-mutant ECD, there is a need for updated clinical practice guidelines to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. This document presents consensus recommendations that resulted from the International Medical Symposia on ECD in 2017 and 2019. Herein, we include the guidelines for the clinical, laboratory, histologic, and radiographic evaluation of ECD patients along with treatment recommendations based on our clinical experience and review of literature in the molecular era.

Association between acute cardiac complications and age of onset.

Box plots showing the median age of onset in patients with or without a history of (A) cardiac tamponade and (B) myocardial involvement. Comparison is made by a multiple logistic regression analysis (Tables S1 and S2). ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01.

Chronic complications were more common. The most frequent was chronic chest pain, defined as pericarditic chest pain with normal inflammatory markers and without findings consistent with acute pericarditis on examination or investigation on 2 or more occasions, which was reported in 51/136 patients (37.5%).

Corticosteroid dependence, defined as continuous daily corticosteroid use at doses greater than prednisolone 5 mg (or equivalent) for 6 months or longer, was also common, occurring in 39/136 patients (28.7%). A significant minority of corticosteroid‐dependent patients developed physical health problems suggestive of corticosteroid toxicity (11/39, 28.2%). Of particular note, 9/39 (23.1%) were diagnosed with osteoporosis or osteopenia, accounting for all cases of these diagnoses in the entire IRP cohort, and 1 patient developed adrenal insufficiency requiring lifelong glucocorticoid replacement. We also observed 1 new diagnosis of hypertension, while 1 patient with pre‐existing type 2 diabetes and hypertension required escalation of antihypertensive therapy and the initiation of insulin.

Chronic fatigue, defined as patient‐reported fatigue between flares, was reported by 19/136 patients (14.0%). All patients with chronic fatigue also reported chronic chest pain.

Patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence were more likely to report chronic pain (aOR, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.3–6.5], P = 0.012) or chronic fatigue (aOR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.6–14], P = 0.0041) than those without (Tables S3 and S4). Those with a history of myocardial involvement were less likely to report chronic pain (aOR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.0054–0.55], P = 0.049) (Table S3). Corticosteroid dependence was also associated with a history of extrapericardial effusion (aOR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.2–6.3], P = 0.023) (Table S5).

Pericarditis has several different causes, however, in about 70% of paediatric patients, a specific aetiology cannot be detected and the pericarditis is considered idiopathic. Recurrences may occur in up to 15–30% of cases. The pathogenesis of recurrent disease is controversial. Infectious, autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways have been proposed as mechanisms involved in recurrences. Therapeutic strategies are not standardised, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at high dosages being the mainstay of therapy with the possible addition of low dose colchicine to prevent recurrences. Biological agents are considered a possible new therapeutic frontiers in the care of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis.

Chest Computed Tomography(CT) and echocardiography on August 7th showed massive pericardial hemorrhage with blood clot. Operation was advised. But the patient claimed explicitly that he would rather die than have a sternotomy because of his concern about the incision infection due to the diabetes and obesity and the disunion of the sternum due to the osteoporosis which caused by renal failure he had suffered for several years. So we performed a minimally invasive surgery.

### A randomized trial of colchicine for acute pericarditis [^116LN87g]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study ICAP was published by Imazio M and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute pericarditis. In the ICAP study, the trial question was: what is the effect of colchicine in patients with acute pericarditis? In the ICAP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ICAP study, the population was: 240 patients (95 female, 145 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute pericarditis who were receiving conventional treatment. The key exclusion criteria were tuberculous, neoplastic, or purulent pericarditis; severe liver disease, skeletal myopathy; blood dyscrasia; IBD; hypersensitivity to colchicine or other contraindication to its use; current treatment with colchicine; and life expectancy < 18 months; pregnant or lactating women. In the ICAP study, the interventions were: n = 120 colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg BID for 3 months for patients weighing > 70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighting ≤ 70 kg) n = 120 placebo (identical placebo for 3 months). In the ICAP study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in incessant or recurrent pericarditis (16.7% vs. 37.5%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.7). In the ICAP study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.76) Significant decrease in hospitalization (5% vs. 14.2%; RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.65) Significant increase in remission at 1 week (85% vs. 58.3%; RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.33). In the ICAP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse effects and rates of study-drug discontinuation. In the ICAP study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with acute pericarditis who were receiving conventional treatment, colchicine was superior to placebo with respect to incessant or recurrent pericarditis.

Conclusion: Recurrent pericarditis in children follows a different course than in adults, with fewer recurrences, prolonged symptom-free periods, and typical ECG abnormalities. The higher corticosteroid use in children raises some concerns because of its potential side effects, including growth impairment and osteoporosis. IL-1 inhibitors should be considered to minimize corticosteroid administration. These findings emphasize the importance of developing a pediatric age-specific guideline.

### Recurrent myocarditis in a patient with active ulcerative colitis: a case report and review of the literature [^111LfDQD]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

UC is often accompanied by extra-intestinal manifestations as anaemia, arthropathy, metabolic bone abnormalities, cutaneous diseases (erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum), ocular (episcleritis and uveitis), hepatobiliary diseases (primary sclerosing cholangitis, pericholangitis, steatosis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and gallstone formation), and less commonly, cardiovascular complications. However, cardiac manifestations can occur with a higher frequency than what it is clinically documented, as they may remain undiagnosed. Up to one-third of patients with IBD, particularly those with UC, can develop myocarditis or pericarditis with a higher rate of complications, and fatal outcomes in comparison with patients affected by Crohn's disease. Therefore, despite myocarditis has been considered a rare extra-intestinal manifestation of UC, this condition has been documented in many literature reports. Cardiac manifestations in UC may be overlooked because of non-specific symptoms (eg, fatigue, dyspnoea and chest pain), which either resolve without any specific treatment or rapidly progress up to more severe heart complications, for example, cardiogenic shock.

MSZ is a 5-aminosalicylic acid agent usually prescribed as a first-line therapy in the treatment of UC.MSZ mechanism of action has not been completely understood. However, it is thought that it reduces inflammation by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma cascade, thus reducing the proinflammatory signalling pathway of the nuclear factor κB. Along with the most common MSZ-evoked side effects (eg, dyspepsia, pancreatitis, blood dyscrasias, nausea and headache), this drug can trigger the onset of cardiac inflammation, such as pericarditis, myocarditis and coronary vasculitis. The mechanisms leading to cardiotoxicity have not been elucidated yet; however, different theories have been proposed: (1) MSZ may increase the eosinophil-stimulating cytokines, promoting a hypersensitivity reaction; (2) a hypersensitivity reaction triggered by antibodies directed against the drug and a cross-reacting with the cardiac tissue; (3) an immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic reaction promoted by its toxicity on the myopericardium.MSZ induced myocarditis usually appears within 4 weeks from the beginning of the treatment, but concomitant corticosteroid use could delay the onset of the cardiotoxicity. MSZ-induced myocarditis has been reported in literature both in the treatment of UC, Crohn's diseaseand in newly diagnosed IBD. Up to now, more than 51 cases of MSZ induced myocarditis have been reported.

### Osteoporosis treatment: updated guidelines from ACOG… [^112RR2VL]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Bisphosphonates, for up to five years orally or three years intravenously, are first-line therapy for osteoporosis.
- Denosumab injections every six months improve bone density more quickly than bisphosphonates, although bone density improvements fade within months after discontinuation unless bisphosphonates are started.
- Parathyroid hormone analog therapy for up to two years dramatically improves bone density and reduces fractures but requires subsequent bisphosphonate use to maintain benefit.
- One year of treatment with romosozumab, a sclerostin-binding analog, followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk more than two years of alendronate therapy alone. PARATHYROID HORMONE ANALOGS In patients with very high risk of fracture due to a history of severe or multiple vertebral fractures, a T-score of −3 or lower, or multiple risk factors, the parathyroid hormone analogs teriparatide and abaloparatide are highly effective.

Parathyroid hormone analogs can also be used in patients whose symptoms do not respond to antiresorptive therapy. Unlike antiresorptive agents, they can restore bone mass that is already lost in patients with advanced osteoporosis. Treatment duration should be limited to two years because of a possible risk of osteosarcoma. Although teriparatide and abaloparatide improve bone density and reduce vertebral and nonvertebral fracture, abaloparatide increases bone density more than teriparatide and more effectively reduces new vertebral fracture. Romosozumab use increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, and there is a U. S. Food and Drug Administration boxed warning against use in patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within one year. Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients with hypocalcemia and rarely can lead to osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture. COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS Soy isoflavones slightly increase bone density.

Flax seeds, green tea extract, and the herbal treatment fufang are not beneficial. REFERRAL Referral to an endocrinologist or osteoporosis specialist is suggested for patients with a T-score less than −3. 0, new fragility fracture, fragility fracture with normal bone mineral density, osteoporosis not responding to treatment, an endocrine or metabolic cause of secondary osteoporosis, or comorbidities that complicate treatment.

Introduction

Recurrent pericarditis (RP) is a debilitating disease with autoinflammation being one of the possible underlying pathogenic mechanisms. RP is characterised by repeated episodes of pericardial inflammation causing chest pain, ECG changes and pericardial effusion. Current management of RP includes treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, systemic glucocorticoids; third-line medications include azathioprine and intravenous human immunoglobulins, alone and in various combinations. After the first episode, additional episodes occur in 15%–30% of patients, and management of RP often requires treatment lasting months to years.NSAIDs and colchicine are associated with gastrointestinal and renal side effects that limit use in some patients. Many patients require long-term use of glucocorticoids, which can cause serious adverse effects, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and adrenal insufficiency. A history of glucocorticoid treatment is an independent risk factor for pericarditis recurrence, and premature tapering of glucocorticoids may contribute to recurrence. For these reasons, guidelines recommend tapering glucocorticoids gradually, over several months. Considering the increased risk and seriousness of adverse events associated with long-term glucocorticoid treatment, a need exists for therapies that effectively prevent pericarditis recurrence while minimising glucocorticoid exposure.

Pericarditis management — first-line pharmacological therapy, exercise restriction, and admission considerations are outlined. "First-line pharmacological treatment includes dual anti-inflammatory therapy with colchicine (3 months following first flare, ≥ 6 months following first recurrence) and NSAIDs or aspirin (starting at high dose and tapering after symptoms resolve and inflammatory markers normalize)". Acid suppression therapies "are often concomitantly prescribed with NSAIDs for gastric protection". Exercise restriction is advised for " ≥ 1 month (maximal heart rate < 100 beats/min with physical activity) until clinical remission". "Hospital admission may be necessary in complicated high-risk cases, such as large pericardial effusion and/or tamponade, severe pain refractory to first-line therapies, and symptomatic constrictive pericarditis".

### Recurrent pericarditis: infectious or autoimmune? [^112sBMM9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

The etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP) remain controversial standing like a bridge that crosses infectious, autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways. Anything may cause acute pericarditis; Echo-virus, and Coxsackie are the most frequently involved viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Coxiella burnetii the most common bacteria, but in 85% of cases it remains "idiopathic". Recurrences occur in up to 20–50% of patients. An immuno-mediated pathogenesis is suggested by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pericardial fluid, the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) in sera of the patients, the occurrence of new autoimmune diagnoses and the good response to anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be used at recommended dosages, till the resolution of symptoms and normalization of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Corticosteroids should be used rarely, at low doses, with an extremely low tapering and with osteoporosis prevention. Colchicine leads to a clinically important and statistically significant benefit, reducing recurrences by 50%. The long term outcome of IRAP is good, without evidence of constriction even after a very long follow-up.

Pericarditis is a rare presentation of thyrotoxicosis associated with Graves disease. This association has not been previously described in the pediatric literature. We report a 17-year-old male patient who presented with chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia. He was found to have diffuse ST-segment elevation consistent with pericarditis. At presentation, he was noted to have bilateral proptosis. Abnormal thyroid function studies and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody level confirmed the diagnosis of Graves thyrotoxicosis. The patient was treated with anti-inflammatory and antithyroid agents and improved in time. We discuss previously reported cases of Graves disease-associated pericarditis in adults, potential etiologies, and management strategies.

### Pericarditis among giant cell arteritis patients: from myth to reality [^11146M1J]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology affecting adults age > 50years. GCA (also known as temporal arteritis) is a vasculitis of large and medium-size vessels that involves the extracranial branches of the carotid artery. Common manifestations include constitutional symptoms, headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and vision loss. Cardiac involvement in GCA is considered to be as low as 5%, and < 30 cases of pericarditis among GCA patients have been reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between GCA and pericarditis by conducting a cross-sectional study utilizing the database of the largest healthcare provider in Israel.

Hypothesis

GCA is associated with pericarditis.

Methods

The proportion of past documentation of pericarditis among patients diagnosed with GCA was compared with that of their age- and sex-matched controls. Univariate analysis was performed using the χ² and t tests; multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression.

Results

The study included 4329 GCA patients and 21611 controls. GCA patients had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors. Pericarditis was observed in 53 GCA patients and 72 controls (1.22% vs 0.33%, respectively; P < 0.001), significantly higher among GCA patients in comparison with controls. A significant interaction was found between GCA, pericarditis, and young age (< 70years).

Conclusions

The study showed an independent association between GCA and pericarditis, especially among young patients. Proper screening should be applied whenever a suspicion arises as to the existence of comorbidity in patients with either disease.

Idiopathic recurrent pericarditis

Pericarditis is a clinical manifestation often encountered as part of the clinical spectrum of inherited and complex autoinflammatory disorders. However, inflammation of pericardium can occur as an isolated, recurrent manifestation, with no clear genetic predisposition or identified infectious etiology. Idiopathic pericarditis represents almost 90% of the cases of acute pericarditis in developed countries and recurs in up to 30% of patients. Standard treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine is not always able to neutralize pericardial inflammation and prevent recurrences.

Inflammasome activation, long hypothesized to be the key driver of inflammation in acute pericarditis, has been recently demonstrated in human specimens of patient with acute pericarditis, reinforcing the biological basis of the striking response to selective IL-1 inhibition therapies frequently reported. Anakinra is highly effective in suppressing the inflammatory response and prevent recrudescence of the disease, as demonstrated in several case series and in one randomized clinical trial. Rilonacept recently showed striking results both in resolving the acute attack of pericarditis and in preventing relapses in a phase III trial for idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. Data on the efficacy of canakinumab are more limited but it is safe to expect analogous results. Hence, the role of interleukin-1 inhibition as a second-line treatment has been well established and is recommended in the 2015 ESC guidelines, while the potential use of selective IL-1 blockade as a first-line therapy needs yet to be thoroughly investigated.
