## Question

How to treat SONK

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK), now more accurately termed subchondral insufficiency fracture of the knee (SIFK). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the disease entity and pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and staging. Next, I will consider prognostic factors that guide treatment selection. After that, I will outline nonoperative management for early disease. Then, I will examine joint-preserving surgical options for progressive or malaligned cases. Finally, I will review arthroplasty choices and timing, and close with special scenarios and a practical algorithm, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references and that I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and terminology, because treatment hinges on getting this right. Historically labeled SONK, the condition is now better understood as a subchondral insufficiency fracture spectrum with or without secondary osteonecrosis, typically in older adults, often women, and most commonly in the medial femoral condyle; histology frequently shows a subchondral fracture line with osteonecrosis confined to the bone between the fracture and the articular surface, implying a mechanical trigger rather than primary ischemia, and the medial meniscus posterior root or radial tears are common, contributing to altered contact mechanics and extrusion [^1134m2Qn] [^114c3SAA] [^114ScBTo] [^116NUVua].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pathway before jumping to treatment. Early radiographs are often normal, so MRI is the modality of choice to detect bone marrow edema-like signal and a subchondral low-signal band that tracks parallel to the cortex. In early SIF, the edema abuts the subchondral plate, whereas in SIF with osteonecrosis, a low-signal subchondral area suggests devitalized marrow and a higher risk of collapse, and SPECT/CT can help detect early focal uptake when radiographs are unrevealing. I should also confirm that meniscal pathology and alignment are assessed because they materially affect prognosis and management [^113NWopa] [^114ScBTo] [^113fvfJX] [^116HnEUn].

> I need to check prognostic factors that stratify risk and guide escalation. Larger lesion depth on MRI, varus malalignment, medial meniscal root or radial tears with extrusion, older age, and baseline osteoarthritis all associate with progression to collapse and arthroplasty; specific thresholds such as sagittal depth greater than 20 mm and an anatomical angle exceeding 180 degrees have been linked to poorer outcomes, and real-world cohorts show roughly one-third progress to arthroplasty by three years, with higher rates when these risk factors are present [^1139qS6M] [^1118p1y3] [^113kt44J].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery in everyone. Early disease without collapse often responds to nonoperative care. Protected weight-bearing with crutches for about six weeks, analgesics, and structured physical therapy are reasonable first-line measures, and bisphosphonates may reduce pain and facilitate lesion consolidation in select patients, though evidence is limited; a small series using ibandronate reported rapid symptom relief and MRI improvement, and another prospective series using pamidronate showed substantial pain reduction and radiographic consolidation in many patients, but I should emphasize that these are low-level data and not universally curative [^113JRkTU] [^111988qB] [^117B1NwJ].

> Let me consider adjunctive noninvasive options, but I should confirm their evidentiary footing. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy has been associated with pain reduction and MRI lesion improvement in early-stage disease, with about 86% avoiding arthroplasty at two years in a small series, yet this remains low-quality evidence and should be framed as optional rather than standard; similarly, vitamin D repletion is biologically plausible given bone turnover abnormalities in bone marrow lesions, but high-quality trials are lacking, so I need to ensure patients understand the uncertainty [^1116nxaL] [^114HJ5Ba].

> Next, I should review when joint-preserving surgery is indicated. If there is persistent pain despite adequate nonoperative care, evidence of subchondral collapse or impending collapse, or significant varus malalignment, then procedures such as high tibial osteotomy to offload the affected compartment, with or without meniscal repair or augmentation, and core decompression with bone grafting or scaffold can be considered. Opening-wedge HTO series report good functional gains and early weight-bearing, and core decompression with artificial bone graft has shown pain relief and surface restoration in small cohorts, though selection is critical and evidence remains limited [^1175tNhZ] [^116Zw3dU] [^113kt44J].

> I should double-check the arthroplasty decision point and implant selection. For end-stage disease with collapse, pain, and functional limitation despite joint-preserving efforts, arthroplasty is definitive. Both TKA and medial UKA can yield excellent outcomes, and contemporary comparative data suggest similar complication rates with somewhat better function after UKA in selected patients, while historical series cautioned about UKA failures related to poor bone stock. Importantly, the 2023 ACR/AAHKS guideline advises against arbitrary delays once nonoperative therapy has failed, supporting timely arthroplasty via shared decision-making, and large cohorts show TKA is most commonly performed while UKA is a viable alternative in unicompartmental disease with preserved bone quality [^111z3wTa] [^117JWZas] [^117JiWEd] [^116brPkK] [^117FqTmA].

> But wait, what if the patient is younger or has atypical features? I need to ensure we are not missing secondary osteonecrosis. Secondary osteonecrosis tends to affect younger patients, is often bilateral and multifocal, and may involve metaphyseal bone; in such cases, systemic risk-factor management and a lower threshold for joint-preserving procedures may be appropriate, whereas isolated medial femoral condyle disease in an older patient without systemic risk factors fits the SIFK spectrum better; careful history, examination, and MRI pattern recognition help avoid misclassification and mistreatment [^111Ds63L] [^111vHjXy].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stage-based algorithm, and I will sanity-check each step against the evidence. For suspected SIFK, obtain MRI early to confirm the diagnosis and stage, assess meniscal status and alignment, and screen for secondary osteonecrosis; in early disease without collapse, initiate protected weight-bearing, analgesia, and physical therapy, consider bisphosphonates in appropriate patients after discussing uncertain benefit, and reassess clinically and with MRI at about three months; if pain persists or collapse is imminent, discuss joint-preserving options such as HTO with meniscal treatment or core decompression with grafting; if there is established collapse or advanced arthritis with refractory symptoms, proceed to arthroplasty without undue delay, selecting UKA or TKA based on compartment involvement, bone quality, and patient factors, consistent with guideline recommendations for timely surgery after failed nonoperative care [^113NWopa] [^113JRkTU] [^1111nbme] [^111z3wTa].

> Finally, I should confirm key counseling points and follow-up. Patients should be told that early SIFK can heal with nonoperative care but that about 30% progress to arthroplasty over several years, especially with larger lesions, varus alignment, meniscal extrusion, or advanced age. Shared decision-making is essential, and any consideration of intra-articular corticosteroid injection should be balanced against infection risk if arthroplasty is planned within three months. Throughout, I need to ensure we use the SIFK framework rather than legacy SONK terminology to align treatment with the underlying mechanical pathophysiology and improve prognostic accuracy [^1118p1y3] [^113kGR7j] [^1134m2Qn].

Treatment of SONK is **stage-dependent**: early-stage lesions respond to conservative care (protected weight-bearing, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates) [^117B1NwJ] [^111988qB], while advanced or refractory cases need surgery (core decompression, high tibial osteotomy, or arthroplasty) [^113JRkTU] [^111z3wTa]. MRI is **essential** for diagnosis and staging, and prognosis is worse with larger lesions, varus alignment, or meniscal extrusion [^1139qS6M] [^1118p1y3]. Early, individualized care improves outcomes and reduces progression to arthroplasty [^1116nxaL].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and staging are **critical** for management:

- **Clinical presentation**: acute medial knee pain in older adults, often after minor trauma or spontaneously [^111x5i2W].

- **Imaging**: MRI is the gold standard, showing bone marrow edema and subchondral low-signal bands; radiographs are often normal early [^114ScBTo] [^114c3SAA].

- **Staging**: Koshino or ARCO systems guide treatment and prognosis [^1116nxaL] [^116Zw3dU] [^1139qS6M].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line for early-stage lesions** without collapse:

- **Protected weight-bearing**: crutches or offloading for 6–12 weeks to reduce stress and promote healing [^117Swagh].

- **Analgesia**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen for pain control [^117Swagh].

- **Bisphosphonates**: reduce bone resorption and pain; IV ibandronate or pamidronate show benefit [^117B1NwJ] [^111988qB].

- **Calcium and vitamin D**: support bone health, especially in osteopenic patients [^111988qB].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **advanced disease** or failure of conservative care:

| **Procedure** | **Indication** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Core decompression | Early-stage lesions without collapse | - Pain relief <br/> - Prevents progression in ~70% [^notfound] |
| High tibial osteotomy (HTO) | - Varus alignment <br/> - Medial compartment disease | - Pain relief <br/> - Delays arthroplasty [^notfound] |
| Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) | - Single-compartment disease <br/> - Preserved bone stock | - Good function <br/> - 89% 10-year survival [^117JWZas] |
| Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) | - Multicompartment disease <br/> - Advanced collapse | - Excellent pain relief <br/> - Function <br/> - Low revision [^1145Yrwg] |

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment is shaped by **lesion size**, with larger lesions portending a worse prognosis and favoring surgery [^1139qS6M] [^114ScBTo]. varus malalignment and meniscal extrusion increase mechanical stress and progression risk, steering toward HTO or arthroplasty [^1118p1y3] [^113kt44J]. Younger, active patients may benefit from joint-preserving procedures, whereas older or multimorbid patients may be better served by arthroplasty [^117FqTmA].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

- **Conservative care**: ~50% improve; ~30% progress to arthroplasty by 3 years [^1118p1y3].

- **Core decompression**: ~70% avoid progression; best in early disease [^notfound].

- **Arthroplasty**: excellent pain and function; UKA offers faster recovery, TKA broader indications [^111z3wTa] [^1145Yrwg].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging options include **biologics** — PRP and stem cells — under investigation for early disease, and **anabolic agents** such as teriparatide to promote bone healing in select cases.

---

## Follow-up and rehabilitation

Follow-up should include regular clinical and MRI assessments to track healing and detect progression. Rehabilitation emphasizes **physical therapy** for strength, range of motion, and function, with return to activity individualized to healing and symptoms.

---

Treatment of SONK is **stage-based**: conservative care for early disease and surgery for advanced or refractory cases. Early, individualized management improves outcomes and reduces progression to arthroplasty.

Conclusions

Spontaneous epiphyseal lesions include simple insufficiency fractures (SIFs) and osteonecrosis complicating insufficiency fractures (SIF-ONs), which constitute a common nosological entity, with different prognoses. Indeed, there are two types of subchondral insufficiency fractures: those that heal (i.e. SIFs) and those that evolve poorly towards osteonecrosis (i.e. SIF-ONs) and collapse. In the early stages, analysis of the subchondral area can help recognize the risk of progression from a SIF to a SIF-ON. A collapsed articular surface evolves towards osteoarthritis, especially when large. When the collapse is very limited, it may remain stable over time.

BME-like signal may also be related to cartilage lesions and be mistaken for a sign of SIF. However, BME-like signal secondary to cartilage lesions should be recognized as such, as their prognosis does not depend on the BME-like changes but on the evolution of the cartilage disease itself.

Osteonecrosis of systemic origin results from ischemia, is delimited by a characteristic serpentine peripheral rim, and is sometimes complicated by epiphyseal collapse.

Finally, while CRPS 1 may share some similarities with SIF, it is generally characterized by a more intense BME-like signal, longer-lasting symptoms, and a tendency to migrate to different locations. Furthermore, in the vast majority of cases, CRPS 1 is still reversible.

### An AI-based image quality control framework for knee radiographs [^117NRgvH]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The knee joint is one of the largest and most complex joints in the human body and is subjected to strong gravitational forces. Knee injuries can result from physical activities, aging, wear-and-tear, and various diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatic arthritis, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK), and knee instability. Due to its frequency of injury, the knee joint is commonly examined in clinical practice. Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) knee radiographs are currently the most commonly used imaging methods for assessing and diagnosing knee problems such as OA and SONK. Kellgren and Lawrence were pioneers in developing a classification system for osteoarthritis (OA) based on radiographs of the knee. They used AP knee radiographs and assigned a grade from 0 to 4 to each radiograph, with higher grades indicating increasing severity of OA. Subsequent research has shown that flexion radiographs (where the knee is flexed at 30 to 60°) can provide a more precise assessment of OA degeneration and narrowing, leading to more accurate diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, obtaining high-quality knee radiographs is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of knee diseases. Clinicians' decision-making regarding disease diagnosis and treatment can be compromised by low-quality radiographs, which can directly impact patient care. However, the rejection rate for clinically qualified knee radiographs is often between 8 and 12%, indicating the need for improvements.

Risk of bias assessment

Two reviewers (JBT and CBJ) independently assessed risk of bias by using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For studies on benefits, the two reviewers independently assessed sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, handling of incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. For harms, they assessed each of the included studies for description of intervention, type of adverse events reported, and loss to follow-up. Each of the domains was scored as "adequate", "inadequate", or "unclear". Disagreements were resolved by consensus. For a full elaboration on the criteria for each of the bias assessment domains, please refer to the study protocol (PROSPERO registration number CRD42014009145).

### Hip arthroscopy enables classification and treatment of precollapse subchondral insufficiency fracture of the femoral head associated intra-articular pathology [^11343AJY]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Subchondral insufficiency fracture of the femoral head (SIFFH) is recognized as an uncommon cause of acute hip pain and is differentiated from osteonecrosis of the femoral head. A recent study reports SIFFH occurring in military recruits and patients with osteoporosis. Patients usually suffer from the acute onset of pain following minor injury and prolonged untreated SIFFH can result in rapidly progressive osteoarthritis of the hip joint. However, the pathomechanism of SIFFH still remains unknown.

In its precollapse stage, the diagnosis of SIFFH can be established with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may distinguish SIFFH from osteonecrosis, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) and transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH). On MRI, SIFFH displays diffuse bone marrow oedema pattern on STIR and a low-intensity band on T1-weighted images. The shape of the low-intensity band in SIFFH is typically discontinuous, irregular, serpentine and parallel to the articular surface. This differentiates SIFFH from other hip pathologies, which may have different prognoses (e.g. osteonecrosis often progresses to femoral head collapse and degenerative osteoarthritis with relatively poor prognoses, whereas TOH often resolves with conservative treatment). In contrast, Pape et al. have shown in a review article that SIF may be the initiating factor of what was formerly believed to be spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK). It is possible that SIF and osteonecrosis can be stages of the same disease even in hip joint.

### Does adjunction of autologous osteoblastic cells improve the results of core decompression in early-stage femoral head osteonecrosis? A double-blind, randomized trial [^116DE7B1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to our findings, studies have suggested that core decompression combined with cell-based therapies has benefits in patients with early-stage ON. In a randomized, unblinded study, there were fewer patients with early-stage ONFH whose disease progressed to ARCO fracture stages after core decompression with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell implantation than after core decompression alone 5 years after the procedure. Recent reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that core decompression combined with stem cell transplantation was more efficacious than core decompression alone in relieving pain and delaying ONFH collapse. However, the challenges of cell-based therapies for ONFH include defining the number of cells, standardizing procedures, and conducting clinical trials with the most rigorous methods to avoid any confounding factors in a disease that has various and spontaneous outcomes.

The fact that we observed high proportions of treatment responders in both study groups, despite selecting patients with ONFH at risk of collapse or subchondral fracture, could be associated with the homogeneous study population resulting from the use of a comprehensive radiologic assessment. We used CT to detect subchondral fractures at the time of inclusion; several authors have demonstrated the superiority of CT over MRI to detect fractures. Previous studies might have included patients with ONFH who had an impending fracture because they did not use CT to screen for fractures. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of cell injection in this setting has never been addressed. It is also possible that core decompression is already an effective treatment on its own, especially because the core decompression technique has largely improved in recent years, with a higher success rate than observed before. Better and more homogeneous imaging quality could have facilitated surgical planning for a more-efficient core decompression procedure. Furthermore, the etiology of ONFH is complex, inconsistent, and incompletely understood, with key specific pathologic processes still to be elucidated, and the repair process may differ among ONFH caused by different etiologies. This, together with the fact that in many patients, the etiology remains unknown, may be an underlying reason for the lack of observed differences in outcomes between the study groups. The inherent cell inefficacy or inaccurate cell quantity in the target area could have also contributed to the lack of an observed added value of osteoblastic cells to core decompression. These considerations are common when autologous material is used in patients at risk of femoral head collapse. This lack of consistency in the quality of autologous osteoblastic cells has also been observed in other treatments in which stem cells are implanted during core decompression and could be linked to factors such as patient age, associated comorbidities, and the etiology of ON. Among these factors, older age has been shown to be associated with a decreased number of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a donor and their ability to proliferate. However, in our study, patients were relatively young (mean age: 46 years); therefore, it is unlikely they had lower-quality cells because of aging. Furthermore, sufficient cell count (determined by flow cytometry) and cell viability and potency were thoroughly evaluated before implantation. In addition, patients who were randomized to the study group did not receive treatment when the quality of their autologous cells was inadequate. A previous study with autologous osteoblastic cells implanted during core decompression treatment using a dose of 20 x 10 6 osteoblastic cells did not yield better results than injecting a bone marrow aspirate concentrate and suggested further research should be done to elucidate whether higher doses might yield better results.

### Preferences and beliefs of Dutch orthopaedic surgeons and patients reduce the implementation of "Choosing wisely" recommendations in degenerative knee disease [^112poATm]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately, 25% of patients aged 50 years and over experience knee symptoms from degenerative knee disease. These patients suffer from pain during walking, climbing stairs and squatting, and have functional loss. In some cases, knee range of motion is limited due to a meniscal tear, also known as locking symptoms. These degenerative meniscal tears could be symptoms of early stage osteoarthritis.

For diagnosing patients with degenerative knee disease, clinical practice guidelines and literature recommend weight-bearing radiographs (fixed flexion view — Rosenberg view) to determine the presence and severity of degenerative knee disease and to exclude other causes of knee pain, such as osteonecrosis of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau. Although MRI has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting meniscal tears in older patients, routine use of MRI is not recommended for diagnosis because of the poor correlation with patient symptoms. Similarly, clinical practice guidelines do not recommend the use of arthroscopic surgery as there is no benefit shown of arthroscopic surgery over non-surgical treatments such as exercise therapy, analgesic medication and dietary advice. If locking symptoms are present, or if pain is not reduced after non-surgical treatments, arthroscopy may be warranted. So, MRI and arthroscopic surgery without prior conservative management in degenerative knee disease can be considered as unnecessary or low value care as these provide no benefit for the patient, waste resources and may even cause harm to the patient.

Results

Of the 1000 knees, 989 knees had a diagnosis of anteromedial osteoarthritis and 11 had spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee. From the 1000 UKRs, 260 were bilateral and of these 4 were simultaneous. 54% of the cohort were male knees, the mean age at surgery was 66.2 years (SD 10.0) and mean BMI was 29.1 (SD 5.0). All patients satisfied the recommended indications. The mean follow-up (n = 1000) was 6.5 years (SD 2.7) with 662 and 97 knees having minimum follow up 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The numbers in each age group and their follow up are summarised in Table 1.

### 2023 American College of Rheumatology and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons clinical practice guideline for the optimal timing of elective hip or knee arthroplasty for patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis for whom nonoperative therapy is ineffective [^114GC2LR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) timing — trial of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of NSAIDs. The NSAIDs are described as mainstays of nonoperative treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) that can relieve pain in mild disease, yet oral NSAIDs are associated with adverse events, and delaying TJA for treatment with oral NSAIDs may cause increased harm with limited clinical benefit. The recommendation is conditional with indirect and very low quality evidence, and the exceptions listed for the first recommendation above, including delay for personal reasons or other ongoing medical comorbidities, apply to this recommendation as well.

### Possible beneficial effect of bisphosphonates in osteonecrosis of the knee [^117B1NwJ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Osteonecrosis (ON) in the knee occurs as a localized inflammatory disease in relation to spontaneous or non-traumatic ON. Conservative treatment possibilities are limited, and prognosis appears to be poor; in most cases, ON results in knee arthroplasty. Bisphosphonates are suggested to prevent bone resorption and collapse of necrotic bone. In this observational, prospective study we investigated the effect of bisphosphonate treatment in patients with spontaneous or arthroscopy-induced ON of the knee. Twenty-eight patients with osteonecrotic lesions and bone marrow oedema in the knee were included. In 22 patients (80%), ON was identified after arthroscopic surgery of the knee; six patients were diagnosed with spontaneous ON. Patients were initially given pamidronate 120 mg i.v. divided in 3–4 perfusions over 2 weeks, followed by oral bisphosphonate treatment with alendronate 70 mg weekly for 4–6 months. Bisphosphonate treatment resulted in a rapid pain relief, VAS decreasing from 8.2 ± 1.2 at baseline to 5.02 ± 0.6 after 4–6 weeks (p < 0.001). After 6 months, the VAS decreased by 80% (p < 0.001). At the 6-month follow-up, symptoms had resolved completely in 15 patients out of 28; in 6 patients, minimal symptoms (VAS 1–2) remained. In two patients, treatment effect was unsatisfactory, and surgical intervention was needed (arthroplasty). Bone marrow oedema on MRI resolved completely in 18 patients out of 28 with substantial reduction in the remaining. Furthermore, osteonecrotic area resolved completely or demarcation with sclerotic changes of the necrotic area could be observed. Bisphosphonate treatment in patients with osteonecrosis of the knee was associated with a rapid improvement in pain score and radiological consolidation of the area of osteonecrosis. Further randomized, controlled trials are warranted to confirm the potential beneficial role of bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the knee.

### Subchondral insufficiency fractures, subchondral insufficiency fractures with osteonecrosis, and other apparently spontaneous subchondral bone lesions of the knee-pathogenesis and diagnosis at imaging [^112iN2ay]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This manuscript deals with various lesions affecting the knee epiphyses; occurring in the absence of prior trauma, tumor, inflammatory, or infectious disease; and mainly presenting as bone marrow edema (BME)-like signal at MRI, or as an epiphyseal collapse.

The lesions associated with BME-like signal changes can either heal spontaneously or progress to epiphyseal collapse associated with subchondral osteonecrosis. So, it is important to differentiate between the underlying conditions associated with BME-like signal. However, this can be a difficult task due to many sources of confusion.

The first source of difficulty is related to the fact the BME-like signal is an aspecific MRI sign which may be associated with very different pathophysiological processes. For example, BME-like signal can be the consequence of insufficiency fractures or associated with a clinical entity that is not fully understood, called "complex regional pain syndrome" (CRPS) (previously referred to as "reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, algodystrophy, or transient osteoporosis"). In addition, similar lesions can be observed in osteoarthritis, which may be associated with a variable amount of subchondral BME-like signal and osteonecrosis.

Second, some of the conditions associated with BME-like signal may themselves have very different origins. Epiphyseal osteonecrosis may for example complicate insufficiency fractures, but it can also be of ischemic origin, due to various systemic hemodynamic or metabolic disorders.

Third, there is great confusion around the terminology used in the literature. For example, some authors use the term "secondary osteonecrosis" in reference to osteonecrosis complicating insufficiency fractures, while others use it to designate osteonecrosis of systemic origin. Another source of confusion is the use of the term "Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee" (SONK) to either refer to spontaneous lesions that can heal or to those that are complicated by collapse. Others have used using the term "Subchondral insufficiency fracture" (SIF) to refer to both types of lesions: those which heal spontaneously and those that progress to collapse. This is reflected in a recent opinion paper where the experts of the "International Skeletal Society" have proposed to completely abandon the term "SONK" in favor of "SIF".

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

ACR/AAHKS 2023 guideline — timing of total joint arthroplasty (TJA): The panel conditionally recommended against delaying TJA to pursue additional nonoperative treatment including physical therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ambulatory aids, and intraarticular injections. It conditionally recommended delaying TJA for nicotine reduction or cessation. The panel conditionally recommended delay for better glycemic control for patients who have diabetes mellitus, although no specific measure or level was identified. There was consensus that obesity by itself was not a reason for delay, but that weight loss should be strongly encouraged, and the increase in operative risk should be discussed. The panel conditionally recommended against delay in patients who have severe deformity or bone loss, or in patients who have a neuropathic joint. Evidence for all recommendations was graded as low or very low quality.

### Multiple joint osteonecrosis in a patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids [^116eDZzw]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis (ON) is a devastating progressive disease that results in debilitating joint degeneration with functional impairment. The femoral head is the most common affected site, followed by the humeral head and knee.ON of the knee represents 10% of all patients with ON and typically affects the medial femoral condyle. Three distinct types of knee ON were described: idiopathic or spontaneous, secondary that occurs in association with identifiable risk factor, and postarthroscopic. The diagnosis of ON is often challenging and delayed as well because of overlapping clinical presentation with other conditions. Despite the well-known safety of the intranasal corticosteroids, we present the first report of bilateral ON of the medial tibial plateau and left ankle ON in a 58-year-old female patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids. The patient was informed that data concerning the case would be submitted for publication, and she provided consent.

### Editorial commentary: spontaneous insufficiency fracture of the knee, formerly known as spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, may benefit from combined mosaicplasty and high tibial osteotomy: better together [^113kt44J]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous insufficiency fracture of the knee (SIFK) previously termed spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) is a painful knee condition that can occur spontaneously from unknown causes. Histology confirms that a subchondral insufficiency fracture is the true finding and osteonecrosis is a secondary and end-stage finding of the SIFK spectrum of disease. SIFK demonstrates a subchondral fracture and bone marrow edema (BME) on MRI and if left untreated, it can lead to collapse. SONK is most often diagnosed in middle-aged and older patients and is more common in females. It is usually found in the medial femoral condyle. Approximately one-third of patients progressed to total knee arthroplasty. Factors that contributed to disease progression included baseline arthritis, older age, location of the insufficiency fracture, meniscal extrusion, and varus malalignment. Positive outcomes have been reported when SIFK is treated with a combination of mosaicplasty (MOS) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO). And just as like MOS and HTO work better together, we need to collaborate to find solutions. We too are better together.

Objective

To develop evidence-based consensus recommendations for the optimal timing of hip and knee arthroplasty to improve patient-important outcomes including, but not limited to, pain, function, infection, hospitalization, and death at 1 year for patients with symptomatic and radiographic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis of the hip or knee who have previously attempted nonoperative therapy, and for whom nonoperative therapy was ineffective, and who have chosen to undergo elective hip or knee arthroplasty (collectively referred to as TJA).

Methods

We developed 13 clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions. After a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low), and evidence tables were created. A Voting Panel, including 13 physicians and patients, discussed the PICO questions until consensus was achieved on the direction (for/against) and strength (strong/conditional) of the recommendations.

Results

The panel conditionally recommended against delaying TJA to pursue additional nonoperative treatment including physical therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ambulatory aids, and intraarticular injections. It conditionally recommended delaying TJA for nicotine reduction or cessation. The panel conditionally recommended delay for better glycemic control for patients who have diabetes mellitus, although no specific measure or level was identified. There was consensus that obesity by itself was not a reason for delay, but that weight loss should be strongly encouraged, and the increase in operative risk should be discussed. The panel conditionally recommended against delay in patients who have severe deformity or bone loss, or in patients who have a neuropathic joint. Evidence for all recommendations was graded as low or very low quality.

Conclusion

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the optimal timing of TJA in patients who have symptomatic and radiographic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis for whom nonoperative therapy was ineffective to improve patient-important outcomes, including pain, function, infection, hospitalization, and death at 1 year. We acknowledge that the evidence is of low quality primarily due to indirectness and hope future research will allow for further refinement of the recommendations.

### Medial unicompartimental knee arthroplasty for osteonecrosis or osteoarthritis [^111FdiJq]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

We report a prospective series of 33 unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKAs) operated for a spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK) compared with 35 UKAs operated for osteoarthritis (OA). The mean follow-up was 5 years. Preoperative functional score in the SPONK group was significantly lower than that in the OA group. The results were comparable in terms of pain, knee score and function. At the last follow-up, the survival rate was 92.8% for the SPONK group and 95.4% for the OA group. We found a higher rate of radiolucencies in the SPONK group, however, without any clinical symptoms. The UKA is a good option in the treatment of SPONK.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Obesity and body mass index (BMI) thresholds — ACR/AAHKS timing of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — state that in our defined population with a BMI of ≥ 50, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of < 50; in our defined population with a BMI of 40–49, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of < 40; and in our defined population with a BMI of 35–39, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of < 35. Recommendations 7–9 are conditional because there may be exceptions to these recommendations, and the evidence supporting a preoperative weight reduction and a rigid BMI or weight threshold is indirect and very low quality.

### Evaluation of lesion in a spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee using 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography [^1167pnp9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging has several advantages over conventional scintigraphy, including a high spatial resolution and the ability to quantify disease progression. Recently, (18)F-fluoride PET has been applied to the evaluation of malignant tumors and musculoskeletal disorders. In our current study, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) was visualized using this technique. We determined whether PET images can reveal SONK lesions, whether there were significant differences in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) among each of the SONK stages, and finally if there was any correlation between the maximum SUVmax value and size of the SONK lesion measured both by radiography and MRI. Fourteen knees from 13 patients diagnosed with SONK were imaged using a PET scanner. In all cases, PET showed an accumulation of 18F-fluoride in the medial condyle. The SUVmax ranged from 8.6 to 23.7 with an average of 15.1 ± 3.7 and was measured at different disease stages with an average of 12.4 ± 5.9 in Stage 2 (n = 5), 16.3 ± 1.4 in Stage 3 (n = 4), and 16.8 ± 4.3 (n = 5) in Stage 4 lesions. There were no significant differences in these measurements between the SONK stages. However, a significant positive correlation between the SUVmax and lesion size, including the surface area of the lesion (r2 = 0.692, P = 0.0002) and the condyle width ratio (r2 = 0.365, P = 0.022), was found. The approximate volumes of the lesions measured by MRI had an average of 4.8 ± 3.1 cm3, and also showed a significant correlation with the SUVmax (r2 = 0.853, P < 0.0001). Hence, our present results indicate that a high SUV is indicative of a large SONK lesion.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113VHk6P]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Osteonecrosis/avascular necrosis with steroid therapy in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) — risk and management: A potential long-term side effect associated with steroid therapy includes osteonecrosis/avascular necrosis, which most often affects weight-bearing joints (hip and/or knee) and seems to have a higher incidence among adolescents than younger children or adults. The Panel suggests considering not withholding corticosteroids in induction or intensification blocks; however, if severe avascular necrosis occurs during therapy, consider holding corticosteroids during maintenance therapy. If MRI findings have significantly improved or patient's symptoms have resolved in 6 months, corticosteroids may be resumed at that time, and prednisone may be preferred over dexamethasone in this context. There is no evidence for vitamin D and calcium replacement in pediatric patients regarding the prevention and treatment of osteonecrosis/avascular necrosis. Among high-risk patients on COG AALL0232, the development of osteonecrosis was associated with reduced rates of relapse (P = 0.0014) and higher 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (P < .0001) and overall survival (OS) (P < .0001).

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old… [^111eSMnT]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

1 In the 1970s, concerns arose about the emergence and rapid progression of group B Streptococcus infection in neonates, whose clinical appearance and preliminary laboratory evaluations did not always reflect the presence of serious disease. 2 Such concerns led to extensive evaluations, hospitalizations, and antimicrobial treatment of all febrile infants younger than 60 days, 3 with many institutions extending complete sepsis workups to 90 days. A major shift occurred in the mid-1980s when Powell et al in Rochester accepted the inability to predict who was at high risk and attempted instead to predict who was at low risk, even in the first month of life.

10, 14 A pattern emerged in which it was recommended that all infants in the youngest group should receive extensive evaluations, hospitalization, and empirical antimicrobial treatment, and infants 29 to 90 days of age could be managed with presumptive intramuscular ceftriaxone as outpatients with pending blood, urine, and CSF culture results.
15. It is more specific for bacterial infections than other IMs and rises more quickly to abnormal values. Procalcitonin has emerged as the most accurate IM for risk stratification available, although not currently available at many sites in the United States with timely results on a 24/7 basis. 38, 39. Viral Testing The development of rapid viral PCR and multiplex respiratory viral testing has led to identifying emerging agents, such as parechovirus, and prompted analyses of their effect on risk stratification of young febrile infants.

Risk Tolerance: A Number Is Not a Decision Even with the availability of valid and reliable data, thoughtful investigators and clinicians will have different thresholds for recommending diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions. The committee believes understanding risk tolerance is of fundamental importance to guideline interpretation. In a straightforward case of a febrile infant having CSF pleocytosis with a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a positive Gram stain result, the committee would expect clinicians to unanimously agree the infant be hospitalized and receive immediate antimicrobial treatment. The committee's focus was to develop a guideline to improve the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs, bacteremia, and bacterial meningitis. Sometimes the term "SBI" is used because it was the only outcome measure reported in many investigations.

In some analyses, bacteremia and bacterial meningitis are combined as IBIs because of the nature of those infections compared with UTIs.

### Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for avascular osteonecrosis [^111gYhd2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The data analyzing clinical and radiological outcomes after modern unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) for spontaneous and secondary avascular osteonecrosis are limited. We determined whether: (1) UKA for osteonecrosis was as reliable for alleviating pain and improving function (measured by Knee Society scores) as it is for osteoarthritis, (2) lower limb alignment could be restored after UKA for osteonecrosis, and (3) UKA for osteonecrosis is as durable as UKA for osteoarthritis (measured by survivorship at 12 years). We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients (31 knees) with osteonecrosis; 21 knees had spontaneous osteonecrosis and 10 had secondary osteonecrosis. Mean patient age was 71 years. Clinical and radiological evaluations were performed by an independent observer at a minimum followup of 3 years (mean, 7 years; range, 3–16 years). Reliable pain relief and function improvement were obtained in 30 knees (96%). Restoration of an appropriate lower-limb mechanical axis was achieved for 27 knees (88%). The Kaplan-Meier survivorship was 96.7% at 12 years. Our data suggest UKA is a reasonable solution for restoring clinical function and radiological lower-limb alignment for spontaneous or secondary osteonecrosis limited to one compartment of the knee, with a durable survivorship.

### Spontaneous regression of steroid-related osteonecrosis of the knee [^116bBo4B]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

It is unknown whether lesions of steroid-related osteonecrosis of the knee increase or decrease in size during the course of the disease after diagnosis. We sought to determine whether steroid-related osteonecrosis of the knee would have spontaneous changes in size, and if so, the factors affecting the change. We performed baseline and followup (minimum of 1 year) magnetic resonance imaging scans on 30 knees of 17 patients. We then used image registration techniques to match two sets of images. Lesion size change was evaluated on all contiguous pairs of matched magnetic resonance images. Fourteen Stage 1 (preradiographic stage) knees in seven patients showed spontaneous incomplete regression without subsequent collapse. These patients had early steroid-related lesions detected within 3 years after starting steroid treatment and all showed bilateral and multifocal involvement; lesion regression occurred regardless of location. The initial size and location of the lesions and discontinuing steroid administration did not seem to affect regression. Regression can occur in some patients with early steroid-related osteonecrosis of the knee, and the time between initiation of steroid treatment and its diagnosis might be the most significant predictive factor.

Arthritis Care & Research (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for knee osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to total knee arthroplasty (timing), AAHKS/ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to consider performing elective knee arthroplasty without delay rather than delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions in patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe OA and bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability or with a neuropathic joint.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Neuropathic joint — timing of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is addressed by the directive "we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions". This is stated to have no direct evidence support, as "There was no evidence for this recommendation; thus the recommendation is based on clinician and patient opinion and experiences". The rationale provided is that "delaying surgery increases the technical difficulty of the procedure and does not improve outcomes after the procedure", and "The recommendation is conditional because of the very low quality of the evidence in addition to the rare exceptions that may apply", with exceptions including "delay for personal reasons or other ongoing medical comorbidities" and possible short delay when "the underlying condition associated with the neuropathic joint is not known to allow for further diagnostic workup".

Coverage policies and nonoperative delays — coverage determination policies "are often not based on evidence studying patients in our defined population", and a review of cited literature in 4 major payers' policies "found that < 10% of the literature cited in these policies discussed the effectiveness of nonoperative treatments" for this population. The Voting Panel "recommended against delaying TJA in our defined population for additional nonoperative treatment including physical therapy, NSAIDs, braces or ambulatory aids, as well as intraarticular injections", noting that "it is not uncommon for patients to have their surgical procedure delayed by a third party for additional nonoperative treatment, creating a major barrier to care". Reported data include that "In an 8-year follow-up study of 3,417 knees deemed appropriate for TKA, Ghomrawi et al found that only 9% underwent a timely TKA (defined as within 2 years of meeting appropriateness criteria)".

### Subchondral insufficiency fractures, subchondral insufficiency fractures with osteonecrosis, and other apparently spontaneous subchondral bone lesions of the knee-pathogenesis and diagnosis at imaging [^116NUVua]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The onset of symptoms is sudden in almost three-quarters of cases and occurs after a minor trauma or even after a wrong move. The onset is so sudden that patients commonly remember the exact moment it occurred.

The lesions are predominantly located in the medial femoral condyle (in about 65% of cases), in the weight-bearing area. The lateral condyle is much more rarely affected (in about 15% of cases), just as the medial tibial plateau. Involvement of the lateral plateau is very rare.

The association with chondrosis varies greatly depending on the series, from intact cartilage to severe chondrosis in cases with advanced collapse. The association with a meniscal tear, on the other hand, has been consistently reported (in up to 76–94% of cases). In particular, the association with radial tears of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus or its attachment is found in more than 50% of cases. These meniscal tears are almost always associated with meniscal extrusions of 3 mm or more beyond the joint space margin (Fig. 1 d). They destabilize the meniscus and increase the mechanical strain on the articular surfaces by more than 25%, to the same extent as large meniscectomies (Fig. 5). Similarly, subchondral fractures or osteonecrosis may also occur following meniscectomy (Fig. 6).

Elective TJA timing — trial of braces and/or ambulatory aids: In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of braces and/or ambulatory aids. The recommendation is conditional with indirect and very low quality evidence, and the listed exceptions for the first recommendation apply. Patients recovering from another lower limb surgery may benefit from delaying TJA and using an ambulatory aid during recovery, but delaying TJA for brace or ambulatory aid treatment can place a burden on the patient and improper use may lead to altered gait mechanics, increased pain, and worsened function.

Adverse Events

Adverse events and serious adverse events were assessed from the time of patient enrollment until the last visit (Supplemental Digital Content 9;).

An adverse event was defined as any negative medical occurrence that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study treatment. A serious adverse event was defined as any adverse event that was life-threatening or resulted in death, hospitalization or prolongation of current hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity, substantial disruption of a patient's ability to conduct normal life activities, or congenital anomalies or birth defects.

Adverse events that started before the date of core decompression with implantation were not considered to be related to the treatment. Adverse events and serious adverse events that started on or after the date of core decompression with implantation (or if the start date of the adverse event or serious adverse event or the start date of core decompression with implantation was missing or unknown) were considered treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events.

The causal relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study treatment was assessed. Treatment-related adverse events were adverse events for which the investigator answered "Yes" to a relationship with the study treatment or adverse events with a missing relationship with the study treatment. Adverse events were classified as having a "certain", "probable or likely", "possible", "conditional or unclassified", or "not assessable or unclassifiable" causal relationship with bone marrow aspiration (sham) intervention, or as having "no relationship" with the bone marrow aspiration (sham) intervention. Adverse events related to other study procedures were those classified as having a "certain", "probable or likely", "possible", "conditional or unclassified", or "not assessable or unclassifiable" causal relationship with study procedures other than bone marrow aspiration and sham intervention (that is, anesthesia, blood sampling, and cell implantation) or those that had a missing relationship with study procedures other than bone marrow (sham) aspiration. Regular physical examinations were made, and vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and respiratory rate, were assessed at the follow-up timepoints. In addition, serology and biochemical and hematologic parameters were evaluated (Supplemental Digital Content 7;).

Ethical Approval

We obtained ethical review board approval for this study. This trial was registered at(NCT01529008).

### Artificial bone grafting [calcium hydroxyapatite ceramic with an interconnected porous structure (IP-CHA)] and core decompression for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the femoral condyle in the knee [^116Zw3dU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

We employed a new surgical method for the treatment of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle of the knee joint. Twelve spontaneous osteonecrosis patients of Koshino's classification stage 2 or 3 underwent core decompression curettage with an artificial bone graft [hydroxyapatite ceramic with an interconnected porous structure (IP-CHA)]. The mean age at surgery was 69.6 years and the mean follow-up term was 24.6 months. All patients reported a decrease in knee pain, immediately after surgery. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores of all the patients also improved post-surgery; X-ray and MR imaging indicated no worsening of the osteoarthritis, and smooth surfaces at the grafted areas of the artificial bone. No severe complications appeared in the patients. Our procedure was, therefore, less invasive and achieved results comparable to those involving traditional, more invasive methods. We recommend our novel procedure as a treatment for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the femoral condyle.

Timing of arthroplasty — no mandated delay: All recommendations in this guideline are conditional due to the low or very low quality of evidence, and there are no strong recommendations. In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) without delay over delaying arthroplasty 3 months; there should be no mandate that patients wait 3 months prior to TJA as an arbitrary cool-down period. The recommendation is conditional because there may be exceptions, and the evidence supporting the recommendation is indirect and very low quality, and patients in the defined population have already attempted nonoperative treatment for an extended period.

### Potential utility of SPECT / CT for early detection of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [^113fvfJX]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) is the most common phenotype of osteonecrosis of knee joints in older adults. Early diagnosis with appropriate management is crucial for improving the prognosis of the SONK. We present SONK in bone scintigraphy and SPECT/CT in 65-year-old man with sudden worsening knee pain and normal radiographs. SPECT/CT revealed intense uptake in subchondral area of left femoral medial condyle, which can be differed from progressed osteoarthritic change of the knee joints suspected on planar scintigraphy. Subsequently performed MRI showed characteristic finding of SONK. Total knee replacement arthroplasty was performed with final histological diagnosis of SONK.

Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline — objective is to develop evidence-based consensus recommendations for the optimal timing of hip and knee arthroplasty to improve patient-important outcomes including, but not limited to, pain, function, infection, hospitalization, and death at 1 year for patients with symptomatic and radiographic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis of the hip or knee who have previously attempted nonoperative therapy, for whom nonoperative therapy was ineffective, and who have chosen to undergo elective hip or knee arthroplasty (collectively referred to as TJA). Methods state that the group developed 13 clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions and, after a systematic literature review, used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rate the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low); a Voting Panel, including 13 physicians and patients, participated. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be voluntary.

### Osteonecrosis of the knee and related conditions [^113JRkTU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis (ON) of the knee is a progressive disease that often leads to subchondral collapse and disabling arthritis. Recent studies have identified three distinct pathologic entities, all of which were previously described as knee ON: secondary ON, spontaneous ON of the knee, and postarthroscopic ON. Radiographic and clinical assessment is useful for differentiating these conditions, predicting disease progression, and distinguishing these conditions from other knee pathologies. The etiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of secondary ON of the knee are similar to those found at other sites (eg, hip, shoulder). Spontaneous ON is a disorder of unknown etiology. Postarthroscopic ON has been described as an infrequent but potentially destructive complication. Various treatment modalities (eg, core decompression, bone grafting, high tibial osteotomy, arthroplasty), have been used with varying degrees of success for each type of ON. Secondary ON frequently progresses to end-stage disease, and early surgical intervention is recommended. Initial management of spontaneous ON of the knee and postarthroscopic ON is typically nonsurgical, with observation for clinical or radiographic progression.

### Predictive factors for the progression of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [^1139qS6M]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess potentially predictive factors that were evaluated 1 year after the onset of symptoms in patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) and to determine receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve cut-off values.

Methods

Within 1 year of symptom onset, patients with SONK-selected treatment options, mainly based on severity of pain, chose either conservative treatment (n = 27 knees) or operative treatment (n = 27 knees). Knee and whole-leg radiographs, knee MRIs and bone mineral density scans of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and femoral condyles were obtained. The parameters measured were: (1) anatomical angle on whole-leg radiograph and (2) lesion size and medial meniscus extrusion on MRI.

Results

The anatomical angle and lesion size in the sagittal section (depth) on MRI were markedly larger in the operative treatment group than those in the conservative treatment group. The anatomical angle and depth on MRI of SONK at Stages 1–3 were significantly different between groups, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 1.16 (1.18–2.34) and 1.11 (1.01–1.23). One year after symptom onset, ROC curve cut-off value for anatomical angle was 180° and depth on MRI was 20 mm.

Conclusion

An anatomical angle > 180° and depth > 20 mm on MRI were predictive factors for a poorer prognosis 1 year after symptom onset in patients with SONK. Our results on radiographs and MRI provided a predictive prognosis for patients with SONK at the initial visit to their orthopaedic surgeons.

### Conservative treatment of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee in the early stage: pulsed electromagnetic fields therapy [^1116nxaL]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

pulsed electromagnetic fields treatment might improve symptoms in the early stage of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.

Methods

Twenty-eight patients (19M/9F, age 49.8 ± 16.4 years) suffering from symptomatic (pain) Koshino stage I spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were treated with local pulsed electromagnetic fields therapy (6 h daily for 90 days). Clinical evaluation: baseline, 6- and 24-month follow-up by VAS for pain, knee society score (KSS), Tegner and EQ-5D scales. MRI evaluation: baseline and 6-month follow-up, measuring bone marrow lesion's areas and grading these lesions by WORMS score. Failures: patients undergoing knee arthroplasty.

Results

Pain significantly reduced at 6 months (from 73.2 ± 20.7 to 29.6 ± 21.3, p < 0.0001), which remained almost unchanged at final follow-up (27.0 ± 25.1). KSS significantly increased in first 6 months (from 34.0 ± 13.3 to 76.1 ± 15.9, p < 0.0001) and was slightly reduced at final follow-up (72.5 ± 13.5, p = 0.0044). Tegner median level increased from baseline to 6-month follow-up (1(1–1) and 3(3–4), respectively, p < 0.0001) and remained stable. EQ-5D improved significantly throughout the 24 months (0.32 ± 0.33, baseline; 0.74 ± 0.23, 6-month follow-up (p < 0.0001); 0.86 ± 0.15, 24-month follow-up (p = 0.0071)). MRI evaluation: significant reduction of total WORMS mean score (p < 0.0001) and mean femoral bone marrow lesion's area (p < 0.05). This area reduction was present in 85% and was correlated to WORMS grading both for femur, tibia and total joint (p < 0.05). Four failures (14.3%) at 24-month follow-up.

Conclusions

Pulsed electromagnetic fields stimulation significantly reduced knee pain and necrosis area in Koshino stage I spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee already in the first 6 months, preserving 86% of knees from prosthetic surgery at 24-month follow-up. No correlation was found between MRI and clinical scores.

### Knee arthroplasty for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee: unicompartimental vs bicompartimental knee arthroplasty [^117JiWEd]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SON) is an osteonecrosis that mainly affects the medial femoral condyle. In endstage SON, knee arthroplasty is the therapy of choice. Because of the unicompartimental nature of the knee, unicondylar knee arthroplasty is considered an ideal implant for treatment of this condition. The purpose of this study was to prove that the long-term results of unicondylar implants are better than the results of bicondylar implants for the treatment of SON. All patients treated for SON between 1984 and 2000 have been recorded. Two groups were formed according to the implant used. In all patients the preoperative radiograph was analyzed according to stage and size of the osteonecrotic lesion and the osteoarthritic changes. Postoperatively, the Knee Society Score and the radiograph were recorded. Thirty-nine patients were included in this study, of which 23 patients were treated by a unicondylar implant and 16 by a bicondylar implant. On a short-term basis, unicondylar implants had better clinical results; however, on a long-term basis bicondylar implants were better. In comparison, only unicondylar implants had to be revised. Radiolucency lines were mainly observed in patients with unicondylar impants and large areas of osteonecrosis. Our long-term results suggest that patients with SON are better treated by bicondylar implants. The reasons for the higher failure rate for unicondylar implants are poor bone stock and secondary arthritic changes.

### Does adjunction of autologous osteoblastic cells improve the results of core decompression in early-stage femoral head osteonecrosis? A double-blind, randomized trial [^114Nc4Vv]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disabling disease that can ultimately progress to collapse of the femoral head, often resulting in THA. Core decompression of the femoral head combined with cell therapies have shown beneficial effects in previous clinical studies in patients with early-stage (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I and II) ONFH. However, high-quality evidence confirming the efficacy of this treatment modality is still lacking.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Is core decompression combined with autologous osteoblastic cell transplantation superior to core decompression with placebo implantation in relieving disease-associated pain and preventing radiologic ONFH progression in patients with nontraumatic early-stage ONFH? (2) What adverse events occurred in the treatment and control groups?

Methods

This study was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study conducted from 2011 to 2019 (ClinicalTrails.gov registry number: NCT01529008). Adult patients with ARCO Stage I and II ONFH were randomized (1:1) to receive either core decompression with osteoblastic cell transplantation (5 mL with 20 x 10 6 cells/mL in the study group) or core decompression with placebo (5 mL of solution without cells in the control group) implantation. Thirty percent (68 of 230) of the screened patients were eligible for inclusion in the study; of these, 94% (64 of 68) underwent a bone marrow harvest or sham procedure (extended safety set) and 79% (54 of 68) were treated (study group: 25 patients; control group: 29). Forty-nine patients were included in the efficacy analyses. Similar proportions of patients in each group completed the study at 24 months of follow-up (study group: 44% [11 of 25]; control: 41% [12 of 29]). The study and control groups were comparable in important ways; for example, in the study and control groups, most patients were men (79% [27 of 34] and 87% [26 of 30], respectively) and had ARCO Stage II ONFH (76% [19 of 25] and 83% [24 of 29], respectively); the mean age was 46 and 45 years in the study and control groups, respectively. The follow-up period was 24 months post-treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite treatment response at 24 months, comprising the clinical response (clinically important improvement in pain from baseline using the WOMAC VA3.1 pain subscale, defined as 10 mm on a 100-mm scale) and radiologic response (the absence of progression to fracture stage [≥ ARCO Stage III], as assessed by conventional radiography and MRI of the hips). Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentages of patients achieving a composite treatment response, clinical response, and radiologic response at 12 months, and the percentage of patients undergoing THA at 24 months. We maintained a continuous reporting system for adverse events and serious adverse events related to the study treatment, bone marrow aspiration and sham procedure, or other study procedures throughout the study. A planned, unblinded interim analysis of efficacy and adverse events was completed at 12 months. The study was discontinued because our data safety monitoring board recommended terminating the study for futility based on preselected futility stopping rules: conditional power below 0.20 and p = 0.01 to detect an effect size of 10 mm on the 100-mm WOMAC VA3.1 pain subscale (improvement in pain) and the absence of progression to fracture (≥ ARCO Stage III) observed on radiologic assessment, reflecting the unlikelihood that statistically beneficial results would be reached at 24 months after the treatment.

Results

There was no difference between the study and control groups in the proportion of patients who achieved a composite treatment response at 24 months (61% [14 of 23] versus 69% [18 of 26]; p = 0.54). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with a treatment response at 12 months between the study and control groups (14 of 21 versus 15 of 23; p = 0.92), clinical response (17 of 21 versus 16 of 23; p = 0.38), and radiologic response (16 of 21 versus 18 of 23; p = 0.87). With the numbers available, at 24 months, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who underwent THA between the study and control groups (24% [six of 25] versus 14% [four of 29]). There were no serious adverse events related to the study treatment, and only one serious adverse event (procedural pain in the study group) was related to bone marrow aspiration. Nonserious adverse events related to the treatment were rare in the study and control groups (4% [one of 25] versus 14% [four of 29]). Nonserious adverse events related to bone marrow or sham aspiration were reported by 15% (five of 34) of patients in the study group and 7% (two of 30) of patients in the control group.

Conclusion

Our study did not show any advantage of autologous osteoblastic cells to improve the results of core decompression in early-stage (precollapse) ONFH. Adverse events related to treatment were rare and generally mild in both groups, although there might have been a potential risk associated with cell expansion. Based on our findings, we do not recommend the combination of osteoblastic cells and core decompression in patients with early-stage ONFH. Further, well-designed studies should be conducted to explore whether other treatment modalities involving a biological approach could improve the overall results of core decompression.

### Is unicompartmental arthroplasty an acceptable option for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee? [^117JWZas]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The literature suggests survivorship of unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKAs) for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee ranges from 93% to 97% at 10 to 12 years. However, these data arise from small series (23 to 33 patients), jeopardizing meaningful conclusions.

Questions/Purposes

We determined (1) the longer-term survivorship of UKAs in a larger group of patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee; (2) their subjective, symptomatic, and functional outcomes; and (3) the percentage of failures and reasons for failures to identify relevant indications, contraindications, and technical parameters for treatment with a modern implant design.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated all 84 patients with late-stage spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee who had a medial UKA from 1998 to 2005. All patients had preoperative MRI to confirm the diagnosis, exclude metaphyseal involvement, and confirm the absence of major degenerative changes in the lateral and patellofemoral compartments. The mean age of the patients at surgery was 66 years and mean BMI was 28.9. We conducted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using revision for any reason as the end point. Minimum followup was 63 months (mean, 98 months; range, 63–145 months).

Results

Ten-year survivorship was 89%. Ten revisions were performed; the most common reasons were subsidence of the tibial component (four) and aseptic loosening of the tibial component (three). No patient underwent revision for progression of osteoarthritis in the lateral or patellofemoral compartments.

Conclusions

Our data suggest spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee may be an indication for UKA, provided secondary osteonecrosis of the knee is ruled out, preoperative MRI documents the absence of disease in other compartments, and there is no overcorrection in any plane.

A few years later in 2008, another histological study of lesions diagnosed as "SONK" by Takeda et al. found that while in the early stages without collapse no osteonecrosis was seen, such features were visible in more advanced stages and confined to the area distal to the site of the fracture, which showed impaired healing (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Histological pattern of a SIF. Bone marrow necrosis ("necrosis") is located in the area between the fracture plane partially repaired ("hyperostosis") and the subchondral bone ("subchondral bone"), detached in this case. Cellular marrow with edema ("edema") is located more proximally to the fracture plane

Clinical context

The clinical context of SIFs is the same as that of the so-called SONKs. Both types of lesions occur mainly in patients above 60 years of age, mainly females, without any specific history of metabolic disorder or therapeutic intervention. A potential link with underlying osteopenia is suggested by some studies, but not all. However, it should be noted that insufficiency fractures may be particularly large or numerous in patients with conditions leading to bone fragility such as in renal transplant recipients or in cases of osteomalacia (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
SIF in a patient with osteomalacia. T2-weighted MR image shows a low signal intensity band corresponding to a particularly thick trabecular fracture (arrow). The bone marrow of this portion of the condyle shows BME-like high signal intensity (asterisk). Note that the BME-like signal extends between the fracture and the bone-cartilage interface (arrowheads). That area of the subchondral bone is in continuity with the rest of the epiphyseal area

### Surgical trends for managing knee osteonecrosis: a 2010 to 2020 United States nationwide study [^117FqTmA]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Knee osteonecrosis (ON) is rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.01–0.17 per 1,000 person years. Our study aimed to do the following: 1) quantify total operative procedures with rates normalized to the United States population; 2) compare arthroplasty versus joint-preserving procedural trends; and 3) determine rates of specific operative techniques/demographics in patients aged < 50 versus > 50 years.

Methods

Using a nationwide database, 8,269 patients diagnosed with knee ON underwent surgical treatment from 2010 to 2020. Documented surgical procedures included total knee arthroplasty (TKA), unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), and core decompression. Primary outcomes included procedural utilization with subanalyses comparing arthroplasty versus joint-preserving procedures, and age-stratified by under/over 50 years. Linear regressions were evaluated for trends in procedural volumes over time.

Results

From 2010 to 2014, 0.54% of all knee procedures were to treat ON compared to 0.71% from 2015 to 2020 (P < .001). Overall rates of TKA (85.4%) and UKA (10.3%) far exceeded rates of joint preserving procedures (4.3%). Comparing 2010–2014 with 2015–2019, joint-preserving procedures proportionally increased (0.7 to 5.0%, P < .001). Patients < 50 years had significantly more joint-preserving procedures (19.5 versus 2.7%). Overall, TKA was the most common procedure (7,062; 85.40%), following by UKA 853; 10.32%) and core decompression (354; 4.28%).

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize surgical trends in management of knee ON. Overall surgical volume for knee ON has continued to increase, outpacing population growth. Patients who have knee ON are most commonly managed with arthroplasty procedures, specifically TKA. Younger aged patients (< 50 years) are more likely to undergo joint-preserving procedures, namely core decompression.

### Diagnosis and management of the osteonecrotic triad of the knee [^117Gk65a]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Generalized osteonecrosis of the knee may include, in addition to osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle that occurs most frequently, osteonecrosis of the patella or the tibial plateau. Such involvement is known as the osteonecrotic triad of the knee. Although the clinical picture of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle seems similar to several other disorders, certain distinct features, including its typical location, clinical symptoms, and late onset of cartilaginous erosion, facilitate differential diagnosis. Despite the progress made in the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle, the prognosis remains severe. More than 80% of the patients deteriorate to the extent that surgical reconstruction is necessary, whereas only about 20%of the patients demonstrate spontaneous resolution or no additional deterioration of the osteonecrotic lesion.

### Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [^111x5i2W]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee presents with acute onset of severe, pain in elderly patients, usually female and usually without a history of trauma. Originally described as idiopathic osteonecrosis, the exact etiology is still debated. Evidence suggests that an acute fracture occurs as a result of chronic stress or minor trauma to a weakened subchondral bone plate. The imaging characteristics on MR reflect the age of the lesion and the symptoms. More appropriate terminology may be " subchondral insufficiency fracture of the knee" or "focal subchondral osteonecrosis".

### Stress fracture of the pelvis and lower limbs including atypical femoral fractures-a review [^117LuVRX]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

It is important to realise that what appears like increased fluid signal on MRI and is therefore colloquially called "bone marrow oedema" is in fact granulation tissue with fibrovascular ingrowth. Oedema-like bone marrow changes therefore represent a tissue reaction to a variety of stimuli; trabecular microfractures leading to bone repair is one of them.

Over the years a number of theories have been brought forward to explain transient or permanent bone marrow signal change around weight-bearing joints. Venous congestion, synovitis and atraumatic reflex sympathetic dystrophy have all been proposed and largely refuted. Yamamoto and Bullough have proposed stress (insufficiency) type fractures as the cause for these syndromes and this theory could explain the range of imaging findings that might or might not progress to more serious presentations including osteonecrosis or even rapid osteolysis of the femoral head.

Applied to the knee spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) can be thought of as a stress fracture of subchondral bone. Any feature increasing the mechanical stress onto bone, such as meniscal degeneration, or weakening bone, such as osteopenia, should and do lead to an increased risk of SONK (Fig. 8). With any significant bone injury some bone tissue death, necrosis, will occur. In the case of SONK this is secondary to mechanical stress and thus "encouraged" by any condition weakening bone or increasing bone stress.

Fig. 8
An elderly female with sudden spontaneous onset of pain. Initial radiographs (shown AP view, a) do not show a focal anomaly. MRI 1 month later performed for persistent pain shows extensive bone marrow oedema-like change in the medial femoral condyle with a subchondral sclerotic area consistent with an insufficiency fracture (b, c; PD-FS; see arrows). The features are those of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, SONK. Note the degeneration/tear of the medial meniscus, a common association of SONK. Radiographic follow-up 1 month after the MRI shows partial cortical collapse of the medial femoral condyle (d, see arrows)

Some of the bone marrow changes identified on MRI are of course incidental findings and resolve spontaneously and never have associated clinical symptoms. This phenomenon is already known from bone scintigraphy studies of athletes.

### Multiple joint osteonecrosis in a patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids [^112hhr83]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Ahlback and colleagues were the first to describe the spontaneous type of knee ON in 1968. It is the most common form of knee ON. Its exact etiology is still unclear; however, it is thought that vascular insufficiency or traumatic event might be implicated in the necrosis of subchondral bone with subsequent development of articular surface collapse and secondary osteoarthritis. This clinical entity is often restricted to the medial femoral condyle with particular unilateral affection of the epiphysis and without other joint involvement or associated comorbidity. It affects older individuals older than 55 years. While secondary knee ON usually affects the epiphysis, metaphysis, and even diaphysis, are found in patients younger than 55 years. It is characterized by the presence of bilateral multiple lesions that affect the hip in 90% of the patients. It occurs in association with steroid use, alcoholism, connective tissue disease, sickle cell disease, thrombophilia, and in patients with organ transplantation.

Patients with allergic rhinitis represent approximately 10% to 30% of the general population, and the prevalence tends to increase progressively across the world. Although the use of intranasal corticosteroids is considered safe, occasional adverse events have been reported such as adrenal suppression, increased intraocular pressure, and growth suppression. Although it was shown that 90% of patients with knee ON have a history of steroid use, data on the dose, route of administration, and length of treatment that can cause ON are remarkably variable. Although long-term high-dose steroid therapy is a major risk factor for ON, ON can develop after short-term low-dose therapy, intra-articular injection, or inhalational steroid. It is believed that steroids increase the bone marrow adipocyte cell size with elevation of the intraosseous pressure and subsequent impairment of the blood flow. The combined use of alcohol and steroids is shown to have an additive effect in causing ON. We feel that despite the low systemic bioavailability of the intranasal corticosteroids, they can cause ON in the presence of increased alcohol intake.

Imaging

What is the role of knee radiographs in the assessment of middle-aged or older patients with a painful knee?

Knee radiography should be used as a first-line imaging tool to support a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or to detect certain rarer pathologies of the knee. Therefore, at least a posterior-anterior weight-bearing semi-flexed knee radiograph and a lateral view should be included in the work-up of the middle-aged or older patient with knee pain (Grade B).

How should we make the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis on a daily practical basis?

The clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis can typically be made on the basis of the duration and character of the knee joint symptoms, patient history (including the presence of strong risk factors for osteoarthritis such as age, limb malalignment, obesity, heredity, prior knee injuries and surgeries) and findings from clinical examination. In the orthopaedic setting, weight-bearing semi-flexed knee radiographs (such as the Lyon Schuss or Rosenberg view) should be included in the work-up of the middle-aged or older patient with knee pain. A skyline patella view is also important for the detection of radiographic evidence of patella-femoral osteoarthritis. Please note that plain knee radiography does not necessarily capture early stages of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (Grade B).

What is the role of knee MRI in the assessment of a middle-aged or older patient with a painful knee?

Knee MRI is typically not indicated in the first-line work-up of the middle-aged or older patients with knee joint symptoms. However, knee MRI may be indicated in selected patients with refractory symptoms or in the presence of "warning flags" or localised symptoms indicating a rarer disease that needs to be ruled out, e.g. osteonecrosis. Hence, if a surgical indication is considered, based on history, symptoms, clinical exam and knee radiography, knee MRI may be useful to identify structural knee pathologies that may (or may not) be relevant for the symptoms (Grade B).

### Multiple joint osteonecrosis in a patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids [^113aLHUh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients usually present with gradual onset of severe medial knee pain that is often worse at night or with weight-bearing. The diagnosis of knee ON is often challenging because it is assumed that the knee pain might be due to meniscal injury or early arthritic changes. Diagnostic workup including connective tissue screening tests and thrombophilia tests can be considered in patients with ON. However, their role in patient management is not clear. The plain radiographs are completely normal initially; therefore, high index of clinical suspicion and thorough history are important to identify possible risk factors. Later on, radiographs show subchondral radiolucent areas and eventual articular surface collapse with arthritic changes as the disease progresses. At early stage disease, MRI is the modality of choice to establish the diagnosis. It provides detailed information about the extension of the lesion and any other associated intra-articular lesions. MRI is also an important screening imaging tool in high-risk patients, regardless of the symptoms. Although bone scintigraphy is an effective diagnostic tool, it has a much lower sensitivity of 64% compared with 100% reported using MRI beside its limited value in patients with multifocal disease. The duration from the start of symptoms to the time of diagnosis is variable ranging from two weeks to 24 months. In our patient, the diagnosis was made 13 weeks after the pain started. Early diagnosis is important to avoid mistreatment and to avoid or delay the need for arthroplasty especially in younger patients.

Although it is difficult to differentiate between spontaneous and secondary knee ON based on the clinical presentation, demographic and radiological findings can help identify the type of knee ON. A relatively young patient with multiple joints involvement and underlying risk factors, as is the case with our patient, makes the diagnosis of secondary ON more likely. In addition, MRI findings are useful to identify the type of knee ON particularly those with notably larger lesions in patients with secondary ON and with the presence of irregular well-demarcated line between the necrotic and viable bone. Only few cases of bilateral knee ON have been reported in the literature with affection of the patella, and the lateral femoral condyle. The lesions in our case were localized to the medial tibial plateau bilaterally, which is unusual. All cases shared the same risk factor of steroid use that varied from the typical oral formto the inhaled form. In our case, intranasal corticosteroids were responsible for ON.

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^116Uwrw1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Osteonecrosis continues to be a condition of widely variant etiologies, treatments, and developmental profiles. Because incidence continues to rise, increased understanding of the pathophysiology is necessary to promote developments of new treatments and corrective procedures. Although promising developments are being made in areas such as bone grafting and stem cell therapy, the field continues to lack an agreed-upon regimen to provide patients with osteonecrosis the greatest quality of life and delay their progression to debilitating injury, collapse, or joint arthroplasty. To more effectively understand this disease process, more data are needed. A national registry would be the most complete system to determine diagnostic and treatment directions. In the absence of such a coordinated effort, institutional registries and large cohort studies would help to make advances in this realm.

In the area of treatment, there are many potential avenues for improvement. Promising advancements in bone repair such as anabolic agents may play a role in promoting healing. In addition, more directed therapies for coincident conditions may reduce the secondary development of osteonecrosis from steroids and chemotherapy. With an expanded study of etiologies, prevention, and therapy, there is a reason to hope for advancements in reducing the burden of this disease.

### Does adjunction of autologous osteoblastic cells improve the results of core decompression in early-stage femoral head osteonecrosis? A double-blind, randomized trial [^116nW1Rp]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disabling condition that mostly affects adults aged 30 to 50 years and more often affects men than women. Without early intervention, progression to femoral head collapse is eventually observed in most patients; at this point, it is often treated with THA. Although the exact pathogenesis of nontraumatic ONFH remains unclear, risk factors include excessive corticosteroid use and alcohol intake, certain diseases, smoking, and obesity). Staging of ONFH is based on the 2019 Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) staging system, with four defined disease stages. The main goals of early-stage ONFH (ARCO Stages I and II) treatment include improvement in symptoms and function, preservation of the femoral head, and delay of the time until THA.

Current treatment options for these precollapse stages include numerous surgical procedures and nonsurgical management, including medications and biophysical treatments, but considerable disagreement remains about how to treat patients with precollapse ONFH. Core decompression is a widely accepted procedure for these patients, but it has inconsistent success. This highlights the need to search for more effective therapeutic options in the management of precollapse ONFH. There has been growing interest in investigating whether core decompression combined with other treatments such as mesenchymal stem cells or osteoinductive agents can improve outcomes for patients with ONFH. Focal adjunction of mesenchymal stem cells is a particularly promising therapy for ONFH, given their ability to differentiate into specific cell lines and proliferate to repair damaged tissues. Studies have suggested that core decompression combined with cell therapy (in vitro culture or concentrated autologous bone marrow–containing mononuclear cells) has beneficial effects in patients with early-stage ONFH. However, current data remain inconclusive, and the treatment is controversial.

We therefore asked: (1) Is core decompression combined with autologous osteoblastic cell transplantation superior to core decompression with placebo implantation in relieving disease-associated pain and preventing radiologic ONFH progression in patients with nontraumatic early-stage ONFH? (2) What adverse events occurred in the treatment and control groups?

Nicotine dependence — ACR/AAHKS timing of TJA — states that in our defined population with nicotine dependence, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA for nicotine reduction/cessation. This recommendation is conditional because there are exceptions, and the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation is low. The decision to proceed with TJA should not be contingent on complete nicotine cessation. Patients should be provided resources to assist with nicotine use reduction or cessation, and the patient should be educated about the increased surgical risks associated with nicotine use and ideally engage in nicotine-reduction strategies.

### Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) [^111988qB]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK/Morbus Ahlback) mainly affects the medial condyle of elderly women. It is assumed that localized vascular insufficiency leads to necrosis of the subchondral bone with subsequent disruption of the nutrition supply to the cartilage above. The aetiology remains unclear in detail. Operative treatment procedures compete against non-operative strategies, whereas the outcome is unpredictable in many cases.

Method

A consecutive case series of five patients suffering from SONK was analysed. All patients underwent a clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, as well as laboratory analyses and visual analogue scale (VAS) evaluation. Our treatment regime is based on high-dose vitamin D administered orally and intravenous application of 3 mg ibandronate two times within 8 weeks. Another 8 weeks later, all patients were followed up including a follow-up MRI.

Results

Within 4 weeks, all patients were free of symptoms. The MRI follow-up showed remission of the bone marrow oedema in every case studied. VAS decreased significantly from 7.4 ± 1.0 pre-interventional to 0.8 ± 1.0 post-interventional. No allergic reactions or other side effects were documented.

Conclusion

We showed that our treatment regime not only eliminated the pathological findings in the MRI of all cases studied, but also decreased the pain level and functional limitations within a short-time period.

### Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee: tibial plateaus [^1151nrLJ]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the medial tibial plateau is less recognized than osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle, but it presents in a similar manner. These patients have a sudden onset of pain on the medial side of the knee associated with a spectrum of MRI changes in the tibial subchondral bone. The small lesions can resolve with only minimal residual scar remaining in the subchondral zone. If the lesion is large, it can collapse or show MRI changes of osteonecrosis. Recognition of this problem may help avoid unnecessary intra-articular surgical intervention.

A 69-year-old man was referred to physical therapy by his primary care physician for an insidious onset of right medial knee pain that had been present for over 4 weeks. Due to the disproportionate response following initial management, he was referred to an orthopaedist for imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed medial femoral condyle osteopenia, bone marrow edema, and subchondral bone collapse, and subsequently the patient was diagnosed with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.

Purpose

The purpose of the present study was to compare total (TKA) and unicondylar (UKA) knee arthroplasty for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK), and to investigate potential correlations to radiographic parameters.

Methods

All consecutive patients with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proven SONK treated with either TKA or UKA between 2002 and 2018 were analysed. The primary outcomes were postoperative complications and failure rates. Functional assessment included Knee Society Score (KSS), WOMAC Score, and range of motion. A novel three-dimensional measurement method was established to determine the size of the osteonecrotic lesion. All outcome parameters were correlated to the size of the necrotic lesion using Spearman's rank correlation.

Results

The two treatment groups (34 TKAs, 37 UKAs) did not differ regarding age, body mass index, and ratio of the volume of the necrotic lesion to the volume of the femoral condyle (n.s.). At a mean follow-up of 6.6 years, patients with UKA had better functional outcomes compared to patients with a TKA (WOMAC Score 1.0 vs. 1.6, p = 0.04; KSS pain 86 vs. 83, n.s), with a similar complication rate. No correlation was found between necrotic lesion size and failure rate (n.s.).

Conclusion

UKA is a valuable treatment option for SONK leading to good functional results and a low failure rate. In case of a surgeon's concern regarding implant anchorage, TKA represents an equivalent solution. The MR-tomographic size of the osteonecrotic lesions seems to have no influence on the results.

Subchondral insufficiency fractures, without (SIF) or with osteonecrosis (SIF-ON)

The subchondral area of the epiphyses of the knees can be the site of SIFs, which are potentially transient, but can also become irreversible if evolving to osteonecrosis (i.e. SIF-ON) and collapse.

Historical background

Spontaneous epiphyseal collapses (referred to as "idiopathic osteonecrosis of the knee") have been described as a distinct entity by Ahlbäck et al. in 1968, with very precise descriptions of the clinical context. With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it became evident that these collapses were preceded by areas of bone marrow edema (BME)-like signal changes, which were visible on MRI before radiographic collapse. Consequently, the term "spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK)" has been extensively used to describe any spontaneous onset of pain that is associated with subchondral BME-like signal at MRI, or epiphyseal uptake on bone scans.

Other authors have noted similarities between spontaneous BME-like signal changes that are transient and those followed by focal subchondral osteonecrosis. These observations have led these authors to consider a common etiology and the hypothesis that an insufficiency fracture could represent the triggering event in both cases.

A histological study by Yamamoto and Bullough in 2000 has largely contributed to advancing the debate. These authors retrospectively reviewed the histological material of surgically treated lesions that had been previously diagnosed as "SONK" based on the clinical presentation, imaging studies (including MRI), and pathologic findings. They found two types of lesions in histology: first, lesions that have a subchondral fracture line with no evidence of associated osteonecrosis, and second, lesions that have a subchondral fracture line associated with focal osteonecrosis (Fig. 2). Since the osteonecrotic area was strictly confined to the area between the fracture line and the articular surface, the authors concluded that the fracture is probably the primary event.

Fig. 2
Diagram depicting the histopathologic classification of the two types of subchondral lesions, by Yamamoto and Bullough (with authorization of the author T.Y.). In lesions previously considered as "spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK)", the authors showed that the area located between fracture line and the articular contour contains either normal bone marrow (in subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIFs)), or focal osteonecrosis (in SIF complicated with osteonecrosis (SIF-ON))

### Zoledronic acid is more efficient than ibandronic acid in the treatment of symptomatic bone marrow lesions of the knee [^114HJ5Ba]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bone marrow lesions (BML) are frequently observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee for various pathologic conditions, yet their clinical significance and the need for treatment are often unclear (Fig. 1). Depending on the related pathology, BML are accompanied by the risk of progression to osteonecrosis. The previous laboratory studies revealed an altered bone metabolism in patients suffering from BML. Specifically, elevated levels of serum bone turnover markers including C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide (CTx, a bone resorption marker) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP, a bone formation marker), as well as vitamin D deficiencies have been reported. MR imaging has been combined with bone metabolic workup to get a better understanding of the aetiopathological processes underlying BML, and to start an indicated treatment as early as possible.

### Core decompression is superior to nonoperative management for humeral head osteonecrosis: a systematic review [^113rt2Zb]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Much of the literature on osteonecrosis has traditionally focused on the hip, which remains the most common site for this disease. The shoulder and the knee are the second most frequently affected sites (both approximately 10% of the incidence). There are a variety of techniques for managing this disease, and it is important to optimize this for our patients. This review aimed to compare the results of core decompression (CD) vs. nonoperative modalities for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the humeral head, including (1) success rate defined as lack of progression to further procedures (shoulder arthroplasty) and no need for further intervention; (2) clinical results (patient-reported pain and functional scores); and (3) radiological outcomes.

Methods

We queried PubMed and found 15 reports that fit the inclusion criteria for studies concerning the use of CD as well as studies discussing nonoperative treatment for stage I-III osteonecrotic lesions of the shoulder. A total of 9 studies encompassed 291 shoulders that underwent CD analyzed at a mean follow-up of 8.1 years (range, 67 months-12 years), and 6 studies examined 359 shoulders that underwent nonoperative management at a mean follow-up of 8.1 years (range, 35 months-10 years). Outcomes of CD and nonoperative management included success rate, number of shoulders requiring shoulder arthroplasty, and evaluation of several normalized patient-reported outcomes. We also assessed radiographic progression (pre- to postcollapse or further collapse progression).

Results

The mean success rate of CD for avoiding further procedures was 76.6% (226 of 291 shoulders) in stage I through stage III. Stage III shoulders avoided shoulder arthroplasty in 63% (27 of 43 shoulders). Nonoperative management resulted in a success rate of 13%, P < .001. In the CD studies, 7 of 9 showed improvements in clinical outcome measurements compared with 1 of 6 of the nonoperative studies. Radiographically, there was less progression in the CD group (39 of 191 shoulders [24.2%]) vs. the nonoperative group (39 of 74 shoulders [52.3%]) (P < .001).

Conclusions

Given the high success rate and positive clinical outcomes reported, CD is an effective method for management, especially when compared with nonoperative treatment methods for stage I-III osteonecrosis of the humeral head. The authors believe that it should be used as treatment to avoid arthroplasty in patients who have osteonecrosis of the humeral head.

### Osteonecrosis of the knee: a review of three disorders [^111vHjXy]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the knee is a debilitating disease that is poorly understood. Originally described as a single disorder, it encompasses three distinct conditions: spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK), secondary osteonecrosis of the knee, and post-arthroscopic osteonecrosis of the knee. This article reviews the current knowledge of these distinct conditions by describing their etiology, pathology, and pathogenesis, as well as their clinical and radiographic presentations. The various treatment options available for each condition are reviewed, with a discussion of their rationale and indications, and a summary of results with various techniques. A thorough understanding of these conditions and their distinguishing features is critical to selecting the best treatment option for an individual patient.

### Clinical results and radiographical evaluation of opening wedge high tibial osteotomy for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [^1175tNhZ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

We evaluated the clinical outcomes, in terms of early weight bearing, of using opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) to treat spontaneous osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle of the knee (SONK) using TomoFix and artificial bone substitute. Damaged cartilage tissue was removed and drilling of the necrotic area followed by OWHTO was performed in 30 knees from 30 patients with an average age of 71 years (range 58–82) at the time of operation. Patients were allowed to undertake partial weight-bearing exercises 1 week after the osteotomy procedure, with all patients performing full weight-bearing exercise at 2 weeks post-surgery. The mean follow-up period was 40 months (range 24–62). All of the SONK patients could walk with a full weight-bearing load, using only a T-cane, at 2 weeks after undergoing OWHTO. Clinical assays, including the mean American Knee Society Score and Function Score, showed significant improvements from 51 to 93 points, and 58 to 93 points, respectively. Prior to surgery, the average femoro-tibial angle (FTA) during standing was 181 (1 degree anatomical varus) and had significantly changed to 170 (10 degrees valgus) at the time of follow-up. There were no cases of non-union, or implant failure in any of our patients. In addition, none of the patients could sit in the Japanese style prior to surgery, but 21 of 30 patients (70%) could do so after treatment. Arthroscopic findings could be observed in 24 out of 30 cases at implant removal. Necrotic area in each case was covered with fibrous cartilage-like tissue completely. Drilling of the necrotic area followed by OWHTO with TomoFix and artificial bone substitute is an effective treatment for SONK as it results in pain alleviation and regeneration of the fibrous cartilage tissue over the necrotic legion. In addition, an early weight-bearing exercise program is possible after this procedure and full weight-bearing can be achieved at two weeks after surgery.

Osteonecrosis of systemic origin

Nosological context

Ischemic or avascular osteonecrosis results from impaired blood supply to the bone, causing irreversible death of bone cells (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes) and bone marrow cells (mainly adipocytes in the knee epiphysis).

Apart from traumatic causes, osteonecrosis can occur by systemic mechanisms that are not always well understood, in subjects with various risk factors (including hypercorticism, alcoholism, hyperuricemia, lupus erythematosus, sickle cell disease, and HIV)).

Systemic osteonecrosis occurs in the epiphyses and in the diaphyseal and metaphyseal regions, particularly in or near the hips and knees. Lesions are bilateral in more than 80% of cases (Fig. 30).

Fig. 30
Distribution of osteonecrosis from systemic origin. T1-weighted MR image shows lesions characterized by bone marrow areas surrounded by a peripheral rim (asterisks). These lesions are often bilateral, epiphyseal, and diaphyseal-metaphyseal. The areas within the peripheral rims may show a normal marrow signal, corresponding to mummified but not degraded fat

Depending on the location, osteonecrosis was previously termed "avascular necrosis", "aseptic necrosis", or "ischemic necrosis" (if located in the epiphysis), or "bone infarction" (if located in the metaphysis or diaphysis). However, the term osteonecrosis is appropriate for all locations of devitalized bone.

In the absence of mechanical collapse, these lesions are generally asymptomatic (so-called silent osteonecrosis). It is when a collapse occurs that the lesion becomes symptomatic.

Radiographic appearance

Radiography is normal for early lesions. In more advanced stages, osteonecrosis appears as irregular densification with a serpentine sclerotic border, better depicted on CT (Fig. 31).

Fig. 31
Radiographic of osteonecrosis of systemic origin. a Radiograph shows areas of heterogeneous bone sclerosis, in this case particularly prominent in the condyles. b CT arthrography shows areas of irregular bone densification corresponding to osteonecrotic lesions (asterisks) surrounded by sclerotic rims. Note collapsed segments in the weight-bearing areas of inferior condylar poles (arrows) associated with fractures within necrotic areas (arrowheads)

The collapse of an epiphyseal lesion is associated with deformation or disruption of the subchondral bone plate, sometimes with separation of the subchondral bone plate from the rest of the lesion (i.e. subchondral dissection). Epiphyseal deformity may evolve towards osteoarthritis.

### The role of meniscal tears in spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee: a systematic review of suspected etiology and a call to revisit nomenclature [^1134m2Qn]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The cause of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) and postarthroscopic osteonecrosis of the knee is unknown, and the mechanisms involved have been poorly characterized.

Hypothesis/Purpose

The purpose of this study was to perform a detailed systematic review of the literature to examine proposed etiological mechanisms for SONK in order to establish an improved understanding of the processes involved. We hypothesized that the etiology of SONK would be multifactorial.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Inclusion criteria were all original research articles presented in the English language that reported on the suspected etiology of SONK. Reviews, case reports with fewer than 3 patients, cost-effectiveness studies, technical reports, editorial articles, surveys, special topics, letters to the editor, personal correspondence, and studies that only proposed factors for the progression of SONK were excluded.

Results

After a comprehensive review of 255 articles, 26 articles were included for final analysis. Twenty-one (80.7%) of 26 articles implicated the role of the meniscus in the development of SONK, in an association with either meniscal tears or its development after meniscectomy. The medial meniscus and posterior meniscal root tears were implicated more frequently. All 4 studies incorporating histological findings supported the insufficiency fracture hypothesis as a pathological basis of SONK.

Conclusion

Physicians should be cognizant of the high prevalence of medial meniscus root tears in patients with SONK. Meniscectomy and meniscal tears, particularly of the medial meniscus posterior root, increase contact pressures and create an environment from which insufficiency fractures can emanate. We believe the term SONK is a misrepresentation of the etiology and pathogenesis of the condition and should be replaced with subchondral insufficiency fractures of the knee. Further elucidation of the etiology is required.

### An evidence-based guide to the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^114DRpFx]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a potentially devastating condition, the prevalence of which is increasing. Many joint-preserving forms of treatment, both medical and surgical, have been developed in an attempt to slow or reverse its progression, as it usually affects young patients. However, it is important to evaluate the best evidence that is available for the many forms of treatment considering the variation in the demographics of the patients, the methodology and the outcomes in the studies that have been published, so that it can be used effectively. The purpose of this review, therefore, was to provide an up-to-date, evidence-based guide to the management, both non-operative and operative, of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

### Current practices of AAHKS members in the treatment of adult osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^114XrzV7]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is currently no standardized protocol for evaluating and treating osteonecrosis of the femoral head in adults in the United States. We sought to understand current treatment practices of a group of surgeons who commonly treat this disease to determine if there was agreement on some aspects of care.

Methods

We designed a two-staged mixed-mode (mailed and faxed) sixteen-question self-administered descriptive survey questionnaire to be sent to all 753 active members of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS). The survey design was based on Dillman's survey research methodology, and the questionnaire included hypothetical clinical scenarios based on the Steinberg classification system. The responses elucidated the opinions and treatment preferences of high-volume arthroplasty surgeons who treat adult patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

Results

Of the 753 active members of the AAHKS, 403 (54%) responded to the questionnaire. Total hip replacement was reported to be the most frequent intervention for treatment of postcollapse (Steinberg stage-IIIB, IVB, V, and VI) osteonecrosis; core decompression was reported to be the most commonly offered intervention for symptomatic, precollapse (Steinberg stage-IB and IIB) osteonecrosis. Less frequently offered treatments included nonoperative management, osteotomy, vascularized and non-vascularized bone-grafting, hemiarthroplasty, and arthrodesis.

Conclusions

The care of adults with osteonecrosis of the femoral head varies among American orthopaedic surgeons specializing in hip and knee surgery. A consensus may evolve with a continued concerted effort on the part of interested surgeons, but it will require randomized, controlled, prospective studies of treatment of each stage of the disease and collaborative multicenter studies.

### Resuming elective hip and knee arthroplasty after the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: the European Hip Society and European knee associates recommendations [^116K4cW9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale Several guidelines outline the urgent indications for hip and knee arthroplasty surgery. The American College of Surgeons' 'COVID 19: Elective Case Triage Guidelines for Surgical Care Guidelines on Surgery' describe the following conditions as priority indications for hip and knee arthroplasty surgery: hip dislocation, knee dislocation, periprosthetic fracture, acute pain exacerbation in prior joint arthroplasty, inability to bear weight on the extremity, wound drainage, fever and concern for periprosthetic infection.

The International Consensus Group and the AAHKS Research Committee recommend priority surgery for impending fracture and exposed implants, in addition to the conditions outlined above.

It would be helpful to have guidelines covering the priority indications for elective surgery for primary hip and knee arthroplasty, with a stratification of patient symptoms, disability, disease severity and soft/tissue bone compromise. Examples might include femoral head collapse in avascular necrosis, severe disability, and painful bone marrow oedema. The same should be done for revision indications, such as bone loss, impending fracture, extensor mechanism disruption, patella dislocation, severe osteolysis, massively failed implants, and second stage implantation of infections.
4 What is the role of outpatient hip and knee arthroplasty/enhanced recovery protocols in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic?

Statement It is universally accepted that shorter hospital stays and treatment in a SARS-CoV-2-free environment decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing elective surgery. Performing hip and knee arthroplasty with enhanced recovery protocols that decrease the length of stay in a facility or can be used in ambulatory care centres to allow for day surgery might be beneficial for reducing the risk of viral transmission. Transitioning to enhanced recovery systems requires full support, adoption of all the subspecialties involved and the possible approval of health care payers, which may not be possible in the pandemic setting.

Rationale Enhanced recovery protocols for hip and knee arthroplasty have been shown to decrease length of stay without increasing complications in appropriate patients. These protocols require a graduated, multi-specialty approach, with refinements being performed according to each centre's needs. Transitioning to enhanced recovery protocols might be difficult in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but it must be an intermediate-term goal, involving the health care payers if necessary.

Treatment Options

Risk of Progression

Evaluating risk of progression is important in determining an appropriate treatment choice (Table 2). Although there is no consensus on a system to definitively predict collapse, a review of attempted strategies has found increased lesion volume, necrosis > 40% of the weight-bearing surface, and necrosis radian > 200 to 250 to be suggestive of future collapse.

Table 2
Treatment Considerations Based on Lesion Collapse and Staging

Observation

The most conservative management, observation, has been considered as a possible approach to osteonecrosis. There has been some evidence for spontaneous resolution of small early-stage osteonecrosis lesions. In combination with observation, restricted weight-bearing is usually advised, although this has not shown utility as a primary treatment modality. A study of observation as a strategy in osteonecrosis of the hip has found a failure rate of over 80% by four years and is not recommended as a standalone treatment in advanced lesions.

### Subchondral insufficiency fractures, subchondral insufficiency fractures with osteonecrosis, and other apparently spontaneous subchondral bone lesions of the knee-pathogenesis and diagnosis at imaging [^114ScBTo]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIFs) and SIFs with osteonecrosis (SIF-ONs) of the knee (previously misnamed spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK)) are bone lesions that appear without prior traumatic, tumoral, or inflammatory event.

Both conditions are characterized in the early stages by epiphyseal bone marrow edema (BME)-like signal at MRI. However, while SIFs usually heal spontaneously, they can also evolve to osteonecrosis (i.e. SIF-ON), which may progress to an irreversible collapse of the articular surface. Careful analysis of other MRI signs may help differentiate the two conditions in the early phase. In SIFs, the BME edema-like signal extends to the area immediately adjacent to the subchondral plate, while in SIF-ONs, this subchondral area shows low signal intensity on fluid-sensitive MR images due to altered bone marrow. The thickness and length of subchondral areas with low fluid-sensitive signal intensity are important factors that determine the prognosis of SIF-ONs. If they are thicker than 4 mm or longer than 14 mm, the prognosis is poor. The differential diagnosis of SIFs and SIF-ONs include bone lesions associated with the "complex regional pain syndrome" (CRPS), epiphyseal osteonecrosis of systemic origin, and those related to cartilage pathology.

Clinical relevance statement Imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIFs) from subchondral insufficiency fractures with osteonecrosis (SIF-ONs) and collapse, as well as in distinguishing them from other spontaneous knee subchondral bone lesions presenting with bone marrow edema-like signal.

Key points

- Subchondral insufficiency fractures may affect the knee, especially in older adults.

- Subchondral insufficiency fractures usually heal spontaneously.

- Sometimes, subchondral osteonecrosis and collapse may complicate subchondral insufficiency fractures.

- Bone marrow-like edema is an aspecific sign seen in all these lesions.

- Degraded marrow in osteonecrosis complicating fractures is hypointense on fluid-sensitive sequences.

X-ray, MRI, CT, Bone Scan

X-ray: According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, radiographs should be the initial imaging modality utilized for the evaluation of knee pain. Radiographs provide adequate evaluation of the joint space, osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation, displaced or chronic stress fractures, joint effusions, and sclerosis in the subarticular region.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): If radiographs are normal, or demonstrate a joint effusion, the ACR recommends an MRI without intravenous (IV) contrast as the next most appropriate study. MRI accurately demonstrates the soft tissues of the knee, without the use of ionizing radiation, and depicts tendon and ligamentous damage, tears and other abnormalities of the meniscus, the presence of synovitis, the extent of effusions, the presence and/or rupture of a popliteal cyst, the extent of cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions, subchondral insufficiency fractures, tibial stress fractures, and osteonecrosis.
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or a joint effusion is detected. However, the utilization of IV contrast may be beneficial to help more accurately diagnose such causes of chronic knee pain as infrapatellar bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome ("runner's knee"), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), and Hoffa's fat pad syndrome.
Computed tomography (CT): While not a first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of knee pain, according to the ACR, under certain circumstances, a CT without IV contrast may be indicated for the evaluation of knee pain, especially in settings where MRI may be contraindicated (ie, in a patient with a non-MRI compatible pacemaker, spinal column stimulator, or deep brain stimulator). CT offers enhanced bony detail and may be useful to confirm a prior osseous injury such as a subtle acute non-displaced fracture or chronic stress fracture. In the setting of chronic knee pain related to patellofemoral syndrome, CT may be helpful in evaluating the patellofemoral anatomy.CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated but may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies.
Bone scan: Bone scan is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with knee pain. Bone scan has low specificity and decreased anatomic resolution when compared to CT or MRI. However, bone scan may help to distinguish between bone and soft-tissue origins for pain.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not often useful as a diagnostic tool for the comprehensive examination of the knee. It may be appropriate to use ultrasound to confirm a suspected effusion or popliteal cyst, and can be utilized to guide in aspiration of synovial fluid which can be evaluated for crystal disease or infection. It also may be utilized to evaluate for synovial pathology, where the use of power Doppler ultrasound can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow that is associated with knee pain. Ultrasound is also useful for following patients with iliotibial (IT) band syndrome and in evaluating medial plicae. Ultrasound can also demonstrate an extrusion of the meniscus (with is suggestive of an underlying meniscal tear) and, on occasion, can detect peripheral meniscus tears, and chondrocalcinosis.

5.4	Osteonecrosis of the Jaw

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving EVENITY. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of EVENITY treatment. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ (chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, angiogenesis inhibitors, and corticosteroids) may increase the risk of developing ONJ. Other risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, and coagulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on benefit-risk assessment. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on EVENITY should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of EVENITY should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment.

5.5	Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures

Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving EVENITY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated.

Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.

During EVENITY treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of EVENITY therapy should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Multiple joint osteonecrosis in a patient on long-term intranasal corticosteroids [^117Swagh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The conservative treatment of knee ON, which included protected weight-bearing and the use of analgesics and diphosphonate, was unsuccessful. Because the disease continued to progress rapidly, joint-preserving procedures such as core decompression and/or impacted bone grafting were not an option for this patient. Because of extensive bone involvement, we proceeded with TKA, which provides excellent results–comparable with those reported in patients with osteoarthritis — in patients with ON, rather than unicompartmental arthroplasty. Our patient's KOOS pain and function scores improved greatly after TKA. The management of talus ON is often challenging with suboptimal outcome in large percentage of patients. The management options include conservative treatment with protected weight-bearing or surgical treatment with core decompression, vascularized bone grafting, total talar prosthesis, or salvage procedure. The surgical treatment for our patient would have been quite extensive requiring a salvage procedure because of the extensive lesions affection the talus and navicular bones.

In conclusion, bone ON is an unusual, debilitating disease that necessitates early diagnosis. ON should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe atypical refractory joint pain particularly in the presence of identified risk factors. The diagnosis might be challenging because of overlapping clinical presentation with other disorders particularly in the early stage of the disease with normal radiographs. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and thorough history with supplemental MRI imaging are essential for the diagnosis of such condition to avoid mistreatment or delays in treatment especially in younger patients.

Mechanical instability — because "instability have an increased risk of revision or reoperation" and the "risk will likely only increase over time, with further delay in surgery", the guideline states, "Thus, timely TJA should be performed in these cases when medically appropriate", and notes, "This recommendation is conditional because of the very low quality of evidence".

Bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability — ACR/AAHKS timing of TJA — states that in our defined population with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying TJA for optimization of non–life-threatening conditions. There was no evidence for this recommendation; thus, the recommendation is based on clinician and patient opinion and experiences. In these patients, delaying TJA may lead to increased instability and increased juxtaarticular bone loss or deformity, which may increase the technical difficulty of the procedure as well as increase the risk of failure and need for revision.

### Outcomes of total and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for secondary and spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [^1145Yrwg]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The reported outcomes of patients who underwent total or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for secondary and spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee are often from studies that lack the number of subjects necessary to generate meaningful conclusions. We systematically reviewed the available literature in order to define the outcomes of patients after total knee arthroplasty for secondary osteonecrosis and after total or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee.

Methods

A literature review yielded twenty cohorts with demographic patient information and outcome scores (global knee scores, radiographic outcomes, and revision rates) for patients who had knee arthroplasty as treatment for either secondary or spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee. The mean preoperative and postoperative global knee scores, the mean revision rate, and the categorization of the mean "poor" and mean "good" outcomes for the knees with each underlying disease were tabulated and reported. The demographic data and the reported mean global knee scores were weighted by the number of knees in each study.

Results

Total knee arthroplasty was performed in 150 knees with secondary osteonecrosis and 148 knees with spontaneous osteonecrosis, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty was performed in sixty-four knees with spontaneous osteonecrosis. Total knee arthroplasty for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee was associated with the best outcomes (higher "good" and postoperative global knee scores and lower revision [3%] and "poor" outcome [6%] rates compared with the other two groups). The outcomes after total knee arthroplasty in knees with secondary osteonecrosis as well as in knees with spontaneous osteonecrosis were better in the cohorts operated on during or after 1985 than in those operated on before 1985. Similarly, the outcomes after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in knees with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee were also better in the cohorts operated on during or after 1985 than in those operated on before 1985.

Conclusions

Total knee arthroplasty performed as treatment for either secondary osteonecrosis or spontaneous osteonecrosis and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty performed as treatment for spontaneous osteonecrosis were associated with improved outcomes in cohorts with more recent operative dates. The evidence suggests that the use of contemporary cemented implants in total knee arthroplasty and the selective use of stems and augments in patients who have development of secondary osteonecrosis after total knee arthroplasty are producing outcomes that are comparable to those seen after total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Although the outcomes of patients who have total knee arthroplasty for the treatment of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee have historically been favorable, such outcomes have also shown particular improvement in the studies from more recent operative periods. Although poor outcomes were seen after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in earlier studies of patients with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee, it is possible that those results were secondary to inappropriate patient selection, as the authors of the most recent and, to our knowledge, the only study to follow established operative indications regarding the use of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty reported excellent results.

### Stress fracture of the pelvis and lower limbs including atypical femoral fractures-a review [^113v5yMD]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

For the radiologist it is important to be familiar with this pathology because this diagnosis should trigger specialist referral. A patient with this diagnosis should not be on bisphosphonates and femoral pinning might be required though the individual circumstances need to be carefully assessed. The authors are aware of cases where atypical femoral fractures were misdiagnosed as "normal" insufficiency fractures leading to continued or even newly instigated bisphosphonate treatment and eventually to overt fracture.

Migrating bone marrow oedema syndrome, transient osteoporosis, transient bone marrow oedema syndrome, spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK)

MR imaging of joints not rarely shows areas of increased fluid signal immediately adjacent to the joint or in the proximity. While some of these signal changes can be explained by degenerative changes, larger, ill-defined areas of oedema-like signal cannot. It was recognised that the radiographic diagnosis of transient osteoporosis has an MRI equivalent and indeed that areas of diffuse oedema-like signal can show different imaging and clinical outcomes with time.

Large ill-defined areas of bone marrow oedema-like change can spontaneously resolve without associated clinical or imaging findings. They can be associated with pain or radiographically visible transient osteoporosis before resolution occurs. The oedema-like signal changes might show small crescent-shaped areas of subchondral contour concavity and sclerosis and this is now thought to represent subchondral stress fractures. This is seen particularly on the convex joint surface of large joints, especially the femoral head and femoral condyles. The overlying cartilage is intact here (Fig. 6).

Areas of osteonecrosis might also develop on the background of bone marrow oedema-like change.

This is distinct from the MRI findings seen in avascular necrosis (avn). In cases of avn disruption of the blood supply to the bone is the primary pathology. The bone marrow shows signal changes with typical serpiginous margins. With ischaemia bone necrosis occurs but in avn necrosis is due to primary disruption of the blood supply as opposed to a primary mechanical bone injury in stress fractures. Bone necrosis due to any cause can lead to bone collapse/fracture. The serpiginous morphology sets primary avn apart from other pathologies and can usually be identified. Often avn is due to a generalised metabolic problem and other sites in the body may show typical findings in cases where local collapse has occurred.

Osteoarthritis

Background: Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common source of knee pain, increases with advancing age, and is more prevalent in women than in men.
Etiology: It is a disorder that develops after macro and micro-trauma leads to maladaptive repair response, activation of the pro-inflammatory immune response, and is characterized by cell stress and extracellular matrix degradation. Mechanical stress, varus and valgus malalignment lead to excessive loading of bone and subsequent development of bone marrow lesions, abnormal focal remodeling, and loss of articular cartilage. Osteoarthritis can involve one or both knees and can occur in any of the three compartments of the knee, most commonly in the medial compartment. Symptom onset is gradual, can be localized or generalized joint pain that is worse with weight bearing and joint motion, and relieved with rest. Morning stiffness resolves in less than 30 minutes and the joint may stiffen briefly after inactivity. Clinical exam findings include bony enlargement, small effusions that are body temperature, and crepitus with joint motion.
Diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis can be made based on history and physical exam. Standing radiographs may not show pathology in early OA so normal radiological findings do not exclude OA. Radiologic findings include osteophytes, subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, and joint space narrowing which is graded using the Kellgren–Lawrence grading system (discussed previously).MRI is used to assess soft tissue if associated injury is suspected; however, it is rarely indicated for diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Ultrasound is an inexpensive and portable way to visualize the knee joint and assess for effusions and osteophytes; however, it is not accurate when assessing degree of joint space narrowing.
Treatment: With the exception of joint arthroplasty and regenerative therapies, most treatments for knee pain secondary to OA are palliative in nature. Treatments are tiered depending on the stage and level of disability of the patient. Conservative management includes activity modifications, weight loss if appropriate, exercise, physical therapy, and education. NSAIDs should be considered first line for "as-needed" symptomatic pain control. Opioids have minimal benefit in OA and are associated with undesirable side effect profile and safety risks, therefore use is discouraged. Intra-articular injections with corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid (HA) are well-accepted treatments for temporary symptomatic relief. Biologics such as PRP or mesenchymal stem cells have been proposed to attenuate the pro-inflammatory degradation in OA and potentially remodel the joint. Several adjunct medications such as cathepsin K inhibitors, Wnt inhibitors, anabolic growth factors, nerve growth factor inhibitors are being studied as a means of not only reducing the pain from knee OA but potentially stopping the progression of structural damage. For patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis who failed conservative therapy and who are candidates, total joint replacement is definitive treatment.

### Spontaneous osteonecrosis / subchondral insufficiency fractures of the knee: high rates of conversion to surgical treatment and arthroplasty [^1118p1y3]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee has recently been termed subchondral insufficiency fracture of the knee (SIFK) to appropriately recognize the etiology of mechanical overloading of the subchondral bone. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical outcomes of SIFK based on progression to surgical treatment and arthroplasty, and to evaluate the risk factors that increase the progression to arthroplasty.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed on patients with a diagnosis of SIFK, as confirmed with use of magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Baseline and final radiographs were reviewed. Baseline MRIs were also reviewed for injury characteristics. Failure was defined as progression to surgical treatment or conversion to arthroplasty.

Results

Two hundred twenty-three patients (71% female) with a mean age of 65.1 years were included. SIFK affected 154 femora (69%) and 123 tibiae (55%), with medial compartment involvement in 198 knees (89%); 74% of medial menisci had root or radial tears, with a mean extrusion of 3.6 mm. Varus malalignment was identified in 54 (69%) of 78 knees. Seventy-six (34%) of all patients progressed to surgical intervention at 2.7 years, and 66 (30%) underwent arthroplasty at 3.0 years. The rates of conversion to surgical intervention and arthroplasty increased to 47% (37 of 79; p = 0.04) and 37% (29 of 79; p = 0.09), respectively, in patients with > 5 years of follow-up. The 10-year survival rate free of arthroplasty for patients with SIFK on the medial femoral condyle (p < 0.01), SIFK on the medial tibial plateau (p < 0.01), medial meniscal extrusion (p = 0.01), varus alignment (p = 0.02), and older age (per year older; p = 0.003) was significantly higher than the survival rates of those without each respective condition.

Conclusions

Subchondral insufficiency fractures predominantly involve the medial compartment of the knee and commonly present with medial meniscal root and radial tears. Approximately one-third of patients progressed to total knee arthroplasty. Baseline arthritis, older age, location of the insufficiency fracture on both the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau, meniscal extrusion, and varus malalignment were all associated with progression to arthroplasty.

### Prevalence of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle in elderly patients [^117DHVx4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Aseptic osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle has recently been reported as a complication of arthroscopic surgery. The time interval between the onset of symptoms and pathognomonic MRI changes (diagnostic window) is not known for osteonecrosis of the knee. To determine the prevalence of early-stage spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) we prospectively examined 176 patients by MRI between May 1998 and December 1999. In six patients MRI revealed a bone marrow edema pattern and subtle subchondral bone changes in the medial condyle consistent with early-stage SONK (prevalence of 3.4%); in the 53 patients older than 65 years the prevalence was 9.4%. In 10 patients (5.7%) the bone and marrow changes on MRI imaging either resolved on follow-up MRI and were regarded as transient epiphyseal lesions or were considered to be reactive changes due to underlying degenerative articular disease. Including MRI in the preoperative diagnostic procedures could avoid missing the diagnosis of avascular necrosis before planning an operative treatment of suspected meniscal tears in elderly patients.
