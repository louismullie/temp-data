## Question

A 62-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a lacerated wound on her left forearm. She got the wound accidentally when she slipped in her garden and scraped her hand against some nails sticking out of the fence. The patient has rheumatoid arthritis and takes methylprednisolone 16 mg/day. She cannot recall her vaccination history. On physical examination her blood pressure is 140/95 mm Hg, heart rate is 81/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). The wound is irregularly shaped and lacerated and measures 4 × 5 cm with a depth of 0.5 cm. It is contaminated with dirt. The physician decides to administer both the tetanus toxoid and immunoglobulin after wound treatment. What is true regarding the tetanus prophylaxis in this patient?
A. It does not make sense to administer tetanus toxoid as it will fail to induce sufficient immunity in a patient who takes oral glucocorticoids.
B. The immunoglobulin administration will provide sufficient levels of anti-tetanus toxin antibodies until the production of the patient's own antibodies starts.
C. It does not make sense to administer tetanus toxoid as it will fail to induce sufficient immunity in patients aged more than 60 years.
D. Immunoglobulin administration can provide constant levels of antibodies in the patient's blood for more than 4 months.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement about tetanus prophylaxis is correct for a 62-year-old woman with a contaminated laceration, unknown vaccination history, and daily methylprednisolone 16 mg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the wound risk category and how that drives tetanus prophylaxis. Then, I should verify the patient's immunization status and what to do when history is unknown. Next, I will review the standard ACIP wound-management algorithm for tetanus toxoid and tetanus immune globulin (TIG). After that, I need to check whether chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters vaccine responsiveness or indications. Finally, I will examine the pharmacokinetics and duration of TIG and compare the answer choices against guideline-based care to select the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the wound classification. A 4 × 5 cm irregular, contaminated laceration with dirt exposure is not a clean, minor wound. It is a dirty wound that carries a higher risk for tetanus spores, so the "all other wounds" branch of the ACIP algorithm applies rather than the "clean and minor" branch [^116BqhED].

> I need to check the patient's immunization status. She cannot recall her vaccination history, so I should treat her as having an unknown or incomplete primary series, which means she lacks reliable protection and warrants both active and passive immunization per ACIP wound-management guidance [^116BqhED] [^113ofiLX].

> Next, I should review the ACIP wound-management algorithm. For dirty wounds in someone with unknown or incomplete vaccination, both a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and TIG are indicated. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated in an adult aged ≥ 11 years who has never received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown, Tdap is preferred, and TIG should be given in a separate syringe at a different anatomical site when indicated [^114hmV4y] [^113utri2] [^113ofiLX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immunosuppression. I initially wondered whether daily methylprednisolone 16 mg might constitute high-dose immunosuppression that would contraindicate tetanus toxoid or mandate TIG regardless of history; wait, let me verify the definition. High-dose systemic corticosteroids are generally defined as ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks, so 16 mg/day of methylprednisolone is not high-dose and does not meet criteria for severe immunocompromise that would alter tetanus vaccine administration or automatically mandate TIG irrespective of vaccination history; thus, standard ACIP wound-management rules still apply here [^113PvpR8] [^113ofiLX].

> I will now examine the pharmacokinetics of TIG to assess the plausibility of the options. TIG provides immediate passive immunity with a half-life of roughly 3–4 weeks, which means protection wanes over several weeks, not months. It does not provide constant antibody levels for more than 4 months, so any claim of multi-month durability would be incorrect [^notfound].

> Let me consider each answer choice carefully. Option A claims tetanus toxoid will fail to induce sufficient immunity in someone on oral glucocorticoids; hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that. While high-dose steroids can blunt vaccine responses, this patient is on a moderate daily dose, and ACIP still recommends administering tetanus toxoid for wound management when indicated; moreover, even with blunted responses, vaccination can still contribute to protection and immunologic memory, so this blanket statement is too strong and not guideline-concordant [^1155Jpxa] [^114hmV4y]. Option B asserts that immunoglobulin will provide sufficient antibodies until the patient's own response begins; that aligns with TIG's immediate passive effect bridging the window until active immunity from the vaccine takes hold, which is precisely why both TIG and toxoid are given together in this scenario [^113ofiLX]. Option C claims tetanus toxoid is ineffective in patients older than 60; hold on, I should verify — ACIP recommends tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines for wound management regardless of age, and older adults are precisely the group in whom boosters are often overdue, so this is incorrect [^114hmV4y] [^111yCps5]. Option D claims TIG provides constant antibody levels for more than 4 months; as noted, TIG's half-life is weeks, not months, so this is incorrect [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the correct statement is Option B: the immunoglobulin administration will provide sufficient levels of anti-tetanus toxin antibodies until the production of the patient's own antibodies starts, which is why both TIG and tetanus toxoid are indicated now for this contaminated wound with unknown vaccination history [^113ofiLX] [^114hmV4y].

---

The correct answer is **B**. The immunoglobulin administration will provide sufficient levels of anti-tetanus toxin antibodies until the production of the patient's own antibodies starts. Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) provides **immediate passive immunity** [^113ofiLX] that lasts about 3–4 weeks, bridging the gap until the vaccine-induced active immunity takes effect. Options A and C are incorrect because tetanus toxoid is effective in patients on glucocorticoids and in older adults, although the immune response may be blunted; thus, both TIG and tetanus toxoid are indicated for dirty wounds with unknown or incomplete vaccination history [^112khUit] [^11167nzT]. Option D is incorrect because TIG does not provide constant antibody levels for more than 4 months [^notfound].

## Clinical scenario analysis

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis taking methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, presenting with a contaminated laceration on the left forearm. She has an **unknown vaccination history**, and the wound is dirty and tetanus-prone [^11167nzT].

---

## Tetanus prophylaxis guidelines

According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tetanus prophylaxis for wound management **depends on the patient's vaccination history and the wound characteristics** [^114hmV4y]. For patients with unknown or incomplete vaccination history and dirty wounds, both tetanus toxoid and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) are recommended [^112khUit].

---

## Mechanism of action and duration of immunity

- **Tetanus toxoid**: Induces active immunity by stimulating the production of antibodies against tetanus toxin. The onset of immunity takes approximately 1–2 weeks, and immunity lasts for several years [^1156pidi].

- **Tetanus immune globulin (TIG)**: Provides immediate passive immunity by administering preformed antibodies against tetanus toxin. The immunity provided by TIG is temporary, lasting approximately 3–4 weeks [^notfound].

---

## Effect of glucocorticoids on tetanus vaccination

Glucocorticoids, such as **methylprednisolone**, can suppress the immune system and potentially blunt the response to vaccination. However, **tetanus toxoid** remains effective even in patients receiving glucocorticoids, although the immune response may be attenuated. Therefore, both tetanus toxoid and **TIG** are indicated in patients on glucocorticoids with unknown or incomplete vaccination history and dirty wounds [^112khUit].

---

## Age-related considerations

Advanced age is associated with a higher risk of tetanus due to **waning immunity** and potential incomplete vaccination history. However, **tetanus toxoid vaccination** remains effective in older adults, although the immune response may be somewhat reduced. Therefore, both tetanus toxoid and **TIG** are indicated in older adults with unknown or incomplete vaccination history and dirty wounds [^112khUit].

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Statement** | **Correctness** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | It does not make sense to administer tetanus toxoid as it will fail to induce sufficient immunity in a patient who takes oral glucocorticoids. | Incorrect | Tetanus toxoid remains effective in patients on glucocorticoids, although the immune response may be attenuated. |
| B | The immunoglobulin administration will provide sufficient levels of anti-tetanus toxin antibodies until the production of the patient's own antibodies starts. | Correct | TIG provides immediate passive immunity lasting 3–4 weeks, bridging the gap until active immunity develops. |
| C | It does not make sense to administer tetanus toxoid as it will fail to induce sufficient immunity in patients aged more than 60 years. | Incorrect | Tetanus toxoid remains effective in older adults, although the immune response may be reduced. |
| D | Immunoglobulin administration can provide constant levels of antibodies in the patient's blood for more than 4 months. | Incorrect | TIG provides temporary immunity lasting approximately 3–4 weeks, not more than 4 months. |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B**. The immunoglobulin administration will provide sufficient levels of anti-tetanus toxin antibodies until the production of the patient's own antibodies starts. TIG provides immediate passive immunity lasting 3–4 weeks, bridging the gap until active immunity develops from the tetanus toxoid vaccination.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1156pidi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Over 90% of tetanus deaths occur in South/South East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, C. tetani is distributed worldwide, with 32–92 cases diagnosed each year in the European Union/European Economic Area; 17–33 in the USA; and 4–11 in the UK. Despite being notifiable, a study of hospital records from 2001–2014 suggested that cases in England were under-reported by 88%. There appears to be seasonality in Europe, with highest incidence in July, and a second peak in October. This likely reflects increased outdoor activity, which carries risks of skin breaks and wound contamination.

WHO has recommended universal childhood tetanus toxoid vaccination since 1974. Serial vaccination is key. This induces a potent IgG response; antibodies are transmitted transplacentally and vaccinating girls therefore prevents neonatal tetanus. Primary immunisation with a three-dose regimen provides near-total protection against clinical disease, maintained for at least 5 years. Children in Britain receive a primary course at 2, 3, and 4 months, with pre-school and teenage booster doses. This five-dose regimen is probably sufficient to confer lifelong immunity, though WHO recommends six, and global booster schedules vary.

As of 2022, 92% of children in the UK were fully vaccinated, similar to other high-income anglophone countries. However, there is no herd immunity, and with growing concerns about parental vaccine hesitancy, and interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, inquiring about childhood vaccination status is crucial. Conflict and natural disasters can also affect vaccination coverage, even in countries with historically robust programmes.

Major risk factors for tetanus include advanced age, injecting drug use, and diabetes mellitus. Sporadic tetanus outbreaks in the UK have been linked to contaminated heroin. Older individuals are at particular risk; they are more likely to have been born before the rollout of universal childhood vaccination, and vaccine-induced antibody levels diminish with age. Cases are more frequent in men, reflecting unsafe circumcision practices, and lower vaccination rates due to WHO's maternal vaccination focus.

Immunization — tetanus in traumatic wounds — Tetanus is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious but not contagious. Tetanus immunization status should be evaluated for all patients with a traumatic wound and treated appropriately based on the patient's history and risk of infection. Tetanus immunization, if indicated based on a patient's history and exposure, should be given to all patients with a traumatic wound. Recommendation grade: 1C. Development of clinical tetanus can probably be delayed with oral antibiotics (penicillin and likely others) and should be used if evacuation of an unimmunized patient with a tetanus-prone wound will be delayed or is logistically complicated; this technique is often used in patients claiming an allergy to tetanus toxoid.

- Pneumococcal vaccination: The link has been updated for routine vaccination in persons aged ≥ 65 years. Under the Shared clinical decision-making section, bullets have been reordered as follows:

o PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be administered during the same visit.

o If both PCV13 and PPSV23 are to be administered, PCV13 should be administered first.

o PCV13 and PPSV23 should be administered at least 1 year apart.

- Tdap: The information for wound management has been updated: "Wound management: Persons with 3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine: For clean and minor wounds, administer Tdap or Td if more than 10 years since last dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine; for all other wounds, administer Tdap or Td if more than 5 years since last dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine. Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, use Tdap. For detailed information, see".

- Zoster vaccination: References have been removed to previous receipt of ZVL (zoster vaccine live or Zostavax) dose when considering vaccination of persons aged ≥ 50 years with RZV (recombinant zoster vaccines or Shingrix) and the bullet about ZVL for persons aged ≥ 60 years was deleted because ZVL is no longer available in the U.S. market.

Open fractures — tetanus prophylaxis and operative timing/soft-tissue management: Tetanus toxoid should be administered if the patient had an incomplete primary immunization, if it has been > 10 years since his or her last booster dose, or if the immunization history is unknown or unclear, and tetanus immunoglobulin should be administered if it has been > 10 years since the patient's last booster dose or if he or she has a history of incomplete primary immunization. Patients with open fractures should be taken to the operating room for irrigation and debridement within 24 hours of initial presentation whenever possible, with severe fractures associated with gross wound contamination brought to the operating room more quickly and as soon as clinically feasible based on the patient's condition and resources available. Whenever possible, skin defects overlying open fractures should be closed at the time of initial debridement. Soft tissue coverage should be completed within seven days of injury for open fractures associated with wounds requiring skin grafting or soft tissue transfers.

### Case report of tetanus in an immunized, healthy adult and no point of entry [^116QWc7Z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 58-year-old man born in the United States with a history of complete childhood immunizations who presented to the Emergency Department with trismus. Past medical history was significant only for Elephantiasis. After an exhaustive workup the patient was found to have Tetanus, with no identifiable portal of entry. The patient was successfully treated for Tetanus with complete recovery. Tetanus is caused by the organism Clostridium Tetani, which usually requires an open lesion to cause infection. Our patient was unique in that he was previously immunized with no obvious lesion. Tetanus should be suspected and treated empirically in any patient presenting with typical signs and symptoms even without an apparent entry site.

### Methylprednisolone… [^113981FW]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Regardless of the route of administration, methylprednisolone integrates systemically as exhibited by its effectiveness to quickly reduce inflammation during acute flares. It is associated with many adverse reactions that require tapering off the drug as soon as the disease is under control. Serious side effects include iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, hypertension, osteoporosis, diabetes, infection, psychosis, and skin atrophy. Medical uses The primary use of methylprednisolone is to suppress inflammatory and immune responses. Methylprednisolone achieves this primarily by regulating the number and function of leukocytes, cytokines, and chemokines. Its widespread inflammatory control is conducive in use across multiple disorders regardless of pathology. Methylprednisolone is commonly prescribed as short-term therapy for acute flares, as seen with acute gouty arthritis. It can be prescribed during on-going therapy in lower doses contingent upon monitorization of adverse effects.

Dosage strength and formulation are optimized per medical use. Following ED discharge, it is advised to prescribe a five-day course of methylprednisolone to decrease the probability of relapse or withdrawal symptoms. Rheumatic diseases Methylprednisolone is used to treat several rheumatic diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Methylprednisolone dosage and administration for these diseases is highly variable due to varied pathophysiology between the diseases and within patients diagnosed with a given disease. In Lupus Nephritis, a common manifestation of SLE, patients are often prescribed methylprednisolone concomitantly with immunosuppressants. Severe manifestations are often treated with Cyclophosphamide or Rituximab and three doses of methylprednisolone IV-pulse treatment before switching to oral prednisolone and azathioprine for maintenance.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are a second-line therapy to relieve joint pain resulting from rheumatoid arthritis. It is most commonly injected into the joints of the knees and shoulders. Although the injection is local, studies have shown systemic absorption as evidenced by beneficial effects on distant joints. In an attempt to minimize HPA suppression, FDA guidelines have restricted IACIs to three per year, with a minimum of 30 days in between injections. Oral methylprednisolone
- Allergy and immunology: angioneurotic edema, asthma, urticaria, seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, and serum sickness.
- Dermatology: toxic epidermal necrolysis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, pemphigus, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, severe seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, and severe psoriasis.
- Endocrinology: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercalcemia associated with cancer, nonsuppurative thyroiditis, and primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.

### Wound… [^114r1HHj]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

In normal physiology, all wounds will undergo a series of steps collectively known as the wound healing process, which include hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and tissue remodeling. Age, tissue oxygenation, stress, underlying medical conditions, and certain medications are just a few of the many factors known to affect the rate of wound healing. Chronic wounds Any wound which is arrested or delayed during any of the normal stages of wound healing is considered to be a chronic wound. Most commonly, these are wounds which develop due to an underlying disease process such as diabetes mellitus or arterial/venous insufficiency. However, it is important to note that any acute wound has the potential to become a chronic wound if any of the normal stages of wound healing are interrupted. Chronic wounds are most commonly a result of disruption of the inflammatory phase of wound healing, however errors in any phase can result in a chronic wound.

The exact duration of time which distinguishes a chronic wound from an acute wound is not clearly defined, although many clinicians agree that wounds which have not progressed for over three months are considered chronic wounds. Common causes of chronic wounds
- Diabetes mellitus – Wound healing impairment in the setting of diabetes is multifactorial. Hyperglycemia, neuropathy, microvascular complications, impaired immune and inflammatory responses, and psychological factors have all been implicated in the formation and propagation of diabetic wounds. Feet are the most common location of diabetic wounds, although any type of wound can be negatively impacted by diabetes. It has been estimated that up to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will be affected by non-healing wounds in their lifetime.
- Venous/Arterial insufficiency – Impaired blood outflow or inflow can both impair wound healing, thereby causing chronic wounds.

Much like diabetes, venous/arterial insufficiency most commonly result in chronic wounds of the lower extremities. In chronic venous insufficiency, blood pooling impedes oxygen exchange and creates a chronic pro-inflammatory environment which both promote formation of venous ulcers. Peripheral artery disease, on the other hand, causes wounds due to poor blood inflow and typically affects the most distal extremities.
- Immunologic disease – The immune system plays a critical role in the inflammatory process; therefore, any disease of the immune system has the potential to impair the inflammatory phase of wound healing, thereby leading to a chronic wound. Patients suffering from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have been found to have larger wounds and prolonged time to heal when compared to the general population.
- Size of wound: Should be accurately measured at time of initial presentation and regularly remeasured until wound resolution.
- Wound location: Very useful consideration in many chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous ulcers. Acute wounds will be located in areas consistent with the mechanism of injury.
- Wound edges: May provide clues to cause of specific wounds, such as gently sloping edges of venous ulcers or rolled edges of certain tumors.
- Surrounding skin: Appearance of the surrounding skin can provide clues to underlying disease processes, such as redness/erythema due to cellulitis, maceration due to uncontrolled wound exudate, or eczematous changes due to a chronic irritation.
- Infection: Classic signs of infection are redness, warmth, swelling, odor, and pain out of proportion to wound appearance.
- Pain: Pain can be nociceptive, neuropathic, or inflammatory, each of which can provide clues to the cause of a wound.

### An unexpected tetanus case [^113ksDXv]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

1 million cases of tetanus are estimated to occur worldwide each year, with more than 200000 deaths. Tetanus is a life-threatening but preventable disease caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium tetani-a Gram-positive bacillus found in high concentrations in soil and animal excrement. Tetanus is almost completely preventable by active immunisation, but very rarely unexpected cases can occur in individuals who have been previously vaccinated. We report a case of generalised tetanus in a 22-year-old woman that arose despite the protective antitoxin antibody in her serum. The patient received all her vaccinations in the USA; her last vaccination was 6 years ago. The case was unusual because the patient had received all standard vaccinations, had no defined port of entry at disease onset, and had symptoms lasting for 6 months. Tetanus can present with unusual clinical forms; therefore, the diagnosis and management of this rare but difficult disease should be updated. In this Grand Round, we review the clinical features, epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis of C tetani infections.

Animal bite wounds — tetanus prophylaxis includes that a primary series (ie, 3 doses) of tetanus toxoid is described, and persons who have not completed the vaccine series should do so. A booster dose of tetanus toxoid should be administered for dirty wounds if > 5 years has elapsed since the last dose and for clean wounds, if > 10 years; Tdap is preferred over Td if the former has not been previously given.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^111Sim5c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Tetanus is an acute and sometimes fatal disease characterized by sudden muscle contractions. The number of tetanus cases reported annually in the United States has declined significantly since the 1930s and 1940s as a result of the introduction of tetanus vaccines. However, sporadic cases continue to occur in persons who are not up-to-date with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccinations (TT) and do not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). To assess the extent of these cases, the California Department of Public Health reviewed all tetanus cases reported during January 2008-March 2014. A total of 21 tetanus patients were reported; five (24%) died. An average of three cases were reported each year during 2008–2013; the average annual incidence among patients aged ≥ 65 years (0.23 cases per 1 million population) was twice that among patients aged 21–64 years (0.10 cases per 1 million population). Of 16 patients with an acute injury before illness and diagnosis, nine (56%) sought medical care, and two (22%) of the nine received appropriate PEP. Although tetanus is rare, it is a life-threatening disease that is preventable. Health care providers should ensure that their patients are up-to-date with TT vaccination and provide appropriate postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds.

### Management of foreign bodies in the skin [^111ZTY4X]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Although puncture wounds are common, retained foreign bodies are not. Wounds with a foreign body sensation should be evaluated. The presence of wood or vegetative material, graphite or other pigmenting materials, and pain is an indication for foreign body removal. Radiography may be used to locate foreign bodies for removal, and ultrasonography can be helpful for localizing radiolucent foreign bodies. It is wise to set a time limit for exploration and to have a plan for further evaluation or referral. Injuries at high risk of infection include organic foreign bodies or dirty wounds. These should be treated with plain water irrigation and complete removal of retained fragments. In most cases, antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. If a patient presents with an infected wound, the possibility of a retained foreign body should be considered. Tetanus prophylaxis is necessary if there is no knowledge or documentation of tetanus immunization within 10 years, including tetanus immune globulin for the person with a dirty wound whose history of tetanus toxoid doses is unknown or incomplete.

Epidemiology of Tetanus in the United States

Tetanus is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. After the introduction of universal vaccination with tetanus toxoid–containing (TT) vaccines in the mid-1940s, the incidence of reported tetanus in the United States declined by > 98%, from 0.39 per 100,000 population in 1947, when national reporting began, to 0.01 per 100,000 population by 2016 (CDC, unpublished data, 2016) (Figure 3). The decline in incidence occurred across all age groups. Deaths from tetanus also declined similarly during this period. The decline in morbidity and mortality is attributable to widespread use of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines; improved wound management, including use of tetanus prophylaxis in emergency departments; improved hygiene during childbirth; increased levels of maternal immunity; and expanded urbanization.

* Per 100,000 population.

Tetanus occurs primarily among older adults. During 2001–2016, three neonatal tetanus cases and 459 non-neonatal tetanus cases were reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). The median age for non-neonatal cases was 44.0 years (range: 2–95 years); 60% of cases occurred in males (CDC, unpublished data, 2016). The risk for both tetanus disease and mortality was higher among persons aged ≥ 65 years than among persons aged < 65 years. Tetanus occurs almost exclusively among persons who are unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated or in those whose vaccination histories are unknown or uncertain. The case-fatality ratio for reported tetanus in the United States declined from 18% (1998–2000) to 8.0% (2001–2016) (CDC, unpublished data, 2016).

### Unreliability of reported tetanus vaccination histories [^1137t1yV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Our study questioned the reliability of patients' reported tetanus immunization histories. One thousand patients at an urban teaching hospital were queried regarding their tetanus immunization status. Of the 377 patients who initially asserted having had a tetanus vaccine in the last 5 years, 98 (26%) were confirmed, either by further history taking or chart review, not to have received tetanus immunization. It appears that there is a sizeable percentage of patients who falsely report their tetanus immunization status.

### A case of tetanus infection in an adult with a protective tetanus antibody level [^116799zH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani and most commonly presents as trismus or other muscle spasms. Despite the development of the tetanus toxoid vaccine, tetanus infection has not been eradicated. Additionally, while there are hypothesized protective levels of tetanus antibody, tetanus infection may still occur in properly vaccinated individuals. We report the case of a 31-year-old male that presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of neck and jaw pain. He reports puncturing his hand with a rusty nail 10 days prior. His reported vaccination history was that he received his last booster vaccination 13 years prior to presentation. In the ED, tetanus vaccine, tetanus immune globulin, and metronidazole were administered. His symptoms improved over the next 2 days and resolved at day 6. Despite his presentation of tetanus infection and rule out of other causes for his symptoms, his tetanus antibody level was reported at 8.4 U/mL, which is considered to be protective. A tetanus antibody level that is adequate for protective immunity should not preclude a patient from treatment of tetanus infection. This case demonstrates that a thorough history, physical exam, and rule out of other causes should guide treatment when there is concern for a tetanus infection.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113G6uSZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Tetanus prophylaxis for animal bite wounds — Recommendation 43 — states that "Tetanus toxoid should be administered to patients without toxoid vaccination within 10 years. Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TdaP) is preferred over Tetanus and diptheria (Td) if the former has not been previously given (strong, low)". The evidence summary emphasizes that "Tetanus is a severe and often fatal disease preventable through routine vaccination (ie, primary series and decennial boosters)".

Despite the availability of effective immunization to prevent tetanus, there are still up to one million cases per year worldwide. Although the majority of tetanus cases occur in third world countries, there are still significant numbers of cases occurring in countries such as the United States, where preventive immunization is easily accessible. The Emergency Physician has the opportunity to contribute to the decline of the incidence of tetanus through knowledge of those at greatest risk for inadequate immunization and through providing proper wound care and immunization prophylaxis.

### Ten-year experiences with tetanus at a tertiary hospital in northwestern tanzania: a retrospective review of 102 cases [^113mbCiF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Results

One hundred-eighteen cases of tetanus were managed during the period under study. Of these, complete information was available on 102 (86.4%) cases while there was some missing data on 16 (13.6%) cases. Thus, a total of 102 patients were studied with an average of 10 cases per year (range of 8–14 cases per year).

Demographic data

Males were 94 (92.2%) and females were 8 (7.8%) with a male to female ratio of 11.8: 1. Their ages ranged from 8 to 72 years with a mean of 36.21 ± 14.64 years. The median was 34.00 years. The mean age of males and females was 35.14 ± 14.82 and 32.44 ± 11.22 years, respectively (P-value > 0.001). The modal age group was 31–40 years. Seventy-six (74.5%) were below 40 years of age, while 26 (25.5%) were aged 40 years and above. No cases of neonatal tetanus were reported. The majority of patients were farmers (51.0%) (Table 1).

Distribution of occupation and the portals of entry of tetanus

Previous tetanus immunization history

Previous tetanus immunization status was recorded in all patients. Of these, only twenty-four (23.5%) patients had prior tetanus immunization, while the other seventy-eight (76.5%) patients were not vaccinated or did not know their tetanus immunization status. However, in patients who had prior tetanus immunization there was no written proof of the immunization schedule in any cases. Serology test to detect anti-tetanus antibodies was not performed.

Portals of entry and type of injury

Acute injuries such us prick, puncture, laceration, burns were the most common portals of entry in 52.9% of cases and commonly occurred in the lower limbs (53.8%). The portals of entry were not identified in 33.6% of cases (Table 1). Twenty-one (38.9%) patients had medical wound care before hospital admission but none received tetanus immunoglobulin despite the absence of tetanus immunity.

### Tetanus immunity and physician compliance with tetanus prophylaxis practices among emergency department patients presenting with wounds [^112gXgdB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine tetanus seroprotection rates and physician compliance with tetanus prophylaxis recommendations among patients presenting with wounds.

Methods

A prospective observational study of patients aged 18 years or older who presented to 5 university-affiliated emergency departments (EDs) because of wounds was conducted between March 1999 and August 2000. Serum antitoxin levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay with seroprotection defined as more than 0.15 IU/mL. Seroprotection rates, risk factors for lack of seroprotection, and rates of physician compliance with tetanus prophylaxis recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices were determined.

Results

The seroprotection rate among 1,988 patients was 90.2% (95% confidence interval 88.8% to 91.5%). Groups with significantly lower seroprotection rates were persons aged 70 years or older, 59.5% (risk ratio [RR] 5.2); immigrants from outside North America or Western Europe, 75.3% (RR 3.7); persons with a history of inadequate immunization, 86.3% (RR 2.9); and persons without education beyond grade school, 76.5% (RR 2.5). Despite a history of adequate immunization, 18% of immigrants lacked seroprotection. Overall, 60.9% of patients required tetanus immunization, of whom 57.6% did not receive indicated immunization. Among patients with tetanus-prone wounds, appropriate prophylaxis (ie, tetanus immunoglobulin and toxoid) was provided to none of 504 patients who gave a history of inadequate primary immunization (of whom 15.1% had nonprotective antibody titers) and to 218 (79%) of 276 patients who required only a toxoid booster.

Conclusion

Although seroprotection rates are generally high in the United States, the risk of tetanus persists in the elderly, immigrants, and persons without education beyond grade school. There is substantial underimmunization in the ED (particularly with regard to use of tetanus immunoglobulin), leaving many patients, especially those from high-risk groups, unprotected. Better awareness of tetanus prophylaxis recommendations is necessary, and future tetanus prophylaxis recommendations may be more effective if they are also based on demographic risk factors.

### Notes from the field: obstetric tetanus in an unvaccinated woman after a home birth delivery-Kentucky, 2016 [^1171nYrM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

On July 11, 2016, state and local health departments in Kentucky were notified of a case of obstetric tetanus in an unvaccinated woman. Obstetric tetanus, which occurs during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy, follows contamination of wounds with Clostridium tetani spores during pregnancy, or the use of contaminated tools or practices during nonsterile deliveries or abortions. CDC did not identify any cases of obstetric tetanus in the United States during 1972–2008. State and local health departments in Kentucky investigated this case to identify risk factors and provide recommendations.

The patient, a woman aged 30 years, is a member of an Amish community. In late June, she delivered a child at home, assisted by an unlicensed community childbirth assistant. She had never received a vaccination for tetanus. Delivery was complicated by breech presentation, but no birth trauma, unsterile conditions, or other complications were reported. Nine days postpartum, the patient experienced facial numbness and neck pain, which progressed over 24 hours to stiff neck and jaw and difficulty swallowing and breathing. She was admitted to the hospital where a clinical diagnosis of tetanus was made, and 6,000 international units of tetanus immunoglobulin were administered intramuscularly. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required. Her hospital course was complicated by seizures and a need for prolonged respiratory support. After approximately a month, the patient was stable and discharged home.

In 2013, ACIP reviewed the most recent safety and immunogenicity data available at that time to inform their recommendations regarding a second routine dose of Tdap. ACIP concluded that a second dose of Tdap would be safe and immunogenic at 5- or 10-year intervals. However, antipertussis antibodies decline rapidly after the first year (,–), and vaccine effectiveness studies indicated that pertussis protection begins to wane within 2–4 years after receipt of a single Tdap dose. This likely limits the impact of a second dose of Tdap on the overall burden of pertussis in the United States. In addition, Tdap vaccines have an uncertain role in prevention of transmission and in herd protection. ACIP concluded that the data did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap, given the likely limited public health impact.

In January 2019, FDA approved Adacel for a second Tdap dose if administered ≥ 8 years after the first Tdap dose and for use for tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management if ≥ 5 years have elapsed since the previous receipt of any tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. In light of the new indication for a second dose of Adacel and evidence of Tdap being used frequently in place of Td, ACIP reassessed current Tdap recommendations. In October 2019, ACIP recommended that either Tdap or Td vaccines could be used in situations where only Td vaccine had been recommended previously. This report provides recommendations for the use of Td or Tdap for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management, and catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history.

Introduction

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults. After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines.

### Tetanus quick stick as an applicable and cost-effective test in assessment of immunity status [^114fhygW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin administration are challenging decisions mostly because of the fact that the current protocol for immunization against tetanus is based on 2 variables: the vaccination status of the patient and the nature of wound and its exposure. To solve this problem, Tetanus Quick Stick (TQS; Nephrotek Laboratory, Rungis, France), an immunochromatographic dipstick test, was developed to determine the tetanus immunity of the patients. The aim of this present study was to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values and cost-effectiveness of TQS in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Methods

Blood samples were collected from 200 patients presenting to our ED. Information including demographic information, tetanus immunization status, wound description, and the preventive measures taken by the emergency physician were gathered by a preeducated nurse. Tetanus Quick Stick test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed as the standard diagnostic test by an emergency physician and a laboratory technician, respectively; and results of the 2 techniques were compared.

Result

Overall, tetanus vaccine was administered to 141(70.5%) patients and immunoglobulin to 105 (52.5%) patients. The analysis revealed 88.1% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity for the TQS test. The positive and negative predictive values of TQS test were 99.3% and 66.1%, respectively. Our analysis is also showed a significant decrease in cost when TQS was applied for patients with dirty, tetanus prone wounds or injuries and unknown or incomplete vaccination history (€ 9.48 versus € 12.1).

Conclusion

This study revealed TQS test to be appropriate and cost-effective for ED use especially in evaluating patients who do not remember or cannot give their tetanus immunization history.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^112khUit]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although rates of tetanus have declined, sporadic cases continue to occur, particularly in adults who are not up-to-date with TT. Vaccination coverage among children is higher; in 2012, an estimated 82.5% of U.S. children aged 19–35 months and 84.6% of U.S. children aged 13–17 years had received ≥ 4 doses of diphtheria toxoid-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) and ≥ 1 dose of tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), respectively. In contrast, only 62% of adults aged ≥ 19 years had received TT during the preceding 10 years; coverage for adults aged ≥ 65 years was 55%. All of the tetanus patients reported in California during January 2008–March 2014 were adults aged ≥ 21 years. Among the 12 patients with verified vaccination histories, none recalled receiving TT during the preceding 10 years. Health care providers should assess patient vaccination status during routine visits to determine whether TT is needed. ACIP recommends that after receiving a primary childhood series, a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) dose should be given during adolescence and every 10 years thereafter. For added protection against pertussis, one of the Td booster doses should be Tdap if it was not previously administered.

Even minor wounds or abrasions can result in tetanus, highlighting the importance of ensuring that patients are up to date for TT. Providers should assess vaccination status in patients with wounds and in particular older adults, injection-drug users, patients with diabetes, and those with chronic wounds, all of whom are considered at increased risk for tetanus. Patients who have completed the 3-dose primary TT series need a booster dose as part of wound management if they have a clean, minor wound and received their last TT dose more than 10 years prior to injury, or if they have any other type of wound and received their last TT dose more than 5 years prior to injury. ACIP recommends that persons with unknown or incomplete histories receive TT as part of routine wound management; patients with wounds that are neither clean nor minor should receive TIG in addition to TT. Although the dosage of TIG for PEP is not specified in the recommendations, dosage information is provided in the product insert. §

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^117QaF3M]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During January 2008–March 2014, a total of 21 tetanus cases were reported; five (24%) were fatal (Table 1). The patients were all adults ranging in age from 21 to 89 years (median = 52 years); 15 (71%) were male. An average of three cases were reported each year during 2008–2013 (range = 0–5). The average annual tetanus incidence rate during 2008–2013 was 0.09 cases per 1 million population, compared with 0.19 cases during 2002–2007. During 2008–2013, the average annual incidence among patients aged ≥ 65 years (0.23 cases per 1 million population) was twice that among patients aged 21–64 years (0.10 cases per 1 million population). The case-fatality rate among patients aged ≥ 65 years was 50%, compared with 13% among patients aged 21–64 years. Race and ethnicity were reported for 18 (86%) patients. The average annual incidence rates among Hispanics (0.08 cases per 1 million population), non-Hispanic whites (0.09), non-Hispanic blacks (0.07), and non-Hispanic Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.03) were similar.

All 21 tetanus patients were hospitalized; 19 (90%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and nine required mechanical ventilation. The median number of days hospitalized was 18 (range = 2–65); of 15 patients for whom data were available, the median cost of total hospital charges per patient was $166,259 (range = $22,229–$1,024,672). Seven patients had conditions associated with increased risk for tetanus; four were diabetic, and three were injection-drug users.TT history was reported for 12 (57%) patients; three (25%) could not recall receiving any doses, and nine (75%) recalled receiving ≥ 1 dose. Among the nine patients who recalled receiving ≥ 1 dose, six received their last dose 10 to 50 years before their illness, and three could not recall when they received their last dose.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^112o323B]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is added by this report?

During January 2008–March 2014 in California, a total of 21 tetanus patients were reported. All were hospitalized, including 19 in intensive care units; five (24%) died. Of 16 patients with an acute injury prior to illness, only nine had sought medical care, and only two of the nine received appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. In addition, some patients with tetanus were not administered the recommended dosage of tetanus immune globulin.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Routine vaccination of patients every 10 years is important to prevent tetanus, particularly in settings where patients do not seek medical care following an injury, where no injury is evident to the patient, or where appropriate postexposure prophylaxis is not provided following an injury. Efforts to educate health care providers might lead to better tetanus postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds and better use of therapeutic tetanus immune globulin for patients with tetanus.

Prevention of Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus

Pregnant women who have completed the childhood immunization schedule and were last vaccinated more than ten years previously should receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine to prevent neonatal tetanus. The risk of neonatal tetanus is minimal if a previously unimmunized woman has received at least 2 properly spaced doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine during pregnancy; one of the doses administered during pregnancy should be Tdap, administered according to the current guidance. She should complete the 3-dose primary series at the recommended intervals.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management

ACIP has recommended administering tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) when indicated as part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus (Table 6). A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated as part of wound management if more than five years has passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous vaccination with Tdap, Td should be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated and Td is unavailable, Tdap may be administered.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^114ZLqsH]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Currently a rarity in high-income countries, tetanus is a diagnosis not to miss. Deaths from tetanus fell by almost 90% between 1990 and 2019, largely reflecting the success of WHO's Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination campaign. However, deaths among children and adults have plateaued, and tetanus remains an important vaccine-preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, notably in southern Asia, southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Tetanus results from infections with spore-forming Clostridium tetani bacteria, usually acquired via contaminated wounds and burns. C tetani releases a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle spasms, rigidity, and dysautonomia. Important complications include laryngeal spasm and resultant airway obstruction and respiratory arrest, nosocomial infections, and sequelae of prolonged immobility. Tetanus is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, but microbiological tests can serve as useful adjuncts. Treatment is multifaceted, requiring source control, antibiotic therapy, and antitoxin administration. With prolonged, quality intensive care, many patients survive with good functional outcome. However, due to challenges in leveraging routinely-collected health-care data and performing high-quality trials in resource-constrained settings, several key questions remain unanswered and optimal treatment strategies are contested. In this Review, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of global tetanus epidemiology, its clinical features and differential diagnosis, principles of management, and prognosis.

### Rheumatoid arthritis… [^116g6FzW]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The goals of treatment are to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when the disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. As the pathology progresses, the inflammatory activity leads to tendon tethering and erosion and destruction of the joint surface, which impairs range of movement and leads to deformity. The fingers may develop almost any deformity depending on which joints are most involved.

To reduce cardiovascular risk, it is crucial to maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA, and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable. Constitutional symptoms Constitutional symptoms including fatigue, low grade fever, malaise, morning stiffness, loss of appetite and loss of weight are common systemic manifestations seen in people with active RA. Bones Local osteoporosis occurs in RA around the inflamed joints. It is postulated to be partially caused by inflammatory cytokines.

More general osteoporosis is probably contributed to by immobility, systemic cytokine effects, local cytokine release in bone marrow, and corticosteroid therapy. Cancer The incidence of lymphoma is increased, although it is uncommon and associated with the chronic inflammation, not the treatment of RA. The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer is increased in people with RA compared to the general population, an association possibly due to the use of immunosuppression agents for treating RA. Pathophysiology RA primarily starts as a state of persistent cellular activation leading to autoimmunity and immune complexes in joints and other organs where it manifests. The clinical manifestations of disease are primarily inflammation of the synovial membrane and joint damage, and the fibroblast-like synoviocytes play a key role in these pathogenic processes.

Three phases of progression of RA are an initiation phase, an amplification phase, and chronic inflammatory phase, with tissue injury resulting from the cytokines, IL–1, TNF-alpha, and IL–6. Other environmental and hormonal factors may explain higher risks for women, including onset after childbirth and hormonal medications. A possibility for increased susceptibility is that negative feedback mechanisms – which normally maintain tolerance – are overtaken by positive feedback mechanisms for certain antigens, such as IgG Fc bound by rheumatoid factor and citrullinated fibrinogen bound by antibodies to citrullinated peptides.

Tetanus is still a scourge among the under-privileged populations of the world, and unfortunately remains an important cause of death although a cheap, safe and highly efficacious vaccine is available. The rarity of the disease in some parts of the world results in newly trained physicians being unable to make a clinical diagnosis, and hampers the conduct of adequately powered randomized controlled trials. Several new and experimental pharmacological agents are being used to control the spasms in tetanus, and to combat the autonomic instability that occurs in the disease. New evidence is emerging regarding the use of antibiotics and intrathecal immunoglobulin in tetanus. It is imperative, therefore, that all physicians working in critical care should be aware of the current advances and evidence-based guidelines for management of tetanus in order to achieve the best outcomes, which Rodrigo and colleagues have reviewed in a recent issue of Critical Care.

### A 51-year-old woman crushed by an elephant trunk [^111udHj2]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Wild and exotic animal attacks are not common in the United States. Animal-related injuries in the United States are usually caused by dog bites, followed by cattle and horse injuries. Exotic animal attacks can occur when the animals are provoked, depressed, or housed improperly by owners. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman who sustained multiple systemic traumatic injuries after she was pinned to a fence by an elephant's trunk. Upon arrival in the emergency department, she was hypothermic with a temperature of 35.1ºC (95.1ºF), hypotensive to 94/60 mm Hg after 5 L crystalloid, tachycardic at 108 beats/min, and intubated with oxygen saturation of 100%. Tranexamic acid was administered in addition to starting a massive transfusion protocol. Injuries included bilateral multiple rib fractures, left abdominal wall degloving injury, right pneumothorax, right hemothorax, left chest wall puncture wound, grade IV splenic laceration, 3 grade III liver lacerations, retroperitoneal hematoma, and degloving injuries to bilateral posterior thighs requiring more than 30 operations. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Several factors need to be considered when evaluating animal-related injuries, including type, age, and sex of the animal. Multisystem traumatic injuries should be assumed when a large animal is involved. Prehospital care and transport time are vital to a patient's survival in both urban and rural settings. During the initial resuscitation, administering antibiotics tailored to the specific animal can greatly decrease risk of infection and morbidity. Additionally, tetanus immunoglobulin, tetanus toxoid, and rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine may be needed, unless the victim has been previously vaccinated.

### Point-of-care testing for tetanus immunity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112whykE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current standard of care for tetanus prophylaxis management in patients with open wounds likely results in overtreatment and unnecessary costs. Point-of-care immunochromatographic tests, known as Tetanus Quick Sticks (TQS), have been developed to qualitatively measure tetanus immunoglobulin levels. Multiple studies advocate their use in EDs. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of TQS to assess their relevance in frontline emergency care.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, The Health Management Information Consortium and The Cochrane Library. Studies were eligible if sensitivity, specificity or cost-efficacy of TQS was reported. At least two authors independently assessed and extracted data from each study. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for TQS.

Results

12 studies were suitable for inclusion (n = 1662865 participants): 1 modelling and 11 prospective observational cohort studies. Eight studies assessed diagnostic accuracy; the summary estimate for sensitivity was 90% (95% CI, 89% to 90%) with specificity 97% (95% CI, 95% to 100%). Six studies investigated cost-efficacy, reporting lower healthcare costs when using TQS instead of the current method of vaccination history, due to a decrease in unnecessary tetanus vaccine and immunoglobulin administration. Based on the current NHS supply chain data, TQS use could save £173.05 per tetanus-prone patient.

Conclusion

TQS could confer the greatest cost savings if used in combination with vaccination history in patients with tetanus-prone wounds. A quality assurance process is recommended prior to implementation of TQS in EDs.

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults (1,2). After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines (3).

### Evaluation of a bedside immunotest to predict individual anti-tetanus seroprotection: a prospective concordance study of 1018 adults in an emergency department [^113o9WWx]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Unscheduled tetanus prophylaxis (UTP) used in the emergency room (ER) in patients with wounds who are unaware of their vaccination history is erroneous in 40% of cases. Evaluation of bedside tetanus immunity with the Tétanos Quick Stick (TQS) test may improve UTP.

Objectives

To show that (1) a positive TQS result reflects immunity to tetanus; and (2) TQS is reproducible by ER workers.

Methods

In a prospective concordance study, immunity to tetanus of patients with wounds was assessed by two techniques: (1) TQS at the bedside, which detects specific tetanus antitoxins at concentrations ≥ 0.2 IU/ml in whole blood or ≥ 0.1 IU/ml in serum; (2) ELISA in the laboratory (threshold > 0.1 IU/ml). The study comprised three groups: (A) healthcare personnel self-tested with the two techniques to determine the effect of training; (B) selected patients with wounds were double-tested with TQS by two healthcare providers whose readings were compared to test reproducibility; and (C) all patients with wounds aged ≥ 15 years were consecutively included.

Results

Of 1018 individuals included, 60 were in group A, 50 were in group B and 908 were in group C. 403 patients who were not included were similar to those included for age, vaccination history and types of wounds. The reproducibility of the test was 98%. TQS sensitivity was 83.0%, specificity 97.5%, positive predictive value 99.6% and negative predictive value 42.9%.

Conclusions

TQS reliably predicts tetanus immunity and is reproducible by healthcare providers. Although it may not accurately discriminate between patients with ongoing and declining immunity, it is currently the most sensitive and specific tool for guiding tetanus prophylaxis and should be included in current guidelines on UTP.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^1116e68F]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

In this analysis, only nine of 16 patients with acute injuries had sought medical care before their tetanus illness onset and diagnosis, and only two of the nine received PEP with TT or TT plus TIG as recommended. Health care providers might fail to provide TIG PEP because of a lack of knowledge about current recommendations or because the assessment of wound severity and whether a patient should be managed with TIG according to ACIP recommendations can be subjective. All tetanus patients required considerable and costly medical care, including hospitalization, and almost all (90%) were admitted to intensive care. Among patients who received TIG as treatment, there was variability in the dose administered. In the United States, 3,000–6,000 U, given in a single intramuscular dose with part of the dose infiltrated around the wound if it can be identified, is generally recommended for treatment. However, the optimal therapeutic dose has not been established, and some experts contend that a dose of 500 U, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is as effective as higher doses and causes less discomfort. It is also possible that some providers treating tetanus patients inadvertently prescribed the PEP dosage of TIG rather than the treatment dosage. Among five treated patients who received < 3,000 U of TIG as treatment, three survived and two died. Among 10 treated patients who received ≥ 3,000 U of TIG, seven survived, and three died.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, although California health care providers are required to report tetanus cases, surveillance is passive, and underreporting is likely. Second, because there is no laboratory testing for tetanus and case identification depends solely on clinical assessment, some cases might be misclassified. Finally, some of the case reports were incomplete, particularly with regard to TT history.

Although significant progress has been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by tetanus, cases of this vaccine-preventable disease continue to be reported. Health care providers should assess the tetanus vaccination status of their patients during routine visits. All providers who provide care for patients with wounds should have protocols for tetanus PEP and ensure that appropriate PEP is provided for such patients.

What is already known on this topic?

The incidence of tetanus has declined significantly since the introduction of tetanus vaccines. However, sporadic cases continue to be reported, particularly in adults who are not up-to-date with tetanus vaccinations.

### Vaccines for women age 50 and older [^116EVodp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td) Toxoid Boosters

Tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid are excellent immunogens. The primary vaccination series in childhood provides high-level protection and induces long-lasting immunologic memory, as evidenced by an anamnestic antibody response to Td after intervals of > 30 years. High levels of primary vaccination and appropriate wound care (including Td boosters) are the cornerstones of tetanus prevention in the United States. The current recommendation that all adults in the United States receive Td boosters every 10 years has been poorly implemented, as evidenced by serosurveys showing that most adults > 50 years of age lack protective levels of antibodies to either tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or both. Despite this high level of serosusceptibility, tetanus (≈30 cases/y) and diphtheria (0–3 cases/y) are rare diseases and almost always occur in persons who never completed the full schedule of childhood vaccinations. Cost and benefit studies favor a policy of a single mid-life Td booster for persons who have completed the full pediatric series, and several advisory groups have recommended a booster at 50 years of age as an alternative to the current standard of decennial boosters. Consideration of reducing the frequency of Td boosters will be complicated by the proposed addition of the acellular pertussis vaccine to the adult Td formulation, as it is more costly and induces a shorter duration of antibody response than Td.

### Updated recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) in pregnant women – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2012 [^114DNUbZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

ACIP Recommendations for Pregnant Women

ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal care implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. Health-care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving Tdap.

Guidance for Use

To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant, optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation although Tdap may be given at any time during pregnancy. For women not previously vaccinated with Tdap, if Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum.

Special Situations

Pregnant women due for tetanus booster

If a tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy (i.e. > 10 years since previous Td), then Tdap should be administered. Optimal timing is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Wound management for pregnant women

As part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus, a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine might be recommended for wound management in a pregnant woman if ≥ 5 years have elapsed since the previous Td booster. If a Td booster is recommended for a pregnant woman, health-care providers should administer Tdap.

Pregnant women with unknown or incomplete tetanus vaccination

To ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus, pregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus should receive three vaccinations containing tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids. The recommended schedule is 0, 4 weeks, and 6 through 12 months. Tdap should replace 1 dose of Td, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Cocooning

ACIP recommends that adolescents and adults (e.g. parents, siblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health-care personnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant aged < 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis if they have not received Tdap previously. Guidance will be forthcoming on revaccination of persons who anticipate close contact with an infant, including postpartum women who previously have received Tdap.

### Accuracy of parental-reported tetanus vaccination status for children with lacerations [^115GmQ7p]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether emergency department (ED) providers are able to accurately assess whether a child with a laceration needs tetanus prophylaxis.

Methods

We conducted an 8-month prospective cross-sectional study of children presenting with a laceration to a pediatric ED. We asked ED providers whether tetanus prophylaxis was necessary. An ED pharmacist accessed the Utah Statewide Immunization Information System (USIIS), and we assessed the accuracy of the ED provider's determination of necessary tetanus prophylaxis compared with USIIS records.

Results

Among 375 patients aged 5 months to 17 years, ED providers made an inaccurate assessment of necessary tetanus prophylaxis in 33 cases (8.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3%-12.1%). Emergency department providers would have inappropriately administered tetanus prophylaxis in 5 cases (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.5%-3.2%) and would have missed the need for tetanus prophylaxis in 28 cases (7.5%; 95% CI, 5.2%-10.6%). Emergency department providers were more likely to provide an inaccurate recommendation in older children (8.3 vs 4.8 years; P < 0.001), in patients with a dirty wound (45.5% vs 11.7%; P < 0.001), and in children who had fewer than 3 vaccines recorded in the USIIS (54.5% vs 1.2%; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Emergency department providers may inaccurately assess the need for tetanus prophylaxis in children. Special attention should be paid to cases of dirty wounds and cases in which fewer than 3 tetanus-containing vaccines have been given.

### Are current UK tetanus prophylaxis procedures for wound management optimal? [^117UvUJY]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a potentially fatal disease that occurs after contamination of a wound with Clostridium tetani spores. The introduction of comprehensive infant vaccination programmes in the 1960s dramatically reduced the incidence of tetanus in the UK. To achieve comprehensive protection against tetanus, the World Health Organization guidelines recommend the administration of the five-dose childhood immunisation regimen and an additional sixth dose, after approximately 10 years, to ensure long-lasting immunity. To supplement these measures, tetanus prophylaxis with human tetanus immunoglobulin is considered essential for incompletely immunised individuals presenting with dirty wounds. However, identifying those individuals who are not fully immunised has, until recently, been problematical. The use of a new rapid, point-of-care immunoassay to assess tetanus immune status may facilitate the optimal management of patients with wounds.

### Improving tetanus prophylaxis in the emergency department: a prospective, double-blind cost-effectiveness study [^115wy1To]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The choice of tetanus prophylaxis for patients with wounds depends on obtaining their vaccination history, which has been demonstrated to be unreliable. Use of a rapid immunoassay (Tétanos Quick Stick, the TQS), combined with knowledge of certain demographic characteristics, may improve the evaluation of tetanus immunity and thus help to avoid inadequate prophylactic measures and reduce costs.

Objectives

To evaluate the contribution of the TQS in the choice of tetanus prophylaxis and to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. The final aim was to define the place of the TQS in a modified algorithm for assessment of tetanus immunity in the emergency department.

Method

In this Belgian prospective, double-blind, multicentre study, 611 adult patients with a wound were included; 498 (81.5%) records were valid. The TQS test was performed by a nurse before the vaccination history was taken and the choice of prophylaxis was made, using the official algorithm (Belgian Superior Health Council), by a doctor who was unaware of the TQS result.

Results

The prevalence of protective anti-tetanus immunity was 74.1%. Immunity was lower in older patients and in female patients. The TQS was a cost-effective tool for patients presenting with a tetanus-prone wound and considered from the vaccination history to be unprotected. Use of the TQS would have improved management in 56.9% (95% CI 47.7% to 65.7%) of patients by avoiding unnecessary treatments, leading to a reduction in the mean cost per patient (10.58 euros/patient with the TQS versus 11.34 euros/patient without). The benefits of the TQS use were significantly greater in patients < 61 years old: unnecessary treatment would have been avoided in 76.9% (95% CI 65.8% to 85.4%) of cases and the mean cost per patient reduced to 8.31 euros.

Conclusion

In selected patients, the TQS is a cost-effective tool to evaluate tetanus immunity. An algorithm is proposed for ED assessment of tetanus immunity integrating age and the TQS result.

### Case report: a challenging case of tetanus presenting with headache [^114hn3zZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Tetanus is a life-threatening infectious neurological condition that has become uncommon due to large-scale immunization campaigns. We describe a rare instance of generalized tetanus presenting with a headache on a tropical island in Malaysia. A 43-year-old woman presenting with headaches and generalized body weakness, which progressed into trismus and neck stiffness. Her medical history indicated a wound on the sole of her foot caused by shattered glass in an unhygienic area, but no tetanus prophylaxis had been administered. The patient was subsequently given immunoglobulin, tetanus toxoid, metronidazole, and sedatives in the recommended dosages. Her neurological condition improved remarkably, but she suffered blood pressure fluctuations due to dysautonomia. She was successfully discharged with complete recovery after 6 months of follow-up. The case demonstrates the significance of appropriate identification and care of tetanus, as well as the lethal effects of untreated wounds in vulnerable patients.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^115uZV1E]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Soft tissue injury

Of note, the focus of this section is on civilian trauma, with the acknowledgment that military-grade (ie, higher energy) weapons are sometimes used in civilian trauma. Further, this review will focus on isolated soft tissue injuries that are not associated with underlying bony or hollow viscus injury.

Simple lacerations (other than face and scalp)

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of simple lacerations?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple soft tissue lacerations. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: There are no recent data to support prophylactic antibiotics for uncomplicated, traumatic soft tissue lacerations. Most high-quality evidence on this topic is over 20 years old, and supports avoiding antibiotics, while much of the recent literature is focused on soft tissue injury with underlying open fractures but does not address isolated soft tissue injury. Overall, the studies emphasize the importance of adequate irrigation, debridement, removal of foreign bodies, and appropriate closure technique as the major means of infection prevention. While the little data that exist generally support forgoing antibiotic prophylaxis, it is important to identify the cases that are more complex and thus may have different management considerations. Moran et al provide a useful approach, advising the consideration of both high-risk wounds and high-risk patients, which may affect a clinician's decision to give antibiotic prophylaxis. The WHO provides a similar framework for wound assessment that includes size, contamination, and other high-risk factors. Clinicians should work from a baseline understanding that in most simple, traumatic soft tissue wounds in civilian patients, prophylactic antibiotics are likely unnecessary, and then adjust only on the basis of specific patient-related or wound-related risk factors or concerns. Additionally, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

Conclusion

Although tetanus is a vaccine preventable infectious disease, its prevalence is still high in our environment and it remains a difficult to treat disease with an unacceptably high morbidity and mortality rate, even with available advanced facilities for its management. Young adult males are commonly affected. The incidence of tetanus can be reduced significantly by an effective immunization program and proper wound management of the patients. Early recognition, intense support and prompt treatment improves morbidity and mortality of patients diagnosed with tetanus. Our study show comparable clinical pattern and outcome with other studies in the developing countries reported in the literatures.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^114rxSYR]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Special Situations

Accelerated Schedule for Infants and Children Aged < 7 Years

For an infant or child aged < 7 years, circumstances such as travel, potential loss to follow-up or increased risk of exposure to pertussis might warrant an accelerated schedule to provide protection as early as possible. An accelerated schedule can be started as soon as the infant is aged 6 weeks, with the second and third DTaP doses administered no earlier than 4 weeks after each preceding dose. The fourth DTaP dose should not be administered before the infant is aged 12 months and should be separated from the third dose by at least 6 months. The fifth DTaP dose should not be administered before the child is aged 4 years. When considering an accelerated schedule, providers also should consider the timing of other recommended vaccines and well-child visits.

History of Pertussis

Persons who have a history of pertussis should receive a pertussis-containing vaccine (i.e. DTaP or Tdap) according to the routine recommendation. Although pertussis disease is likely to confer natural immunity against pertussis, the immune response might be suboptimal against subsequent pertussis disease and the duration of protection induced by an infection does not provide long-term immunity.

Persons Who Have Recovered from Tetanus or Diphtheria

Tetanus or diphtheria infection do not necessarily confer immunity against re-infection; therefore, active vaccination should be initiated at the time of recovery from the illness according to the schedule. Persons who have completed the primary tetanus vaccination series should receive a booster dose as soon as feasible during convalescence. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and should begin the 3-dose tetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccination series.

Vaccine Administration

A summary of dose schedules is provided (Tables 4 and 5).

All health care personnel administering vaccinations should be aware of the potential for syncope after vaccination, especially among adolescents and young adults, and should take appropriate measures to prevent potential injuries. Providers should strongly consider observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated. If syncope occurs, the vaccine recipient should be observed until symptoms resolve.

A 78-year-old woman with no known medical history presented with severe neck pain that began 4 days prior to admission located in the paraspinal cervical region radiating to the shoulders, legs and back. She had associated stiffness of her neck and progression of pain to her jaw and throat with progression to generalised body spasms with lower extremity stiffness and weakness that limited her ability to walk. She quickly developed dysphagia and odynophagia with subsequent generalised spasms and profound hypoxic respiratory failure requiring nasotracheal intubation. The presumptive diagnosis of tetanus was made and she was given tetanus toxoid immune globulin and Tdap vaccine. She was managed in the intensive care unit and after a week of admission, required a tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement. She required a prolonged hospitalisation stay of 21 days before being transferred to a long-term vent facility.

Adult immunizations in diabetes mellitus — vaccine-specific guidance includes influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, COVID-19, tetanus, and zoster. The intranasal influenza vaccine should be used with caution because its safety in persons with DM has not been established, and inactivated influenza vaccine may be considered for persons with DM. For pneumococcal vaccination, the CDC/ACIP recommends a single dose of PCV15 or PCV20 for adults with DM who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown, and when PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all persons with DM aged 59 years or younger and should be considered for persons 60 years or older with shared clinical decision-making based on risk assessment and likelihood of an adequate immune response; a 2‑dose hepatitis B vaccine, HEPLISAV‑B, had greater seroprotection rates among persons with DM compared with the 3‑dose hepatitis B vaccine 28 weeks after vaccination. Individuals with DM, when infected with COVID‑19, are more likely to be hospitalized, need higher levels of care, and have higher mortality; hence, individuals with DM should be vaccinated according to current CDC recommendations. Tetanus prophylaxis in wound management is recommended and could be important for persons with DM who have foot ulcers. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is recommended for adults 50 years of age and older according to the CDC/ACIP schedule, and the live attenuated zoster vaccine is no longer available for use in the United States.

Austere initial assessment and prophylaxis — if obtaining a tetanus history is unclear, or the most recent tetanus vaccination is more than 5 years and resources allow, consider revaccination; as there is no definitive evidence regarding prophylactic antibiotic use early on in the burn process, antibiotics should not be administered prophylactically in the austere environment; baseline laboratory values such as hematocrit, chemistries, urinalysis, or chest x-ray may be beneficial for burns > 15% TBSA.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^116M9vot]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Sixteen (76%) patients reported that an acute injury had occurred before illness onset; including punctures (seven), abrasions (four), linear lacerations (three), compound fracture (one) and animal bite (one). Of six patients with data on wound depth, two had wounds that were > 1 cm deep. Seven of 11 patients with available data had wounds that appeared infected, and two of seven patients with available data had wounds with devitalized, ischemic, or denervated tissue. Five patients reported no acute injuries before onset; of these, three were injection-drug users. The remaining two patients could not recall any acute injuries; however, one reported an insect bite, and the other reported chronic abrasions on the hands and feet and exposure to soil.

Of the 16 patients who reported acute injuries before illness onset, nine had sought medical care for their injuries (Table 2). Of the nine, only two received appropriate PEP before the onset of tetanus symptoms as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (Table 3). Of the seven patients who did not receive appropriate PEP, five had punctures or contaminated wounds and unknown TT vaccination histories, and should have received both TT and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) as recommended. However, four patients did not receive any PEP, and one received TT PEP only. Of the two remaining patients, one had a clean, minor wound and reported receiving at least one TT dose more than 10 years ago, but was not offered TT PEP as recommended; the other patient was contraindicated for TT because of a history of anaphylaxis, but was not offered TIG as an alternative.

Following their tetanus diagnoses, all 21 patients were treated with TIG; six were treated ≤ 1 day after symptom onset, eight ≤ 4 days, six ≤ 9 days, and one was treated > 2 weeks after onset. Among the five fatal cases, one patient was treated ≤ 1 day after symptom onset, two were treated ≤ 4 days, and two ≤ 9 days after onset. Of 15 patients for whom data on TIG dosage were available, five received less than the 3,000–6,000 U that is generally recommended for treatment; two received less than 500 U, and three received 500–1,000 U.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (adults), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines, including at least one tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis dose, in individuals aged ≥ 19 years who have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria. Administer vaccination series preferably according to the following schedule: one dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, followed by one dose of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis at least 4 weeks afterward, and one dose of either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis 6–12 months later.

Background

Tetanus, though a vaccine preventable disease, is still a significant public health problem throughout the world and it is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate, particularly in the developing world. The global incidence of tetanus is still estimated at one million cases annually, with a case fatality ratio ranging from 6% to 72% depending on the availability of well equipped intensive care unit. The incidence of tetanus in the developed world is markedly low and is no longer responsible for significant mortality, this has been attributed to high level of health awareness in terms of vaccination and availability of human and material resources to manage the disease. In developed countries tetanus occurs mainly in elderly due to decline in protective antibodies and in developing countries tetanus is common in the young due to lack of effective immunization program and appropriate treatment of injuries.

Tetanus is caused by Clostridium Tetani, a gram positive, anaerobic and spore forming bacterium which is found in soil and in animal and human faeces and the usual mode of entry is through a punctured wounds or lacerations, although tetanus may follow surgery, burns, gangrene, chronic ulcers, dog bites, injections such as with drug users, dental infection, abortion and childbirth. In some patients no portal of entry for the organism can be identified.

Tetanus occurs sporadically and almost always affects non-immunized, partially immunized, or fully immunized persons who fail to maintain adequate immunity with booster doses of vaccine. It is therefore very important, in order to have protection against tetanus, that all age groups have the universal primary immunization with subsequent maintenance of adequate antitoxin levels by means of appropriately timed boosters.

### A minor wound with a fatal course [^115rkMet]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors report on a fatal case of severe tetanus in a 74-year old woman. Despite comprehensive intensive care management they could not achieve a satisfying control of the autonomic dysfunction caused by tetanus. By now there is no established therapy for the treatment of the autonomic dysfunction. This report demonstrates the dismal prognosis of severe tetanus in the older people, which is often complicated by cardiovascular comorbidity and underlines the importance of tetanus prevention by sufficient vaccination.

§ Persons with HIV infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunization.

¶ Yes, if > 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

** Yes, if ≥ 5 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

Persons who have completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series and have received a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine < 5 years earlier are protected against tetanus and do not require a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine or TIG as part of wound management. An attempt should be made to determine whether a patient has completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. Persons who have not completed the primary series might require tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management (Table 6). When both TIG and a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine are indicated, the products should be administered using separate syringes at different anatomical sites. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunizations.

Persons with a history of an Arthus reaction following a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine until > 10 years after the most recent dose; this interval is recommended regardless of the wound condition (e.g. even if contaminated or severe). In all circumstances, the decision to administer TIG should be based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus (Table 6).
