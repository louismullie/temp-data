## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a differential diagnosis for a 60-year-old man with fever, lymphadenopathy, and mouth ulcers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the triad epidemiologically and by acuity. Then, I should prioritize the differential by pathophysiology and pretest probability in this age group. Next, I will outline a focused diagnostic workup with red flags and when to escalate to biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized list of likely etiologies and note special considerations that could modify pretest probabilities, such as travel, sexual exposures, and medications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Fever with lymphadenopathy in an adult over 40 carries a higher risk of malignancy and serious systemic disease, so I should not anchor prematurely on benign causes; at the same time, oral ulcers plus nodes broaden the differential to infectious, inflammatory/autoimmune, and neoplastic etiologies, and I need to keep both common and dangerous entities in view [^72da86f4] [^30d581ca].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies that fit this triad. Acute HIV infection is high on the list in any adult with fever and lymphadenopathy; oral ulcers can occur and the rash may be subtle or absent, so I should maintain a low threshold for HIV RNA/Duo testing even without reported high-risk exposure, especially in higher-prevalence settings [^c9018db3] [^a0748470]. Secondary syphilis can present with fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and mucous membrane involvement including oral ulcers; I should order treponemal/nontreponemal serologies if there is any sexual risk history or atypical mucocutaneous findings [^d960e8ed]. Epstein-Barr virus remains plausible, though less likely at 60; I should consider it if there is pharyngitis, fatigue, and atypical lymphocytes, recognizing that classic features can be muted in older adults [^5648e872]. I should also remember tularemia in the right exposure context (rabbit/animal contact, hunting) given its ulceroglandular and glandular presentations with fever and regional nodes, and consider rickettsial infections if there is an eschar or compatible exposure history [^5b47dffb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about infections alone. I need to check for inflammatory and autoimmune causes that can produce fever, nodes, and oral ulcers. Behçet disease is a leading consideration in adults with recurrent oral ulcers and systemic features; I should ask about genital ulcers, ocular symptoms, skin lesions, and arthritis, and consider pathergy testing where available, while remembering that oral ulcers can be the initial manifestation of systemic disease [^13a5d1a6]. Systemic lupus erythematosus can present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and oral ulcers, sometimes mimicking infection; I should screen ANA, dsDNA, and complement if clinical suspicion is present, noting that SLE can occasionally present with features suggestive of HIV or lymphoma [^bd69039f]. Adult-onset Still's disease belongs on the list when there is high spiking fever, evanescent rash, and seronegative polyarthritis; I should check ferritin and consider this if infectious workup is unrevealing and inflammatory markers are markedly elevated [^d495b83f]. I should also keep drug-induced lupus or oral ulcerations in mind if there is a relevant medication history, such as penicillamine, which can cause oral ulcers and a lupus-like syndrome with lymphadenopathy [^145aa558].

> Next, I should review neoplastic etiologies because age over 40 with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy raises concern. Lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin, can present with fever, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy; oral involvement is less common but possible, so I should palpate all nodal stations and plan early excisional biopsy if nodes persist beyond 2–4 weeks or if red flags emerge [^72da86f4] [^7b93c9fe]. I need to ensure I do not miss head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with occult primaries that can present with cervical nodes and, rarely, oral lesions; a careful ENT exam and consideration of PET-CT may be warranted if the source remains elusive [^7b93c9fe]. Leukemia can also produce fever, cytopenias, and lymphadenopathy; I should review the CBC and peripheral smear carefully for blasts or dysplasia [^72da86f4].

> But wait, what if this is a periodic fever syndrome masquerading in adulthood. PFAPA is classically pediatric, yet adult-onset cases are increasingly recognized; I should consider it if there are stereotyped febrile episodes with aphthae, pharyngitis, and cervical nodes, especially with a dramatic response to a single dose of corticosteroids, while remembering that adult PFAPA is a diagnosis of exclusion and requires careful exclusion of hereditary periodic fevers and other causes [^6b0eb404] [^c3a80fbb]. I should double-check for features of TRAPS, HIDS, or FMF if there is a family history, ethnicity risk, or atypical periodicity, and consider targeted genetics if the phenotype is compelling [^febe7f27].

> I should confirm the initial diagnostic approach. A focused history should cover sexual exposures, travel and animal exposures, medication use including new drugs, and timing and pattern of fevers; the exam should document node size, consistency, distribution, and any mucocutaneous lesions beyond the mouth, including genital and ocular findings [^30d581ca]. Core labs should include CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, ESR/CRP, HIV RNA or 4th-generation Ag/Ab, EBV serology, RPR with treponemal confirmation, and urinalysis; I should add ferritin if Still's is suspected, and consider ANA with dsDNA and complement if autoimmune disease is on the table [^c9018db3] [^d495b83f]. Chest radiograph is reasonable to screen for mediastinal disease or atypical infections; if nodes persist or malignancy is suspected, excisional biopsy provides the highest diagnostic yield and should not be delayed unnecessarily [^72da86f4] [^7b93c9fe].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate escalation. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, nodes larger than 2 cm, hard or fixed nodes, B symptoms (night sweats, weight loss > 10%, persistent fever), organomegaly, cytopenias, or elevated LDH should lower the threshold for early biopsy and imaging, including PET-CT to localize occult disease or guide biopsy [^72da86f4] [^30d581ca]. If tularemia is suspected based on exposure, I should coordinate with public health and use appropriate antibiotics, as delays can worsen outcomes [^36d96a08].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized differential for this 60-year-old man. Most likely: secondary syphilis given the triad and age, followed closely by acute HIV infection; both require prompt serologic testing and, if positive, staging and treatment planning [^d960e8ed] [^c9018db3]. Next, I should consider lymphoma given age and systemic symptoms, with early biopsy if nodes persist or red flags appear [^72da86f4]. Behçet disease and SLE are important inflammatory differentials, particularly with recurrent oral ulcers and multisystem features; targeted autoimmune testing and careful mucocutaneous exam are key [^13a5d1a6] [^bd69039f]. Adult-onset Still's disease remains a consideration if there is high spiking fever, rash, and seronegative arthritis with very high inflammatory markers [^d495b83f]. Less likely but plausible in the right context are EBV, tularemia, and adult-onset PFAPA, which should be considered only after excluding more common and serious causes [^5648e872] [^36d96a08] [^6b0eb404].

> Finally, I need to ensure the management plan is aligned with the working diagnosis. If HIV or syphilis is confirmed, treat per guidelines and arrange partner notification and testing; if lymphoma is suspected, expedite hematology referral and tissue diagnosis; if an autoinflammatory syndrome is suspected, initiate disease-specific therapy and consider rheumatology input; if no diagnosis emerges and nodes persist, proceed to excisional biopsy and PET-CT to avoid missing malignancy or granulomatous disease [^c9018db3] [^e899e17b] [^72da86f4] [^30d581ca].

In a 60-year-old male with fever, lymphadenopathy, and mouth ulcers, the differential includes **infectious, autoimmune, malignant, and drug-related** etiologies. The most likely are **HIV, EBV, CMV, tuberculosis, lymphoma, and SLE** [^c9018db3] [^5648e872] [^7fda5245] [^72da86f4] [^bd69039f]. Key next steps include **HIV testing, EBV/CMV serologies, TB testing, CBC, LDH, and chest imaging**; if lymphadenopathy persists beyond 4 weeks or is hard/fixed, obtain excisional lymph node biopsy to exclude lymphoma or other malignancies [^7b93c9fe] [^30d581ca].

## Autoimmune and inflammatory etiologies

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Fever, lymphadenopathy, oral ulcers, arthralgia, serositis; check ANA, dsDNA, complement [^bd69039f].
- **Behçet's disease**: Recurrent oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, arthritis; clinical diagnosis with exclusion of others [^a63de1c1].
- **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)**: Oral ulcers, sinusitis, pulmonary involvement, renal disease; c-ANCA/PR3 positive [^ee2f44b6].

---

## Malignant etiologies

- **Lymphoma (Hodgkin/non-Hodgkin)**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, oral involvement; excisional biopsy is diagnostic [^notfound].
- **Leukemia**: Fever, lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, oral ulcers; bone marrow biopsy may be needed [^notfound].
- **Oral squamous cell carcinoma**: Persistent oral ulcer, lymphadenopathy, weight loss; biopsy of ulcer and nodes [^notfound].

---

## Drug-induced etiologies

Drug-induced etiologies include **methotrexate, penicillamine, and allopurinol**, which can cause oral ulcers, fever, and lymphadenopathy; review medications and consider drug-induced lupus or DRESS [^145aa558] [^7fda5245].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History**: Onset, duration, travel, sexual exposures, medications, systemic symptoms (night sweats, weight loss) [^30d581ca].
- **Exam**: Node size/consistency, oral lesion character, organomegaly, rash [^72da86f4].
- **Initial labs**: CBC, LDH, ESR/CRP, HIV test, EBV/CMV serologies, TB testing, RPR, ANA, liver/renal function [^c9018db3] [^5648e872].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray; CT neck/chest/abdomen if persistent nodes or systemic symptoms [^30d581ca].
- **Biopsy**: Excisional lymph node biopsy if nodes persist > 4 weeks, are hard/fixed, or if malignancy is suspected [^7b93c9fe].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely causes in this patient are **HIV, EBV/CMV, tuberculosis, lymphoma, and SLE**. A structured workup with targeted labs and timely biopsy of persistent nodes is essential to distinguish infection, autoimmunity, and malignancy [^30d581ca].

### A taste of periodic fever syndromes [^81996e31]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Periodic fevers are acquired or inherited disorders of innate immunity, which were first described in the 1940s. The patients are typically young at onset and have regularly recurring fevers for a few days to a few weeks with systemic inflammatory symptoms that are interrupted by symptom-free periods. There is a variety of clinical manifestations including gastrointestinal complaints, myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. A differential diagnosis in these patients may include recurrent infections, other inflammatory disorders, and neoplastic disease. This clinical review focuses on a sample of autoinflammatory disorders including familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated periodic syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome. We review the basics, pertinent clinical and laboratory features, and management of each entity.

Acute and recent HIV infection — clinical suspicion and differential diagnosis: Health care providers should consider the possibility of acute HIV infection in symptomatic people and in asymptomatic people with a possible acute (within 2–6 weeks) exposure to HIV. Signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings may include fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, pharyngitis, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation. High-risk exposures include sexual contact with someone who has HIV or is at risk of HIV infection, sharing needles, syringes, or equipment for drug preparation or injection, or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with bodily fluids that may carry HIV. The differential diagnosis may include COVID-19, EBV and non-EBV (e.g. CMV) infectious mononucleosis syndromes, influenza, viral hepatitis, streptococcal infection, or syphilis, and diagnosis of any STI should prompt HIV testing and consideration of acute HIV infection.

### Acute oral ulcers [^b64d644c]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of acute oral ulcers can be challenging. Important historic details include the pattern of recurrence, anatomic areas of involvement within the mouth and elsewhere on the mucocutaneous surface, associated medical symptoms or comorbidities, and symptomology. Careful mucocutaneous examination is essential. When necessary, biopsy at an active site without ulceration is generally optimal. Depending on the clinical scenario, supplemental studies that may be useful include cultures; perilesional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence testing; and evaluation for infectious diseases, gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, connective tissue diseases, or hematinic deficiencies. Clinicians should maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute oral ulcers.

### Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA) or recurrent urinary tract infections: a case report [^ac444cb2]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study shows that a patient should never be marked, particularly when the symptom and signs aren't completely justifying a patient's condition. The other most important educational massage is the setting at which the patient was first visited, considering if the patient had first been visited by a rheumatologist, the first differential diagnosis for periodic fevers would have probably been PFAPA, thus physicians should consider other diagnosis outside their own specific field of specialty.

### Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome and syndrome of unexplained recurrent fevers in children and adults [^b87aec26]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Children and adults with autoinflammatory disorders, who often experience recurrent fevers, rashes, cold-induced symptoms, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, recurrent infections, aphthous stomatitis, and abnormal blood cell counts, may present to the allergist/immunologist because the symptoms mimic allergies and disorders of immunity. In recent years, there has been increased recognition of non-monogenic autoinflammatory disorders, including periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome and syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fevers. For many clinical practitioners, the natural history, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, and preferred therapies remain challenging because of the presumed rarity of patients and the evolving field of autoinflammation. Here, we aim to provide a practical framework for the clinical allergist/immunologist to evaluate and treat this patient population.

### Imaging findings of ulceroglandular tularemia [^a5bcf532]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Francisella tularensis, the causative organism in Tularemia, is a relatively rare disease. There are a few radiological clues to elucidate its presence when suspicion arises. There should be strong consideration for Tularemia in the differential of any patient with its classic symptoms, diffuse cervical lymphadenopathy with evidence of necrosis, and enlarged adenoids. Ultrasound may demonstrate suppurative lymphadenopathy suggestive of infection, as in the case presented. CT often will demonstrate the extent of lymphadenopathy. On chest radiography, tularemia pneumonia is often the presenting finding, which may demonstrate bilateral or lobar infiltrates. Additionally, hilar lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions are often associated findings. Cavitary lesions may be present, which are better delineated on CT scan. We present a case of a 7-year-old male who presented with a painful right-sided palpable neck mass for 9 days, who was diagnosed with Tularemia after numerous admissions.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults [^30d581ca]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin is defined as a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions, coupled with an unrevealing diagnostic workup. The differential diagnosis is broad but is typically categorized as infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory disease, or miscellaneous. Most cases in adults occur because of uncommon presentations of common diseases, and up to 75% of cases will resolve spontaneously without reaching a definitive diagnosis. In the absence of localizing signs and symptoms, the workup should begin with a comprehensive history and physical examination to help narrow potential etiologies. Initial testing should include an evaluation for infectious etiologies, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes such as venous thromboembolism and thyroiditis. If erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels are elevated and a diagnosis has not been made after initial evaluation, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, with computed tomography, may be useful in reaching a diagnosis. If noninvasive diagnostic tests are unrevealing, then the invasive test of choice is a tissue biopsy because of the relatively high diagnostic yield. Depending on clinical indications, this may include liver, lymph node, temporal artery, skin, skin-muscle, or bone marrow biopsy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of fever of unknown origin and therefore should be avoided except in patients who are neutropenic, immunocompromised, or critically ill.

### Characterization of novel pathogenic variants leading to caspase-8 cleavage-resistant RIPK1-induced autoinflammatory syndrome [^cd6af6da]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

From a clinical point of view, the main manifestations detected in the enrolled patients are markedly similar to those previously described, with minor differences in the incidence of splenomegaly (16.7% vs 58.3); abdominal pain (16.7% vs 41.7%); oral ulcers (66.7% vs 71.4%); arthralgias (83.3% vs 37.5%), and headache (83.3% in our series vs not specified). These data clearly indicate a relatively homogenous clinical picture for the CRIA syndrome and markedly different to the manifestations described in the deficiency of RIPK1, which is characterized by profound cellular immunodeficiency, with recurrent and severe infections, progressive polyarthritis, and early-onset inflammatory bowel disease.

The CRIA syndrome displays marked similarities with two well-known AIDs, the HIDS syndrome and the periodic fever, aphthosis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, and consequently it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these diseases. Some clinical features are frequent in all these three diseases, including early age at disease onset, the periodic nature of inflammatory episodes, and the presence of fever, lymphadenopathies, oral ulcers, and increased acute phase reactants. In contrast, there are some differences that may help clinicians to distinguish these entities. These differences include the inheritance pattern of the disease (dominant for the CRIA syndrome, recessive for HIDS, and polygenic inheritance for PFAPA); the near absence of inflammatory manifestations at serosa; skin and eye in CRIA syndrome; the tendency in PFAPA syndrome to spontaneously subside the inflammatory episodes during puberty and adolescence in contrast to HIDS and CRIA syndromes, where these episodes are still present during adulthood; certain differences in the hematological tests (tendency to normal values of leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in CRIA syndrome); and the different outcome of frequently administered treatments. Finally, the deficiency of caspase-8 may be also considered in the differential diagnosis of CRIA syndrome, because both diseases share some pathophysiological mechanisms (partial or total impairment of normal caspase-8 function) and clinical features such as lymphadenopathies and splenomegaly. However, the differences with regard to their inheritance pattern, age at disease onset, frequencies of severe infections and mucosal involvement, and mortality rates may help clinicians to clearly distinguish these two conditions. Table 3 includes a comparative summary of the main similarities and differences observed among the above mentioned diseases.

History

A 27-year-old female presented initially with several days of profound fatigue, cervical lymphadenopathy, and fevers. She was prescribed a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate before re-presenting 1 week later with fever, headaches, photophobia, arthralgias, diarrhea, dysuria, and painful skin lesions. Examination revealed oral and labial ulcers (Fig 1), erythematous nodules on the extremities (Fig 2), conjunctival hyperemia, papilledema, and vulvar erythema. Laboratory studies were notable for neutrophilia, anemia, elevated C-reactive protein, and positive Monospot and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen IgG. Infectious and autoimmune workup was otherwise unremarkable. Histologic findings from biopsy of a subcutaneous nodule are shown (Fig 3).

### Oral lesions associated with systemic disease [^13a5d1a6]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral manifestations may be the first sign of a systemic disease, or represent lesions associated with an established or recurrent disease. Oral health care providers are often the first to recognize these signs. Some lesions have characteristic features that allow for early detection and intervention. On the contrary, clinical manifestations may be diverse and require a comprehensive evaluation to establish a definitive diagnosis. This article reviews the oral manifestations of select systemic diseases to help clinicians develop a differential diagnosis that leads to early diagnosis and timely intervention.

### Treatment of refractory yao syndrome with canakinumab [^d72df78a]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

YAOS often presents with recurrent and remitting flu-like symptoms followed by fever and erythematous plaques or patches. Our patient experienced symptoms that are commonly reported with YAOS: gastrointestinal manifestations (bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), arthritis and arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, headache, weight loss, and chronic pain causing physical impairment.,

Other reported features of YAOS include sicca-like symptoms, most commonly periorbital swelling, lower extremity swelling, oral ulcers, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, pericarditis, and pleuritis. Cerebral infarction has also been reported in the context of a YAOS-associated fever attack. Eyelid swelling is especially common, seen in > 50% of patients with YAOS. Its absence in our case highlights disease variability and emphasizes recognizing its full spectrum of manifestations. Although 90% of Caucasians experience dermatitis, no Chinese patients with dermatitis have been reported, suggesting possible human leuokocyte antigen-mediated differences in disease expression.

A broad differential should include other systemic autoinflammatory diseases, a group of disorders caused by chronic activation of the innate immune system. In contrast with classic autoimmune disorders, autoinflammatory conditions lack identifiable autoantibodies but rather comprise periodic fever syndromes with evanescent urticarial papules, plaques, figurate erythema, erysipelas-like eruptions, and sterile pustules, typically in association with. fever Elevated acute phase reactants, rash, serositis, arthritis, and lymphadenopathy are present in both autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Yao et aldeveloped a 6-gene panel to screen for periodic fever syndromes that may mimic YAOS (Table I). Typically, recurrent patchy erythema, distal extremity swelling, and eyelid swelling are more suggestive of YS than other hereditary periodic fever syndromes.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^0539920d]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:
A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

### PFAPA meets Behçet's disease: a rare overlap in a pediatric patient [^682f8c71]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, and Cervical Adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome and Behçet's Disease (BD) are autoinflammatory disorders with overlapping features, including recurrent oral ulcers and systemic inflammation. PFAPA predominantly affects young children with periodic fever episodes, while BD is rare in pediatrics and presents with mucocutaneous and systemic involvement. This case of an 8-year-old boy with features of both conditions highlights diagnostic challenges and the potential for shared pathogenic mechanisms.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus presenting with features suggestive of human immunodeficiency virus infection [^bd69039f]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

We describe 8 patients who presented with fever, weight loss, anemia, and oral and/or esophageal candidiasis, and who were initially thought to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or lymphoma. These patients fulfilled American College of Rheumatology criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) because of arthralgias or arthritis, hematological derangements, and immunological abnormalities. Treatment was delayed because SLE did not immediately enter into the differential diagnosis. All patients had a rapid response to corticosteroids, with defervescence of fever, decrease in lymphadenopathy within 24–48 hours, and complete resolution of lymphadenopathy and other signs and symptoms of illness in 7–10 days. It is important to recognize this mode of SLE presentation in patients who test negative for HIV infection so that the appropriate diagnostic evaluation and initiation of treatment can be expedited.

### Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome in a young adult who had features of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis as a child [^3f56ea6c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) was diagnosed in a 22-year-old man after a 1-year history of periodic fever, myalgia, conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and oral ulcers. As a child he had signs and symptoms suggestive of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome. This report indicates the importance of considering TRAPS as a cause of periodic fever in older children and adults and that TRAPS may present with signs and symptoms suggestive of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome in young children.

Discussion

The incidence of syphilis has been increasing in the USA since 2001. The histology of syphilis, though widely studied, still remains a diagnostic challenge, particularly when the clinical presentation does not suggest the diagnosis. We present an overview of the clinical and pathological features commonly associated with cutaneous primary and secondary syphilis, addressing, at the end, the current case.

Treponema pallidum, as is well known, is the etiological organism of syphilis. Syphilis presents in one of three stages — primary, secondary and tertiary — with primary and secondary syphilis being the most common. Secondary syphilis is most commonly encountered in dermatopathology practice. The anogenital region is the most common location. However, 5% of cases arise in extragenital sites, which are termed endemic, or non-venereal, syphilis. The oral cavity is the most commonly involved extragenital site, but any site can be involved.

In primary syphilis, the lesion typically appears as a chancre, a punched-out, painless ulcer that develops 20–30 days after exposure to T. pallidum and may be associated with painless lymphadenopathy. These lesions resolve within 1–5 weeks and do not scar.

Secondary syphilis arises 6–8 weeks after the primary chancre. The lesions initially present as 5–10 mm erythematous macules on the head, face and neck similar to a viral xanthem. A polymorphic papular eruption subsequently occurs and consists of coppery red papules, measuring 3–10 mm in diameter. Involvement of the palms, soles and oral cavity is highly suspicious for secondary syphilis. However, this classic progression is not always observed and there is clinical significant overlap with other entities and non-specific presentations. Patients can also present with other cutaneous manifestations, some of which overlap with syphilis. These include papulosquamous/psoriasiform lesions, oral ulcers, condylomata, bullous lesions, and erythema muliforme-like folliculitis. Patients with secondary syphilis can also develop fever, headache, weight loss, myalgias and arthralgias. Left untreated, secondary syphilis resolves within 2–10 weeks. After a latent phase, patients can progress to cure with seronegativity; seropositivity without lesions; or develop lesions of tertiary syphilis.

A woman in her early 20s with no significant medical history presented with tender cervical lymphadenopathy, swinging feverish episodes up to 39.6°C, a widespread maculopapular rash and polyarthralgia. She was extensively investigated as an inpatient with multiple imaging studies and blood tests to encompass the potential diagnosis of infection, malignancy or autoimmune disorders. She was discharged after undergoing an excisional cervical lymph node biopsy, which was later reported as consistent with the diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

### Fever of unknown origin: clinical overview of classic and current concepts [^00b2f980]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to disorders that present with prolonged and perplexing fevers that are difficult to diagnose. This article presents a clinical overview of classic and current causes of FUOs, which may be due to infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. Comprehensive but nonfocused diagnostic testing is ineffective and should be avoided. The FUO workup should be directed by the key history, physical, and laboratory findings in clinical presentation. The clinical syndromic approach in the differential diagnosis of FUOs is emphasized, and the diagnostic importance and significance of fever patterns are discussed.

### Granulomatosis polyangiitis [^ee2f44b6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 22-year-old female patient was admitted to hospital after being referred from the oral medicine clinic where she had been seen for persistent gingivitis and mouth ulcers. She described an insidious history of persistent fevers, dry cough and unexplained weight loss over 4–6 weeks. Imaging showed extensive bilateral pulmonary nodules with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and two lesions in the pancreas. MRI revealed these lesions to be well-defined fluid-filled cysts in the tail of the pancreas, without features of malignancy. Core biopsies taken from her lung nodules demonstrated features of vasculitis with granulomata. This was consistent with her positive immunology for c-antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies and proteinase-3, which were sent after her fever failed to settle with antibiotic treatment. In keeping with a diagnosis of vasculitis, the patient showed a significant clinical and biochemical response to intravenous methylprednisolone and high-dose daily prednisolone thereafter.

### Periodic fever syndromes: a diagnostic challenge for the allergist [^26a838ea]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

The objective was to present a case of periodic fever with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA), summarize the medical literature on PFAPA, review the differential diagnosis and suggest a diagnostic approach to periodic fevers in children. A PubMed search was conducted for all case reports and series of patients with PFAPA. The references of these papers yielded further case reports. Review articles or large case series were used for sources of information regarding the other periodic fever and autoinflammatory syndromes. All cases reported as PFAPA were included in the review, even though a few of the cases may not have been accurately diagnosed. The periodic fever and autoinflammatory syndromes of childhood are a group of diseases that cause repeated febrile illnesses with various associated symptoms. Except for PFAPA, each of these diseases is caused by a known genetic mutation. Effective treatment options and long-term prognosis varies among these syndromes. Children with periodic fever or autoinflammatory syndromes sometimes present to an Allergy/Immunology clinic for immunologic evaluation. It is important for the Allergy/Immunology specialist to be familiar with the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach and treatment of these conditions.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^72da86f4]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Sweet syndrome
B. Behçet's disease
C. Primary EBV infection
D. Erythema multiforme
E. Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection

Answers:
A. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with neutrophilia, fevers, and typically edematous plaques or vesiculobullous lesions. Histology would show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and papillary dermal edema without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
B. Behçet's disease – Correct. The oral and genital ulcers, neutrophilic vasculitis on histology of erythema nodosum-like skin lesions, as well as ocular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms with an otherwise unremarkable infectious and inflammatory workup led to a diagnosis of Beçhet's disease.
C. Primary EBV infection – Incorrect. EBV infection may have been both an inciting trigger for Behçet's disease and the cause of her initial presentation consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Associations between EBV infection and Behçet's disease have been well demonstrated. While EBV itself can have dermatologic manifestations, EBV alone was improbable, particularly given evidence of neutrophilic vasculitis on biopsy and subsequent EBV viral load and IgM testing were negative.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. The rash associated with erythema multiforme typically consists of targetoid plaques on the distal extremities. Skin biopsy findings here are also not compatible with erythema multiforme, which would show a vacuolar interface dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate, rather than a neutrophilic vasculitis as pictured.
E. Primary HSV infection – Incorrect. Erythema-nodosum like skin lesions would be highly unusual for primary HSV infection. HSV serologies and PCR were obtained and negative.

### Towards a new set of classification criteria for PFAPA syndrome [^e4846f47]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Periodic Fever, Aphthous stomatitis, Pharyngitis and Cervical Adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is characterized by regularly recurrent fever flares of early onset, accompanied by pharyngitis, cervical lymphadenopathy and oral aphthous ulcers. The diagnosis is currently based on the modified Marshall's criteria proposed in 1999, but the power of these criteria remains limited, and they show a good sensitivity but a lack in specificity. PFAPA is not a well-defined disease and shows a clinical overlap with the inherited periodic fevers, such as Familial Mediterranean Fever, Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome and Mevalonate kinase deficiency, for which a causative gene is well established. These diseases often require a more intensive therapeutic approach and have a more severe course and long-term prognosis. Therefore among those showing a PFAPA phenotype, it would be important to identify patients at risk of carrying mutation in genes associated with inherited periodic fever to avoid unnecessary genetic testing. Moreover, PFAPA shows a clinical overlap with other infectious diseases, and more specific criteria could help avoid prescriptions of unnecessary antibiotic therapies.

In 2008 we started an international collaborative effort, aimed at developing new classification criteria based on expert consensus and analysis of real patient data, to identify a new set of classification criteria for PFAPA syndrome with higher specificity. This project was conducted through several steps: 1) a preliminary Delphi survey among international pediatricians and rheumatologists; 2) a consensus conference of physicians with specific expertise in PFAPA to obtain a provisional new set of classification criteria; 3) a preliminary evaluation of the new set of criteria on a cohort of real PFAPA patients.

### Clinicopathological challenges of diagnosing reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption [^f22caf69]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

Case 1

An adolescent male presented to an Emergency Department (ED) with an 8 day history of sore throat. He had cough and high-grade fevers. His lips were erythematous, and he had left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. His medical history included scarlet fever and three episodes of Group A Streptococcus tonsillitis confirmed by throat cultures. He had a documented penicillin allergy, so had been prescribed erythromycin by a general practitioner on the fifth day of the illness. However, the commencement of erythromycin was thought to be unrelated to his symptoms including the development of cracked, bleeding lips, painful ulcers of the oropharynx (figure 1) and preputial mucosa on the third day of the illness.

At the ED, he was moderately dehydrated. He was admitted for intravenous (IV) fluid support and treated with cephalexin for suspected bacterial pharyngitis. He later developed non-purulent limbic-sparing conjunctivitis and dyspnoea. A chest X-ray revealed right upper lobe pneumonia. Initial differential diagnoses included Kawasaki disease and Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS). However, IgM serology returned positive for M. pneumoniae, and a diagnosis of RIME was made. His antibiotic therapy was changed to roxithromycin.

Case 2

A young girl with no significant medical history presented with a blistering rash, with conjunctivitis and labial and oropharyngeal mucositis (figure 2a-c). There was no history of recent new medications preceding the onset of symptoms.

Figure 2
Examples of non-mucosal involvement, such as pseudotargetoid lesions (a), purpuric macules (b) and papulonodules (c).

Nitrous oxide sedation was used because of severe pain and procedural anxiety. This helped to facilitate IV access, blood tests, ophthalmology and dermatology assessments. The rash had both well-circumscribed vesicles surrounded by erythematous rings and areas of yellow crusted ulceration. Ophthalmology examination revealed purulent bilateral conjunctivitis. There was extensive haemorrhagic mucositis and crusting of the lips, mouth and throat. Blood tests showed a high C-reactive protein level, but the white cell count was normal. Nasopharyngeal PCR testing for viral and bacterial pathogens returned positive for influenza B only.

Both children in this case series required nasogastric feeding support until the oropharyngeal lesions improved with a course of steroids and analgesia.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^e899e17b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) clinical features include GUD, lymphadenopathy, or proctocolitis. Rectal exposure among MSM or women can result in proctocolitis, which is the most common presentation of LGV infection and can mimic inflammatory bowel disease with clinical findings of mucous or hemorrhagic rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, or tenesmus. Outbreaks of LGV proctocolitis have been reported among MSM with high rates of HIV infection. Among heterosexuals, a common clinical manifestation is tender inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral, sometimes preceded by a self-limited genital ulcer or papule, and LGV-associated lymphadenopathy can be severe with bubo formation and potential rupture. Oral ulceration can occur and might be associated with cervical adenopathy, and persons with genital or colorectal LGV lesions can also experience secondary bacterial infection or be infected with other sexually and nonsexually transmitted pathogens.

### Kikuchi disease: a case report [^d50bf738]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Kikuchi disease, also known as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, is a rare, benign cause of cervical lymphadenitis. It is characterized by painful cervical lymphadenopathy with fevers, leukopenia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It is diagnosed by obtaining a biopsy specimen from a lymph node that shows characteristic histopathologic findings.

Case Report

We highlight a 42-year-old Japanese man who presented with persistent fevers and cervical lymphadenopathy who was misdiagnosed at multiple urgent care facilities and emergency departments. He was eventually diagnosed with Kikuchi disease after a biopsy specimen was obtained from a lymph node 1 month after his symptoms began. He was treated with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone with resolution of his symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although Kikuchi disease has been previously described in various specialty medical journals, the published literature on Kikuchi disease in emergency medicine is relatively scarce. Given that cervical lymphadenopathy is a common presentation to emergency departments, it is important for emergency physicians to be cognizant of Kikuchi disease in the differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy to prevent misdiagnoses and unnecessary treatments.

Differential diagnosis of warm water immersion injuries — distinguishing conditions: Differential diagnosis includes NFCI and frostbite, which can be distinguished from WWIF or TIF by a history of exposure to cold temperatures or cold water rather than warm water. Pressure necrosis can mimic or coexist with warm water injury, and tropical immersion foot can cause ulcerations in areas of swollen tissue. Like TIF, soft-tissue infections can cause erythema and edema, sometimes with fever and lymphadenopathy; infections are usually unilateral and well demarcated, unlike TIF, which is usually symmetrical and diffuse. Wet-sock erosions are superficial skin erosions that occur only in areas that experience friction or pressure, especially under bootlaces, unlike the lesions in TIF that cover the dorsum and ankle.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^f9afb323]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is caused by human enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses. Outbreaks can occur in the spring to fall and are common in North America, and most cases occur in patients younger than 10 years. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is transmitted by fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet contact. Patients present with a low-grade fever, a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet, and painful oral ulcerations. Lesions usually resolve in seven to 10 days; however, in rare cases, patients may have neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications. The differential diagnosis for childhood rashes and oral enanthems is broad and includes erythema multiforme, herpes, measles, and varicella. Treatment is supportive and directed toward hydration and pain relief as needed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Oral lidocaine is not recommended, and antiviral treatment is not available. The best methods to prevent the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease are handwashing and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces and fomites.

### Periodic fever syndromes: beyond the single gene paradigm [^febe7f27]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of FMF

Recent work based on the Eurofever registry - a large international registry of autoinflammatory diseases - has proposed new provisional clinical classification criteria with high sensitivity and specificity based on a gold standard defined by the presence of two MEFV mutations. The criteria include fever episodes lasting less than two days, with accompanying symptoms of chest pain and/or abdominal pain together with Eastern or North Mediterranean ethnicity. Patients should not have aphthous stomatitis, urticarial rash, or enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and episodes may not last more than 6 days. While these criteria remain provisional, other published classification criteria (Table 1) have been developed based on expert opinion and description of clinical manifestations in populations of limited ethnic diversity; the overlap among clinical features has led to low performance when applied to patients with different autoinflammatory diseases.

Given that there are overlapping symptoms among FMF and a number of polygenic autoinflammatory diseases – including periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), and Behçet disease – it is often challenging to make a purely clinical diagnosis of FMF. This is particularly the case in regions such as North America where FMF is rare and may be milder or present atypically. Some patients may also be mistakenly diagnosed with autoinflammatory or autoimmune syndromes that have some overlapping clinical features, including Behcet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatic fever.

Moreover, interpretation of genetic testing is challenging in patients with an FMF syndrome or a clear inflammatory phenotype but only one MEFV mutation of uncertain significance. Consensus guidelines suggest that while the diagnosis relies on clinical judgment, another periodic fever syndrome (PFS) should be considered in this case. Further studies are needed to validate data from combined molecular and clinical analysis in order to understand the effects of specific genetic variants. As emphasized by a recent systematic review, there is wide clinical variability among individuals with an FMF phenotype that is only partially explained by allelic heterogeneity.

The aim of this review is to describe the difficulties faced in clinical settings in making a diagnosis of FMF, or other genetically defined autoinflammatory diseases, in the face of patients with clinical disease and genetic mutations that are defined as 'uncertain'. The use of patient databases to advance understanding, particularly in genetically mixed populations, and the implications to treatment accessibility when diagnoses are undefined, are discussed.

### Sweet syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^57517327]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a disorder of unknown etiology. It has been associated with autoimmune processes, malignancies, infections, drug reactions, and gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We describe the case of a 51-year-old man who presented with severe pain in his tongue and throat and referred pain in his right ear, along with odynophagia, fever, and hoarseness of 48 hours'duration. An oral and oropharyngeal examination revealed the presence of aphthous ulcerations, as well as a 3 × 3-cm raised inflammatory lesion on the right anterior lateral tongue and a 5 × 5-mm bulla on the hard palate in the midline. In addition, erythematous papules and macules were noted on his face, neck, and extremities. Cultures, a biopsy, and laboratory tests yielded a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome. The patient was prescribed oral prednisone, and his signs and symptoms resolved within 2 months. Although Sweet syndrome is uncommon, even in dermatology practice, its head and neck and oral manifestations and its association with paraneoplastic disease warrant the need for otolaryngologists to be aware of the condition.

### A rare acneiform eruption presentation of kikuchi-fujimoto disease presenting with concurrent systemic lupus erythematosus [^588ad6b5]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare benign histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis of unknown etiology. It is a self-limited condition that typically manifests in young adults in the third decade of life and classically presents with a flu-like prodrome followed by fevers and cervical lymphadenopathy. The underlying cause is unknown, but it has been hypothesized to represent an immune-mediated response to a viral infection. Cutaneous manifestations associated with KFD vary and may include erythematous macules, patches, papules or plaques, malar erythema, pruritus, or oral ulcers.

Human herpesvirus-8 disease — clinical manifestations notes that most individuals latently infected with HHV-8 are asymptomatic, while immunocompetent children and organ transplant recipients may develop a primary infection syndrome with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, bone marrow failure, and occasional rapid progression to Kaposi sarcoma (KS). KS manifestations vary widely, with most patients having nontender, hyperpigmented, macular or nodular skin lesions; oral lesions occur in approximately one-third of patients and are predictors of pulmonary involvement and less favorable treatment outcomes. Lymphatic involvement is also common and may lead to debilitating lower extremity edema, and involvement of internal viscera occurs in up to 50% of cases.

### Clinical reasoning: a 60-year-old man with asymmetric weakness and persistent fever [^0d8e8a36]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathies, especially those with atypical features, remain a diagnostic challenge. In this case, a 60-year-old patient presented with acute-onset weakness starting in the right hand then sequentially involving the left leg, left hand, and right leg over 5 days. The asymmetric weakness was accompanied by persistent fever and elevated inflammatory markers. Subsequent development of rashes combined with careful review of the history led us to the final diagnosis and targeted treatment. This case highlights clinical pattern recognition with the help of electrophysiologic studies in peripheral neuropathies, which provide shortcuts to narrow the differential diagnosis. We also illustrate the important pitfalls from history taking to ancillary testing in diagnosing the rare but treatable cause of peripheral neuropathy (eFigure 1, links.lww.com/WNL/C541).

Clinical Manifestations

Visible skin ulceration and regional lymphadenopathy were seen among 215 (65.7%) participants (ulceroglandular tularemia), whereas 34 (10.4%) had isolated tender and enlarged lymph nodes (glandular tularemia; Table 1). Lymphadenopathy was located in the lower extremities in 156 (62.7%), the upper extremities (axilla or chest) in 39 (15.7%), the head/neck region in 41 (16.5%), and in an unspecified location in 13 (5.2%) cases. A single case of oculoglandular tularemia was reported. Eight participants reported a transient pharyngitis, but symptoms were otherwise not consistent with oropharyngeal tularemia. Twenty-four (7.3%) participants had persistent fever without localized symptoms, suggestive of typhoidal tularemia. Other symptoms included diarrhea and/or vomiting (n = 17; 5.2%) and headache (n = 84; 25.7%). Onset of primary lymphadenopathy and/or skin lesion and fever generally occurred within the same time frame (median, 0 days; IQR, −2 to +1 days).

Respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain) were described among 59 (18.0%) participants. Among these who had chest radiograph imaging, 25/40 (62.5%) had confirmed infiltrates and 5/40 (12.5%) cases had atypical imaging findings. Fifteen cases had confirmed infiltrates on computed tomography (CT) scans, with 14 scans reporting nodular infiltrates (5 involving multiple lobes), 4 suspected pulmonary abscesses, 8 enlarged thoracic lymph nodes > 10 mm, and 4 necrotic lymph nodes. Six CT reports were highly suspicious for malignancy, with 3 undergoing positron emission tomography/CT scanning, and 1 CT-guided lung biopsy. Fourteen (93.3%) cases underwent repeat CT of the chest with partial or complete resolution of infiltrates/lymph nodes. No malignancy was identified during follow-up.

Conclusions

This study is the first documentation of PFAPA with short intervals between flares of less than two weeks. This study shows, that in patients with frequent flares at presentation, flare frequency might be increased even further after introduction of abortive treatment with corticosteroids. Therefore, these patients may require closer follow-up, including earlier initiation of prophylactic treatment for PFAPA flares or tonsillectomy, for they are more likely to become extreme PFAPA.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^a45fe993]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease as differential diagnosis of monkeypox, Germany, August 2022 [^e92d05ff]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Lewis et al. recommend considering hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) as a differential diagnosis for monkeypox on the basis of a series of 9 patients from Argentina and Bolivia with suspicion of monkeypox, of which 3/9 patients had laboratory-confirmed monkeypox and 4/9 patients had HFMD. HFMD is common in young children worldwide. Symptoms are usually mild and transient and consist of influenza-like illness, oral sores or pustules, and a palmar and plantar rash. However, reports about atypical HFMD, which is characterized by severe symptoms, unusual localization of the rash, and occurrence in immunocompetent adults, have recently increased.

Like HFMD, monkeypox often clinically manifests with influenza-like symptoms and a pustular rash. As of September 2022, > 3,500 cases have been reported in Germany, and differential diagnosis and testing has become increasingly necessary.

We report a case of a 20-year-old man who sought evaluation for monkeypox at University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). Two days before, he began experiencing myalgias and fever, followed by a generalized rash with painful pustular lesions on the arms, hands, feet, mouth, scalp, and anus (Figure). He was taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis but had no concurrent conditions. He reported sexual contact with 2 male partners in the 14 days before symptom onset and had regularly visited his family in the previous 29 days, during which time multiple family members experienced influenza-like symptoms and a rash. The patient had called an urgent care provider the day before our evaluation and had been placed under quarantine for suspicion of monkeypox because of his clinical manifestations and medical history.

Figure
Painful pustular lesions on left foot (A) and hand (B) of a 20-year-old man 1 day after onset of influenza-like symptoms, Germany. PCR results were positive for enterovirus but negative for orthopoxvirus, confirming hand, foot, and mouth disease rather than monkeypox.

We swabbed anal, oral, and skin lesions and assessed the specimens for orthopoxvirus and enterovirus nucleic acids by PCR, which was positive for enterovirus but negative for orthopoxvirus, confirming HFMD. In conclusion, we support the suggestion to consider atypical HFMD as a differential diagnosis of monkeypox.

### PFAPA syndrome: a review on treatment and outcome [^8e34440b]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA syndrome) is the most common cause of periodic fever in childhood. The current pharmacological treatment includes corticosteroids, which usually are efficacious in the management of fever episodes, colchicine, for the prophylaxis of febrile episodes, and other medication for which efficacy has not been proven so far. Tonsillectomy is an option for selected patients. Usually PFAPA syndrome resolves during adolescence, but there is increasing evidence that this condition may persist into adulthood.

### Diagnosis of PFAPA syndrome applied to a cohort of 17 adults with unexplained recurrent fevers [^6b0eb404]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of PFAPA syndrome, mainly characterised by regularly recurring periodic fevers associated with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and/or lymphadenitis, and mostly occurring in the paediatric setting, resembles an acquired autoinflammatory disease. The description of PFAPA syndrome in adult patients is largely increasing.

Objectives

To recognise PFAPA syndrome in a group of adult patients evaluated for recurrent fevers in our Rheumatology Unit.

Methods

To apply current diagnostic criteria for PFAPA syndrome in a group of 359 adults with unexplained recurrent fevers monitored in our Unit between January 2007 and June 2011.

Results

We have found 17 out of 359 patients fulfilling the diagnosis of PFAPA syndrome: these patients (10 males, 7 females) were Caucasian with a mean age of 33.3 ± 9.5 years, had recurrent febrile episodes begun at a mean age of 25.9 ± 8.3 years and a mean number of episodes of 8.3 ± 5.2 per year with a mean duration of 5.5 ± 1.8 days. In particular, 7/17 patients had the 3 cardinal signs, the other 10 had a combination of 2 signs. Corticosteroids were given in 14/17 patients; tonsillectomy was performed in 9/17 patients: corticosteroid responsiveness and tonsillectomy efficacy were observed respectively in 11 and 2 patients.

Conclusions

Our case highlights the importance of considering PFAPA syndrome in adults presenting with unexplained recurrent fevers and symptoms commonly encountered in general medical practice.

### Periodic fevers with aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) [^5dc11182]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

PFAPA syndrome (acronym of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis) is the most common cause of periodic fever in childhood. Nowadays, it is considered part of the wide family of the autoinflammatory diseases, but a genetic or molecular marker hasn't been identified yet, therefore, its etiology is still unknown. Diagnosis is essentially based on clinical criteria but, especially in younger children, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate it from other hereditary periodic fever syndromes. Fever attacks in PFAPA have a spontaneous resolution and in a high rate of patients the syndrome ends spontaneously over time. Treatment is still a matter of debate. Usually a single administration of oral corticosteroids aborts attacks. Tonsillectomy may be an alternative option but its role remains to be clarified.

### Exuberant oral lesions in an immunocompromised patient [^5d01c5c7]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the etiological agent commonly associated with this disease?
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18
D. Herpes simplex virus 1
E. Epstein-Barr virus

Answers:
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32 — Incorrect. The HPVs 13 and 32 are low-risk oncogenic subtypes and related to Heck disease.
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4 — Incorrect. HPVs 2 and 4 are more associated to common warts present in the oral cavity.
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18 — Correct. HPV 6 and 11 are associated with a low oncogenic risk, while HPV 16 and 18 are related to a high oncogenic risk. These four HPV subtypes are commonly detected in oral condyloma accuminatum. The molecular analysis was positive for high-risk oncogenic deoxyribonucleic acid-human papillomavirus in the presented case.
D. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) — Incorrect. HSV-1 is an alphaherpesvirus, which causes an infection that is usually asymptomatic, affecting skin and mucosa. Gingivostomatitis is the most common manifestation of primary HSV (HSV-1) infection, mainly manifesting as multiple painful oral lesions, swollen gums, blisters, and sores. The lesions described are incompatible with those reported in this case, which were painless.
E. Epstein-Barr virus — Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus is a herpesvirus, which is widespread throughout the world. A typical clinical manifestation is infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis, an increase of cervical lymph nodes sensitivity and size, and moderate-to-high fever. The clinical findings are not compatible with those observed in the present case.

### Coxiella burnetii: an unusual ENT pathogen [^da6f228a]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2004). Low credibility.

Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, is a prevalent zoonotic disease manifestating usually as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis. We describe 2 cases of serologically proven infection by Coxiella burnetii whose primary manifestations arose from the upper respiratory tract and were initially referred to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) department. This is the first related report in medical literature. A 20-year-old woman with fever, bilateral tonsillitis, lymphadenopathy, and mild aminotransferase elevation, and a 30-year old man with spiking fever and laryngitis are presented. Diagnosis in both cases was achieved through evolving serological response to Coxiella burnetii. The importance of including the pathogen in the differential diagnosis of ENT patients, in assorted epidemiological settings, and the significance of the proper antibiotic selection are further discussed.

### Rare extrapulmonary complications of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection [^88cf580d]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Stevens-Johnsons syndrome (SJS) is a rare extra-pulmonary complication of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. We present the case of a 26-year-old man with fever, cough, extensive oral mucosal ulceration and a widespread truncal rash. He was diagnosed with M. pneumoniae-induced SJS. He responded well to antibiotics and steroids initially, but went on to develop pseudomembranous conjunctivitis requiring bilateral amniotic membrane grafting. SJS is most commonly drug-induced, however, M. pneumoniae is the commonest infectious cause and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. It is also important to get specialist care involved early to minimise the long-term effects of any complications.

Although acute immune-mediated lesions of the oral cavity (AIML) can have an onset over several months, they often demonstrate rapid onset and can be self-limited. Despite the self-limiting nature of some disorders, patients with AIML can have significant pain and multisystem involvement. It is vital for the oral health care provider to arrive at the proper diagnosis with distinction from overlapping conditions, as the oral manifestations may be harbingers of more serious systemic complications.

### Genital ulcers as an unusual sign of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome: a novel symptom? [^dc95e4af]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy (PFAPA) syndrome, which is characterized by periodic episodes of high fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis, is of unknown etiology and manifests usually before 5 years of age. A patient with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome simultaneously presenting with genital ulcers has not been reported previously. We describe a 12-year-old Chinese girl with a 2-year history of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome who exhibited vulvar ulcers accompanying an episode of febrile periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, and cervical adenopathy. Although during a 1-year follow-up this girl did not manifest typical symptoms/signs of Behçet's disease except recurrent oral aphthae and genital ulcers, it is possible that periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngotonsillitis, cervical adenopathy syndrome and Behçet's disease could have overlapping manifestations. Furthermore, this report would add to the evidence of a wide variation in the clinical symptomatology of PFAPA syndrome.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease: a rare but important differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy [^7cba540c]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 23-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of fevers, cervical lymphadenopathy and fatigue. A CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed left cervical lymphadenopathy, enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla and groin and hepatomegaly. A left cervical excisional lymph node biopsy was undertaken and the histopathological findings were consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. He was treated with high-dose prednisolone for 1 week, which was then tapered. Generalised arthralgia and daily episodes of malaise were experienced for a subsequent 2 months following the cessation of corticosteroids. The condition lasted 4 months from the onset of symptoms. This case report highlights the importance of including Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease has commonly been mistaken for tuberculosis and lymphoma, and unnecessary exposure to agents used to treat these conditions can be avoided by prompt histological diagnosis.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease: a review [^f5c6e5b9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare entity characterized by subacute necrotizing lymphadenopathy and frequently associated with fever. Young adults of Asian ancestry are most commonly affected, but it has been reported worldwide. Despite many studies in the literature, the cause of KFD remains uncertain. Histologically, KFD is characterized by paracortical lymph node expansion with patchy, well-circumscribed areas of necrosis showing abundant karyorrhectic nuclear debris and absence of neutrophils and eosinophils. Three evolving histologic patterns-proliferative, necrotizing, and xanthomatous-have been recognized. By immunohistochemistry, histiocytes in KFD are positive for myeloperoxidase. There is a marked predominance of T cells in the lesions (with mostly CD8-positive cells) with very few B cells. The differential diagnosis of KFD includes infectious lymphadenitis, autoimmune lymphadenopathy (primarily systemic lupus erythematosus), and lymphoma. Clinicians and pathologists are poorly familiar with this entity, which frequently causes significant diagnostic challenges.

### A 8-year Bangladeshi girl with disseminated histoplasmosis, presented as chronic liver disease with portal hypertension: a rare case report [^0f78029e]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Histoplasmosis was first described over a century ago by American physician Samuel Darling. It is primarily a pulmonary disease and soil is the environmental reservoir. It exist as mold in the environment. Two types of conidia as macroconidia (8–15 μm) and microconidia (2–4 μm) are formed. It occurs commonly in North and Central America but may presents in other parts around the world. Exposure to histoplasma is common in the population of endemicity, but symptomatic infection is uncommon. Pulmonary infection occurs by inhalation of microconidia, it may present as acute or chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. Patient may develope cough, sputum production, hemoptysis, dyspnea. Disseminated histoplasmosis may presents in various form, so difficult to diagnose. It experience asymptomatic hematogenous dissemination through the reticuloendothelial system via parasitized macrophages. The symptoms include fever, malaise, anorexia, weight loss. On physical findings patient may have anemia, lymphadenopathy, petechiae, mucous membrane ulceration, hepatosplenomegaly etc.

Disseminated histoplasmosis can present in different ways but jaundice and ascites is very uncommon. Disseminated form is common in immune compromised condition as infant, older age, HIV infection, transplant recipient, hematological malignancy or those on corticosteroids or TNF-α inhibitors therapy which are associated with increased risk of opportunistic infections. Disseminated form is the commonest presentation in infant and toddlers. Among this age group 60–80% patients has acute disseminated progressive disease.

We are reporting this case because our patient had strongly features of chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and another differential was disseminated tuberculosis. But finally she diagnosed as a case of disseminated histoplasmosis. This case emphasizes the need to keep disseminated histoplasmosis in differential diagnosis of children presenting with fever, jaundice, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^5e9d89e9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Lymphogranuloma venereum diagnostic considerations emphasize that a definitive LGV diagnosis can be made only with LGV-specific molecular testing (e.g. PCR-based genotyping); these tests can differentiate LGV from non–LGV C. trachomatis in rectal specimens but are not widely available, and results are not typically available in a time frame that would influence clinical management. Therefore, diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, epidemiologic information, and a C. trachomatis NAAT at the symptomatic anatomic site, with exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or genital, oral, or rectal ulcers. Genital or oral lesions, rectal specimens, and lymph node specimens can be tested for C. trachomatis by NAAT or culture, with NAAT the preferred approach because it can detect both LGV strains and non–LGV C. trachomatis strains. Therefore, all persons presenting with proctocolitis should be tested for chlamydia with a NAAT performed on rectal specimens.

### Consensus treatment plans for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA): a framework to evaluate treatment responses from the childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance (CARRA) PFAPA work group [^c3a80fbb]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The PFAPA Work Group defined patient inclusion characteristics (Table 1) that were slightly modified from the original proposed diagnostic criteria for PFAPA. First, the duration of fever attacks was defined as 3–7 days to avoid confusion with other autoinflammatory syndromes that may share some features with PFAPA but differ in their duration of febrile attacks, such as Familial Mediterranean Fever. Second, to exclude recurrent infections and malignancy, patients had to have had more than 6 stereotypical periodic febrile episodes. Exclusion of cyclic neutropenia is kept. Third, to ensure periodicity, these episodes had to occur with regularity, defined as a maximum variability of 1 week for fever cycles occurring at 2–4-week intervals and a maximum variability of 2 weeks for fever cycles occurring at 5–8-week intervals. Fourth, age of onset ≤ 5 years was omitted because only one-third of the physicians who responded to the preliminary survery considered young age mandatory for the diagnosis of PFAPA. 5,

Table 1
CTPs inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients with PFAPA

Four treatment strategies were defined based on the literature review, survey, and the process as described above:

1) Antipyretics during episodes; 2) Abortive treatment with corticosteroids; 3) Prophylaxis with colchicine or cimetidine; and 4) Surgical management with tonsillectomy (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Consensus treatment plans for PFAPA

To evaluate efficacy, outcome measures were defined by the Work Group (Table 2) using NGT. The primary outcome was resolution of fever, categorized as complete (no fevers for 3 months), partial (reduced total number of days with fever over a period of 3 months), and no response (no change or increase in total days of fever over a period of 3 months). The group agreed that a particular regimen should be trialed for 3 febrile episodes to determine efficacy and, if deemed not effective by the physician and/or family, changed to another arm. Quality of life will be measured by missed school days and parental global assessment using a visual analog scale (a unidimensional measure of a characteristic or attitude that cannot easily be directly measured and is frequently used in populations with rheumatic diseases).

### Penicillamine (Depen) [^145aa558]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The appearance of a drug eruption accompanied by fever, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, or other allergic manifestations usually requires discontinuation of penicillamine. Certain patients will develop a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) test and some of these may show a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome similar to drug-induced lupus associated with other drugs. The lupus erythematosus-like syndrome is not associated with hypocomplementemia and may be present without nephropathy. The development of a positive ANA test does not mandate discontinuance of the drug; however, the physician should be alerted to the possibility that a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome may develop in the future.

Some patients may develop oral ulcerations which in some cases have the appearance of aphthous stomatitis. The stomatitis usually recurs on rechallenge but often clears on a lower dosage. Although rare, cheilosis, glossitis, and gingivostomatitis have also been reported. These oral lesions are frequently dose-related and may preclude further increase in penicillamine dosage or require discontinuation of the drug.

Hypogeusia (a blunting or diminution in taste perception) has occurred in some patients. This may last two to three months or more and may develop into a total loss of taste; however, it is usually self-limited, despite continued penicillamine treatment. Such taste impairment is rare in patients with Wilson's disease.

### Atypical pulmonary manifestations suggestive of lung cancer in Behçet's disease with spontaneously regressing lymphadenopathy and a lung mass: a case report [^490796f0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by a wide range of systemic manifestations, including urogenital ulcers, arthritis, skin lesions, and inflammation of the eyes and vascular structures (1, 2). Although it can affect multiple organ systems, pulmonary involvement is relatively rare and generally manifests as pulmonary vascular lesions. Pulmonary manifestations occur in 1–7.7% of cases, with pulmonary artery aneurysms being the most common finding, often accompanied by thrombosis.

This report presents the case of a male with a 27-year history of BD who exhibited radiological features suggestive of lung cancer. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET-CT) of his chest revealed peribronchial tissue thickening, bronchial narrowing, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes, raising concerns about a potential malignancy. Despite the rarity of such presentations in BD, these findings highlight the importance of including BD in the differential diagnosis when encountering similar radiological abnormalities.

Case report

A 56-year-old East Asian male with a 27-year history of BD, characterized by recurrent oral ulcers, skin lesions, joint pain, and ocular abnormalities, was referred to our hospital following the new identification of right hilum enlargement in a recent chest X-ray. Imaging studies, including chest X-ray and CT performed 18 months earlier, showed no evidence of right hilar enlargement (Fig. 1 A and D). The patient, who had maintained a stable BD state on a consistent dose of 20 mg prednisolone for prior past 3 years, reported no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, or dyspnea. His medical history included stage 3 A colon cancer diagnosed approximately 18 months before, for which he underwent surgery and chemotherapy, achieving complete remission.

### Infectious complications with the use of biologic response modifiers in infants and children [^382a3492]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) — screening is not recommended, but NTM should be considered in the differential for patients on biologic response modifiers (BRMs) with compatible clinical presentations. There are no recommendations or tests at the present time for screening for NTM, and NTM should be considered in the differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses, cervical or unexplained lymphadenitis, other focal infections, or anytime tuberculosis is being considered.

### Kimura disease: unusual presentation in an African American male [^87c6d2e9]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Kimura disease was first described in the Chinese literature in 1937 as "eosinophilic hyperplastic lymphogranuloma" and later coined Kimura disease in 1948 after characterization by Kimura et alin the Japanese literature. Historically the disease has been reported to primarily affect young Eastern Asian males in the second or third decade of life. Because of the predominance in young Eastern Asian males, this disease is often not included in the differential diagnosis outside of this demographic. One reported case demonstrated delayed diagnosis of Kimura disease in a young male of African descent due to this very reason.

The most common reported clinical finding of Kimura disease is painless subcutaneous nodules that occur in the head and neck region, with atypical manifestations in the oral cavity. Patients often display eosinophilia on complete blood count in addition to lymphadenopathy. Rare occurrences of Kimura disease in African males have been previously reported in the epiglottisand hard palate. There have also been cases with associated pruritus with lesions of Kimura disease in older patients. In our case, the patient had associated tenderness with the lesion.

There have also been recent reports analyzing Kimura disease focusing specifically on age. A case series study included 238 patients and found that although Kimura disease was predominately diagnosed with a 17:1 male to female ratio in patients < 20 years old, patients diagnosed > 40 years of age had a 2:1 male to female ratio. Additionally, time to diagnosis was increased in older patients and clinical presentation involved more cases of associated pruritus compared with younger patients.

In this case, we report an African American male over 60 years of age diagnosed with Kimura disease. The patient presented with a somewhat tender 1 cm subcutaneous nodule of the left temple. Histopathologic sections showed lymph node tissue with open sinuses and increased capsular and interfollicular fibrosis. Abundant eosinophils were also present in interfollicular areas forming microabscesses, leading to the diagnosis of Kimura disease. Elevated eosinophils were in fact observed initially on the patient's complete blood count, but returned to normal levels after removal of the lesion.

### Periodic fever syndromes [^cba549fd]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Human autoinflammatory diseases (except for the periodic fever, adenopathy, pharyngitis, aphthae syndrom) are a heterogeneous group of genetically determined diseases characterized by seemingly unprovoked inflammation, in the absence of autoimmune or infective causes. Tremendous advances in the understanding of these disorders have been seen in the last decade. This article discusses hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes that are associated with recurrent fevers.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^ab0c3185]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 CLASSIC CLINICAL PRESENTATION

The incubation period of the infection ranges from 4 to 10 days. More than 90% of patients present with skin manifestations consisting of whitish papules on an erythematous inflammatory base appearing mainly within the area of virus inoculation (in recent outbreaks, such areas coincide with areas involved in sexual contact). Such erythema may not be noticeable in patients of color. The lesions have been termed pseudopustules as they are solid lesions containing no purulent material. Over the next few days, they develop central umbilication with subsequent centrifugally progressive necrosis until the entire lesion is covered (Figure 1a). Eventually, the necrotic crust falls off, leaving residual erythema or a varioliform scar. Some authors have compared the lesions to a flower in the so‐called Pansy sign. Ulcers in mucosal areas present with maceration and a dirty background(Figure 1b).

FIGURE 1
(a) Clustered pseudopustules at the base of the penis. Note the necrotic central ulceration in the larger lesion. (b) On mucosal surfaces, lesions may show a dirty nonspecific appearance.

Previous African endemic cases affected patients of different ages and both sexes, but during the 2022–2024 global outbreak, a dominant sexual route of transmission was identified. A predilection for men who have sex with men (MSM) has been found, as well as a higher frequency of lesions located in genital and perianal areas, compared with the more monomorphic patterns with truncal predominance and centrifugal spread previously seen in Africa. Furthermore, infection in the current outbreak has a better prognosis and higher infectivity. The most frequent systemic manifestations include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headache, and arthromyalgia. A nonnegligible percentage of cases have been associated with odynophagia, proctitis, and urethritis. Myocarditis, encephalitis, respiratory, and gastrointestinal disorders have been reported as systemic complications.

3.1 Solitary lesions

Between 8.5% and 11% of patients present with solitary lesions, most frequently located in the genital area. This presentation can be a diagnostic challenge and poses a differential diagnosis with other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis.

### Ecthyma associated withand [^c4ff1d3a]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

The patient is an 81-year-old man with hypertension and obesity who was admitted for management of acute pancreatitis. In the setting of narcotic-induced hypoventilation and obesity, the patient had respiratory failure requiring noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). On the seventh day of his hospital stay, he had a new 1.5-cm x 2.0-cm mildly tender necrotic ulcer on the bridge of his nose. The ulcer had an erythematous base and slightly indurated, erythematous border (Fig 1).

The patient denied headache, visual changes, epistaxis, cough, hematemesis, fevers, chills, night sweats, ocular pain, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, dysphagia, odynophagia, and stomatodynia. He denied recent foreign travel, insect bites, and exposure to animals. He had no history of HIV or tuberculosis infection.

Several infections were included in the differential diagnosis, including bacterial infections and mycobacterial infections. Because of the rapid progression of the lesion, the differential diagnosis included aggressive angioinvasive fungal infections such as zygomycosis. Vasculitic and vasculopathic causes were also considered in the setting of the patient's acute illness.

Two 3-mm punch biopsy sections were obtained from the indurated, inflamed edge of the eschar, including both affected and unaffected skin. Routine histology findings showed deep epidermal erosion, fibrin deposition, necrosis of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands with neutrophils, and evidence of bacteria within the erosion and papillary dermis. Tissue culture found heavy growth of β-lactamase-negative Moraxella species and heavy growth of S epidermidis. The patient did not have fever, bacteremia, or lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures were normal. The patient was started on a 2-week course of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 800 mg - 160 mg twice daily, and bacitracin-polymyxin B ointment topically twice daily. The ecthyma quickly resolved. He was seen in follow-up 2 months later, with a well-healed, 2-cm cicatrix without surrounding erythema (Fig 2).

### TB or not to be? Kikuchi-fujimoto disease: a rare but important differential for TB [^4fed1eb2]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old British Pakistani woman presented with a 2-month history of drenching fevers, night sweats, lethargy and tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Initial investigations, bloods and imaging were unremarkable. Fever persisted during her admission, and treatment for tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis was started postbiopsy until histology confirmed a diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease (KFD). KFD has a non-specific presentation of fever, night sweats and lymphadenopathy and commonly raises a clinical suspicion of a number of other serious conditions such as TB, lymphoma, HIV, systemic lupus erythematous, toxoplasmosis and infectious mononucleosis. Although rare, KFD should be considered to be a differential diagnosis for fever of unknown origin and tender lymphadenopathy in otherwise well individuals. This case demonstrates the importance of a timely histological biopsy diagnosis to prevent an incorrect diagnosis and administration of unnecessary medications.

### A case of likely acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis in a 17-year-old male presenting to general paediatrics [^7eb59ede]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present the case of a 17-year-old male with a sore throat, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral erythematous and enlarged tonsils, fever, joint pain, widespread tender purpuric nodules, ulcerative lesions and erythematous pustules. The diagnosis was initially unclear. He had raised neutrophils, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. His skin biopsy showed a neutrophilic dermatosis with superficial pustulosis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Most likely, the patient suffered from a rare condition called acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND). AFND is a very rare disorder of poorly understood aetiology, with only a few hundred reported cases in the literature. The complexity and rarity of this condition, and the difficulty in diagnosing, is an example of the challenge facing paediatricians as the paediatric admission age threshold increases to include older adolescents and young adults up to the age of 25 years, as per the National Health Service (NHS) long-term plan.

### Kikuchi's disease: a case report and review of the literature [^e623794b]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Kikuchi's disease is a necrotizing lymphadenitis that is prevalent in Asia and is being increasingly recognized in other areas of the world. It usually occurs in women in their late 20s or early 30s and manifests as a posterior cervical adenopathy. It resolves spontaneously, usually over a period of several weeks to 6 months. Its initial clinical appearance is commonly similar to that of a lymphoma, and it can be pathologically misdiagnosed as such. Kikuchi's disease might be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. We report a case of Kikuchi's disease that occurred in a 36-year-old Asian woman. We discuss the clinical features, differential diagnosis, radiographic evaluation, and pathology of this case, and we review the literature in an effort to assist otolaryngologists in diagnosing this benign and uncommon entity.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^5648e872]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) diagnosis — History alone can raise concern for IM, and clinicians are recommended to maintain a level of suspicion based on overall presentation; a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that signs and symptoms lack sensitivity, although splenomegaly, palatal petechiae, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy increased the likelihood; hematologic findings were more accurate and serologic testing is indicated; typical illness may include fever that can rarely exceed > 40°C or > 104°F and last up to 3 weeks; in a systematic review, lack of sore throat (sensitivity 0.81; Likelihood Ratio range 0.51–0.62) or lack of headache (sensitivity 0.66; LR range 0.63–0.73) reduced the likelihood of IM.
