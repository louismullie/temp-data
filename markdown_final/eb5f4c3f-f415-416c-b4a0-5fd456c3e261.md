## Question

Can a colonoscopy be performed by ingesting a camera to visualize the intestinal tract?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a colonoscopy can be performed by ingesting a camera to visualize the intestinal tract. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and whether "swallowing a camera" refers to colon capsule endoscopy versus traditional optical colonoscopy. Then, I should verify the technical capabilities and specifications of colon capsules. Next, I will review guideline positions to understand when this is recommended. After that, I need to check diagnostic performance characteristics from clinical studies. I should also examine bowel preparation requirements, because acceptability depends on prep burden. Then, I will assess key limitations, including lack of therapeutic intervention and risks like incomplete exams or retention. Finally, I will distinguish colon capsule from small-bowel capsule uses and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded bottom line.

> Let me first confirm terminology so we don't talk past each other. Traditional colonoscopy uses a flexible endoscope inserted per rectum to visualize and treat lesions throughout the colon, whereas "ingesting a camera" generally refers to capsule endoscopy; in the colorectal context this is specifically called colon capsule endoscopy (CCE), which is designed to visualize the colon after oral ingestion without endoscopic insertion, but it remains purely diagnostic and not interventional.

> I need to verify the technology details to be sure we're discussing contemporary devices. The second-generation colon capsule (CCE2, e.g. PillCam COLON2) is roughly 11–12 mm by 31–33 mm, has two cameras each with about a 172° field of view, adaptive frame rates, approximately 10 hours of battery life, and transmits images wirelessly to an external recorder for later review with software that can assist with polyp size estimation and image enhancement; this is indeed a swallowable device that traverses the colon via peristalsis without insufflation or sedation [^113TTACL] [^115nhBTY] [^115xM6Gn].

> Next, I should review guideline positions, and I need to be careful because recommendations differ across societies. The 2021 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) colorectal cancer screening guideline lists colon capsule endoscopy every 5 years as an acceptable alternative for individuals unwilling or unable to undergo colonoscopy or stool testing, placing it alongside options like CT colonography and multitarget stool DNA testing [^1127oGLR] [^114W83tX]. Hold on, I should verify positions from oncology guidelines; in contrast, the 2020 ESMO guideline recommends against using capsule colonoscopy for routine CRC screening, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty about its role in population screening programs [^111NW1Xa] [^111T637Z].

> Now I will examine performance characteristics. In a multicenter NEJM trial comparing capsule to optical colonoscopy, sensitivity for polyps ≥ 6 mm was 64% with specificity 84%, sensitivity for advanced adenomas was 73%, and 14 of 19 cancers were detected (74% sensitivity), with performance notably better when bowel cleanliness was good or excellent; completion within battery life occurred in about 93% of patients in that cohort [^111W7RtA]. Let me double-check earlier comparative work; an initial multicenter study also showed feasibility with moderate-to-good detection relative to colonoscopy, but again not equivalence to optical colonoscopy across all lesion sizes [^1153aiWD].

> Wait, let me verify the bowel preparation requirements, because patients often assume swallowing a camera means "no prep". Contrary to the idea of a "prepless" optical capsule, current CCE protocols require rigorous preparation — often more demanding than standard colonoscopy — including 1–2 days of polyethylene glycol–based cleansing with booster agents (e.g., sodium phosphate or ascorbic acid), fasting, and careful timing to optimize transit and cleanliness; low-volume PEG plus oral contrast regimens have been used in trials to balance efficacy and tolerability [^113TTACL] [^115nhBTY] [^114ZRJNq]. Hmm, wait a minute — some literature mentions a "prepless capsule", but I should clarify that this refers to a novel experimental X-ray–emitting capsule system that reconstructs 3D images with ultra-low radiation, which is not the standard optical CCE device used clinically for mucosal imaging [^1143inqx] [^116md6CJ] [^117H1ssU].

> I will now assess key limitations and contraindications to ensure clinical safety is front and center. CCE cannot perform real-time therapy — no biopsies, polypectomy, tattooing, or hemostasis — so any positive finding mandates subsequent optical colonoscopy for confirmation and treatment, which affects care pathways and resource use [^113TTACL]. Diagnostic yield depends heavily on prep quality and colonic motility; incomplete examinations can occur if the capsule fails to traverse the colon before battery depletion or if cleanliness is suboptimal, with completion rates variable across studies and strongly prep-dependent [^111W7RtA] [^111VRYXE]. I should double-check retention risk; while rare overall, capsule retention is a recognized complication in capsule endoscopy, with small-bowel data showing very low rates and guideline-supported strategies such as patency capsule use in obstructive-risk scenarios and conservative management if retention occurs, escalating to device-assisted enteroscopy when needed [^1116uJiu] [^116pJkaY] [^115GdRmX].

> Hold on, let me not conflate small-bowel and colon capsules. Most of the mature evidence base and guidelines for capsule endoscopy concern small-bowel indications such as obscure GI bleeding and suspected Crohn's disease; colon capsule is a distinct application with different prep, software, and validation status, and its role remains more selective and adjunctive rather than replacing colonoscopy [^116W5yXP] [^114LLTya]. I should confirm that distinction clearly, because extrapolating small-bowel performance or indications to the colon would be misleading in clinical decision-making.

> Next, I should review how CCE is used in practice scenarios. In FIT-positive pathways and incomplete colonoscopy, CCE has been explored as a triage imaging option and has shown acceptable detection with tailored prep regimens, but positive or suspicious results still route patients to therapeutic colonoscopy; comparisons with CT colonography suggest CCE can be competitive diagnostically in selected settings, though local expertise, availability, and patient factors drive test selection [^115nhBTY] [^113TTACL].

> Let me reconsider the overarching clinical comparison before concluding. Optical colonoscopy remains the gold standard because it combines high-definition visualization with the ability to biopsy and remove lesions in the same session, guided by quality-enhancing techniques and polypectomy best practices that cannot be replicated by a passive capsule at this time [^1136QcGK] [^111Koppu] [^114gusQN]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating equivalence; the moderate sensitivity of CCE for ≥ 6 mm lesions and its non-therapeutic nature underscore why guidelines either position it as an alternative for those who cannot or will not undergo colonoscopy or caution against routine screening use pending further evidence [^1127oGLR] [^114W83tX] [^111NW1Xa] [^111T637Z].

> Bottom line: Yes, you can "look at the colon by swallowing a camera" using colon capsule endoscopy, but it is not the same as a colonoscopy; it is a noninvasive, diagnostic-only modality with moderate sensitivity that requires extensive bowel prep, has variable completion dependent on cleanliness and motility, and any positive finding still requires optical colonoscopy for diagnosis and treatment, making it a complementary option for selected patients rather than a true replacement for colonoscopy [^113TTACL] [^111W7RtA] [^1127oGLR] [^111NW1Xa].

Yes, there is a swallowable camera for the intestinal tract: **capsule endoscopy** is a pill-sized device that captures images as it passes through the GI tract [^113TTACL] [^115BSfys]. It is **non-invasive** and does not require sedation or insufflation, but it cannot take biopsies or perform therapy [^114LLTya] [^114fwHB7]. Capsule endoscopy is mainly used for the **small bowel** (e.g. obscure bleeding, Crohn's disease) and as an alternative for colon evaluation when colonoscopy is incomplete or not tolerated [^114cYY4U] [^114nDpBC] [^1127oGLR] [^115nhBTY]. It is not a replacement for standard colonoscopy, which remains the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening and polyp removal [^1127oGLR] [^111T637Z] [^111W7RtA].

---

## Technology and procedure

Capsule endoscopy uses a **miniature camera** with a light source, batteries, and a wireless transmitter in a pill-sized capsule that the patient swallows; propelled by peristalsis, it captures images throughout the GI tract [^114MtcYS] [^113TTACL]. Images are transmitted to a patient-worn recorder for later clinician review [^113TTACL]. The procedure is **non-invasive**, requires no sedation or insufflation, and is generally more comfortable than traditional colonoscopy [^114LLTya]. The capsule is excreted naturally within 24–48 hours [^116tMu65] [^114fwHB7].

---

## Clinical indications

Clinical indications for capsule endoscopy include **small-bowel evaluation** for obscure GI bleeding, suspected Crohn's disease, small-bowel tumors, and celiac disease [^114cYY4U] [^114nDpBC] [^11581EaN] [^114fwHB7], as well as **colon evaluation** for patients unable or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy or when colonoscopy is incomplete [^1127oGLR] [^115nhBTY].

---

## Advantages and limitations

### Advantages

- **Non-invasive**: No sedation or insufflation required [^114LLTya].

- **Patient comfort**: Generally well tolerated [^1153aiWD].

- **Comprehensive imaging**: Visualizes the entire small bowel, which is difficult with traditional endoscopy [^114fwHB7] [^111gzwvL].

---

### Limitations

- **No therapeutic capability**: Cannot perform biopsies or remove polyps [^114LLTya].

- **Bowel preparation**: Requires thorough preparation for clear images [^113TTACL] [^114ZRJNq].

- **Capsule retention**: Rare risk, especially with strictures or obstructions [^115GdRmX] [^115sNfFC].

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Lower sensitivity for small polyps or flat lesions compared to colonoscopy [^111W7RtA] [^111VRYXE].

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend capsule endoscopy as an alternative for patients who cannot or will not undergo colonoscopy, or when colonoscopy is incomplete [^1127oGLR] [^114W83tX]. It is **not recommended as a primary screening tool** for colorectal cancer because traditional colonoscopy remains the gold standard [^111T637Z] [^1127oGLR].

---

## Recent advancements and future developments

Recent advancements include **improved image resolution**, longer battery life, and enhanced software to improve diagnostic accuracy [^113TTACL] [^115xM6Gn]. Future developments may add therapeutic capabilities — such as targeted drug delivery or biopsy tools — and integration with artificial intelligence for automated image analysis [^111G66Dy] [^116qdzkA].

---

Capsule endoscopy is a **non-invasive** alternative to traditional colonoscopy, providing comprehensive imaging of the intestinal tract. It is particularly useful for small bowel evaluation and as an alternative for colon evaluation when traditional colonoscopy is not feasible [^114cYY4U] [^1127oGLR]. However, it cannot replace traditional colonoscopy due to its inability to perform therapeutic interventions and its lower diagnostic accuracy for certain lesions [^1127oGLR] [^111W7RtA].

### Clinical utility of colon capsule endoscopy: A moving target [^113TTACL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The CCE2 capsule, with an approximate battery life of 10 hours, measures 11.6 mm × 31.5 mm. It is equipped with two cameras that have a 172° field of view and light-emitting diodes to illuminate the area surrounding the camera, along with bidirectional wireless communication technology. The adaptive frame rate of the cameras allows CCE2 to capture more images when the colon is in motion and fewer when it is stationary. The data recording device, approximately the size of a hand, comprises a small screen and a sensor lead connection socket. In addition to a real-time viewer, the recorder enables bidirectional communication with the capsule. Images transmitted wirelessly from the capsule are stored in the data recorder and, once the study is completed, can be downloaded to a workstation equipped with RAPID software for viewing. The software offers enhanced visualization of mucosal patterns and vasculature, featuring a polyp size estimation function and flexible spectral imaging color enhancement.

It is crucial to highlight that, while CCE is a non-invasive procedure, excellent visualization of polyps heavily depends on high-quality bowel preparation, which surpasses the regimens typically used for standard colonoscopy and CT colonography. The preparation involves a bowel cleansing protocol lasting one or two days, utilizing polyethylene glycol (PEG) along with additional booster preparations like sodium phosphate (NaP) or ascorbic acid. Furthermore, patients are required to adhere to a fasting period and abstain from consuming solid food for one or two days before undergoing CCE.

### Video capsule endoscopy of the small bowel [^114fwHB7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

It is now more than six years since capsule endoscopy was first introduced to the gastroenterological community. This disposable 26 x 11 mm video capsule, containing its own optical dome, light source, batteries, transmitter, and antenna, is swallowed with water following a 12-hour fast. The capsule is propelled via peristalsis through the gastrointestinal tract, capturing about 60,000 digital images, and is excreted naturally. Capsule endoscopy has become a first-line tool for detecting abnormalities in the small bowel since all other imaging technologies are rather ineffective. This review covers recent developments in capsule endoscopy technology and provides an update of its main indications.

- **Recent findings**: There are some clear indications for capsule endoscopy: obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected small bowel tumor (in which it is becoming a primary investigational tool), suspected Crohn's disease, surveillance of inherited polyposis syndromes, drug-induced small bowel injury, and any abnormal small bowel imaging. Controversy persists regarding what is a normal small bowel appearance, which is exacerbated by the inability to take biopsies and thus differentiate between entities; with technological advances, however, it is hoped that this will be addressed.

Capsule endoscopy has been incorporated into the gastroenterologists' daily life, changing the approach to many small bowel pathologies.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, specifically with respect to the choice of screening tests, the ACG 2021 guidelines recommend considering alternative screening modalities for individuals unable or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy or FIT. These alternatives include obtaining flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, a multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years, CT colonography every 5 years, or colon capsule endoscopy every 5 years.

### Capsule endoscopy: In search of the ideal image [^114ZRJNq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Capsule studies can be reviewed at varying rates and speeds; however, significant debris can be frustrating for the reviewer, much like excessive stool can hinder the progress of a colonoscopy. Numerous studies have been published regarding the advantages of ideal preparation in the setting of capsule endoscopy. The most recent study by Wei et al. demonstrated that colonic preparation, combined with simethicone given just prior to the capsule study, results in improved visibility of the mucosa. In theory, this leads to enhanced diagnostic ability and limits excessive reading duration.

### Octa-nonagenarians can perform video capsule endoscopy safely and with a higher diagnostic yield than 65–79-year-old patients [^1116uJiu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

True capsule retention was rare. Video capsules were cleared in abdominal X-rays performed in 17 out of 20 patients. Only one patient (0.2%) showed a retained capsule in the stomach on abdominal X-ray, necessitating EGD-assisted removal of the capsule from the stomach 28 days after the capsule swallowing, with no further adverse events. Two patients with delayed small bowel (SB) passage received verbal and written instructions to complete an abdominal X-ray and return for follow-up, but did not return to our hospital. Thus, data regarding their X-ray findings and outcomes were not available for analysis. To our knowledge, no patient required hospitalization or surgical intervention, and no deaths were recorded.

Twenty patients (4.1% aged 65–79 years vs. 2.2% aged ≥ 80 years, p = 0.385) completed a successful patency (dissolvable) capsule study prior to the video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Indications for patency capsule included suspected strictures (11 patients aged 65–79 years vs. one patient aged ≥ 80 years), known SB polyps/tumor (one patient aged 65–79 years, one patient aged ≥ 80 years), and prior intestinal surgery (six patients aged 65–79 years).

Gastric and SB transit times were comparable between the two groups (gastric: 65–79 years old 32.6 ± 37.1 vs. ≥ 80 years old: 33.8 ± 30.9 min, p = 0.775; SB: 65–79 years old 244.4 ± 84.9 vs. ≥ 80 years old 249.2 ± 94.9 min, p = 0.635) (Figure 2). In fact, there was no correlation between age in years and gastric transit time (r = 0.014, p = 0.752) or age in years and SB transit time (r = 0.032, p = 0.465).

### A novel prepless X-ray imaging capsule for colon cancer screening [^116md6CJ]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Bowel preparation remains a major obstacle limiting complete uptake of colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. Therefore, any test that does not require preparation would likely increase compliance. However, the accuracy to depict cancers and adenomas should not suffer substantially. A new X-ray capsule has been shown in a series of proof-of-concept studies to be safe and effective in 3D reconstruction of the colonic wall and lumen, including identifying adenomatous polyps.

The capsule system includes a short-lived radioisotope within a collimator housing that emits three X-ray beams in all directions by way of a rotating miniature electric motor as the capsule scans the length of the gastrointestinal tract. A small volume of ingested radiopaque contrast agent enhances the contrast of the colon's walls and differentiates them from stool content. Compton backscattered photons, attenuated by the contrast agent mixed with the colon contents, and X-ray fluorescence photons emitted from the contrast agent are detected by sensors in the capsule and analyzed by on-board electronics and embedded software to estimate the distance from the capsule to the colon wall. These estimations are used to perform 3D image reconstruction of the colon lumen and outer wall.

As the capsule progresses, the system generates an instantaneous track of the capsule position and orientation along the colon, with an accuracy of ± 1 cm. This is achieved using additional sensors in the capsule, including a 3D accelerometer and a 3D magnetometer, allowing the clinician to localize effectively.

### Wireless capsule endoscopy [^114LLTya]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has established itself as a valuable test for imaging the small intestine. It is a safe and relatively easy procedure to perform, providing valuable information in the diagnosis of small-bowel conditions. However, its applications remain limited within the esophagus and colon. Future developments may include improving visualization within the esophagus and developing technologies that allow manipulation of the capsule within the GI tract as well as biopsy capabilities.

### Metastatic breast cancer presenting as an incidental colon polyp on screening colonoscopy [^113rTHYx]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Metastatic spread of breast cancer to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is uncommon. When it does occur, it is typically associated with invasive lobular carcinoma and most often involves the stomach and intestinal wall, though the colon may be involved in rare instances. We present a unique case of metastatic breast cancer diagnosed via a colonic polyp found during routine screening colonoscopy. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of metastatic breast cancer.

### Aspects of colorectal cancer screening, methods, age and gender [^1136QcGK]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Although colonoscopy is an excellent tool for detecting and treating lesions in the colon, it must be conducted with high accuracy during screening. Failing to do so can lead to potential harm, including the recognized risks of perforation and bleeding, which may result in lethal complications. Thus, screening procedures should be performed by highly trained colonoscopists, making systematic training essential and effective. Recent findings from the Polish program indicate that even when all lesions are removed during a screening colonoscopy, the risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) remains if lesions are larger than 20 mm. Conversely, smaller lesions are associated with a decreased risk compared to those with no lesions. In recent years, despite colonoscopy being the gold standard, the risk of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancers (PCCRC) is as high as 10% and often depends on the quality of the procedure.

- **CT colonoscopy**: The CT colonoscopy technique has developed immensely and is now excellent. However, its major drawback is similar to that of traditional colonoscopy: the bowel must be cleaned using the same methods, a tiresome and often unpleasant procedure. Furthermore, CT colonoscopy provides examination capabilities whereby the images can be re-examined, unlike optical colonoscopy, but it does not allow for treatment. Several studies comparing these two methods conclude that optical colonoscopy has many advantages.

### Wireless capsule endoscopy [^114MtcYS]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Gastroscopy, small bowel endoscopy, and colonoscopy are uncomfortable due to the use of comparatively large diameter flexible cables that must be pushed into the bowel. These cables carry light via fibreoptic bundles, power, and video signals. Small bowel endoscopy is particularly limited by issues of discomfort and the inability to advance enteroscopes far into the small bowel. There is a clinical need for improved methods to examine the small bowel, especially in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding from this site.

### New vision in video capsule endoscopy: Current status and future directions [^111G66Dy]. Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Now, more than 10 years after the approval of video capsule endoscopy (VCE), the technology has become an essential component in the management of several clinical conditions. Currently, two capsules are approved in the United States for visualizing the small bowel mucosa, one capsule is authorized for oesophageal assessment, and several others are in use or under evaluation worldwide. New investigations have focused on optical improvements, advances in intestinal cleansing, and risk-reduction strategies to optimize VCE methodologies in clinical care.

Established indications diagnosed using VCE include unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel Crohn's disease (in adults and children > 10 years old), localization of small bowel tumours, and a broad range of miscellaneous abnormalities. Investigations are ongoing to determine the utility of VCE in colon cancer screening, assessment of oesophageal disorders, and diagnosis of coeliac disease.

Active research is in progress into ways to improve the efficacy of VCE recording interpretation, prolong imaging time, and further enhance optics and imaging methods. To expand the potential utility of VCE, novel devices that can manoeuvre within or insufflate the gut lumen, tag or biopsy suspect lesions, or target drug delivery to specific sites are in development. To facilitate these advances, consortia have been organized to promote innovative VCE technologies.

### A novel prepless X-ray imaging capsule for colon cancer screening [^1143inqx]. Gut (2016). High credibility.

The demand for bowel cleansing hampers participation in screening colonoscopy, while poor preparation impairs adenoma detection. A novel prepless X-ray imaging capsule is presented for colon screening; the capsule emits low-dose X-rays scattered by an ingested contrast agent mixed with colon contents and sensed by detectors in the capsule. This process generates high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imagery of the colon without the need for bowel cleansing.

Following preliminary studies with implanted polyps in synthetic colon phantoms, bovine cadaver and live swine, and human experiments with dummy capsules (n = 75), 49 patients swallowed the capsule, with natural excretion occurring in 48 patients after 73.2 ± 45.4 hours. Pedunculated and sessile polyps were clearly seen and validated by subsequent colonoscopy. The total radiation exposure was ultra low at 0.03 ± 0.007 mSv.

### Capsule endoscopy and imaging tests in the elective investigation of small bowel disease [^116kcTsM]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Capsule endoscopy enables high-resolution depiction of small bowel mucosa and has been shown by several studies to have a high diagnostic yield in a variety of small bowel diseases. In this review, we critically assess the contributions of capsule endoscopy and imaging tests in common small bowel disorders. Radiological tests that only assess the small bowel mucosa will be less useful in the era of capsule endoscopy.

### Prospective study of factors important to achieve observation of the entire colon on colon capsule endoscopy [^1134ZF2W]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Colonoscopy (CS) is the gold standard for diagnosing colorectal diseases, such as colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. However, performing a complete CS can be challenging in some patients, and others hesitate to undergo the procedure. The cecal intubation rates for CS are reportedly 85–95%, and alternative procedures may be suggested for patients with incomplete CS.

Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) involves swallowing a capsule to facilitate observation of the lumen of the entire digestive tract. It does not require an air supply and is a noninvasive procedure with a markedly low risk of adverse events compared to conventional CS. CCE reduces patient stress and may be more acceptable to patients.

Another option for colorectal examination is computerized tomography (CT) colonography (CTC). The sensitivity and specificity of CTC are high for the diagnostic yield of colorectal polyps, suggesting its usefulness. However, a study indicated that the sensitivity and specificity of CCE for colorectal polyp detection were favorable in patients with incomplete CS, with a higher detection rate than CTC. As such, the demand for CCE has been increasing, and its role will become more important in the future.

### Oxycontin [^11751vPY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Difficulty in swallowing and risk for obstruction in patients at risk for a small gastrointestinal lumen**: There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OxyContin tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation, and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet OxyContin tablets prior to placing them in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth. There have been rare post-marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders, such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen, are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider the use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen.

- **Risks of use in patients with gastrointestinal conditions**: OxyContin is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in OxyContin may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.

- **Increased risk of seizures in patients with seizure disorders**: The oxycodone in OxyContin may increase the frequency of seizures.

### Piezo acts in an intestinal valve to regulate swallowing in C. elegans [^116xeAAA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

C. elegans exhibits a relatively simple digestive tract consisting of distinct anatomical and functional organs, including the mouth, pharynx, and intestine, allowing efficient and elaborate feeding and digestion of bacterial food. Ingested bacteria are ground and transported by pharyngeal pumping and peristalsis to the intestine, where further digestion and nutrient absorption occur. An additional valve-like organ or structure in the digestive tract, referred to as the pharyngeal-intestinal valve (PI valve), physically connects the pharynx to the intestine. This structure is anatomically analogous to the esophagus in vertebrates and appears to act as a barrier to control food flow. However, the precise roles of the PI valve in the C. elegans digestive system have not been explored. Furthermore, it is intriguing to decipher whether interoception is involved in the digestive system of C. elegans and, if so, which molecular sensors play a role. Here we find that the PI valve detects intestinal distension caused by food accumulation via pezo-1, a C. elegans ortholog of PIEZO channels, and triggers pharyngeal plunge to move food down to the intestine.

### Gattex [^113u2KVi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to assess safety**: A follow-up colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy (or alternate imaging) is recommended at the end of one year of Gattex treatment. If no polyp is found, subsequent colonoscopies and upper GI endoscopies (or alternate imaging) should be performed no less frequently than every five years. If a polyp is found, adherence to polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended [see warnings and precautions (5.1)].

- **Colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy in pediatric patients**: Perform subsequent fecal occult blood testing annually in pediatric patients while they are receiving Gattex. If there is new or unexplained blood in the stool, perform a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy [see warnings and precautions (5.1)]. Colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is recommended for all pediatric patients after one year of treatment and every five years thereafter while on continuous treatment with Gattex. Consider upper GI endoscopy (or alternate imaging) during treatment with Gattex [see warnings and precautions (5.1)].

- **Laboratory testing**: Laboratory assessments are recommended every six months. If any clinically meaningful elevation is observed, further diagnostic workup is recommended as clinically indicated (e.g. imaging of the biliary tract, liver, or pancreas) [see warnings and precautions (5.1), (5.3)].

- **Discontinuation of treatment**: Discontinuation of treatment with Gattex may result in fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Monitor fluid and electrolyte status in patients who discontinue Gattex treatment [see warnings and precautions].

### New imaging techniques and opportunities in endoscopy [^114zVQFq]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal endoscopy is undergoing major improvements, which are driven by new available technologies and substantial refinements of optical features. In this review, we summarize available and evolving imaging technologies that could influence the clinical algorithm of endoscopic diagnosis. Detection, characterization, and confirmation are essential steps required for proper endoscopic diagnosis. Optical and non-optical methods can help to improve each step; these improvements are likely to increase the detection rate of neoplasias and reduce unnecessary endoscopic treatments. Furthermore, functional and molecular imaging are emerging as new diagnostic tools that could provide an opportunity for personalized medicine, in which endoscopy will define disease outcome or predict the response to targeted therapy.

### Capsule endoscopy versus colonoscopy for the detection of polyps and cancer [^111W7RtA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

An ingestible capsule consisting of an endoscope equipped with a video camera at both ends was designed to explore the colon. This study compared capsule endoscopy with optical colonoscopy for the detection of colorectal polyps and cancer.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective, multicenter study comparing capsule endoscopy with optical colonoscopy (the standard for comparison) in a cohort of patients with known or suspected colonic disease for the detection of colorectal polyps or cancer. Patients underwent an adapted colon preparation, and colon cleanliness was graded from poor to excellent. We computed the sensitivity and specificity of capsule endoscopy for polyps, advanced adenoma, and cancer.

- **Results**: A total of 328 patients (mean age, 58.6 years) were included in the study. The capsule was excreted within 10 hours after ingestion and before the end of the lifetime of the battery in 92.8% of the patients. The sensitivity and specificity of capsule endoscopy for detecting polyps that were 6 mm in size or bigger were 64% (95% confidence interval, 59 to 72) and 84% (95% CI, 81 to 87), respectively, and for detecting advanced adenoma, the sensitivity and specificity were 73% (95% CI, 61 to 83) and 79% (95% CI, 77 to 81), respectively. Of 19 cancers detected by colonoscopy, 14 were detected by capsule endoscopy (sensitivity, 74%; 95% CI, 52 to 88). For all lesions, the sensitivity of capsule endoscopy was higher in patients with good or excellent colon cleanliness than in those with fair or poor colon cleanliness. Mild-to-moderate adverse events were reported.

### Feasibility study of a new magnetic resonance imaging mini-capsule device to measure whole gut transit time in paediatric constipation [^116H7V67]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

This was an open-label, feasibility, case-control study conducted in a university setting. The intervention mirrored a common X-ray ROM protocol. The underlying principle was to load the gastrointestinal tract with repeated daily doses of multiple markers, achieving a steady state, and then image the marker locations in the GI tract at predetermined intervals. Various versions of this protocol have been proposed; we employed the one involving three daily doses of 24 markers each, a method also used in the common Sitzmarks ROMs product.

Participants were instructed to swallow 24 mini-capsules each morning at home over three consecutive days, totaling 72 mini-capsules. These could be mixed in yoghurt or swallowed with water or fruit juice. Participants underwent a short MRI scan on day four. If mini-capsules remained visible in the bowel, a second MRI scan was conducted on day seven. Should the capsules still be present, a third MRI scan was performed between days 26 to 28. This last scan was not part of the WGTT test but aimed to gather data on potential mini-capsule retention.

EuroQoL Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) questionnaire data were collected at baseline and daily throughout the study (from day 0, before taking the mini-capsules, to day 8). Additionally, EQ-5D-Y data were collected at baseline. This questionnaire assesses health-related life domains such as mobility, self-care, and pain. The lowest possible score for the EQ-5D-Y is 1,1,1,1,1, indicating no issues in any of the five domains.

### A brave new world for capsule-based colonic investigations [^116qdzkA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) has evolved from its initial applications into a transformative diagnostic tool for colorectal pathology, bridging gaps in clinical capabilities with innovative imaging and sensor technologies. Despite challenges, this technology represents a cornerstone for future non-invasive diagnostics.

Recent technological advancements have introduced several new tools for investigating the colon. Capsule-based platforms have expanded clinical indications and improved diagnostic capabilities. Although these technologies' full potential has yet to be realized, clinicians can now address previously unattainable challenges due to their application. It has been nearly 20 years since the introduction of the first CCE. This special collection presents a compelling overview of how capsule-based platforms have revolutionized — and continue to do so — the field of colonic investigation.

### Prospective study of factors important to achieve observation of the entire colon on colon capsule endoscopy [^111VRYXE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The morbidity and mortality rates of colorectal cancer remain high. To prevent colorectal cancer development and related deaths, it is important to undergo colorectal examination positively. The sensitivity and specificity of second-generation CCE for detecting colorectal polyps measuring ⩾6 mm is 63–91% and 64–94%, respectively; this procedure proves to be useful. On the other hand, several issues have been raised that need clinical resolution. In particular, the most important issue is that the entire colon observation rate (excretion rate, completed CCE rate) is not 100%. A potential method for improving completed CCE rates is to identify patients who are most suitable for this procedure. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to clarify factors important to achieve completion of CCE.

### Colon capsule endoscopy versus CT colonography in FIT-positive colorectal cancer screening subjects: A prospective randomised trial-the VICOCA study [^115nhBTY]. BMC Medicine (2020). High credibility.

After colonoscopy, any relevant therapeutic procedures were undertaken if necessary. Subsequently, patients were followed at an outpatient clinic to detect any potential adverse event appearing within 30 days of colonoscopy.

- **Colon capsule endoscopy**: Colon capsule endoscopy retrieves images of the entire colon in a minimally invasive manner without the need for insufflation. It is an 11 × 33 mm long device swallowed by the patient that traverses the entire digestive tube with the help of normal peristaltic movements.

- **Device used**: The second-generation CCE used in this study (PillCam® COLON2 Capsule Endoscopy; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) has two cameras, one at each end, with a 172-degree angle in each camera. The Rapid software, versions 7 and 8, includes a 'polyp size estimation software' that calculates the polyp length by moving the cursor from one end of the polyp to the other.

- **Preparation and evaluation**: The CCE preparation included a low-volume laxative solution (Moviprep®: PEG-3350, sodium sulphate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid for oral solution; Norgine B. V, UK) combined with Gastrografin® (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution USP; Berlimed SA, Madrid, Spain). The cleansing level was evaluated based on a previously validated scale and classified as poor (large amount of faecal residue), fair (enough residue to preclude a completely reliable examination), good (small amount of residue, not enough to interfere with examination), and excellent (no more than small bits of adherent faeces) for each colonic segment. Examinations scored as 'poor' were not considered reliable.

### Diagnosing small bowel Crohn's disease with wireless capsule endoscopy [^113UbdGE]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

The small bowel is the most commonly affected site of Crohn's disease (CD), although it may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. The methodologies for examining the small bowel include X-ray and endoscopy.

- **Aims**: To evaluate, for the first time, the effectiveness of wireless capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected CD of the small bowel that was undetected by conventional modalities, and to determine the diagnostic yield of the M2A Given Capsule.

- **Patients**: Seventeen patients (eight males, mean age 40 years, SD 15) with suspected CD fulfilled the study entry criteria. Nine had iron deficiency anemia (mean hemoglobin 10.5 g%, SD 1.8); eight experienced abdominal pain, seven had diarrhea, and three had weight loss. Small bowel X-ray and upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopic findings were normal. The mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 6.3 years (SD 2.2).

- **Methods**: Each subject swallowed an M2A Given Capsule containing a miniature video camera, batteries, a transmitter, and an antenna. Recording time was approximately eight hours. The capsule was excreted naturally in the patient's bowel movement, and the data it contained were retrieved and interpreted the next day.

- **Results**: Of the 17 study participants, 12 (70.6%, six males, mean age 34.5 years, SD 12) were diagnosed as having CD of the small bowel according to the findings of the M2A Given Capsule.

- **Conclusions**: Wireless capsule endoscopy diagnosed CD of the small bowel, with a diagnostic yield of 71%. It was demonstrated as being an effective modality for diagnosing patients with suspected CD undetected by conventional methods.

### An overview of emerging smart capsules using other-than-light technologies for colonic disease detection [^116E66fs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

After rigorous clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the PillCam® capsule endoscopy system emerged as the first commercially available CE technology. Its impact has been profound, introducing a minimally invasive and patient-centric approach to diagnosing and monitoring GI conditions, particularly those elusive to traditional diagnostic methods, such as those affecting the small intestine. In 2006, Given Imaging Ltd. further expanded the capabilities of CE by introducing the inaugural generation of a colon exploration capsule, marking a significant stride in the evolution of this transformative technology. This development is built upon the existing small bowel and esophageal capsules, broadening diagnostic possibilities within the GI tract. Known as CCE-1 or the PillCam COLON, this pioneering capsule measured 11 mm × 31.5 mm. It was equipped with two cameras featuring a remarkable 156° angle of view on both sides, enhancing its ability to capture comprehensive images of the colon. Subsequently, the domain of colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) continued to advance with the introduction of CCE-2, the second-generation system known as the PillCam COLON2. This updated capsule represented a significant leap forward in specifications and technical capabilities. Albeit with the exact dimensions, it boasted an expanded angle of view of 172° for both imagers, effectively covering nearly 360° of the colon. During motion, the CCE-2 captured images at 35 frames per second (fps), adjusting to 4 fps while stationary to conserve battery power without compromising image quality.

### Biochromoendoscopy: Molecular imaging with capsule endoscopy for detection of adenomas of the GI tract [^11682prZ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Capsule endoscopy (CE) provides minimally invasive technology for GI imaging but has limited ability to discriminate different types of polyps. Near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) probes activated by biomarkers upregulated in adenomas (e.g. cathepsin B) are potentially powerful tools to distinguish premalignant or malignant lesions from benign or inflammatory lesions.

- **Objectives**: To examine whether CE can be integrated with NIRF probes to detect adenomas and whether cathepsin B-activated NIRF probes are activated by benign or inflammatory lesions.

- **Design**: Mouse models of adenomas, hyperplastic/lymphoid polyps, and acute or chronic intestinal inflammation were injected intravenously with a cathepsin B-activated probe (Prosense 680). Dissected intestines were imaged with CE under white or NIRF light. For NIRF excitation (680 nm), dichroic and emission (700 nm) filters were combined with CE when images were recorded. Prosense 680 samples with or without protease were used as positive and negative controls. CE-based imaging data were verified using an independent imaging system (Xenogen IVIS system).

- **Main outcome measurements**: Proof of principle that CE integrated with NIRF probes can detect and discriminate adenomas from other lesions.

- **Results**: CE-based NIRF imaging with Prosense 680 readily visualized adenomas, including in the colitis model. NIRF signals of different intensities were detected. Prosense 680 was not activated by benign or inflammatory lesions.

- **Limitation**: Optical filters external to the capsule were used.

- **Conclusions**: We demonstrate proof of principle that CE integrated with NIRF probes can detect and discriminate adenomas from other lesions.

### An overview of emerging smart capsules using other-than-light technologies for colonic disease detection [^115xM6Gn]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Furthermore, the CCE-2 featured an extended operating duration of approximately 10 hours. It incorporated a power-saving 'sleep' mode activated upon ingestion to enhance energy efficiency, ensuring that battery life would be conserved until the capsule reached the colon. In recent years, multiple other manufacturers have also entered the market, offering double-domed capsules for colon examination. This expansion of industry players underscores the field's ongoing advancements, progress, and clinical interest.

- **Available types of colon capsule endoscopes and operating characteristics**: As exciting as these advancements are, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of conventional white light (WL) CE. While CE has played a pivotal role in visualizing the digestive tract, offering valuable insights into mucosal inspection, it has often encountered challenges in providing the detailed and specific information necessary for early disease detection and the precise characterization of anomalies. The introduction of WL imaging CE has sparked extensive research to enhance its diagnostic capabilities by integrating other sensing modalities. These developments can address the limitations of WL imaging by improving the detection of subtle mucosal microlesions and submucosal or transmural pathology, thereby opening novel diagnostic possibilities. Additionally, researchers are exploring incorporating various sensors to measure physiological parameters and discover new biomarkers.

### Capsule enteroscopy and radiology of the small intestine [^111gzwvL]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

In a few years, the video capsule for small bowel enteroscopy has gained widespread clinical acceptance. It is readily ingested, disposable, and allows for a complete, low-invasive endoscopic examination of the entire mucosa of the small bowel. It is a patient-friendly method and a first-line procedure in the difficult evaluation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. It has the highest proven diagnostic sensitivity for detecting lesions of the mucosa, irrespective of aetiology. However, the limitations of capsule endoscopy include difficulty in localizing mucosal lesions anatomically and its restricted use in patients with dysphagia, strictures, or motor dysfunction. Strictures, transmural, and extra-mural lesions in patients with small bowel Crohn's disease are evaluated by MRI-enterography and CT-enterography.

### Feasibility and safety of a novel magnetic-assisted capsule endoscope system in a preliminary examination for upper gastrointestinal tract [^112YE4Dh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Capsule endoscopy procedures are ineffective for upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract examination because they do not allow for operator-controlled navigation of the capsule. External controllability of a capsule endoscope with an applied magnetic field is a possible solution to this problem. We developed a novel magnetic-assisted capsule endoscope (MACE) system to visualize the entire upper GI tract. The present study evaluated the safety and feasibility of the MACE system for the examination of the upper GI tract, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.

- **Methods**: The present open clinical study enrolled ten healthy volunteers. All participants swallowed a MACE, and an external magnetic field navigator was used for magnetic capsule manipulation in the upper GI tract. We assessed the maneuverability of the magnetic capsule and the completeness of the MACE examination as well as the safety and tolerability of the procedure.

- **Results**: The present study enrolled ten healthy volunteers with a mean age and body mass index of 47.7 years and 25.6 kg/m², respectively. One volunteer withdrew because of difficulty in swallowing the capsule. In total, nine volunteers underwent the MACE examination. The average examination time was 27.1 minutes. The maneuverability of the capsule was assessed as good and fair in 55.6% and 44.4% of the participants, respectively. The overall completeness of the examination in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was 100%, 85.2%, and 86.1%, respectively. No severe adverse events occurred during this study. All participants…

### Technology insight: Current status of video capsule endoscopy [^115BSfys]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is the most recent major practical and conceptual development in the field of endoscopy. The video capsule endoscope — a small, pill-sized, passive imaging device — has been demonstrated to be the pre-eminent imaging device for disorders of the small intestine. Initially, VCE was employed to detect the origin of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Several other indications have now been justified or are in the process of evaluation. Over 200,000 of these disposable devices have been used worldwide, with an extraordinarily good safety record; indeed, the device has been approved for use in children as young as 10 years of age.

In addition, a double-ended capsule has now been approved for the evaluation of mucosal disease in the esophagus. The now-widespread deployment of the device into gastrointestinal practice in the US and many other countries suggests that VCE has achieved mainstream utility. The development of similar competitor devices and devices whose movement can be controlled is in progress.

### Invega [^115fsaf5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Potential for gastrointestinal obstruction**: Because the INVEGA® tablet is non-deformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the gastrointestinal tract, INVEGA® should ordinarily not be administered to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). This includes conditions such as esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, "short gut" syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or Meckel's diverticulum. There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures associated with the ingestion of drugs in non-deformable controlled-release formulations. Due to the controlled-release design of the tablet, INVEGA® should only be used in patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17.8)].

	- A decrease in transit time, such as seen with diarrhea, would be expected to decrease bioavailability, whereas an increase in transit time, as seen with gastrointestinal neuropathy, diabetic gastroparesis, or other causes, would be expected to increase bioavailability. These changes in bioavailability are more likely when the changes in transit time occur in the upper GI tract.

### Octa-nonagenarians can perform video capsule endoscopy safely and with a higher diagnostic yield than 65–79-year-old patients [^111u1gsm]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

Indications for referral were most commonly for anemia/obscure occult gastrointestinal bleeding, accounting for 63.4% of cases in both age groups (65–79 years old — 62.8% vs. ≥ 80 years old — 66.3%, p = 0.554). Suspected or established Crohn's disease was the second most common indication and was three times more prevalent in the 65–79-year-old group compared to the ≥ 80-year-old group [76/443 (17.2%) vs. 5/92 (5.4%), respectively, p = 0.004]. Most patients were referred for investigation of chronic diarrhea and suspected Crohn's disease (65–79 years old 66/76 (86.8%) vs. ≥ 80 years old 4/5 (80%), p = 0.528); only 10 patients in the 65–79-year-old group and one patient in the ≥ 80-year-old group had already been diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The prevalence of obscure overt bleeding as an indication for investigation was 2.5-fold higher in the ≥ 80-year-old group compared to the 65–79-year-old group (25% vs. 9.9%, p < 0.001).

- **Completion rates and transit times**: Complete small bowel endoscopy was achieved in 515 out of 535 video capsule endoscopies (VCEs), indicating a 96.3% completion rate. VCE completion rates were similar between age groups (65–79 years old — 96.8% vs. ≥ 80 years old — 93.5%, p = 0.132). Among the 20 incomplete VCEs, 15 were last documented in the small bowel (65–79 years old (2.3%) vs. ≥ 80 years old (5.4%), p = 0.154), and 5 were last documented in the stomach (four patients — 65–79 years old (0.9%) vs. one patient ≥ 80 years old (1.1%), p = 1.000). Three of the 15 patients with delayed small bowel passage had normal passage (two patients from the 65–79 years old group and one patient from the ≥ 80 years old group).

### Randomized trial of a video headset vs. a conventional video monitor during colonoscopy [^114iaE7h]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Head-mounted video displays have recently become available for endoscopy. This study compared a video headset with a conventional monitor during colonoscopy. Five endoscopists were randomized to use a headset or a monitor during the procedures. They completed a questionnaire assessing image quality, procedure characteristics, and comfort. Additionally, medication use and procedure duration were recorded.

A total of 96 colonoscopies were performed. Image quality and comfort were rated as poorer during headset use (p < 0.05). However, neck strain was significantly reduced with the headset. Medication use and total procedure time were similar. There was a trend toward increased time to reach the cecum with the headset (9.8 vs. 8.0 minutes, p = 0.055).

In conclusion, this randomized study comparing a video headset and a conventional monitor for colonoscopy found that image quality and comfort were inferior with the headset, although neck strain was improved. Further technological advancements are required before headsets can be considered an acceptable alternative to the conventional video monitor for GI endoscopy.

### Piezo acts in an intestinal valve to regulate swallowing in C. elegans [^11538YGs]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Sensations of the internal state of the body play crucial roles in regulating physiological processes and maintaining homeostasis. However, our understanding of how internal signals are sensed, processed, and integrated to generate appropriate biological responses remains limited. Here, we show that the C. elegans PIEZO channel, encoded by pezo-1, regulates food movement in the intestine by detecting food accumulation in the anterior part of the intestinal lumen, thereby triggering rhythmical movement of the pharynx, referred to as the pharyngeal plunge. Pezo-1 deletion mutants exhibit defects in the pharyngeal plunge, which is rescued by PEZO-1 or mouse PIEZO1 expression but not by PIEZO2 in a single isolated non-neuronal tissue of the digestive tract, the pharyngeal-intestinal valve. Genetic ablation or optogenetic activation of this valve inhibits or induces the pharyngeal plunge, respectively. Moreover, pressure built in the anterior lumen of the intestine results in a pezo-1-dependent pharyngeal plunge, which is driven by head muscle contraction. These findings illustrate how interoceptive processes in a digestive organ regulate swallowing through the PIEZO channel, providing insights into how interoception coordinates ingestive processes in higher animals, including humans.

### A novel prepless X-ray imaging capsule for colon cancer screening [^117H1ssU]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Scanning capsule study: Forty-nine capsules were swallowed by 46 volunteers aged 45–68 years, with three participants swallowing the capsule on two different occasions. Of these, 48 capsules were ingested and naturally eliminated by volunteers without any minor or major side effects. In one case, a capsule was retained in the cecum and was retrieved during a follow-up colonoscopy performed for polypectomy; this participant remained asymptomatic. Total patient radiation exposure was 0.03 ± 0.0007 mSv. Image reconstructions provided 3D views of the colonic wall and lumen, showcasing the typical contour of various segments, such as the hepatic flexure and triangular shape of the transverse colon. Notably, no 'haustral rings' were observed during capsule movement. Several polyps were detected and later validated by colonoscopy. Representative examples include a sessile polyp in the ascending colon and a pedunculated, lobulated polyp in the sigmoid colon.

Figure 2 includes the reconstruction of polyps. It shows (A) a sessile polyp in the ascending colon. The endoscopic image of a 12×4 mm sessile polyp (indicated by an arrow) on a haustrum, and (B) a three-dimensional (3D) trace of the colon by capsule data from the anteroposterior view. The blue line marks the segment where a polyp was visualized. Further images demonstrate (C and D) the reconstruction of the colon segment, either tube-type (C) or fillet-type (D), with the polyp marked by an arrow. Lastly, (E) showcases a reconstruction of the outer colon surface, with the polyp visible as an indentation (arrow).

### Gastrointestinal biopsy obtained during cancer screening, a biological marker for α-synucleinopathy [^115oMcjS]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Currently, because there are no diagnostic tests that allow for a conclusive diagnosis of Lewy body disease (LBD), at an early stage of the disease, up to 20% of patients in the early stages are misdiagnosed. Since the discovery of altered α-synuclein (αS) as a constituent of hallmark lesions in LBD, that is Lewy bodies, postmortem (PM) neuropathological examination and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of this altered protein have become the gold standard in diagnostics.

Numerous studies have addressed the detection of αS pathology in peripheral tissues, particularly in skin, intestine, and submandibular gland that are suitable for in vivo sampling. Regarding the intestine, altered αS has been detected in various gastrointestinal (GI) tissue samples, ranging from the esophagus to the rectum in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Noteworthy, however, positive αS staining has also been detected in the GI tract in unimpaired subjects, probably representing subjects in a preclinical stage of LBD. As early as 1990, a mass cancer screening applying colonoscopy was suggested to be used for identification of pathology in this location. Thus, the GI tract might be a promising peripheral tissue to assess for αS pathology as the tissue is readily available for biopsy during routine endoscopic procedures, particularly since colonoscopy is a routine screening tool in subjects aged 60 years and above in many countries.

In this study, we assessed whether αS pathology was readily detected in GI biopsies. The subjects that were included had displayed αS pathology in the brain at PM neuropathological assessment. The goal was to identify wh

### Fistula caused by cytomegalovirus enteritis hidden between swollen folds and detected by capsule enteroscopy [^112SaW8q]. Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who was receiving dialysis, presented with a 6-month history of anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 5.6 g/dL. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies and computed tomography (CT) were unable to identify the cause of the anemia. Small-intestine capsule endoscopy revealed multiple ulcers with adherent blood.

- **Transanal enteroscopy findings**: After the folds were separated, an ulcer was identified. During an attempt to visualize the entire ulcer, another intestinal tract was discovered behind it. Biopsy of the ulcer showed giant inclusion bodies in the granulation tissue, which immunohistochemical analysis confirmed as cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive cells. The patient was diagnosed with CMV enteritis and treated with ganciclovir. Two months after treatment, his hemoglobin level improved to 12.0 g/dL.

- **Figures explanation**:
	- **Figure 1**: Small-intestine capsule endoscopy in a patient with CMV enteritis shows active bleeding and ulcers.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^112QzyJT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Disturbances of gastric, intestinal, and colonic motor and sensory functions affect a large proportion of the population worldwide, impair quality of life, and cause considerable health-care costs. Assessment of gastrointestinal motility in these patients can serve to establish diagnosis and guide therapy. Major advances in diagnostic techniques during the past 5–10 years have led to this update about indications for, selection of, and performance of currently available tests.

As symptoms have poor concordance with gastrointestinal motor dysfunction, clinical motility testing is indicated in patients in whom there is no evidence of causative mucosal or structural diseases, such as inflammatory or malignant disease. Transit tests, using radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, breath tests, and wireless motility capsules, are noninvasive. Other tests of gastrointestinal contractility or sensation usually require intubation, typically represent second-line investigations limited to patients with severe symptoms, and are performed only at specialized centres.

- **Recommended tests**: This Consensus Statement details recommended tests as well as useful clinical alternatives for investigation of gastric, small bowel, and colonic motility.
- **Classification and treatment**: The article provides recommendations on how to classify gastrointestinal motor disorders based on test results and describes how test results guide treatment decisions.

### ScotCap - A large observational cohort study [^112Eo63n]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was the CCE test completion rate, defined as the excretion of the capsule within its battery life or visualization of the anal cushions. Secondary outcomes included the rate of uptake of CCE, successful bowel preparation rate, findings from CCE (such as polyps, inflammation, and colorectal cancer), the need for further diagnostic bowel tests (like colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and CTC), and findings and/or pathology discovered during further investigation (polyp, inflammation, colorectal cancer). Additionally, the urgency and indication of follow‐up investigations were recorded, along with the detection rate of colonic polyps and colorectal cancer in follow‐up tests.

- **Statistical analysis**: The primary outcome was determined as the proportion of complete CCE tests out of the total number of CCE procedures. The uptake of CCE was calculated as the proportion of patients who successfully swallowed the capsule out of those invited to participate in the evaluation. The number of patients requiring each follow‐up test was calculated by summing those who had undergone that test during the evaluation period with those who were scheduled to undergo it following the end of the evaluation period.

The requirement for follow‐up investigation was recorded from patients' CCE reports by a clinical researcher (CM). Follow‐up tests were classified as 'due to CCE findings' if CCE reported any findings necessitating endoscopy, regardless of whether the CCE examination was adequate. Investigations carried out solely due to an incomplete CCE or inadequate bowel preparation were classified as incomplete.

### Evaluation of the PillCam Colon capsule in the detection of colonic pathology: results of the first multicenter, prospective, comparative study [^1153aiWD]. Endoscopy (2006). High credibility.

Population-based screening for colorectal cancer is widely recommended, with conventional colonoscopy considered the preferred diagnostic modality. However, compliance with screening colonoscopy is low, and manpower capacity is limited. Capsule endoscopy might therefore represent a desirable alternative strategy.

The PillCam Colon capsule endoscope was prospectively tested in a multicenter setting. The indications for endoscopy in the enrolled patients included colorectal cancer screening (43%), postpolypectomy surveillance (26%), and lower gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (31%). Study subjects underwent colon preparation and then ingested the capsule on the morning of the examination, with conventional colonoscopy being performed the same day. The PillCam Colon capsule findings were reviewed by three experts in capsule endoscopy who were blinded to the conventional colonoscopy findings.

A total of 91 subjects were enrolled in three Israeli centers (55 men, 36 women; mean age 57), and the results were evaluable in 84 cases. The capsule was excreted within 10 hours in 74% of the patients and reached the rectosigmoid colon in the other 16%. Of the 84 evaluable patients, 20 (24%) had significant findings, defined as at least one polyp of 6 mm or more in size or three or more polyps of any size: 14/20 (70%) were identified with the capsule and 16/20 (80%) were identified by conventional colonoscopy. Polyps of any size were found in 45 patients, 34/45 (76%) found by the capsule and 36/45 (80%) by conventional colonoscopy.

### Octa-nonagenarians can perform video capsule endoscopy safely and with a higher diagnostic yield than 65–79-year-old patients [^116tMu65]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

The study, conducted from 2010 to 2017, analyzed 547 video capsule endoscopies (VCEs) performed in older adults aged 65 years and above, accounting for 31.0% of 1765 consecutive studies conducted in adults aged 18 years and over during this period. Twelve VCEs (2.2%) were excluded from analysis: two patients (0.4%) were unable to swallow the VCE (both were 73 years old), and in ten cases (1.8%), there was a recording malfunction (nine patients were aged 65–79, and one patient was 83 years old). In total, 535 VCE studies were performed on 499 older adult patients, with 51.2% being male.

Thirty-six patients (6.7%) underwent VCE twice within the study period, with an average interval of 23.1 months between procedures (range: 1.05–85.7 months). VCEs were conducted in 443 (82.8%) patients aged 65–79 years (median age: 71 years) and 92 (17.2%) patients aged 80 years and older (range: 80–93 years, median: 83 years). The prevalence of male gender was similar between the two groups (52.1% in the 65–79 age group vs. 46.7% in those aged 80 and above, p = 0.345). Three patients who underwent two VCE studies crossed the age cutoff and were therefore included in both age groups (patient 1: aged 79 and 81 years; patient 2: aged 79 and 83 years; patient 3: aged 77 and 84 years).

### Endoscopic capsule placement improves the completion rate of small-bowel capsule endoscopy and increases diagnostic yield [^116LJNDm]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

The methods for increasing the rate of complete small-bowel examinations by capsule endoscopy (CE) demonstrate conflicting results, and it is unknown whether improving the completion rate of CE transit correlates with improvement in diagnostic yield.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to determine whether a higher rate of complete small-bowel examinations results in a higher diagnostic yield of CE.

- **Design**: Case-control comparison.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care university hospital.

- **Patients**: A total of 273 patients underwent conventional CE (group A), and 261 patients underwent real-time CE (group B). Furthermore, the patients in groups A and B were divided into 2 subgroups by pyloric transit time (A1, A2 and B1, B2, respectively).

- **Interventions**: After swallowing the capsule, each patient was monitored with a real-time viewer in group B, and the patients underwent endoscopic placement if the capsule was delayed in the esophagus or stomach.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Pyloric transit time, small-bowel transit time, the rate of complete small-bowel examinations, and the diagnostic yield.

- **Results**: The rate of complete small-bowel examinations was significantly higher in group B than in group A (87.4% vs 78.0%, respectively; p = 0.004). The diagnostic yield was significantly higher in group B2 than in group A2 (60.0% vs 41.7%, respectively; p = 0.019).

- **Limitations**: Nonrandomized study.

- **Conclusions**: Endoscopic placement improves the rate of complete small-bowel examinations, resulting in a higher diagnostic yield of CE.

These recommendations on video capsule endoscopy, an emerging technology with an impact on the practice of endoscopy, were developed by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Guidelines Committee. The first draft of each section was prepared by one or two members of the writing team, who were selected as experts on the content of that section based on their published work. They used an evidence-based methodology, performing MEDLINE and PubMed literature searches to identify relevant clinical studies. Abstracts from scientific meetings were included only if no published full paper existed on a particular topic. If there was disagreement, the first author of the guideline made the final decision. Recommendations were graded according to the strength of the supporting evidence.

The draft guideline was critically reviewed by all authors and submitted to the ESGE councillors for their critical review before approval of the final document. The ESGE Guidelines Committee acknowledges that this document is based on a critical review of the data available at the time of preparation and that further studies may be needed to clarify some aspects. Moreover, this guideline may be revised as necessary to account for changes in technology, new data, or other aspects of clinical practice. This document should be regarded as supplying recommendations only to gastroenterologists in providing care to their patients. It is not a set of rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care, or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any specific treatment approach.

### Evaluation of postsurgical recurrence in Crohn's disease: A new indication for capsule endoscopy [^116zyqWx]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Recurrence after surgery to treat Crohn's disease is frequent and unpredictable. The efficacy of postsurgery capsule endoscopy in detecting recurrence in patients with Crohn's disease is yet to be confirmed.

- **Objective**: To assess the safety, accuracy, and therapeutic impact of capsule endoscopy in these patients.

- **Design**: Crohn's disease recurrence at the neoileum (Rutgeers score) was assessed in the patients by colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy. The M2A Patency Capsule (Given Imaging, Yoqneam, Israel) was administered one week before capsule endoscopy. Capsule endoscopy was performed within two weeks of colonoscopy. Investigators were blinded to the results of each technique. Patient comfort during the procedures was recorded.

- **Patients**: Twenty-four patients with Crohn's disease with ileocolonic anastomosis were prospectively included. All patients were asymptomatic and did not receive any prophylactic treatment.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Neoileum recurrence.

- **Results**: A colonoscopy was performed in all patients, although the neoileum could not be reached in three of them. M2A Patency Capsule excretion was delayed in two patients; thus capsule endoscopy was given only to 22 patients. Recurrence was visualized with colonoscopy in six patients and with capsule endoscopy in five. Ten additional recurrences were visualized only with capsule endoscopy. Moreover, proximal involvement was detected in 13 patients. Therapeutic management was modified in 16 patients. All patients preferred capsule endoscopy.

- **Conclusions**: Capsule endoscopy is more effective in the evaluation of recurrence.
