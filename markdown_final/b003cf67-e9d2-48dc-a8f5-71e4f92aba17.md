## Question

What are LSIL found in papsmwae

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what LSIL on a Pap smear means, how to interpret it, and how to manage it according to current guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the Bethesda terminology and cytology–histology distinctions. Then, I should verify the HPV association and natural history, including regression and progression risks. Next, I will review risk-based management thresholds and age-specific algorithms. After that, I should consider special populations such as adolescents, immunocompromised patients, and those with prior treatment. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan and address common pitfalls and patient counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the definition and terminology. LSIL stands for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, a cytologic diagnosis on Pap smear that reflects mild cellular abnormalities typically due to active HPV infection. Cytologic LSIL is not equivalent to histologic CIN 1, even though both are often driven by HPV, so I need to avoid conflating cytology and histology when planning management [^1179VKo2] [^112GgMaR].

> I need to check the HPV association and prevalence. Most LSIL cytology is HPV-positive, with pooled estimates around 76–80% for high-risk HPV, and HPV 16 is commonly represented; this high prevalence is why HPV triage of LSIL is generally not cost-effective, although genotyping can refine risk in some contexts [^111warZj] [^112PTkYC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk. I should verify progression and regression data. In adolescents and young women, LSIL has very high regression rates — about 61% at 12 months and up to 91% by 36 months — supporting conservative management; in adults, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after LSIL is modest overall but varies with HPV status, with HPV-positive LSIL carrying higher risk than HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-negative LSIL approximating the risk of HPV-negative ASC-US, which is clinically useful for triage decisions [^112TLSiC] [^117K1jiU].

> Next, I should review the modern management framework. The 2019 ASCCP guidelines shifted to risk-based management using a 4% immediate CIN 3+ risk threshold for colposcopy and a 0.55% 5-year CIN 3+ risk threshold for 3-year return, with 1-year surveillance for intermediate risks. This replaces rigid test-based algorithms with individualized risk estimates derived from large cohorts, which I should apply to LSIL results in context of current and prior screening history [^112QTZyx] [^112MKveH].

> Let me consider age 25 and older first. For adults with LSIL, immediate colposcopy is generally recommended unless a recent documented HPV-negative screen within about 5 years lowers the immediate risk enough to defer to 1-year surveillance. If HPV status is unknown, LSIL typically meets or exceeds the 4% threshold, so colposcopy is indicated, and HPV genotyping can further stratify urgency, especially for HPV 16/18 [^1115MkEf] [^111Y9yUh].

> Wait, I should double-check the role of HPV genotyping in LSIL. Although reflex HPV testing is not used to triage LSIL itself due to high positivity, knowing whether LSIL is HPV 16/18–positive increases concern for underlying CIN 2+ and may influence the threshold for expedited evaluation or treatment; conversely, HPV-negative LSIL carries substantially lower 5-year CIN 3+ risk and can often be managed with repeat testing rather than immediate colposcopy, aligning with the equal-management-of-equal-risks principle [^117K1jiU] [^111Y9yUh].

> Now, for patients younger than 25 years, I need to ensure I apply the conservative algorithm. Colposcopy is not recommended for isolated LSIL; instead, repeat cytology at 12 months is advised, with colposcopy reserved for persistence at 24 months or any evolution to HSIL/ASC-H/AGC, reflecting high regression rates and the potential harms of overtreatment in this age group [^1114nyBo] [^112TLSiC].

> I will now examine postcolposcopy scenarios. If colposcopy and biopsy show CIN 1 or no lesion, observation with HPV-based testing at 1 year is preferred. If CIN 1 persists for at least 2 years, continued observation remains acceptable, though treatment is an option after shared decision-making, balancing low progression risk against patient preferences and fertility considerations [^114S4n9j] [^113nuVv7].

> But wait, what if the preceding cytology was high grade and the biopsy shows only CIN 1? In that discordant setting, I should confirm whether the squamocolumnar junction and lesion limits were fully visualized and endocervical sampling was adequate. If so, observation with HPV-based testing and colposcopy at 1 year is acceptable, whereas immediate diagnostic excision is also reasonable, particularly after HSIL cytology, given the possibility of occult high-grade disease [^114y6t54] [^115RoB51].

> Next, I should review special populations. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, any SIL warrants colposcopy and annual screening is recommended. In postmenopausal patients, HPV prevalence declines and HPV triage can be considered to avoid unnecessary procedures. After treatment for CIN 2/3, surveillance is intensified for at least 25 years because of elevated recurrence risk [^115LfuY4] [^11685vKk] [^111Y9yUh].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of endocervical curettage. Routine ECC is not recommended for all LSIL referrals. It is reserved for unsatisfactory colposcopy or when no lesion is visualized, given its low yield of high-grade pathology in low-grade cytology populations [^116tgZFm] [^113uBFdt].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a 30-year-old with LSIL and unknown HPV status, I would arrange colposcopy. If HPV 16/18 is present, I would expedite evaluation and consider diagnostic excision if the colposcopy is unsatisfactory or the lesion is high grade, whereas if HPV is negative, I would favor observation with repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year, recognizing the lower risk profile. For a 22-year-old with LSIL, I would repeat cytology in 12 months and only proceed to colposcopy if LSIL persists at 24 months or if HSIL/ASC-H/AGC emerges [^1115MkEf] [^1114nyBo] [^111Y9yUh].

> I should confirm patient counseling points. LSIL is common and usually reflects transient HPV infection with a high likelihood of resolution, especially in younger patients. Persistent HPV, particularly types 16/18, increases the risk of progression, which is why structured follow-up is important. Smoking cessation, HPV vaccination if not completed, and adherence to recommended surveillance intervals meaningfully reduce risk and anxiety [^115hhbDe] [^112TLSiC].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up tracking. I will record the Bethesda cytology category, HPV status and genotypes if available, colposcopic findings, biopsy results, and the rationale for observation versus treatment. I will also schedule reminders for surveillance intervals and communicate clearly with the patient to minimize loss to follow-up, which is a known contributor to delayed detection of high-grade disease [^1149mvG3] [^1176VUav].

LSIL on a Pap smear means **low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion** — mild cervical cell changes caused by HPV, most often transient and resolving spontaneously [^11358M8m] [^112TLSiC]. Management is **risk-based**: colposcopy for ages ≥ 25 [^1115MkEf], repeat cytology for ages < 25 [^1114nyBo], and HPV status guides follow-up [^114TLCUE]. Most LSIL **regresses**; persistent HPV or repeated LSIL increases the risk of progression, so ongoing surveillance is essential [^112TLSiC] [^115hhbDe].

---

## Definition and cytological features

LSIL reflects **mild cervical cell abnormalities** — nuclear enlargement, hyperchromasia, and koilocytosis — and is usually due to transient HPV infection [^11358M8m] [^113BxkZG]. It is a **cytologic diagnosis**, not a histologic one, and does not always correspond to CIN1 on biopsy [^112GgMaR].

---

## Causes and risk factors

LSIL is **primarily caused by HPV**, especially low-risk types (e.g. 6, 11) that cause warts and high-risk types (e.g. 16, 18) that can progress to high-grade lesions [^notfound]. Risk factors include **multiple sexual partners, early sexual activity, immunosuppression, smoking, and prior cervical abnormalities** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and natural history

LSIL has a **high regression rate**, especially in younger women; about 60% regress within 12 months and ~91% within 36 months [^112TLSiC]. Persistence or progression is linked to ongoing high-risk HPV infection [^117K1jiU] [^114PkPMe]. Progression to CIN2/3 or cancer is uncommon but possible, particularly with persistent high-risk HPV [^114S4n9j] [^115hhbDe].

---

## Management guidelines

Management is **risk-based**, integrating age, HPV status, and prior results [^114TLCUE]:

| **Age group** | **Initial management** | **Follow-up** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 25 years | Colposcopy if HPV-positive or unknown; repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year if HPV-negative | Per risk-based guidelines |
| < 25 years | Repeat cytology at 12 months; colposcopy if persistent or HSIL/ASC-H | Return to routine screening after 2 negative results |

---

Colposcopy is indicated for **HPV-positive LSIL or unknown HPV status** in women ≥ 25 years [^115ujeLc]; observation is appropriate for HPV-negative LSIL or in younger women [^113nuVv7] [^1114nyBo].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up depends on **risk and prior results** [^114TLCUE]. After colposcopy showing CIN1 or less, repeat HPV-based testing in 1 year; after treatment for CIN2/3, continue surveillance for at least 25 years [^111Y9yUh]. Persistent LSIL or ongoing high-risk HPV warrants closer surveillance or treatment [^114S4n9j].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Patients should be reassured that LSIL is **common and often resolves spontaneously** [^112TLSiC]. Emphasize adherence to follow-up, HPV vaccination, safe sex practices, and smoking cessation to reduce progression risk [^115hhbDe].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

Untreated LSIL **usually regresses**, but persistent high-risk HPV can progress to CIN2/3 or cancer over time; regular surveillance is key to detecting and treating progression early [^115hhbDe].

---

LSIL on a Pap smear reflects **mild HPV-related changes** that often regress; management is risk-based, with colposcopy for higher-risk patients and observation for lower-risk or younger patients, and ongoing surveillance is essential to detect progression early [^114TLCUE] [^112TLSiC].

LSILAn area of abnormal cells that forms on the surface of certain organs, such as the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, and esophagus. LSILs look slightly abnormal when looked at under a microscope. They are usually caused by infection with certain types of human papillomavirus and are found when a Pap test or biopsy is done. LSILs usually go away on their own without treatment, but sometimes they can become cancer and spread into nearby tissue. LSIL is sometimes called mild dysplasia. Also called low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.

The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the uterus that forms a canal between the uterus and vagina. Before cancer cells form in tissues of the cervix, the cells of the cervix go through abnormal changes called dysplasia. There are different types of dysplasia.

Mild dysplasia, called low-grade intraepithelial lesion is one type. Moderate or severe dysplasia, called high-grade intraepithelial lesion is another type of dysplasia. LSIL and HSIL may or may not become cancer.

Posttreatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 — first surveillance testing shows that most treated patients (82.3%, total 4,695) have a negative HPV test with immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risks of 0.34% and 2.0%, leading to 1-year follow-up, and any abnormality on any follow-up test leads to referral to colposcopy, including HPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL cytology, HPV-negative high-grade cytology, and all HPV-positive results.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^114yzbLm]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

### Risk-based triage strategy by extended HPV genotyping for women with LSIL cytology: a real-world study [^111EkUrA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The present study stratified 14 hrHPV and 4 intermediate‐risk HPV types into three groups based on the immediate risk of CIN3+ among LSIL in accordance with the risk thresholds of ASCCP guidelines. Compared with the conventional management strategy for LSIL, this new risk‐based stratification strategy exhibited that it can not only effectively reduce unnecessary colposcopies but also maintain high efficacy for CIN2+/3+ detection. However, more comprehensive studies are still needed globally. In the future, we will validate these findings in a large‐scale cervical cancer screening cohort to provide more evidence on the cumulative risk of specific HPV types among LSIL women, to fully assess the long‐term effects and feasibility of widespread implementation of this strategy.

### The clinical significance of "squamous intraepithelial lesion of indeterminate grade" as a distinct cytologic category [^111oQPtA]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

The histologic and/or cytologic follow-up of 127 cases of cervical lesions termed "squamous intraepithelial lesion of indeterminate grade" (SIL) on Papanicolaou (Pap) smears by the 2001 Bethesda System was compared with 150 control cases of low-grade SIL (LSIL), high-grade SIL (HSIL), and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H). A follow-up diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or higher was identified in 22.8% of SIL cases, which was 2.6 times higher than LSIL, 3 times lower than HSIL, and 1.5 times lower than ASC-H. A follow-up diagnosis of CIN 1 was identified in 31.5% of SIL cases, which was 2 times lower than the LSIL group, 1.5 times higher than the ASC-H cases, and 1.8 times higher than the HSIL group. We found that 22.0% of cases diagnosed as SIL were followed up by Pap smears rather than colposcopy and biopsy, compared with about 1% of LSIL and HSIL cases. Because SIL cases have a significant risk of harboring CIN 2 or greater, we recommend follow-up by colposcopy and biopsy.

### 2001 consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities [^115PLLms]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer precursors.

Participants

A panel of 121 experts in the diagnosis and management of cervical cancer precursors, including representatives from 29 professional organizations, federal agencies, and national and international health organizations, were invited to participate in a consensus conference sponsored by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP).

Evidence and Consensus Process

Guidelines for the management of women with cervical cytological abnormalities were developed through a multistep process. Starting 6 months before the conference, working groups developed draft management guidelines based on formal literature reviews of English-language articles published in 1988–2001, as well as input from the professional community at large, obtained using interactive Internet-based bulletin boards. On September 6–8, 2001, the ASCCP Consensus Conference was held in Bethesda, Md. Guidelines with supporting evidence were presented and underwent discussion, revision, and voting.

Conclusions

Management of women with atypical squamous cells (ASC) depends on whether the Papanicolaou test is subcategorized as of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or as cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H). Women with ASC-US should be managed using a program of 2 repeat cytology tests, immediate colposcopy, or DNA testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Testing for HPV DNA is the preferred approach when liquid-based cytology is used for screening. In most instances, women with ASC-H, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, HSIL, and atypical glandular cells should be referred for immediate colposcopic evaluation.

### Colposcopic evaluation after a repeat atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) smear [^113BSBrQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Management of patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) remains controversial. We chose to repeat the Pap smear after four months. If ASCUS persisted in this second test, the patient was advised to undergo colposcopy. Our objective is to determine the clinical significance and the prediction of neoplasia among these patients through a colposcopic examination.

Methods

Of 29,827 patients who had a Pap smear, ASCUS were detected in 1387 (5%) and persisted in the repeat smear of 225 (16%). Colposcopy and an additional Pap smear were performed on 186 patients.

Results

Out of 186 colposcopic evaluations, 91 (49%) were normal and the patients had a negative Pap smear. Colposcopy was abnormal in 95/186 patients (51%) (Table 1). Histology of the directed biopsies revealed 38 (21%) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 17 (9%) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Forty patients (21%) with normal biopsies had ASCUS for the third time in the Pap smear.

Conclusions

Colposcopic evaluation after a repeated Pap smear with ASCUS is an appropriate cost-effective management. Finding 30% of LSIL or HSIL justifies this additional investigation.

### Cytology versus high-risk HPV testing for follow-up of HPV-positive women without CIN [^115isDaz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Screening for cervical cancer is often considered the success story for cancer screening in the United States. However, much room for improvement still exists. For example, experts have yet to establish the best follow-up strategy for women with an abnormal Papanicolaou test and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) followed by a normal colposcopy or biopsy that is negative for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The incorporation of HPV testing has allowed the development of a more sensitive and cost-efficient strategy. This article presents a brief overview of related guidelines and current modalities, and reviews selected studies. Finally, future directions and a possible schema for clinical management of these patients are included.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^1115MkEf]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

To validate the 4.0% Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy, the KPNC CIN 3+ prevalent risk estimates were compared with those from other study populations with more diversity in sociodemographic characteristics including the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, and the BD Onclarity registrational trials. The 4% threshold functioned similarly.

The 4.0% immediate risk Clinical Action Threshold has important implications for patients with at least 1 previous negative HPV-based test because surveillance is recommended rather than immediate colposcopy for low-grade abnormalities (HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) in patients whose preceding screening result was a negative HPV test or cotest within a routine screening interval (approximately 5 years). This additional information reduces the immediate CIN 3+ risk to approximately 2%, leading to a recommendation of 1-year surveillance instead of immediate colposcopy. Adoption of the 4.0% Clinical Action Threshold reduces the number of patients referred for colposcopy over 2 rounds of screening from an estimated 9.8%, using the 2012 ASCCP recommendations, to 8.3% using the 2019 recommendations. Exceptions to the 4.0% threshold, encompassing results with cancer risk disproportionately higher than CIN 3+ risk, are discussed in Section H.2.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^111warZj]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) — prevalence and risk — In 1996, the median percentile reporting rate for US laboratories was 1.6%, increasing to 2.1% by 2003; in 2003, the median percentile reporting rate of LSIL was 1.4% for conventional cytology specimens and 2.4% for liquid-based specimens. A meta-analysis reported that the pooled estimate of high-risk HPV DNA positivity among women with LSIL was 76.6%, and the prevalence of CIN 2,3 or cancer at initial colposcopy among women with LSIL is 12% to 17%; postmenopausal women are an exception with lower HPV prevalence after an LSIL result. Data from ALTS indicate that the risk of high-grade cervical neoplasia in women with LSIL is the same as in those with ASC-US who are high-risk HPV DNA positive.

### Cervical cancer screening: a review [^115hhbDe]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Each year in the US, approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer, 14 000 people are diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 4000 die of cervical cancer.

Observations

Essentially all cervical cancers worldwide are caused by persistent infections with one of 13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68. HPV vaccination at ages 9 through 12 years will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers. In people with a cervix aged 21 through 65 years, cervical cancer is prevented by screening for and treating cervical precancer, defined as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix. High-grade lesions can progress to cervical cancer if not treated. Cervicovaginal HPV testing is 90% sensitive for detecting precancer. In the general population, the risk of precancer is less than 0.15% over 5 years following a negative HPV test result. Among people with a positive HPV test result, a combination of HPV genotyping and cervical cytology (Papanicolaou testing) can identify the risk of precancer. For people with current precancer risks of less than 4%, repeat HPV testing is recommended in 1, 3, or 5 years depending on 5-year precancer risk. For people with current precancer risks of 4% through 24%, such as those with low-grade cytology test results (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]) and a positive HPV test of unknown duration, colposcopy is recommended. For patients with precancer risks of less than 25% (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 [CIN1] or histologic LSIL), treatment-related adverse effects, including possible association with preterm labor, can be reduced by repeating colposcopy to monitor for precancer and avoiding excisional treatment. For patients with current precancer risks of 25% through 59% (eg, high-grade cytology results of ASC cannot exclude high-grade lesion [ASC-H] or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] with positive HPV test results), management consists of colposcopy with biopsy or excisional treatment. For those with current precancer risks of 60% or more, such as patients with HPV-16-positive HSIL, proceeding directly to excisional treatment is preferred, but performing a colposcopy first to confirm the need for excisional treatment is acceptable. Clinical decision support tools can facilitate correct management.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 100 000 people are treated for cervical precancer each year in the US to prevent cervical cancer. People with a cervix should be screened with HPV testing, and if HPV-positive, genotyping and cytology testing should be performed to assess the risk of cervical precancer and determine the need for colposcopy or treatment. HPV vaccination in adolescence will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers.

Bethesda terminology and CIN categories — The 2001 Bethesda System terminology is used for cytological classification, employing low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Histology uses a 2-tiered system with CIN 1 for low-grade lesions and CIN 2,3 for high-grade precursors. Cytological LSIL is not equivalent to histological CIN 1 and cytological HSIL is not equivalent to histological CIN 2,3.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Women with HIV infection aged < 30 years — management of abnormal Pap test results — specifies that for an ASC-US Pap test, if reflex HPV testing is positive, referral to colposcopy is recommended; if HPV testing is not available or not done, repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months is recommended (AII), and for any result equal to or greater than ASC-US on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is recommended (AII). For LSIL or worse (including ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL), referral to colposcopy is recommended regardless of reflex HPV result, if done.

### Do women ≥ 50 years of age need as much screening as women [^116BoqJw]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

As shown in Table 6, one critical point in cervical screening is the specificity of cytohistological diagnosis.

We estimated the joint probability of a false-positive CIN2+ diagnosis within a screening episode, as it depends on the probability of being a false-positive case at both the primary and the assessment test, for the adopted diagnostic category.

Several meta-analyses have shown that cytological specificity ranges from 14 to 97%. We assumed a specificity ranging from 0.94 to 0.97, according to estimates from studies on low-risk screening attenders. Lower values did not allow the estimation of the true positives; anyway, it is very unlikely that a specificity as low as 0.60–0.70 might occur in a modern cytological screening setting.

Histological diagnosis reproducibility might be as questionable as cytological diagnosis. Studies of cervical biopsies have shown fair-to-poor interobserver and intraobserver agreement in reporting. We assumed histological specificity to be at least 0.94 according to the findings of ASCUS-LSIL Triage study, which reviewed 2237 original histological slides.

According to these assumptions, the ratio between true-positive and false-positive results is almost above 10 under 50 years of age, whereas among older women, for each real case identified, one false positive is also diagnosed. After four tests, at least three false-positive cases are diagnosed every true positive (Table 6). These considerations hold also in the case of two 20-year age groups, that is 25–44 and 45–64 (data not shown). Yet, in our results, the effect is even stronger, thus demonstrating that the screening benefits over 50 years is uncertain.

Cervical cancer screening recommendations — HPV testing scope and Pap categories — state that available human papillomavirus (HPV) tests can detect up to 14 oncogenic HPV types, and testing is always for oncogenic HPV types only with no role for non-oncogenic HPV; some assays specify genotypes HPV16 or HPV16/18. Possible Pap test results include Normal, LSIL or CIN1, HSIL or CIN2, 3, ASCUS, ASC-H, and AGC.

ASCCP risk estimates — postcolposcopy after high-grade referral with no CIN 2+ found indicate that, in the stratum with prior HPV-positive status, if the current cytology is negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), the CIN 3+ immediate risk is 5.0% and the 5-year risk is 12% with management of Colposcopy and a recommendation confidence score of 80; if the current cytology is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-US/LSIL), the CIN 3+ immediate risk is 6.6% and the 5-year risk is 17% with management of Colposcopy and a recommendation confidence score of 99.

FIGURE 10
This figure describes management of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by ASC-H cytology.

Rationale: Patients with a diagnosis of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) after HSIL and ASC-H cytology have 1-year CIN 3+ risks of 3.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Because HSIL cytology is associated with a higher risk than ASC-H cytology, colposcopy is recommended in addition to HPV-based testing at the 1-year follow-up if excision is not elected. Failure to detect CIN 2+ at colposcopy in patients with HSIL cytology does not mean that a CIN 2+ lesion has been excluded, although occult carcinoma is unlikely. As a result, patients with HSIL cytology who do not have immediate diagnostic excision require close follow-up. Few studies of HSIL cytology managed without treatment have been reported, and follow-up in those is limited; management relies on expert opinion. Of note, at all colposcopic examination when no lesion is identified on the cervix, the vagina and vulva must be examined for vaginal or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.

### Review of triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among young women [^111ZqETZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Globally, cancer of the cervix is ranked as the fourth most common malignancy among women. Low‐ and middle‐income countries are the most affected, where 85% of deaths from the disease occur annually. The screening strategy through Pap smear followed by the subsequent management of abnormal results has shown its efficiency in the reduction of the disease in countries with high screening coverage rates. Through the Bethesda system 2001, squamous cell abnormalities on Pap smear constitute different categories, mainly atypical squamous cells (ASCs) subdivided into ASCs of unknown significance (ASC‐US) and ASCs cannot rule out high‐grade intraepithelial lesion (ASC‐H); low‐ and high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL, HSIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

ASC‐US is a mix of cervical abnormalities at different stages encompassing the lowest risk atypia to the worst form of precancerous lesions, with some harboring the potential to downgrade to normalcy. The literature reports approximately 10%–20% of women with ASC‐US to harbor a different degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which are precursor lesions of SCC. Young women present certain particularities in the cervical cancer screening program. Among those who are sexually active, 70% carry human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and almost 70% are transient. Only a few of these women develop CIN2/3, and a study by Case et al.found that only 50% of adolescents referred for colposcopy for HSIL had confirmed CIN2 or 3, considering that HSIL may be overstated in younger women. The majority of these lesions regress with time and do so at a higher rate than in older women. The concern with ASC‐US is that without adequate follow‐up or lack of it, complications may arise or follow the treatment. Furthermore, the management of ASC‐US presents a few challenges because its progression following identification remains unpredictable. It is unknown which cases of ASC‐US may regress to become normal or progress to LSIL or HSIL. The rate of regression and progression is also unpredictable. In a meta‐analysis by Melnikow et al. ASC‐US showed a regression to normal in 68% of cases over duration of 24 months, whereas in 7.13% of cases, it progressed to a worse grade of SIL in the same period. Furthermore, in a study by Moscicki and colleagues, among the patients aged 13–25 years who were diagnosed in the community hospital setting as having CIN2, 62% of cases went into remission spontaneously. However, as progression in one sense or another cannot be predicted, clinicians need to exercise caution. Therefore, women with ASC‐US require sufficient triage or appropriate management and treatment.

### Extensively keratinized squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix are difficult to grade [^117DU1C7]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that extensively keratinized squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) are difficult to grade precisely by identifying 100 Papanicolaou smears with a keratinizing SIL that had been originally judged difficult to grade. Of these, 65 were confirmed as low-grade SIL (LSIL) or high-grade SIL (HSIL) on subsequent biopsy. The 65 smears were reviewed independently by 3 cytopathologists who graded each case as LSIL or HSIL (by Bethesda System criteria). The accuracy of the grade was determined by the subsequent biopsy results; accuracy was compared with that of a historic control group of SILs with biopsy follow-up. In the study group, biopsies showed LSIL in 41 cases and HSIL in 24. The mean accuracy for a smear diagnosis of LSIL was 60% for the study group and 92% for the control group. For a smear diagnosis of HSIL, the accuracy was 60% for the study group and 95% for the control group. The overall kappa value for the study group confirmed poor interobserver agreement. Some keratinizing SILs are difficult if not impossible to grade precisely using standard criteria. For such lesions, the diagnosis "SIL, grade cannot be determined due to extensive keratinization" is justified.

### Is p16 (INK4A) expression more useful than human papillomavirus test to determine the outcome of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance-categorized pap smear? A comparative analysis using abnormal cervical smears with follow-up biopsies [^1152WhU7]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To correlate high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) viral load to p16(INK4A) expression in atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)-categorized Pap smears with follow-up biopsies in order to elucidate their relationships in gynecological pathology.

Methods

We studied 66 ASCUS-categorized Pap smears with subsequent follow-up biopsies. HR-HPV viral load was determined by Hybrid Capture II assay from the cervical swab in each ASCUS-diagnosed Pap smear. Both smears and biopsies were immunostained with a primary anti-p16 antibody, clone E6H4, and we analyzed the correlations between HR-HPV viral load in each ASCUS-diagnosed Pap smear and p16 expression of smears with follow-up biopsies.

Results

Correlation analyses of the corresponding histological diagnoses from 66 ASCUS-diagnosed Pap smears revealed that 21 (32%) cases had only reactive changes and 45 cases showed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia including LSIL (24 cases, 36%) and HSIL or higher (21 cases, 32%). Tests for HR-HPV viral load revealed 17 (26%) negative cases and 49 (74%) positive cases. Immunostaining showed that 26 cases (39%) were negative and 40 (61%) were positive for p16 expression. Comparative analysis of these two tests indicated consistencies as well as discrepancies. They showed significant differences (P < 0.001) between negative p16 expressions of Pap smears with the presence of reactive lesions in follow-up biopsies and HR-HPV viral load. However, no significant difference (P = 0.739 and 0.606) between p16 expression of Pap smears with the presence of LSIL, HSIL or higher in follow-up biopsies and high HR-HPV viral load was found. In addition, there were significant differences (P < 0.001) in specificity and positive predictive value, but no significant differences were found in sensitivity (P = 0.606) and negative predictive value (P = 0.062) between p16 immunostaining and HR-HPV viral load.

Conclusion

The results indicate that there is a close association between weak or strong p16 expressions in ASCUS-categorized smears with the presence of SILs in follow-up biopsies and positive HR-HPV viral loads. Conversely, there is also a clear association between the lack of p16 expression and the absence of significant lesions in follow-up biopsies, but this is not consistent with a negative HR-HPV viral load. It is concluded that p16 expression is an indicator of pathogenic activity of HR-HPV, which is an objective biomarker for clarification of ASCUS-categorized Pap smears in gynecological cytopathology. Furthermore, through comparative analysis, directly visualized p16 immunostaining on smears appears to be a more effective method than HR-HPV viral load for the detection of reactive changes and LSILs from ASCUS-categorized Pap smears.

### "Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion" is a distinct cytologic category: histologic outcomes and HPV prevalence [^111Vv3Ni]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

We examined the histologic outcomes and prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) in women with liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) tests interpreted as "low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion" (LSIL-H) compared with the 2001 Bethesda System (TBS 2001) cytologic categories of LSIL, high-grade SIL (HSIL), and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H). A computer search identified 426 LSIL, 86 ASC-H, 81 LSIL-H, and 110 HSIL cytologic interpretations during a 1-year period, each with up to 2 years of histologic follow-up. The risk of histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or worse (CIN 2+) associated with LSIL-H (32/81 [40%]) was intermediate between LSIL (46/426 [10.8%]) and HSIL (72/110 [65.5%]), but not significantly different from ASC-H (23/86 [27%]). However, LSIL-H was more frequently associated with a definitive histologic diagnosis of any CIN (CIN 1+) than ASC-H (53/81 [65%] vs 35/86 [41%]). Moreover, the prevalence of HR-HPV was significantly greater in patients with LSIL-H than in patients with ASC-H (15/15 [100%] vs 43/73 [59%]). The histologic outcomes and HR-HPV prevalence associated with LSIL-H differ significantly from the established categories of TBS 2001 and provide evidence to support the recognition of LSIL-H as a distinct cytologic category.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^112MKveH]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, the 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative cervical cytology in the general population, for whom national guidelines recommend a 3-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks after a negative cytology result without HPV testing ranged from 0.33% in the KPNC population to 0.52% in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, to an estimated 0.45% in the screened population of the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Thus, 0.55% was considered an appropriate value for the Clinical Action Threshold. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds. Consistent with the 2012 guidelines, patients with a low-grade cotest result (e.g. HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL) followed by a colposcopy with results of less than CIN 2, followed in turn by a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold (see Figure 2). Also consistent with previous guidelines, patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk 0.40%).

FIGURE 2
This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common low-grade screening abnormality (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.2%). Colposcopy of less than CIN 2 has a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the patient has a repeat abnormal screen at the next follow-up, colposcopy is recommended. If the HPV-based test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. NA, not applicable because stable risk estimates are not available.

### Empiric care for minimally abnormal pap smears… [^1158cLgv]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

A significant number of Papanicolaou smears are obtained in the United States annually, and approximately 2. 5 million of them are reported to have low-grade cytologic abnormalities. Based on the Bethesda system for reporting Pap smear results, they are classified as minimally abnormal and include benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Although these minimally abnormal Pap smear results are common, management strategies vary from treatment with topical or oral antibiotics to repeating the Pap smear in three to six months. Because recent data have shown a link between minimally abnormal Pap smears and bacterial vaginosis, treatment with antibiotics should, in theory, resolve the abnormality. Ferrante and colleagues studied the efficacy of 0.

75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel therapy in asymptomatic patients who had minimally abnormal Pap smear results. Study participants included women who had routine Pap smears with minimally abnormal results, defined as limited by inflammation, benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes, or ASCUS, that did not favor any neoplastic process. Women who agreed to participate completed a questionnaire to elicit demographic information and risk factors for cervical cancer. Participants were randomized to receive treatment with 0. 75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel, one applicator-full at bedtime for five days, or no treatment. Of the 145 women who agreed to participate in the study, 114 followed up in the appropriate time frame and were included in the data analysis. There was no difference between the control and treatment groups with regard to demographics and risk factors for abnormal Pap smears. Fifty-four percent of the follow-up Pap smears were normal.

Among women whose follow-up Pap smear was normal, there was no statistical difference between those who did or did not receive treatment. Only one Pap smear worsened to LSIL during the study. The authors found no subgroups in the study for whom the treatment was effective. editor's note: When coping with abnormal Pap smear results, physicians face the dilemma of determining the best strategy for management. The fact that Pap smears with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be assessed by colposcopic examination of the cervix is not questioned in the literature. However, minimally abnormal Pap smear results do not have a clear-cut management strategy.

### Virologic versus cytologic triage of women with equivocal pap smears: a meta-analysis of the accuracy to detect high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia [^116bfaV4]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The appropriate management of women with minor cytologic lesions in their cervix is unclear. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing as an alternative to repeat cytology in women who had equivocal results on a previous Pap smear.

Methods

Data were extracted from articles published between 1992 and 2002 that contained results of virologic and cytologic testing followed by colposcopically directed biopsy in women with an index smear showing atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Fifteen studies were identified in which HPV triage and the histologic outcome (presence or absence of a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade II or worse [CIN2+]) was documented. Nine, seven, and two studies also documented the accuracy of repeat cytology when the cutoff for abnormal cytology was set at a threshold of ASCUS or worse, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or worse, or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse, respectively. Random-effects models were used for pooling of accuracy parameters in case of interstudy heterogeneity. Differences in accuracy were assessed by pooling the ratio of the sensitivity (or specificity) of HPV testing to that of repeat cytology.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity were 84.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.6% to 91.1%) and 72.9% (95% CI = 62.5% to 83.3%), respectively, for HPV testing overall and 94.8% (95% CI = 92.7% to 96.9%) and 67.3% (95% CI = 58.2% to 76.4%), respectively, for HPV testing in the eight studies that used the Hybrid Capture II assay. Sensitivity and specificity of repeat cytology at a threshold for abnormal cytology of ASCUS or worse was 81.8% (95% CI = 73.5% to 84.3%) and 57.6% (95% CI = 49.5% to 65.7%), respectively. Repeat cytology that used higher cytologic thresholds yielded substantially lower sensitivity but higher specificity than triage with the Hybrid Capture II assay. The ratio of the sensitivity of the Hybrid Capture II assay to that of repeat cytology at a threshold of ASCUS or worse pooled from the four studies that used both triage tests was 1.16 (95% CI = 1.04 to 1.29). The specificity ratio was not statistically different from unity.

Conclusion

The published literature indicates that the Hybrid Capture II assay has improved accuracy (higher sensitivity, similar specificity) than the repeat Pap smear using the threshold of ASCUS for an outcome of CIN2+ among women with equivocal cytologic results. The sensitivity of triage at higher cytologic cutoffs is poor.

### Clinical utility of HPV-DNA detection: triage of minor cervical lesions, follow-up of women treated for high-grade CIN: an update of pooled evidence [^115DJjiv]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Human papilloma virus (HPV) testing and repeat cytology are both proposed as methods to triage women with minor cytological cervical lesions. By triage, those women can be identified who need referral for diagnostic exploration with colposcopy and/or biopsy.

Methods

We conducted meta-analyses of reported studies on the accuracy to detect high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia or worse disease (CIN2+) in women with ASCUS or LSIL. We also performed meta-analyses to examine the best predictor of recurrence of CIN after treatment for CIN2 or CIN3.

Results

We found that HPV testing using the Hybrid Capture II test is more effective (more sensitive, equally specific) than cytology for the triage of patients with ASCUS Pap smears. Because of the high rate of HPV positivity, this is not the case for patients with LSIL. Studies concerning post-treatment follow-up were heterogeneous. In general, HPV testing performed better than follow-up cytology to predict success or failure of treatment (significantly higher sensitivity, not significantly lower specificity).

Conclusions

Overall, in comparison with follow-up cytology, HPV DNA testing is more sensitive and equally specific for triage of ASCUS cases and for predicting recurrence of CIN in women treated for high-grade CIN.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^112GqwcK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Data Presentation: Current Results and History

Two central questions underlie risk estimations: (a) What are the current results? (b) What past results affect the risk estimate for the current results? The "current results" are those for which the clinician is seeking guidance, either an HPV test or cotest result (see Tables 1A – 2C 4A – 5B) or a colposcopy/biopsy result (see Table 3). The past results that impact risk estimates are noted under "history". Table 1A refers to patients without a recent documented HPV test or cotest result, so the history is simply "unknown". In Table 1B, "history" refers to recent documented negative HPV test (management after a prior negative cotest is so similar that we do not show them, interested readers can consult the full tables online). However, documented negative cytology provides relatively less reduction in risk compared with a negative HPV or cotest as history. Therefore, patients with a negative cytology history will still be managed by Table 1A. In Tables 2A B C, "history" refers to the abnormal screening test result preceding the current result: HPV-negative ASC-US (Table 2A), HPV-negative LSIL (Table 2B), and HPV-positive NILM (Table 2C). In Table 3, "history" refers to the precolposcopy test results. In Table 4A, "history" refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and a low-grade test result preceding colposcopy. In Table 4B, "history" again refers to both the colposcopy result (< CIN 2) and preceding test result but addresses when a high-grade test result preceded the colposcopy.

In Tables 5A and 5B, "history" refers to treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3, and "current results" are HPV test results or cotest results after treatment. For Tables 5A and 5B, the risk estimation in this scenario (i.e. posttreatment) derives specifically from treated CIN 3 and the test result at the follow-up visit after treatment. The risk remains higher for treated CIN 3 compared with CIN 2 scenarios. However, to maximize safety after treatment of precancer, management is recommended based on the risks of patients treated for CIN 3. Thus, the management recommendations apply to both treated CIN 2 and CIN 3.

### The use of endocervical curettage in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or atypical squamous cells of unknown significance on pap smear [^113uBFdt]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the use of endocervical curettage in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS) on Pap smear.

Methods

A cross-sectional study evaluated women at a single center colposcopy service between January 1999 and December 2003 having LSIL or ASCUS on Pap smear and compatible lesions on colposcopic examination who underwent endocervical curettage. Associations of abnormal endocervical curettage results with lesion topography, age, and satisfactory colposcopy were evaluated. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to evaluate independent associations and estimate the probabilities of abnormal endocervical curettage for different clinical scenarios.

Results

Two hundred thirty-seven women were included. The estimated prevalence of abnormal endocervical curettage was 5.5% (95% CI = 2.6%-8.3%). Only 2 endocervical curettage results reported cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 (0.8%, 95% CI = 0%-2%). Bivariate analysis showed a significant association between abnormal endocervical curettage result and central topography of the lesion (p = .01). A multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that association (p = .04). The model was used to calculate probabilities of abnormal results in different scenarios.

Conclusions

The overall prevalence of abnormal endocervical curettage in patients with LSIL or ASCUS on Pap smear is low. The prevalence of endocervical curettage results reporting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 lesions is even lower. Therefore, the use of systematic endocervical curettage performance in this setting is questionable. Our model helps to predict the probability of abnormal results and assist in the decision of whether to perform endocervical curettage.

### Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion: a category with an increased outcome of high-grade lesions: use as a quality assurance measure [^116vftCs]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

"Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion" (LSIL-H) is an increasingly used, equivocal interpretive category in gynecologic cytology. In an effort to evaluate its potential usefulness as a measure of quality assurance, we studied patterns of use of the LSIL-H diagnosis compared with "LSIL" and "high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion" (HSIL) with corresponding histologic outcomes for 10 cytopathologists in our practice. In our laboratory, while the overall rate of associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or greater on histologic follow-up for LSIL-H was intermediate between that of LSIL and HSIL, the outcomes for individual cytopathologists varied widely. Monitoring this particular utilization-outcome data with periodic confidential feedback to individual cytopathologists offers an opportunity for practice improvement within a laboratory and serves as an additional measure of quality assurance. These data may be useful for establishing and/or realigning the diagnostic criteria for this equivocal cytologic interpretation endorsed by a pathology practice.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115LfuY4]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-associated cervical cancer screening and colposcopy — Providers should consider screening within 1 year of onset of sexual activity, regardless of age or method of HIV acquisition (BIII). HIV-infected adolescents and women who have become sexually active, whether vaccinated or not, should continue screening annually throughout their lives (BIII), and evidence is insufficient to recommend cervical cancer screening in HIV-infected girls who are not sexually active. It is recommended that triage be done in HIV-infected adolescents similar to that in adult women, in that any SIL, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or atypical squamous cells cannot exclude a high-grade lesion (ASC-H) should be referred for colposcopy (BIII). For ASC-US, either immediate referral to colposcopy or repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months is recommended; if ASC-US or greater is found on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is warranted. If Pap smear results are abnormal, care should be provided according to the Guidelines for Management of Women with Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests by American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. In perinatally infected adolescents, 30% had an abnormality (ASCUS or greater) on their first Pap smear.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^116nq9eV]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published. To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

### The accuracy of the Papanicolaou smear in the screening and diagnostic settings [^111qpp83]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the performance of the Papanicolaou smear in screening and diagnostic settings.

Study Design

We analyzed Papanicolaou smear results of 1,850 women recruited into a clinical trial to evaluate an emerging technology for the detection of cervical cancer. Screening and diagnosis groups were based on the history of previous Papanicolaou smear results. We calculated sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), receiver operating characteristic curves, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results

In the screening group, by defining disease as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2,3/cancer or worse and using high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) as the test cutpoint, the AUC was 0.689, and the LR+ and LR- were 39.25 and 0.67, respectively. In the diagnosis group, the AUC was 0.764, and the LR+ and LR- were 3.79 and 0.56, respectively. By defining disease as human papillomavirus/CIN 1 or worse and HSIL as the test cutpoint, the AUC was 0.586, and the LR+ and LR- were 17.01 and 0.92 in the screening group; in the diagnosis group, the AUC was 0.686, and the LR+ and LR- were 2.77 and 0.75, respectively.

Conclusions

In a screening setting, a Papanicolaou smear result of HSIL or worse is 39 times more likely in a patient with CIN 2,3/cancer than in a patient without it. This compares to 4 times more likely in the diagnostic setting. The magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio observed in the screening group indicated that abnormal Papanicolaou smear results obtained in the screening setting should have more impact on clinical decision making than those from results obtained in the diagnostic setting.

### Five-year risks of CIN 3 + and cervical cancer among women who test pap-negative but are HPV-positive [^114PkPMe]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Current US guidelines for cotesting recommend that the large numbers of women who test Pap-negative, but human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive, return in 1 year, and those who remain HPV-positive or have low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or worse Pap results be referred for colposcopy. However, the performance of these guidelines in routine clinical practice has not been evaluated.

Methods

We estimated cumulative 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) among 32,374 women aged 30 to 64 years with HPV-positive/Pap-negative cotest results at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2003 to 2010.

Results

The 5-year CIN 3+ risk after an HPV-positive/Pap-negative cotest result, which was found in 3.6% of women, was 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2%-4.8%). The 5-year cancer risk was 0.34% (95% CI = 0.26%-0.45%), and half of the cases were adenocarcinoma. Overall, 48% of the women remained HPV-positive on return (median = 418 days after baseline), a percentage that varied little over ages 30 to 64 years. At the return after a baseline HPV-positive/Pap-negative result, almost every repeat cotest result predicted greater subsequent 5-year CIN 3+ risk than the same cotest result had at baseline (HPV-positive/LSIL, 9.2% vs 6.1%, p = .01; HPV-positive/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], 7.9% vs 6.8%, p = .2; HPV-positive/Pap-negative, 7.4% vs 4.5%, p < .0001; HPV-negative/LSIL,1.7% vs 2.0%, p = .8; HPV-negative/ASC-US, 2.9% vs 0.43%, p = .0005; HPV-negative/Pap-negative, 0.93% vs 0.08%, p < .0001).

Conclusions

Using the principle of "equal management of equal risks", women testing HPV-positive/Pap-negative had a subsequent CIN 3+ risk consistent with risk thresholds for a 1-year return. However, on returning in approximately 1 year, about one-half of women will be referred for colposcopy because of continued HPV positivity or Pap abnormality. Clinicians should keep in mind that cotest results at the return after a baseline HPV-positive/Pap-negative finding are riskier than the same baseline cotest results in the general population, supporting intensified clinical management at return testing.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: updates through 2023 [^117L6CGc]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

3) Update to interval for repeating unsatisfactory cytology: The recommendation statement has been updated to reflect evidence that waiting 2 months before repeating the cytology test is not necessary.

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months is recommended (BIII).

Rationale: The 2- to 4-month waiting period was initially proposed due to early studies indicating differences in cytology results repeated over a short time interval. The recommendation was carried forward through several guideline iterations, but rereview of evidence supports revision of the 2-month waiting period. A seminal article in 2005 specifically addressed this question and found the concern of reduced cellularity with short interval repeat not to hold true. In this study, the cytology interval ranged from 8 to 30 days in 763 women, 31 to 60 days in 2,317 women, 61 to 90 days in 1,090 women, 91 to 120 days in 491 women, and 121 to 184 days in 394 women. They found that repeat cytologic interpretations of unsatisfactory findings, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) did not vary among the Pap interval groups. Most importantly, the approximate cellularity of the samples was slightly better in the interval group of 8 to 30 days (P trend = 0.04). In addition, higher rates of unsatisfactory results have been documented in patients with cancer compared with those with CIN3 or lower grade results. Waiting to repeat an unsatisfactory cytology in the presence of cancer could lead to harm, specifically if other recommended workup for symptomatic patients is not performed. For this reason, the 2019 recommendations were updated.

### Liquid-based cytology for primary cervical cancer screening: a multi-centre study [^115A6r3B]. British Journal of Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this six-centre, split-sample study was to compare ThinPrep fluid-based cytology to the conventional Papanicolaou smear. Six cytopathology laboratories and 35 gynaecologists participated. 5428 patients met the inclusion criteria (age > 18 years old, intact cervix, informed consent). Each cervical sample was used first to prepare a conventional Pap smear, then the sampling device was rinsed into a PreservCyt vial, and a ThinPrep slide was made. Screening of slide pairs was blinded (n = 5428). All non-negative concordant cases (n = 101), all non-concordant cases (n = 206), and a 5% random sample of concordant negative cases (n = 272) underwent review by one independent pathologist then by the panel of 6 investigators. Initial (blinded) screening results for ThinPrep and conventional smears were correlated. Initial diagnoses were correlated with consensus cytological diagnoses. Differences in disease detection were evaluated using McNemar's test. On initial screening, 29% more ASCUS cases and 39% more low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and more severe lesions (LSIL+) were detected on the ThinPrep slides than on the conventional smears (P = 0.001), including 50% more LSIL and 18% more high-grade SIL (HSIL). The ASCUS:SIL ratio was lower for the ThinPrep method (115:132 = 0.87:1) than for the conventional smear method (89:94 = 0.95:1). The same trend was observed for the ASCUS/AGUS:LSIL ratio. Independent and consensus review confirmed 145 LSIL+ diagnoses; of these, 18% more had been detected initially on the ThinPrep slides than on the conventional smears (P = 0.041). The ThinPrep Pap Test is more accurate than the conventional Pap test and has the potential to optimize the effectiveness of primary cervical cancer screening. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^116CmwYQ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Adolescent women with LSIL — natural history and management indicate very high regression and conservative follow-up. Prospective follow-up studies of adolescents with LSIL have shown very high rates of regression to normal, including a cumulative regression rate of 91% at 36 months, and among those not regressed at 2 years, 60% regressed to normal in the following 12 months. A recent colposcopy series found that 7% of adolescents and young women 13 to 22 years old with LSIL had CIN 2,3 at colposcopy. For management, in adolescents with LSIL, follow-up with annual cytological testing is recommended (AII), and at the 12-month follow-up only adolescents with HSIL or greater on repeat cytology should be referred to colposcopy.

Management of adolescent women with ASC-US or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) — screening intervals and thresholds. The algorithm applies to "Adolescent Women with ASC-US or LSIL (females 20 years and younger)" and specifies "Repeat Cytology @ 12 months"; if cytology is " < HSIL", perform "Repeat Cytology @ 12 mos later", with "Negative" then leading to "Routine Screening". Separately, the text states that in adolescents with ASC-US, follow-up with annual cytological testing is recommended (BII).

### How are women with high grade pap smear abnormalities managed? A population based study [^114pbkFq]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This population based study investigates the patterns of care women with high grade cervical dysplasia receive.

Methods

The study population includes women with a first time diagnosis of a high grade dysplasia (ASC-H, AGUS, HSIL, malignancy, carcinoma) from 2000 to 2005 as identified in a centralized cervical smear database. Record linkages were then carried out to other databases of health care services to characterize management.

Results

Women (43,712) with a high grade dysplasia had a mean age of 37.6. HSIL and AGC accounted for 55% and 33% of abnormalities, respectively. The mean time to referral to colposcopy services ranged from 6 to 24 weeks. Women (1195) were diagnosed with an underlying cervical cancer with a mean time to diagnosis of 26, 26, 17, 6, and 3 weeks for the cytologic abnormality of ASC-H, AGUS, HSIL, malignancy, and carcinoma, respectively. Women (559) were diagnosed with endometrial cancer. The mean time to diagnosis from index Pap was 16, 5.3 and 1.5 weeks for AGC, malignancy, and carcinoma on Pap test, respectively. The percentage of patients with a high grade Pap smear who had no follow-up all up to a 2-year window from index Pap was 5.4, 74, 19, 1.22, and 0.18% for ASC-H, AGUS, HSIL, malignancy and carcinoma on Pap, respectively.

Conclusions

The mean time to referral to colposcopy and rates of loss to follow-up for high grade smears are influenced by cytologic nomenclature. Explicit language is recommended for national guidelines to reduce the prolonged time in the workup of patients who may have serious premalignant and malignant lesion of the reproductive tract.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^115FZx2n]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer screening — HIV-infected adolescents and women: Because of the reportedly high rate of progression of abnormal cytology in HIV-infected adolescents and young women who were infected through sexual intercourse, providers should consider screening within 1 year of onset of sexual activity, regardless of age or method of HIV acquisition (BIII) and, if results are normal, continue annually thereafter (AII). HIV-infected adolescents and women who have become sexually active, whether vaccinated or not, should continue screening annually throughout their lives (BIII); evidence is insufficient to recommend cervical cancer screening in HIV-infected girls who are not sexually active. If Pap smear results are abnormal, care should be provided according to the Guidelines for Management of Women with Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests by American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, with triage similar to adults whereby any SIL, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or atypical squamous cells cannot exclude a high-grade lesion (ASC-H) should be referred for colposcopy (BIII). For ASC-US, either immediate referral to colposcopy or repeat cytology in 6 to 12 months is recommended, and if ASC-US or greater is found on repeat cytology, referral to colposcopy is warranted. A cited study reported that 30% of perinatally infected adolescents had an abnormality (ASCUS or greater) on their first Pap smear.

### Which test is a better strategy to determine the outcome of atypical glandular cell-categorized pap smears? Immunocytochemical p16INK4A expression or human papillomavirus test – a retrospective cohort study [^113zEJ2r]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was to correlate high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) viral load to p16(INK4A) (p16) expression in atypical glandular cell (AGC)-categorized Pap smears with follow-up biopsies for elucidating their relationships.

Methods

We enrolled 36 AGC-categorized Pap smears with subsequent follow-up biopsies. HR-HPV viral load was determined by Hybrid Capture II assay in each AGC-diagnosed Pap smear. Both smears and biopsies were immunostained with a primary anti-p16 antibody, clone E6H4. Correlations between HR-HPV viral load in each AGC-diagnosed Pap smear and p16 expression of smears with follow-up biopsies were performed.

Results

Comparative analysis of two tests disclosed both consistencies and discrepancies. There were significant differences (P = 0.02) between negative or weak p16 expression of Pap smears with the presence of reactive lesion or LSILs/CIN1s in follow-up biopsies and negative HR-HPV viral load. However, no significant difference (P = 0.317) was found between p16 expression of Pap smears with the presence of HSIL/CIN2, 3 and AIS or adenocarcinoma in follow-up biopsies and high HR-HPV viral load. In addition, there were significant differences (P = 0.012) in specificity, but no significant differences were found in sensitivity (P = 0.604), positive and negative predictive value (P = 0.066 and 0.264) between p16 immunoexpression and HR-HPV viral load.

Conclusions

Pathogenic activity of HR-HPV was indicated by p16 expression on smears and tissue sections, which appears to be a better strategy than HR-HPV viral load test for the detection of clinically insignificant lesions from AGC-categorized Pap smears.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^115RoB51]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 — Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by HSIL cytology is managed via three initial options: "Observation: Colposcopy & Cytology < 25 years Colposcopy & HPV-based testing ≥ 25 years at 1 year", "Diagnostic Excision Procedure^a", or "Review of cytologic, histologic, and colposcopic findings". During observation, "Abnormal Test Results" are managed per guideline, while "Age-specific retesting in 1 year " follows if "All Tests Negative", and with continued negativity transition to "HPV-based testing every 3 years for at least 25 years". If follow-up shows "Cytologic HSIL at 1 year", management follows guideline with "Continued observation for age < 25 years only", whereas "ASC-H/HSIL cytology at 2 years" leads to "Diagnostic Excisional Procedure". Footnote criteria state excision is appropriate "Only if colposcopy visualizes the entire squamocolumnar junction and upper limit of lesion(s), and endocervical sampling is < CIN 2".

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^1157UMWK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP long-term follow-up after low-grade cytology or histologic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) without high-grade abnormalities — Among patients initially diagnosed with low-grade cytologic or histologic abnormalities after HPV infections, continued surveillance according to risk estimation using available data is recommended (CIII). The 5-year CIN 3+ risks for abnormal screening test results without evidence of cytologic or histologic HSIL followed by negative HPV-based testing were 0.51% after the first negative test and 0.23% after the second negative test; thus, patients reach criteria for a 3-year return after the second negative HPV-based test. For HPV+/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) followed by 3 rounds of negative cotesting, the estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk was 0.17% (95% CI = 0.14%–0.44%); therefore continued testing at 3-year intervals is recommended at this time, whereas for those with low-grade abnormalities who underwent colposcopy at which CIN2+ was not found and then 3 rounds of negative cotesting, the estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk was 0.03% (95% CI = 0.0–0.19%), and thus does qualify for return to a 5-year interval.

### See-and-treat strategy for diagnosis and management of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions [^1134BdQA]. The Lancet: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

In a see-and-treat protocol, patients referred for colposcopy because of an abnormal Pap smear in cervical-cancer screening can be treated by loop excision, without biopsy, during one visit to the clinic. However, overtreatment in the see-and-treat strategy has been reported to be 1.2–83.3% for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and to be 13.3–83.3% for high-grade SIL. Range of overtreatment narrowed to 4.0–23.5% for those with normal pathology and to 18.0–29.4% for those with normal or low-grade pathology when calculation of overtreatment was restricted to patients diagnosed with high-grade SIL on colposcopy and referral Pap smear. Most common treatment complications are bleeding and infection. Nonetheless, the strategy has become accepted internationally: low costs, decreased patient anxiety, and increased compliance make it appealing, especially in settings with limited health resources, and for patients at risk of not being treated in a timely manner or of not returning for a second appointment. Mathematical modelling may give information about the appropriateness and usefulness of this treatment while the results of long-term clinical trials are awaited.

### The probability for a pap test to be abnormal is directly proportional to HPV viral load: results from a Swiss study comparing HPV testing and liquid-based cytology to detect cervical cancer precursors in 13, 842 women [^115tUQt7]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The black line with small white circles in Figure 2 represents the CYTO false negatives with subsequent biopsy proven LSIL. The 95% confidence intervals are not drawn as previously, but are enumerated thereafter in square brackets. Per increasing lnRLU interval, the frequencies of histologic LSIL (CYTO negative) are 67/79 = 84% [75–92], 44/57 = 77% [64–87], 34/42 = 80% [66–91], 38/47 = 80% [67–91], 16/30 = 53% [34–72], 16/28 = 57% [37–76], 9/19 = 47% [24–71], 9/20 = 45% [23–68], 7/26 = 27% [12–48] and 0/11 = 0% [0–24].

Retrospective analysis of cytological preparations associated with HSIL

Figure 3 portrays the retrospective analysis of the 79 cytological preparations (CYTO−HPV+ and CYTO+HPV+) associated with biopsy-proven HSIL (one cytological preparation, HPV+CYTO+, was not available for spot counting). The mean number of positive spots was 5.2 for HPV+/CYTO− cytological preparations (black triangles, n = 34) and 23.1 for HPV+/CYTO+ cytological preparations (white squares, n = 45). A total of 14% (11 out of 79) of cytological preparations HPV+/CYTO− did not show any positive spots. The mean lnRLU values were 2.6 for cytological preparations HPV+/CYTO− (black triangles, n = 34) and 4.8 for HPV+/CYTO+ cytological preparations (white squares, n = 45). Both differences (number of positive spots and lnRLU) were found significant with t -test (P < 0.05). The two cytological preparations HPV−/CYTO+ associated to biopsy-proven HSIL had six and 10 positive spots (not shown in Figure 3).

### Human papillomaviral load changes in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix [^112PTkYC]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. The most common oncogenic HPV type in preinvasive and cervical cancer is HPV 16, detectable in 21% of women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), in more than 50% of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3), and women with cervical cancer in America and Europe. HPV 18 causes 10–15% of CIN 3 and cervical cancers. In addition, HPV 18 also causes more than 35% of cervical adenocarcinomas, which are difficult to detect by current screening methods. Additionally, HPV 52 and 58 are as prevalent as HPV 16 and 18 in patients with preinvasive and cervical cancer in Taiwan and Asian countries.

Approximately 50% of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and 80% of LSILs are infected by oncogenic types of HPV. HPV DNA testing for patients with ASCUS provides useful information and allows referral of patients for immediate colposcopy to detect high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and cancer. In contrast, oncogenic HPV DNA testing is not informative for triage of patients with LSILs because a high percentage of LSIL patients are HPV positive. A repeat Pap smear in 3–6 months or direct biopsy under colposcopy is generally used in clinical practice. Development of alternative triage strategies for women with LSILs would be valuable in distinguishing women with LSILs that have high probabilities of progression to HSILs from women with LSILs that have spontaneously regressed.

I.4 Management of LSIL (CIN 1) or Less Preceded by ASC-H or HSIL Cytology

Guideline: When CIN 2+ is not identified histologically after an ASC-H or HSIL cytology result, it is acceptable to review the cytologic, histologic, and colposcopic findings. If the review yields a revised interpretation, management should follow guidelines for the revised diagnosis (CIII). When CIN 2+ is not identified, HSIL cytology is managed more aggressively than ASC-H cytology. For cytology showing HSIL, but biopsy showing histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less, either an immediate diagnostic excisional procedure or observation with HPV-based testing and colposcopy at 1 year is acceptable, provided in the latter case that the initial colposcopic examination fully visualized the squamocolumnar junction and the upper limit of any lesion, and that the endocervical sampling, if collected, was less than CIN 2 (BII). For ASC-H, if the colposcopic examination can fully visualize the squamocolumnar junction and the upper limit of any lesion and that the endocervical sampling, if collected, is negative, observation at 1 year with HPV-based testing is recommended; a diagnostic excisional procedure is not recommended (BII). For both HSIL and ASC-H cytology, if observation is elected, and all tests are negative at the 1-year visit, repeat HPV-based testing is recommended in 1 year (at 2 years from the original cytology). If all tests are negative at both the 1- and 2-year follow-up visits, return for retesting with HPV-based testing in 3 years is recommended, then proceed with long-term surveillance (Section J.3). If any test is abnormal during the observation period, repeat colposcopy is recommended, and management based on resulting biopsies is recommended. A diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended for patients with HSIL cytology results at either the 1- or 2-year visit, or ASC-H results that persist at the 2-year visit (CIII) (see Figures 9, 10).

### Comprehensive overview of genotype distribution and prevalence of human papillomavirus in cervical lesions [^112tbK7y]. Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

4.4 Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL

ASC-H is a heterogeneous diagnostic category with cytological changes suggestive of HSIL, accounting for 5–10% of atypical squamous cells in TBS for reporting cervical cytology. Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Care Plan data indicated that ASC-H confers a higher risk of CIN3+ over time than ASC-US or LSIL, and the high rate of HPV detection in women with ASC-H makes reflex HPV testing unsuitable. Both the 2012 and 2019 ASCCP guidelines recommended that for women with ASC-H cytology, colposcopy should be performed regardless of HPV result. They also noted that reflex HPV testing is not recommended in this setting. Many studies have demonstrated that HPV-positive rates in women with ASC-H Pap test results were 50–60% and women with ASC-H Pap with negative HPV tests would have a very low risk of high-grade cervical lesions. – In the USA, many laboratories provide reflex HPV testing for ASC-H Pap.HPV testing results can provide useful risk stratification information in women with ASC-H Pap tests.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^114TLCUE]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

B. INTRODUCTION

This is the fourth American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP)-sponsored consensus guidelines for management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities, after the original consensus conferences in 2001and subsequent updates in 2006and 2012. An interim guidance publication providing management recommendations for primary HPV screening was released in 2015. This document updates and replaces all previous guidance. The key difference between 2019 guidelines and previous versions is the change from primarily test results–based algorithms (e.g. "Colposcopy is recommended for patients with HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]", etc.) to primarily "risk-based" guidelines (e.g. "Colposcopy is recommended for any combination of history and current test results yielding a 4.0% or greater probability of finding CIN 3+", etc.). See Box 1 for essential changes. Tables of risk estimates for possible combinations of current screening test results and screening history (including unknown history) have been generated from a prospective longitudinal cohort of more than 1.5 million patients followed for more than a decade at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). All KPNC estimates of risk underlying guideline decisions are detailed in the accompanying article by Egemen et al. The applicability of these risk estimates to other United States regions and populations has been confirmed in other data sets from screening programs and clinical trials. Many patients, especially those with minor abnormalities, can be managed by identifying their risk level using Tables 1A to 5B in Egemen et al and linking it to a recommended clinical action (return to routine screening, surveillance with repeat testing at 1- or 3-year intervals, colposcopy, or treatment). To facilitate use of these tables, the same information will be accessible via smartphone app (for purchase) and web (no cost) through. Decision aids may facilitate use of the tables. Common abnormalities are managed using risk estimates outlined in Section E, and rare abnormalities are managed via the result-specific consensus recommendations outlined in Sections G-K.

### Adherence to guidelines for follow-up of low-grade cytologic abnormalities among medically underserved women [^117Mk6Ft]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether women in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) who had findings on a Papanicolaou (Pap) test of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were followed up in accordance with the interim guidelines for management of abnormal cervical cytology.

Methods

For this study period, the guidelines for a Pap result of ASC-US or LSIL specified follow-up by Pap tests repeated every 4 to 6 months for 2 years. If a second report of ASC-US or LSIL was made, the patient was to have colposcopy. We analyzed data from 10,004 women who had a result of ASC-US or LSIL followed by a second ASC-US or LSIL from 1991–2000.

Results

As judged by the guidelines, 44% of women who had 2 low-grade abnormalities were followed up appropriately with colposcopy. Among women with 2 ASC-US results, those aged less than 30 years were more likely to receive colposcopy than the other age groups, while women who were aged 60 years and older were more likely to be followed up with a third Pap test. For each of the 4 result groups, American Indian or Alaska Native women had the highest percentages of a third Pap test, whereas Black or African-American women had a higher percentage of no follow-up.

Conclusion

More than one half of the women studied were not followed up in accordance with the established guidelines for managing abnormal cervical cytology. Factors such as age and race or ethnicity influence whether women with cytologic abnormalities receive appropriate follow-up.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^116tgZFm]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Recommended management of women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) states that colposcopy is recommended for managing women with LSIL, except in special populations (AII). Endocervical sampling is preferred for nonpregnant women in whom no lesions are identified (BII) and for those with an unsatisfactory colposcopy (AII), but is acceptable for those with a satisfactory colposcopy and a lesion identified in the transformation zone (CII). After colposcopy when cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is not identified, acceptable options are testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) at 12 months or repeat cervical cytology at 6 and 12 months (BII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy", return to routine cytological screening is recommended (AII). If the HPV DNA test is positive or repeat cytology is ASC-US or greater, colposcopy is recommended (AII). Women with CIN should be managed according to the 2006 Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, and in the absence of histologically confirmed CIN, neither excisional nor ablative procedures are acceptable for the initial management of LSIL (EII).

### Human papillomavirus reporting: minimizing patient and laboratory risk [^112Gggw2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Risk management efforts in the cytology laboratory must address the gap between what can be achieved with medical history's most effective cancer screening test, the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, and even higher entrenched public expectations. Data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS) now provide level I clinical evidence from a large, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of ASCUS cases is generally the preferred method for initial assessment of the most prevalent category of abnormal Pap interpretation. The proposed combination of HPV DNA testing with cytologic Pap testing, the DNA Pap test, further shows the potential to nearly eliminate false-negative screening results, based on sensitivity and negative predictive values reported in available studies. Human papillomavirus DNA testing also appears to represent a significant enhancement for detection of endocervical adenocarcinomas, which are difficult to detect and prevent. Human papillomavirus DNA testing, when used in conjunction with cervical cytology, can significantly reduce risk to both the patient and the laboratory.

Validation of Risk-Based Guidelines

A previous validation effort in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry found risks there to be largely similar to that of KPNC. However, we further validated risk-based management for the initial screen using 3 cohorts: (1) the CDC NBCCEDP, (2) the Onclarity Human Papillomavirus Trial, and (3) the ATHENA study.

The CDC's NBCCEDP was established to provide low-income patients (defined as family income at or less than 250% of the federal poverty level) access to screening and diagnostic examinations for breast and cervical cancer. The NBCCEDP analysis cohort consisted of 363,544 patients 30 years and older with nonmissing HPV and cytology test results and no history of CIN 2+ histology. This population includes both patients undergoing screening with cotesting and patients undergoing primary cytology screening who had an HPV test to triage an ASC-US result. Patients also reported whether they had previously been screened. Using estimated risks from the CDC NBCCEDP, we conducted separate validation studies for patients who reported having a prior cytology test in the past 5 years (well-screened) versus those who reported that their prior cytology test occurred more than 5 years ago, that they were never screened, or that they did not know when they were last screened (screened rarely/never/unknown). Because most patients in the cohort had only a single screen, only the immediate risk of positive test results (i.e. HPV positive/NILM, HPV positive/ASC-US, or LSIL+) was available.

High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) — terminology, prevalence, and diagnostic yield: HSIL refers to cytological findings previously reported as moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, CIN 2, and CIN 3. The mean reporting rate of HSIL in US laboratories is 0.7%. In one US center, HSIL rates were 0.6% in women 20–29 years old, 0.2% in women 40–49 years, and 0.1% in women 50–59 years. A single colposcopic examination identifies CIN 2,3 or cancer in 53% to 66% of women with HSIL cytological results, CIN 2,3 or cancer is diagnosed in 84% to 97% of women evaluated using a loop electrosurgical excision, and approximately 2% of women with HSIL have invasive cancer.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^11685vKk]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal women with LSIL — acceptable options and follow-up: Acceptable options include reflex HPV DNA testing, repeat cytological testing at 6 and 12 months, and colposcopy (CIII). If the HPV DNA test is negative or if CIN is not identified at colposcopy, repeat cytology in 12 months is recommended, whereas if either the HPV DNA test is positive or the repeat cytology is ASC-US or greater, colposcopy is recommended (AII). If 2 consecutive repeat cytological tests are negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, return to routine cytological screening is recommended.

You are a gynecologist‐oncologist, I'm a healthy 30‐year‐old woman and have a positive Pap (low‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [LSIL]) and positive HPV 16. What should I do next?

ChatGPT
Colposcopy: Given the positive cervical smear and HPV 16 result, a colposcopy is strongly recommended. During this procedure, a colposcope (a specialized microscope) is used to closely examine the cervix for any abnormal areas.
Biopsy: If any abnormal areas are identified during the colposcopy, the gynecologist may perform a biopsy. This involves taking small samples of tissue from the cervix for further examination under a microscope.
Histologic evaluation: The biopsy samples will be sent to a pathology laboratory for histologic evaluation. A pathologist will analyze the tissue samples to determine the severity of the cellular changes and provide a definitive diagnosis.
Management based on histology and HPV 16: (a) LSIL/Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 1 (CIN1): If the biopsy confirms LSIL or CIN1, close observation with regular follow up is often recommended. This may involve repeat cervical smears at regular intervals (typically every 6–12 months) to monitor any changes. As you have tested positive for high‐risk HPV type 16, more frequent follow up and monitoring may be advised. (b) HPV‐related High‐Grade Lesions: If the biopsy reveals higher‐grade changes such as high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or CIN Grade 2 or 3 (CIN2/3), further evaluation and treatment may be required. Options may include LEEP, cold knife conization, or other excisional procedures to remove the abnormal tissue.

Erratum: 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines — when certain situations do not have specific guidance, using the 2012 updated consensus guidelines is acceptable. For individuals aged 25 or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 updated consensus guidelines are recommended for management of abnormal results. Specifically, the 2012 guidelines recommend colposcopy for all cytology results of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or higher for individuals aged 25 and above.

I. MANAGING HISTOLOGY RESULTS

Treatment Considerations for Patients 25 Years or Older

Individuals who exceed treatment thresholds may undergo expedited treatment, defined as excisional treatment without preceding histologic confirmation. However, most patients will require both screening test and colposcopic biopsy results to determine the next step in management. The following section outlines guiding principles to consider when managing these results. Treatment guidelines are dichotomized by younger than 25 years or 25 years or older because of high spontaneous regression rates of HPV infection and CIN 2 and low incidence of cancer in those younger than 25 years. Individuals younger than 25 years are discussed under Special Populations (Section K). The term "young women" is no longer used. The consensus guidelines recognize that patients of various ages are concerned with the potential impact of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes. Shared decision-making is especially critical when individuals consider treatment of histologic HSIL (CIN 2) and abnormalities with a relatively low likelihood of underlying CIN 3+, such as histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by HSIL or ASC-H cytology, or persistent histologic LSIL (CIN 1).

I.1 Management of Histologic HSIL, not Further Specified or Qualified

Histologic reporting of cervical biopsies has moved to the LAST/WHO criteria, but its uptake by pathologists has not been universal. The consensus recommendation of the LAST guidelines (Section F.1) is to qualify histologic HSIL using the CIN nomenclature (CIN 2 or CIN 3). Because of measurable regression rates for CIN 2, the present guidelines subdivide treatment options based on the CIN qualifiers of CIN 2 and CIN 3. However, pathology reports incorporating the LAST criteria may not specify a CIN diagnosis.

Guideline: Treatment is preferred if histologic HSIL cannot be specified (e.g. reported as histologic HSIL or histologic HSIL [CIN 2,3]) (CIII) (see Figure 7).

FIGURE 7
This figure describes the steps involved in clinical management of histologic HSIL.

Rationale: CIN 3 is considered a direct cervical cancer precursor. If CIN 3 cannot be excluded, managing the patient as if CIN 3 is present is preferred. This conservative approach was considered safest for patients. Alternatively, the clinician could call the pathologist to further qualify the CIN equivalent and issue an additional report, then manage using the revised diagnosis.

### The clinician's view: role of human papillomavirus testing in the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines for the management of abnormal cervical cytology and cervical cancer precursors [^111moMLk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) National Consensus Conference for the Management of Women With Cervical Cytological Abnormalities and Cervical Cancer Precursors was held on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Md, September 6–8, 2001. The conference was attended by 121 representatives from 29 national organizations interested in cervical cancer screening issues. For the first time, guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cytology, developed from evidence-based literature, were presented to delegates from the majority of organizations with interest in cervical cancer screening, voted on, and revised when necessary to achieve a majority two-thirds approval. This development of consensus-approved guidelines is likely to be considered one of the most important milestones to date in the management of women with abnormal cervical cytology. The timing of this Consensus Conference resulted from the convergence of many different factors, including new cytologic terminology developed at the Bethesda 2001 workshop and publication of the enrollment data from the National Cancer Institute's Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US)/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL) Triage Study, otherwise known as ALTS. Additionally, new preliminary longitudinal ALTS data provided much of the information on the natural history of abnormal Papanicolaou tests and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), as well as data on the performance of both new liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in the management of women following colposcopy. The result was a large database of new information that provided the foundation for the ASCCP Consensus Conference. This article covers only the recommendations of the ASCCP Guidelines that were based in large part on the results of the ALTS trial. Therefore, the focus is on the management of women with equivocal (ASC-US) and low-grade (LSIL) cytologic abnormalities. Management of women with these cytologic abnormalities has been particularly problematic, because individually these women are at least risk for CIN 3 and cancer, yet their sheer numerical dominance ensures that they account for the majority of high-grade CIN detected in the United States in the follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology. Data from ALTS confirmed that women with ASC-US could be safely managed by any of the conventional approaches (repeat Papanicolaou test, immediate colposcopy, or HPV testing), but that the preferred management approach for women having an ASC-US report from liquid-based cytology was to assess the patient's risk by testing for HPV. Additionally, longitudinal ALTS data determined that repeat liquid-based cytology at 6 and 12 months and an HPV test at 12 months were nearly equivalent options in the follow-up of women referred for HPV-positive ASC or LSIL, yet not found to have CIN 2+ at initial colposcopy. Therefore, all follow-up recommendations for women with CIN 1 or lower postcolposcopy findings include these 2 options. The data and the recommendations for the management of ASC-US, ASC cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and LSIL are discussed.

### The risk of developing cervical cancer in the elderly: who benefits from screening after the age of 60? [^116Jy4h3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

For reporting of cervical smears, The Dutch CISOE-A classification system, which can easily be translated into the Bethesda nomenclature, was used. People with an abnormal index smear, including ASC-US, atypical glandular cells (AGC), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude a high-grade lesion (ASC-H), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), were identified from the Dutch nationwide pathology databank (Palga; Houten, Netherlands). Next, index cytology as well as follow-up cytology were categorized as high-grade (HSIL and ASC-H) and low-grade (ASC-US and LSIL). Histology samples were classified as low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), grade 1 (CIN1), and high-grade CIN (CIN2 and CIN3). Only histological results with a clear pathological description of invasive disease were classified as cancer. The group with no CIN during follow-up included people with normal histology or cytology results, or people without cytology or histology follow-up results after their index smear, indicating that no cervical premalignancy or malignancy has been diagnosed. To account for prevalent hrHPV-related CIN and cervical cancer, abnormal Pap smears and CIN lesions were censored for 2 years after inclusion because these indicate immediate follow-up after the index smear. People with cervical cancer or a hysterectomy within 2 years were excluded from analysis. Follow-up for people undergoing a hysterectomy after 2 years was censored from the date of the hysterectomy and follow-up for people diagnosed with cervical cancer after 2 years was censored from the date of the diagnosis because some were not treated surgically but received chemoradiation. The general follow-up protocol after an abnormal Pap smear in the Netherlands in this period was a colposcopy, either or not combined with a biopsy or loop excision of the transformation zone, depending on the assessment of the colposcopist, followed by follow-up for at least 12 months depending on the cytology and hrHPV result. In the Netherlands, treatment of CIN2 and CIN3 is advised for postmenopausal women and see-and-treat loop excision of the transformation zone is offered in case of high-grade cytology and a high-grade impression during colposcopy.

### The effect of time interval between referral and colposcopy on detection of human papillomavirus DNA and on outcome of biopsy [^117LFmRV]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess the effect of the time interval between referral cytology and the outcome of colposcopically directed biopsy in relation to human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction in women referred after abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears.

Study Design

The study enrolled 453 women who were referred for colposcopic examination after two Pap smears were reported as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and 553 women who were referred with a single smear reported as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL).

Results

The results in both patient groups were evaluated in time intervals of 60 days or more, 61 to 120 days, and more than 120 days between referral and colposcopy. A higher proportion of white women than African American women and Hispanic women were seen within 60 days after referral in both referral groups. Women of all race/ethnic backgrounds referred with HSIL were seen within 60 days in a significantly larger proportion than women referred with ASCUS/LSIL. Women referred with ASCUS/LSIL had an increasing frequency of negative HPV findings with the prolonged time intervals. In women referred with a single smear of HSIL, there was a significantly decreasing trend over time in detection of low-risk and unidentified types of HPV and an increasing trend of HPV DNA negative results.

Conclusion

The frequency of high-risk HPV DNA was similar in patients referred with ASCUS/LSIL or HSIL. In both referral groups, there was a time-dependent increase of negative biopsy results and a decreased frequency of low-risk HPV or of unidentified HPV types. This suggests that the initial abnormality on the Pap smear associated with other than high-risk HPV types may regress over time. The presence of high-risk HPV DNA does not predict the actual histologically verifiable tissue changes but indicates a lower probability of negative biopsy results in all time intervals between referral and biopsy.

### Clinical importance of "low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL-H) " terminology for cervical smears 5-year analysis of the positive predictive value of LSIL-H compared with ASC-H, LSIL, and HSIL in the detection of high-grade cervical lesions with a review of the literature [^1166WsUz]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared follow-up biopsy findings and positive predictive values (PPVs) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse (CIN 2+) in cases that were cytologically interpreted as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL); high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL); LSIL, cannot exclude HSIL (LSIL-H); and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) during a 5-year period to evaluate the clinical significance of LSIL-H as a distinct cytological category.

Methods

All Pap tests with a diagnosis of LSIL-H, ASC-H, LSIL, and HSIL (January 1, 2004-July 20, 2009) were retrieved from our computer database. PPVs of cytological diagnostic categories for detecting CIN 2+ were compared.

Results

Of all Pap tests (n = 163,315), 1713 cases that had histological confirmation were included in the study. The LSIL-H diagnosis represented only 0.23% (n = 387) of all Pap tests and 9.3% of all cytological SILs (n = 4119). LSIL alone was associated with a significantly lower risk for CIN 2+ (PPV = 21%) as compared with LSIL-H (PPV = 40%). The results showed that the risk of CIN 2+ was intermediate for LSIL-H compared with unqualified LSIL (p < 0.005) and HSIL (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The current study is one of the largest LSIL-H series to date. Because of its intermediate status between LSIL and HSIL, LSIL-H should be considered a distinct diagnostic category, and specific cytomorphological criteria should be defined. The results suggest that an LSIL-H diagnostic category would aid in more rapid detection and treatment in some patients with CIN 2+.

### Assessment of follow-up for low-grade cytological abnormalities in the national breast and cervical cancer early detection program, 2000–2005 [^1176VUav]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the management of women in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) before and after the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines for management of abnormal cytology were published in 2002.

Materials and Methods

We examined the follow-up for 22,342 women with LSIL during 2 periods: 2000–2002 and 2003–2005.

Results

The percentage of providers who followed the recommended guidelines with colposcopy for an LSIL Pap test result increased by 9% from the pre-ASCCP to the post-ASCCP period. An increase was seen in every age and racial/ethnic group. Younger women (< 30 years) and white women were more likely than comparison groups to be followed by colposcopy rather than a repeat Pap test.

Conclusions

The increase in percentage of women having colposcopy in 2003, 1 year after the new guidelines were published, suggests a change in provider practices consistent with those guidelines.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests [^115dx48i]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

A group of 146 experts representing 29 organizations and professional societies met September 18–19, 2006, in Bethesda, MD, to develop revised evidence-based, consensus guidelines for managing women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests. Recommendations for managing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) are essentially unchanged. Changes were made for managing these conditions in adolescents for whom cytological follow-up for 2 years was approved. Recommendations for managing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and atypical glandular cells (AGC) also underwent only minor modifications. More emphasis is placed on immediate screen-and-treat approaches for HSIL. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is incorporated into the management of AGC after their initial evaluation with colposcopy and endometrial sampling. The 2004 Interim Guidance for HPV testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology for screening in women 30 years of age and older was formally adopted with only very minor modifications.

### Screening properties of human papillomavirus testing for predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion smears: a prospective study [^114X7yUq]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to determine the usefulness of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and 2 to 3 on cervical biopsies in women who had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) on Papanicolaou tests. In this prospective cohort, 167 women with abnormal cytologic examination (ASCUS and LSIL) were evaluated by colposcopy-directed biopsy and endocervical curettage. Colposcopy was performed on all study participants to obtain cervical tissue for histologic examination for detection of underlying CIN in patients with an initial cytologic test result of ASCUS and LSIL. A sample for HPV DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction was obtained. The HPV type 16 was positive in 35.4% of the 167 women with abnormal cytologic examination result in our gynecologic outpatient's clinic. Histologic diagnosis of CIN 1 was found in 45 of 135 women with ASCUS and in 17 of 32 women with LSIL. According to the cytologic findings, the frequency of CIN grade 2 or 3 in patients classified as ASCUS and LSIL was 12.5% (17/135) and 18.7% (6/32), respectively. Of the ASCUS smears, 9.6% were positive for HPV type 16. The sensitivity of the HPV type 16 using polymerase chain reaction technique threshold in detecting CIN 1 and CIN 2 to 3 was 57% and 46% in ASCUS-LSIL cytologic examination, respectively. The positive predictive value of HPV type 16 ranged from 60% in patients with CIN 1 and 42% in CIN 2 to 3 in ASCUS-LSIL. By contrast, negative predictive value was 58% in patients with CIN 1 and 80% in CIN 2 to 3. The low positive predictive value of HPV testing with ASCUS smears suggests that HPV positivity could be not used for predicting the presence of CIN 2 to 3.

### 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical screening tests [^112PDT2C]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Medium credibility.

2006 consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical screening — major management updates include that the core recommendations for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) were changed minimally, and postcolposcopy management for these cytological abnormalities is now identical; for special populations such as adolescents a more conservative approach incorporating cytologic follow-up for 2 years was approved. For high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and atypical glandular cells, core recommendations underwent only minor modification, with more emphasis placed on immediate "screen-and-treat" approaches when managing women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA is incorporated into the management of women with atypical glandular cells after initial evaluation with colposcopy and endometrial sampling, and use of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to cervical cytology for screening in women 30 years and older was formally adopted with only very minor modifications.

### European guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening. second edition – summary document [^112DSDs2]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

guidelines for management of screen-positive women

A woman with a high-grade cytological lesion, a repeated low-grade lesion or an equivocal cytology result and a positive HPV test should be referred for colposcopy. The role of colposcopy is to identify the location of the abnormal cells, to target taking of biopsies and to decide whether any treatment is required. Colposcopy should only be carried out by adequately trained health professionals.
Guidelines are provided for the management of ASC-US and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Guidelines for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are difficult to delineate because current evidence does not indicate that any method of management is optimal. Repeat cytology or colposcopy are acceptable options, but HPV testing as an initial management option is not sufficiently selective for all women with LSIL. However, HPV testing in older women with LSIL can be considered.
Quality assurance and collection of data on patient management are important elements of the management and follow-up of women referred with an abnormal cervical smear.
Colposcopy is sometimes proposed as an alternative screening method, but its specificity (and probably also its sensitivity) in primary screening is too low for this purpose.

### Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion? Concordance between the interpretation of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion in Papanicolaou tests: results from the college of American pathologists PAP education program [^115Rff57]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Obtaining diagnostic concordance for squamous intraepithelial lesions in cytology can be challenging.

Objective —

To determine diagnostic concordance for biopsy-proven low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) Papanicolaou test slides in the College of American Pathologists PAP Education program.

Design —

We analyzed 121059 responses from 4251 LSIL and HSIL slides for the interval 2004 to 2013 using a nonlinear mixed-model fit for reference diagnosis, preparation type, and participant type. We evaluated interactions between the reference diagnosis and the other 2 factors in addition to a repeated-measures component to adjust for slide-specific performance.

Results —

There was a statistically significant difference between misclassification of LSIL (2.4%; 1384 of 57664) and HSIL (4.4%; 2762 of 63395). There was no performance difference between pathologists and cytotechnologists for LSIL, but cytotechnologists had a significantly higher HSIL misclassification rate than pathologists (5.5%; 1437 of 27534 versus 4.0%; 1032 of 25630; p = 0.01), and both were more likely to misrepresent HSIL as LSIL (P < .001) than the reverse. ThinPrep LSIL slides were more likely to be misclassified as HSIL (2.4%; 920 of 38582) than SurePath LSIL slides (1.5%; 198 of 13196), but conventional slides were the most likely to be misclassified in both categories (4.5%; 266 of 5886 for LSIL, and 6.5%; 573 of 8825 for HSIL).

Conclusions —

More participants undercalled HSIL as LSIL (false-negative) than overcalled LSIL as HSIL (false-positive) in the PAP Education program, with conventional slides more likely to be misclassified than ThinPrep or SurePath slides. Pathologists and cytotechnologists classify LSIL equally well, but cytotechnologists are significantly more likely to undercall HSIL as LSIL than are pathologists.

### Routine cervical screening with primary HPV testing and cytology triage protocol in a randomised setting [^111HNquU]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Finnish cervical screening programme

Finnish cervical screening programme is organised and nation-wide, targeted for 30–60-year-old women. Individual municipalities are responsible for the costs and practical arrangements. The screening interval is 5 years, unless intensified (or risk group) screening is indicated by previous screening test result or reported symptoms; in this case, the screening interval is shortened to 1 year. Women belonging to the target population are identified from the national Population Registry and invited by a personal letter to free cervical screening. During the screening visit a trained nurse or midwife takes the screening sample, traditionally a cytological smear of three cervicovaginal subsamples (vaginal, cervical and endocervical), that is, a VCE smear. In addition to this, for each participant the sample-taker fills an information form of recent gynaecological history. Completed forms and fixed samples are sent to screening laboratories for further processing and analysis. Eventually, screening results are mailed from the screening laboratories to the attended women. However, if colposcopy is indicated on the basis of the screening result, the woman is generally contacted first by phone.

Primary smear analysis is performed in screening laboratories by cytotechnicians. A pathologist re-screens all the slides with any abnormalities and a small fraction of the slides classified normal. The cytology results are reported according to modified Papanicolaou classification, in which the specimen adequacy is evaluated and descriptive diagnosis given in addition to designating the cytological findings class I (normal) through to class V (malignant). Women with class III–V smears (mild, moderate and severe dyskaryosis as well as carcinoma cells in British terminology; ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL and glandular atypia in TBS 2001) are directly referred for colposcopy. Instead, class II smears (borderline changes in British terminology, reactive and ASC-US in TBS 2001) are considered essentially benign in cellular changes and, thus, they are most often recommended to control for by a new smear after 6–12 months or after the possible medicinal treatment. In addition, in most municipalities women with class II smears are invited to intensified screening after 1 year. Screening-induced colposcopies and other possible confirmatory tests are conducted mainly in regional hospitals, where the possible histologically confirmed precancerous lesions are treated and their postoperational follow-up is carried out. Women with negative histological confirmation are invited to intensified screening a year after.

### Age-specific prevalence of HPV genotypes in cervical cytology samples with equivocal or low-grade lesions [^112UA8z6]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Awareness of the causal relationship between HPV infection and cervical cancer has made the detection of the virus an attractive approach to identify women at risk of developing cervical cancer. This approach, which is particularly important in cases of minor cytological abnormalities, is internationally accepted for use in cases of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). However, it has not been generally recommended in cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) because of the high prevalence of oncogenic HPV in this group. Women with minor cytological abnormalities account for a large proportion of those referred for further investigation, a process resulting in psychological stress and considerable health-care costs.

In Sweden, about 3–5% of all smears show some kind of abnormality, almost 80% of which are minor cytological changes. Current Swedish guidelines for management of minor abnormalities do not include HPV testing; rather, a second Pap smear or colposcopy is required. The question whether HPV testing may improve the Swedish screening programme is under discussion, especially in the light of the potential to identify precancerous lesions among ASCUS and LSIL and to distinguish these from reactive or degenerative lesions. According to our previous study, complementing liquid-based cytology (LBC) with an HPV test in cases of ASCUS and LSIL may lead to a 40% decrease in the number of these women referred for further investigation. Human papillomavirus prevalence is high among younger women with LSIL, which is why an age limit for triage HPV testing is being sought. We wished to compare the age-specific prevalence of HR-HPV in these cytological categories to show that difference in prevalence is not an argument against triage testing.

The purpose of our study was to identify the HPV types present among women with minor cytological abnormalities using the PCR-based Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and to describe the prevalence of multiple infections in relation to age before the implementation of vaccination programmes.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management — after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

Anal carcinoma — LSIL/HSIL terminology, diagnosis, and progression risk: The Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) Project recommended unified terminology whereby condyloma and AIN 1 are referred to as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and AIN 2 and 3 as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL); HSIL (AIN 2/3) can be a precursor to anal cancer, and LSIL/HSIL are diagnosed by digital anorectal examination (DRE/DARE) and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), followed by anal pap smear (cytology) and/or biopsy. In a prospective cohort of 550 MSM who were HIV-positive, conversion of HSIL to anal cancer was 18% (7/38) at a median follow-up of 2.3 years.

### Risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 + among women with a history of previous treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: ASCUS and LSIL pap smears after treatment [^114xXjWb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the current study was to describe outcomes among women with low-grade abnormalities on cervical cytology screening in the setting of previous excisional or ablative treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).

Methods

Study participants were recruited into the Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants. At enrollment, the patient's previous cytology results, previous colposcopic biopsy results, and previous cervical procedures were recorded. Study procedures included collection of biospecimens followed by colposcopy and biopsy. From clinical records, additional information regarding previous treatment for CIN was collected.

Results

Two hundred seventy-four women had an atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS) referral Pap and 532 women had a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) referral Pap. For patients with an ASCUS referral Pap, previous treatment was associated with an odds ratio for CIN 2+ (45.0% vs 28.2% of untreated patients) of 2.08 (95% confidence interval = 1.05–4.13, p = .04). For patients with an LSIL referral Pap, 33.3% of those women with previous treatment had CIN 2+ compared with 16.7% of those patients enrolled with no previous treatment (odds ratio = 2.49, 95% confidence interval = 1.12–5.51, p = .03).

Conclusions

Patients with a history of previous treatment for CIN have a 2-fold risk of CIN 2+ at the time of colposcopy referral for ASCUS or LSIL cervical cytology.

### Effects of implementing the dual Papanicolaou test interpretation of ASC-H and LSIL following bethesda 2014 [^1125xJ9K]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of implementing the dual interpretation of atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) after the Bethesda System 2014 and to compare it with other indeterminate interpretations.

Methods

Rates of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity and histologic follow-up and the proportion of women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on histologic follow-up were compared for the combined interpretation of ASC-H and LSIL (ASCHL) and the categories of LSIL, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL-H) and ASC-H.

Results

The percentage of ASCHL HPV-positive cases (86.0%) was similar to that of LSIL-H but significantly higher in comparison to that of ASC-H. The rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+)and CIN 3+ for ASCHL (29.6% and 3.6%, respectively) were similar to those of LSIL-H and ASC-H. When stratified by HPV test results, the proportions of patients with CIN 2+and CIN 3+ remained statistically similar to those with ASCHL and with LSIL-H and ASC-H.

Conclusions

Considering the similar risks of CIN 2+and CIN 3+for ASCHL and ASC-H, having a separate category of ASCHL for reporting cervical cytology appears to be redundant.

FIGURE 12
This figure describes management of cytologic abnormalities in patients younger than 25 years.

FIGURE 13
This figure describes management of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) in patients younger than 25 years.

Rationale: HPV vaccination became available in the United States in 2006, and patients at the target age for vaccination have now entered the younger than 25-year age group. Consequently, population-level risks of CIN 3+ for a given screening results are expected to decrease through a combination of individual and herd immunity. Observation is indicated for low-grade cytology results (ASC-US, LSIL), which are likely to represent non-16/18 HPV infections with a high probability for regression and low risk for rapid progression to cancer. Accurate risk estimation for this age group is very difficult because vaccination is rapidly changing population-level CIN 3+ risk and the conservative 2012 management guidelines recommend against colposcopy/biopsy for lesser cytology abnormalities, which limits the ability to accurately measure CIN 3+ rates in this age group. Therefore, in the absence of new compelling data to change management in this age group, the 2012 algorithms are carried forward. The guidelines outlined in this document are designed to adapt to changes in population vaccination coverage as well as new technologies, and we anticipate that incorporating HPV vaccination effects on the population-level prevalence of HPV infections will affect management recommendations in the near future.

Management of Cytology ASC-H and HSIL in Patients Younger Than 25 Years

Guideline: Colposcopy is recommended for patients younger than 25 years with ASC-H or HSIL cytology (AII). Immediate treatment without histologic confirmation is not recommended (see Figure 13).

Rationale: Although overall CIN 3+ prevalence is lower, cytology results of ASC-H are associated with higher risks of CIN 3+ than ASC-US, even in patients younger than 25. Therefore, colposcopy is warranted to evaluate the cervix for CIN 3+. Immediate treatment without histologic confirmation is not warranted in this population because of the high rate of resolution of CIN 2+ and the potential harms of treatment.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^1114nyBo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — patients younger than 25 years, initial management after an abnormal screening test result: In patients younger than 25 years with low-grade cytology screening results, repeat cytology alone at 1 and 2 years after the initial abnormal result is recommended (BII). Colposcopy is recommended if high-grade cytology is found at any point (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL], atypical squamous cells — cannot exclude HSIL [ASC-H], atypical glandular cells [AGC], adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) or if low-grade cytology persists at the 2-year follow-up visit (BII). If reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is performed and the results are negative, repeat cytology in 3 years is recommended (BII). After 2 consecutive negative cytology results, return to routine age-based screening is recommended (BII). If colposcopy is performed and the results are less than CIN 2 (i.e., histologic low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL; CIN 1] or less), repeat cytology in 1 year (BII), and manage as above (e.g., repeat cytology for ASC-US/LSIL, colposcopy for ASC-H or higher).

### The probability for a pap test to be abnormal is directly proportional to HPV viral load: results from a Swiss study comparing HPV testing and liquid-based cytology to detect cervical cancer precursors in 13, 842 women [^112D3Xk7]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Biopsy results

Of the 1334 women with abnormal tests, 1086 (81.4%) underwent colposcopy with biopsy. Out of 1086, 1031 (95%) biopsies were satisfactory for evaluation. A total of 18.5% women (248/ out of 1334) refused to be colposcoped, missed appointments or underwent the follow-up in other laboratories. In order to verify the negative group (HPV−CYTO−), random invitations for colposcopy were regularly sent to women with both tests negative during the study. Since some women declined to participate, up to 700 invitations were sent before being able to gather the target number of 500. Finally, 502 women with normal tests were colposcoped and biopsied. These biopsy results were divided into three categories: normal, LSIL (CIN 1) and HSIL (CIN2/3). No invasive lesion was found on cytology and biopsy in any group. The details of the results are presented in Table 1, where biopsy results are crossed to CYTO and HPV results. Table 2 presents biopsy results according to the HPV/CYTO subsets. A key result is that 41.5% of all histologic HSIL lesions were found in the subset HPV+CYTO−.

Sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of CYTO and HPV

The unbiased estimation of frequencies of lesions (normal, LSIL and HSIL) per HPV/CYTO subset for the entire study population (Table 3) permits calculation of unbiased sensitivity and specificity for detection of histologic HSIL (95% confidence interval in parentheses). Sensitivity is 58.7% (48.6–68.2) for CYTO and 97% (91.8–99.4) for HPV, while specificity is 96.9% (96.6–97.2) for CYTO and 92.4% (91.9–92.9) for HPV. The negative predictive value of CYTO and HPV are, respectively, 99.75 (99.67–99.83) and 99.98 (99.96–100). On the basis of the fact that no histologic HSIL lesion was found in the 502 randomly chosen women negative for both tests, the negative predictive value of the combination of negative tests HPV and CYTO estimated for all 13 842 patients is 100% (99.98–100).

### Review of triage strategies for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among young women [^114KxELJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In Norway, health authorities recommend that women aged 25–69 years have a screening Pap smear every 3 years. The HPV test was adopted in Norway for screening in 2005 as a form of delayed triage. HPV test is performed during repeat cytology, 6–12 months after the diagnosis of ASC‐US/LSIL instead of at the time of initial ASC‐US/LSIL. Before 2005, ASC‐US was managed by repeating cytology alone. At the time of repeat, women with normal Pap test and HPV+ test would have to repeat the HPV test within 12 months, whereas HSIL or repeat ASC‐US/LSIL‐HPV+ test are referred for colposcopy/biopsy immediately after triage. Although this delayed triage increased the detection of CIN2+, it is unlikely that it also increased the referrals to colposcopy. In addition, even if the rates fell in women referred back to the screening program indicating better risk stratification, it cost a lot to the program since more women undergo colposcopy and biopsy. Moreover, the lowest specificity was observed in women under 34 years of age (47%).

### Hr-HPV testing in the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy [^1149mvG3]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The success of any cervical cancer prevention programme relies on the interplay between the underlying risk factors and the type of screening programme: an organised programme is more effective than an opportunistic programme. Furthermore, the existence and quality of the field and laboratory facilities for screening and diagnostic follow-up, as well as the facilities available for treating diagnosed lesions, are key elements of any screening programme. Monitoring the patient path or 'chain of action' for each patient with an abnormal screening result is of crucial importance. In Italy, despite the availability of well-functioning screening programmes spreading all over the country, the follow-up protocol after abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy is not clearly defined.

While existing uniformity of indications in case of cytological abnormalities and diagnosis of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) (excisional therapy), there is no uniformity of indications for the abnormal cytology. The European guidelines suggest the hr-HPV test in the follow-up after negative colposcopy only for some cytological results: Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US), Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) and Atypical Squamous Cells cannot exclude a High-Grade Lesion (ASC-H). However, these indications are not universally applied in the Italian cervical cancer screening programmes and in majority of the programmes the follow-up of abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy is usually managed according to the gynaecologist judgment.

I.5 Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) Diagnosed Repeatedly for at Least 2 Years

Guideline: For patients 25 years or older with histologic LSIL (CIN 1) who is diagnosed at consecutive visits for at least 2 years, observation is preferred (BII) but treatment is acceptable (CIII). If treatment is selected and the entire squamocolumnar junction and all lesions were fully visualized during colposcopic examination, either excision or ablation treatments are acceptable (CII).

Rationale: Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) is the histologic manifestation of HPV infection. CIN 1 may be associated with oncogenic (high-risk) or low-risk HPV infections and may be due to persistent infection with 1 type or sequential infections with different types. HPV 16 is less common in CIN 1 than in CIN 3. Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) and cytologic ASC-US/HPV+ and LSIL are the same biologically and thus should be managed similarly. Regression rates are high, especially in younger patients, and subsequent diagnosis of CIN 2+ is uncommon regardless of whether CIN 1 is found on endocervical sampling or a biopsy of the transformation zone. The KPNC data showed a similar, relatively low 5-year risk of CIN 3+ of approximately 2% when CIN 1 or no lesion was found on colposcopy/biopsy after HPV-positive cytologic ASC-US or LSIL. In the KPNC data set of individuals with CIN 1 on biopsy on 2 consecutive visits, the subsequent follow-up demonstrated that 52% were HPV negative, 48% were HPV positive, and of the HPV-positive group, 92% had NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL cytology. A study of 126 women undergoing LEEP for CIN 1 diagnosed at consecutive visits for 2 years found that 87% had CIN 1 or negative pathology, whereas 13% had histologic HSIL (CIN 2+). Based on these data, and considering the potential harms of treatment, the present recommendations prefer continued observation of those with histologic LSIL (CIN1) diagnosed on consecutive visits for at least 2 years. Treatment is an acceptable option based on patient preference, after shared decision-making. Because the immediate estimated CIN3+ risk is less than the 25% treatment threshold, this is considered a special situation.

### Natural history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 in primigravida [^112KzHm8]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2003). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES.: The purpose of our prospective cohort study was to determine whether cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 regresses, persists, or progresses during pregnancy. Eighty-four primigravid patients, ages 16 to 32 years old (mean 26), with no history of abnormal Pap smear, had abnormal Pap test results during their prenatal care between August 1995 and December 1998. The initial Pap results on these patients were: 57 (67.8%) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; 21 (25%) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL); and 6 (7.2%) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Colposcopy and directed biopsies performed showed: 21(25%) normal; 6 (7.2%) acute cervicitis; 9 (10.7%) chronic cervicitis; 39 (46.4%) CIN 1; 7 (8.3%) CIN 2; and 2 (2.4%) CIN 3. RESULTS.: Thirty-nine patients with LSIL were seen for follow-up colposcopy and biopsy in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum. Twenty-eight patients (71.8%) had a repeat normal (regression) as follows: 2 (7.1%) in the second trimester, 4 (14.3%) in the third trimester, and 22 (78.6%) postpartum. Three patients (7.7%) had progression. Eight patients (20.5%) had persistent CIN 1. CONCLUSIONS.: Our study found that more than 70% of CIN 1 was associated with pregnancy regression in primigravidas. Our study suggests the need for postpartum follow-up of all the patients diagnosed with CIN 1 during pregnancy. The follow-up should include a Pap smear. Patients without regression of LSIL by Pap smear at the postpartum visit should be thoroughly investigated and treated.

### Improved abnormal pap smear triage using cervical cancer biomarkers [^116T1MQm]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The current system of Pap smear screening and management of abnormal cytology has resulted in a marked reduction in invasive cervical cancer. Many women, however, are not found to have significant precursor lesions. This is due to the poor specificity of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) triage. More specific cervical cancer biomarkers may be more effective triage tools than hr-HPV. We evaluated whether a dual stain for p16 and Ki-67 might improve the triage of abnormal Pap smears.

Materials and Methods

p16/Ki-67 immunostaining was performed on additional slides prepared from 515 women with abnormal Pap smears (301 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASCUS], 169 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL], 29 atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade lesion [ASC-H], 16 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]). High-risk HPV typing was performed on all cases. Immunostaining and hr-HPV were compared in relation to their diagnostic accuracy for the detection of biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3. A cost analysis comparing hr-HPV versus immunostaining as the initial triage tool used for abnormal Pap smears was also performed.

Results

High-risk HPV was positive in 127 (42.2%) ASCUS, 129 (76.3%) LSIL, 20 (69.0%) ASC-H, and 15 (93.8%) HSIL. p16/Ki-67 was positive in 54 (17.9%) ASCUS, 73 (43.2%) LSIL, 19 (65.5%) ASC-H, and 15 (93.8%) HSIL. For detection of CIN 2/3, sensitivity/specificity of hr-HPV and p16/Ki-67 was 89.29%/14.94% and 96.43%/60.92%, respectively. Overall, diagnostic accuracy was statistically significantly higher for p16/Ki-67 compared with hr-HPV. Compared to HPV, immunostain triage could have generated approximately $46,000 savings in the study population.

Conclusions

The triage of abnormal Pap smears by p16/Ki-67 immunostaining shows comparable sensitivity, improved specificity, and significantly improved diagnostic performance when compared to hr-HPV. Immunostaining is of value in triaging LSIL and ASC-H Pap smears in addition to ASCUS. The widespread utilization of biomarker triage could result in significant health care cost savings without compromising the detection of significant cervical cancer precursors.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^113nuVv7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated risk of CIN 3+ based on history and current results that is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: One-year surveillance implies close follow-up for those whose risks fall between the Clinical Action Thresholds for colposcopy and 3-year follow-up. Consistent with the 2012 consensus recommendations, follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities: HPV-positive/NILM or HPV-negative/LSIL with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.1% respectively); 1-year surveillance is also recommended after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive ASC-US, or repeated HPV-positive NILM). New data for these guidelines find that the risk of CIN 3+ is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2. Based on lower CIN 3+ risks, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within an appropriate screening interval (approximately 5 years) or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year (see Figure 2). Of note, a previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

### Five-year risks of CIN 2 + and CIN 3 + among women with HPV-positive and HPV-negative LSIL pap results [^117K1jiU]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) Pap results do not typically lead to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. HPV triage is not cost-effective because most cases are HPV-positive. However, under new national guidelines recommending cotesting for women aged 30 to 64 years, clinicians will increasingly receive the HPV test result with LSIL Pap results. Some authors have suggested that HPV triage might be effective at older ages, when the percentage of HPV positivity among women with LSIL declines.

Methods

We estimated 5-year risks of CIN 2+ and CIN 3+ among 9,033 women aged 30 to 64 years who had both an HPV test and an LSIL Pap result.

Results

HPV positivity among women with LSIL decreased only slightly with age (30 to 34 vs 60 to 64 years, 88% vs 72%, p < .0001). The 5-year risks of CIN 2+ and CIN 3+ of women aged 30 to 64 years testing HPV-positive/LSIL were larger than those among women testing HPV-negative/LSIL (CIN 2+, 19% vs 5.1%, p < .0001; CIN 3+, 6.1% vs 2.0%, p < .0001). The 5-year risk of CIN 3+ in HPV-negative/LSIL women was similar to that for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) Pap test result without knowledge of HPV test results (2.0% vs 2.6%, p = .4).

Conclusions

HPV-negative/LSIL posed lower risk than other Pap results that guidelines currently recommend for referral to immediate colposcopy. By the principle of "equal management of equal risks", women with HPV-negative/LSIL might reasonably be managed similarly to those with ASC-US Pap results without knowledge of HPV testing, that is, retesting at 6 to 12 months, rather than immediate colposcopy. Although the HPV test result for LSIL Pap results provides actionable information to clinicians who screen with cotesting, the high HPV positivity of LSIL at even the oldest ages suggests the lack of cost-effectiveness of HPV triage of LSIL for clinicians who do not use routine cotesting.

### LSIL: definition and management [^115VCyMR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) has changed greatly over the past 2 decades. The most recent recommendations propose avoiding treatment while continuing to monitor patients for clearance of disease or a change to a more severe diagnosis. Knowledge of the correct way to manage LSIL is important because LSIL is a relatively common diagnosis found on cervical cytology. Especially since the introduction of liquid-based cytology, the diagnosis of LSIL has become more frequent. The College of American Pathologists estimated in 2003 that the reporting rate for LSIL was 2.9%.

§ Negative HPV test or cotest (HPV plus Pap test) results only reduce risk sufficiently to defer colposcopy if performed for screening purposes within the last 5 years. Colposcopy is still warranted if negative HPV test or cotest results occurred in the context of surveillance for a previous abnormal result.

¶ Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years. Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared decision-making.

The following are highlights of the new management guidelines:

Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk. º If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e. negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV positive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or cotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results would not similarly reduce risk). º Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients. º If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result (i.e. HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years (i.e. rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first. º When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.
When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management. º Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone. º HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal. º HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy. º If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test is normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.
HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result. º Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.
After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or severe dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least 25 years. º Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, and 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. º After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance includes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or cotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone. º Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after the initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age 65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the surveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.

### Definición de LSIL-diccionario de Cáncer del NCI… [^1113jvDe]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

LSILÁrea de células anormales que se forma en la superficie de ciertos órganos, como el cuello del útero, la vagina, la vulva, el ano y el esófago. Cuando se observa al microscopio, el aspecto de la LSIL es ligeramente anormal. Por lo general, la causa de estas lesiones es una infección por ciertos tipos de virus del papiloma humano. Estas lesiones se encuentran con una prueba de Pap o una biopsia. Con frecuencia, las LSIL desaparecen por sí solas sin necesidad de tratamiento, pero en ocasiones las células anormales se vuelven cancerosas y se diseminan al tejido cercano. La LSIL a veces se llama displasia leve. También se llama LEIBG y lesión escamosa intraepitelial de bajo grado.

Antes de que se formen las células cancerosas en los tejidos del cuello uterino, las células en este órgano tienen cambios anormales que se llaman displasia. Hay diferentes tipos de displasia: la displasia leve, llamada lesión intraepitelial de bajo grado, es un tipo y la displasia moderada o grave, llamada lesión intraepitelial de alto grado, es otro tipo. Tanto la LSIL como la HSIL se pueden convertir o no en cáncer. Consulte el Diccionario de cáncer del NCIEmpieza conContieneNavegar por letra inicial: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ#.

### Definition of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion… [^113BxkZG]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesionListen to pronunciationAn area of abnormal cells that forms on the surface of certain organs, such as the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, and esophagus. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions look slightly abnormal when looked at under a microscope. They are usually caused by infection with certain types of human papillomavirus and are found when a Pap test or biopsy is done. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions usually go away on their own without treatment, but sometimes they can become cancer and spread into nearby tissue. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion is sometimes called mild dysplasia. Also called LSIL.

The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the uterus that forms a canal between the uterus and vagina.

Before cancer cells form in tissues of the cervix, the cells of the cervix go through abnormal changes called dysplasia. There are different types of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia, called low-grade intraepithelial lesion is one type. Moderate or severe dysplasia, called high-grade intraepithelial lesion is another type of dysplasia. LSIL and HSIL may or may not become cancer.

### Regression of low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions in young women [^112TLSiC]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to assess the probability of low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (LSIL) regression in young women, and to examine the factors associated with this regression.

Methods

In a longitudinal study of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, female adolescents aged 13–22 years were examined every 4 months by cytology, colposcopy, and HPV DNA status. Both prevalent and incident LSIL cases were included in the analysis, with regression defined as at least three consecutive normal Pap smears.

Findings

Median follow-up time from baseline (defined as the time of first LSIL diagnosis) for the 187 women with LSIL was 61 months (IQR 34–80). Median time they had been sexually active at diagnosis was 3.2 years (2.6–6.5). Probability of regression for the entire cohort was 61% (95% CI 53–70) at 12 months and 91% (84–99) at 36 months of follow-up. No associations were found between LSIL regression and HPV status at baseline, sexual behaviour, contraceptive use, substance or cigarette use, incident sexually transmitted infection, or biopsy. Multivariate analysis showed that only HPV status at the current visit was associated with rate of regression, whether infection was caused by one or more viral types (relative hazard = 0.3 [95% CI 0.21–0.42], and 0.14 [0.08–0.25], respectively).

Interpretation

The high rate of regression recorded in this study lends support to observation by cytology in the management of LSIL in female adolescents. Negative HPV status was associated with regression, suggesting that HPV testing could be helpful in monitoring LSIL.

A positive cervical smear (LSIL) and positive HPV 16 indicate LSIL, which are abnormal cell changes in the cervix. While HPV 16 is considered high risk and associated with cervical cancer, LSIL usually resolves on its own without developing into cancer.
However, your doctor will likely recommend further investigation to assess the situation and determine the appropriate management plan. This may involve: Colposcopy: A magnified examination of the cervix using a special instrument. Cervical biopsy: Taking a small tissue sample from the cervix for analysis.
Based on the results of these tests, your doctor will recommend the most appropriate management approach, which might include: Observation: In many cases with LSIL, observation with regular cervical smear tests and colposcopy may be sufficient. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure: A minimally invasive procedure to remove abnormal cervical tissue. Other treatment options: Depending on the specific findings, other treatments like cryotherapy or laser ablation might be considered.
Remember: Do not panic. LSIL is a common finding and often resolves on its own. Schedule an appointment with your gynecologist or oncologist as soon as possible. Discuss your specific situation and receive personalized advice and guidance. Follow your doctor's recommendations for further tests and management. Maintain regular cervical cancer screening as advised by your doctor.
