## Question

What are the indications for using a pressure-controlled ventilation mode in the ICU?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for using pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) in the ICU. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology and how PCV differs from volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence comparing PCV versus VCV, especially in ARDS. Next, I will examine guideline positions and reconcile them with the evidence. After that, I should identify practical clinical scenarios where PCV offers advantages, including patient-ventilator synchrony, sedation needs, and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and highlight what not to use PCV for, anchoring on ARDSNet and contemporary ARDS guidance.

> Let me first confirm the physiological distinction, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be shaky. PCV sets a constant inspiratory pressure and allows tidal volume to vary with compliance and resistance, typically with a decelerating flow profile, whereas VCV sets a constant tidal volume and allows inspiratory pressure to vary with mechanics; both can be used to deliver lung-protective ventilation, but they prioritize different control variables and have different trade-offs in pressure, volume, and flow delivery.

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality comparative evidence before drawing conclusions. The 2015 Cochrane review of three RCTs with 1,089 adults with ARDS found no definitive mortality advantage for PCV versus VCV, with moderate-quality evidence showing a nonsignificant trend toward lower in-hospital and ICU mortality and uncertain effects on barotrauma; importantly, the authors concluded that available data were insufficient to confirm superiority of either mode, which tempers any strong preference for PCV on outcomes alone [^744b94b9]. I should also note that a 2015 systematic review of 34 studies likewise found no consistent differences in compliance, gas exchange, hemodynamics, work of breathing, or clinical outcomes between PCV and VCV, reinforcing the lack of a clear outcome signal favoring PCV [^2b75d902].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check guideline positions and ensure I'm not overinterpreting single studies. Contemporary ARDS guidelines emphasize lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and plateau pressures under 30 cm H2O, and they do not recommend PCV over VCV as a default strategy; both modes are acceptable if they achieve protective targets, and mode choice should be individualized rather than dogmatic [^65dd3793] [^9b23f2e5]. This aligns with the Cochrane conclusion and supports a mode-agnostic approach when protective parameters are maintained [^744b94b9].

> Let me consider practical advantages where PCV might help despite the absence of a mortality signal. PCV's decelerating flow and pressure-limited design can improve patient-ventilator synchrony and reduce work of breathing in patients with high or variable respiratory drive, potentially lowering sedation requirements; this is particularly relevant during assisted breathing phases and in patients with obstructive physiology or dynamic hyperinflation, where a pressure target with variable flow may better match demand [^44defd7e] [^07206209]. I should double-check that this is hypothesis-generating rather than outcome-proven; yes, these are physiologic and comfort advantages rather than mortality benefits, so they should be framed as reasonable clinical rationales in selected patients rather than universal indications [^2b75d902].

> Next, I should review special populations where PCV is commonly favored even if evidence is indirect. In pediatric and neonatal critical care, pressure-targeted modes are frequently used to reduce barotrauma risk and accommodate growth and changing mechanics; while adult data cannot be extrapolated wholesale, the principle of limiting peak pressure with variable volume is consistent with lung-protective philosophy and is standard in many pediatric practices [^notfound]. In patients with severe airflow obstruction or high auto-PEEP risk, PCV may facilitate smoother flow delivery and reduce dynamic hyperinflation, though I need to ensure tidal volume is still monitored to avoid inadvertent high volumes [^44defd7e].

> I will now examine the role of PCV in ARDS beyond the Cochrane data. Although some older physiologic studies suggested potential benefits of PCV with inverse ratio or decelerating flow, modern high-quality evidence has not shown a survival advantage for PCV over VCV when both deliver low tidal volumes and limit plateau pressures; thus, PCV should not be chosen solely to "improve outcomes" in ARDS, but may be reasonable when it helps with synchrony, sedation, or specific mechanics while still adhering to protective targets [^744b94b9] [^65dd3793]. But wait, what if I'm conflating PCV with adjuncts like prone positioning or recruitment maneuvers? I should clarify that those are separate, evidence-based strategies with their own indications and are not dependent on choosing PCV over VCV [^65dd3793] [^6caf210c].

> Let me think about weaning and sleep, because clinicians often ask about PCV at night. Small crossover studies suggest that assist-control or PCV at night may improve sleep architecture compared with pressure support in some ICU patients, likely by resting respiratory muscles and reducing arousals; however, the evidence quality is low and guidelines make only conditional suggestions, so this is not a strong indication but a reasonable, patient-centered trial in selected cases with severe sleep fragmentation or ventilator asynchrony [^e973d788] [^9f4d025b]. I should confirm that any such approach is individualized and reassessed frequently for net benefit, which aligns with the weak evidence base and expert opinion [^e973d788].

> I should confirm what not to use PCV for. PCV is not indicated to replace evidence-based lung-protective strategies, and it does not obviate the need to monitor tidal volumes, plateau pressures, driving pressure, and PEEP; in fact, PCV can permit larger tidal volumes if not carefully titrated, so vigilance is essential to avoid volutrauma while benefiting from pressure control [^44defd7e] [^3aa9c606]. Likewise, PCV is not a substitute for prone positioning in severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockade when indicated, or ECMO when refractory hypoxemia persists despite optimized conventional therapy; those decisions hinge on separate evidence bases and should not be conflated with mode selection [^65dd3793] [^6caf210c].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. High-quality evidence does not show that PCV improves survival or major outcomes compared with VCV when both deliver lung-protective ventilation, so there is no mandatory indication to choose PCV over VCV on outcomes alone; however, PCV can be the preferred mode in selected scenarios where its physiologic features improve synchrony, reduce sedation needs, or align with patient-specific mechanics, provided that protective tidal volumes and pressures are still achieved and monitored [^744b94b9] [^65dd3793]. Guidelines endorse either mode as acceptable, emphasizing the primacy of protective parameters and individualized care, which is the most defensible, evidence-aligned stance [^9b23f2e5] [^d0070c0e].

> Final clinical take: I should double-check that my bottom line is actionable. Use PCV when you need tighter control of inspiratory pressure with variable flow to improve comfort or synchrony, in patients with high or erratic respiratory drive, in obstructive physiology where decelerating flow may help, or in pediatric contexts where pressure-targeted ventilation is customary, while continuously monitoring tidal volume and plateau pressure to ensure lung protection; do not choose PCV expecting a mortality benefit, and always be prepared to switch modes if the patient's needs or mechanics change [^44defd7e] [^65dd3793] [^9b23f2e5]. If your primary goal is to guarantee a stable tidal volume with explicit limits on pressure, VCV with careful attention to plateau and driving pressure remains perfectly appropriate and evidence-based, reinforcing that mode selection is a tool to deliver protective ventilation rather than an outcome determinant itself [^65dd3793] [^3aa9c606].

Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) is indicated in the ICU when **tight control of peak inspiratory pressure** is needed to reduce the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, especially in ARDS [^notfound] and other forms of acute respiratory failure with low compliance [^notfound]. PCV is also preferred for **improved patient-ventilator synchrony** in patients with high or variable respiratory drive, and for **facilitating lung-protective strategies** by limiting plateau pressures and allowing permissive hypercapnia [^44defd7e] [^b3633c9d]. It is commonly used in ARDS, severe asthma, COPD exacerbations, and during one-lung ventilation, and is particularly useful when pressure limitation is prioritized over consistent tidal volume [^303b2d5c] [^44defd7e].

---

## Physiological rationale for pressure-controlled ventilation

PCV delivers a **preset inspiratory pressure** with a decelerating flow waveform, allowing tidal volume to vary with respiratory system compliance and resistance. This approach offers several physiological advantages:

- **Limitation of peak inspiratory pressure**: PCV inherently limits peak inspiratory pressure, reducing the risk of barotrauma and volutrauma, particularly beneficial in patients with low lung compliance [^44defd7e].

- **Improved patient-ventilator synchrony**: The decelerating flow profile better matches patient demand, potentially reducing work of breathing and improving comfort, especially in patients with high or variable respiratory drive [^07206209].

- **Facilitation of lung-protective ventilation**: PCV allows clinicians to implement lung-protective strategies by limiting plateau pressures and enabling permissive hypercapnia, thereby minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [^b3633c9d].

---

## Clinical indications for pressure-controlled ventilation

PCV is indicated in several **clinical scenarios** in the ICU, including:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for pcv** |
|-|-|
| Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) | - Low tidal volume ventilation with limited plateau pressure is recommended [^65dd3793] <br/> - PCV facilitates these lung-protective strategies [^44defd7e] |
| Severe asthma or COPD exacerbations | - PCV limits peak inspiratory pressure <br/> - Reduces risk of dynamic hyperinflation and barotrauma [^notfound] |
| One-lung ventilation during thoracic surgery | - Lower peak pressures and improved oxygenation compared to volume-controlled ventilation [^303b2d5c] |
| Patients with high or variable respiratory drive | - Improved synchrony and reduced work of breathing [^07206209] |
| Neuromuscular disorders or respiratory muscle weakness | - Pressure-limited ventilation reduces the risk of excessive tidal volumes and barotrauma [^notfound] |

---

## Evidence supporting pressure-controlled ventilation

Several studies and reviews have evaluated PCV versus volume-controlled ventilation (VCV):

- **ARDS patients**: A Cochrane review found no significant difference in mortality or barotrauma between PCV and VCV, but highlighted the importance of lung-protective strategies regardless of mode [^744b94b9].

- **One-lung ventilation**: Meta-analyses indicate that PCV results in lower peak inspiratory pressures and improved oxygenation compared to VCV, although clinical outcomes are similar [^303b2d5c].

- **Patient-ventilator synchrony**: PCV has been associated with improved synchrony and reduced work of breathing, particularly in patients with spontaneous respiratory efforts [^07206209].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While PCV offers several advantages, clinicians must consider the following:

- **Variable tidal volume**: Tidal volume may fluctuate with changes in compliance or resistance, necessitating close monitoring to avoid hypoventilation or hyperventilation [^44defd7e].

- **Lack of proven mortality benefit**: No large randomized controlled trial has demonstrated a mortality benefit of PCV over VCV when lung-protective strategies are applied [^744b94b9].

- **Operator expertise**: Effective use of PCV requires careful titration of pressure settings and vigilant monitoring of tidal volumes and gas exchange [^44defd7e].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **lung-protective ventilation** with low tidal volumes and limited plateau pressures, regardless of the mode used [^65dd3793]. The choice between PCV and VCV should be individualized based on patient characteristics, clinician expertise, and the clinical context [^d0070c0e].

---

Pressure-controlled ventilation is indicated in the ICU when **tight control of inspiratory pressure** is required, particularly in ARDS, severe asthma, COPD exacerbations, and during one-lung ventilation. It offers advantages in terms of lung protection, patient-ventilator synchrony, and facilitation of lung-protective strategies, but requires careful monitoring and individualized adjustment.

### Pressure-controlled versus volume-controlled ventilation for acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^744b94b9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) account for one-quarter of cases of acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICUs). A third to half of patients will die in the ICU, in hospital or during follow-up. Mechanical ventilation of people with ALI/ARDS allows time for the lungs to heal, but ventilation is invasive and can result in lung injury. It is uncertain whether ventilator-related injury would be reduced if pressure delivered by the ventilator with each breath is controlled, or whether the volume of air delivered by each breath is limited.

Objectives

To compare pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) versus volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in adults with ALI/ARDS to determine whether PCV reduces in-hospital mortality and morbidity in intubated and ventilated adults.

Search Methods

In October 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Isssue 9), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 1 October 2014), the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1994 to 1 October 2014) and Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) at the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1990 to 1 October 2014), as well as regional databases, clinical trials registries, conference proceedings and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (irrespective of language or publication status) of adults with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure or acute on chronic respiratory failure and fulfilling the criteria for ALI/ARDS as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference who were admitted to an ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation, comparing pressure-controlled or pressure-controlled inverse-ratio ventilation, or an equivalent pressure-controlled mode (PCV), versus volume-controlled ventilation, or an equivalent volume-controlled mode (VCV).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification from trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Main Results

We included three RCTs that randomly assigned a total of 1089 participants recruited from 43 ICUs in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Spain and the USA. Risk of bias of the included studies was low. Only data for mortality and barotrauma could be combined in the meta-analysis. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the three mortality outcomes on the basis of serious imprecision around the effect estimates. For mortality in hospital, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; three trials, 1089 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and for mortality in the ICU, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; two trials, 1062 participants; moderate-quality evidence). One study provided no evidence of clear benefit with the ventilatory mode for mortality at 28 days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 983 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The difference in effect on barotrauma between PCV and VCV was uncertain as the result of imprecision and different co-interventions used in the studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.77; two trials, 1062 participants; low-quality evidence). Data from one trial with 983 participants for the mean duration of ventilation, and from another trial with 78 participants for the mean number of extrapulmonary organ failures that developed with PCV or VCV, were skewed. None of the trials reported on infection during ventilation or quality of life after discharge.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available data from RCTs are insufficient to confirm or refute whether pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation offers any advantage for people with acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. More studies including a larger number of people given PCV and VCV may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a strategy based on a specific pressure-controlled mode of ventilation set to encourage spontaneous ventilation at minimal risks did not significantly reduce mortality compared to conventional ACV with similar tidal volume and PEEP levels but reduced the need for sedation and adjunctive therapies of hypoxemia.

Although volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control are the 3 most commonly used ventilator modes in current clinical care, the 3 modes have not been compared directly in a large randomized trial, and to our knowledge, no trial has compared adaptive pressure control with the other 2 modes. Whether the choice of ventilator modes affects outcomes for critically ill adults is unknown. To address this gap, the Mode of Ventilation During Critical Illness pilot trial compared the use of volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control among critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the use of mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel conducted systematic reviews and metaanalyses of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

Results

For all patients with ARDS, the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H₂O) (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (high confidence in effect estimates) and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure (moderate confidence in effect estimates) and recruitment maneuvers (low confidence in effect estimates). Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected ventilatory interventions for adult patients with ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline.

### Effect of ventilator mode on ventilator-free days in critically ill adults: a randomized clinical trial [^f263393e]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary Outcome

The number of ventilator-free days through day 28 did not differ significantly among the 3 study groups, with a median of 23 days (IQR, 0–26 days) in the volume control group, 22 days (IQR, 0–26 days) in the pressure control group, and 24 days (IQR, 0–26 days) in the adaptive pressure control group (P = 0.60) (Fig 3, Table 2, e-Tables 15, 16). Results were similar in analyses that adjusted for baseline covariates, analyses that included patients enrolled during analytic washout periods, and a mixed model in which period was included as a random effect (e-Tables 17–19). None of the prespecified baseline variables modified the effect of trial group assignment on the primary outcome except hypercarbic respiratory failure as an indication for mechanical ventilation, with fewer ventilator-free days in the volume control and pressure control groups than in the adaptive pressure control group (volume control vs adaptive pressure control: OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.11–0.83]; and pressure control vs adaptive pressure control: OR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.13–0.83]) (e-Figs 11–15). In a post hoc analysis, the presence of ARDS criteria at enrollment also did not modify the effect of trial group assignment on the primary outcome (e-Fig 11).

### Effect of ventilator mode on ventilator-free days in critically ill adults: a randomized clinical trial [^6795e111]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether the choice of ventilator mode affects outcomes for critically ill patients is unknown.

Research Question

What are the effects of 3 common ventilator modes (volume control vs pressure control vs adaptive pressure control) on death and duration of mechanical ventilation among critically ill adults?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, crossover pilot trial among adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in a medical ICU between November 1, 2022, and July 31, 2023. Each month, patients in the participating unit were assigned to receive volume control, pressure control, or adaptive pressure control during continuous mandatory ventilation. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days through 28 days.

Results

Among 566 patients included in the primary analysis, the median proportion of ventilator mode assessments in the assigned mode during the first 72 hours was 100% in each group. The median number of ventilator-free days was 23 days (interquartile range [IQR], 0–26 days) in the volume control group, 22 days (IQR, 0–26 days) in the pressure control group, and 24 days (IQR, 0–26 days) in the adaptive pressure control group (P = 0.60). The median tidal volume was similar among the 3 groups, but the percentage of breaths > 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight differed among the volume control (median, 4.0% [IQR, 0.0%-14.1%]), pressure control (median, 10.6% [IQR, 0.0%-31.5%]), and adaptive pressure control (median, 4.7% [IQR, 0.0%-19.2%]) groups.

Interpretation

This pilot trial established the feasibility of conducting a cluster-randomized crossover trial of ventilator mode among critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and demonstrated differences in intermediate outcomes that warrant further investigation in a larger trial.

Results

Trial Population

Of the 656 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in the study ICU during the study period, 37 patients (5.6%) met exclusion criteria and 619 patients (94.4%) were enrolled in the trial (Fig 1, e-Fig 1). Of those enrolled, 53 patients (8.6%) were enrolled during an analytic washout period, and the remaining 566 patients (91.4%) were included in the primary analysis. Among the 566 patients in the primary analysis, 181 patients (32.0%) were assigned to the volume control group, 198 patients (35.0%) were assigned to the pressure control group, and 187 patients (33.0%) were assigned to the adaptive pressure control group. The trial groups showed similar baseline characteristics (Table 1). The median age was 58 years, 41.3% of patients were female, 39.8% of patients had hypoxemic respiratory failure as an indication for mechanical ventilation, and 210 patients (37.1%) had ARDS. Complete information on baseline patient characteristics is available in e-Tables 1–6.

Patient Characteristics at Baseline

Invasive Mechanical Ventilation and ICU Interventions

Which ventilator mode the patient was receiving was recorded a median of every 1 minute (IQR, 1–1 minute) between enrollment and cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation, resulting in 1,405,218 assessments of ventilator mode among the 566 patients (e-Appendix 1). In the 72 hours after enrollment, when patients were receiving continuous mandatory ventilation, the median proportion of ventilator mode assessments that were in the assigned mode was 100% (IQR, 100%-100%) in the volume control group, 100% (IQR, 98.9%-100%) in the pressure control group, and 100% (IQR, 100%-100%) in the adaptive pressure control group (Fig 2, e-Figs 2–4, e-Tables 7–10). A total of 61 patients (10.8%) in the primary analysis experienced a crossover after spending a median of 8 days (IQR, 5–14 days) in the assigned group, and the ventilator mode was selected by treating clinicians for the remainder of the time receiving mechanical ventilation (e-Table 9).

### Pressure-controlled vs volume-controlled ventilation in acute respiratory failure: a physiology-based narrative and systematic review [^2b75d902]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Mechanical ventilation is a cornerstone in the management of acute respiratory failure. Both volume-targeted and pressure-targeted ventilations are used, the latter modes being increasingly used. We provide a narrative review of the physiologic principles of these two types of breath delivery, performed a literature search, and analyzed published comparisons between modes.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether pressure control-continuous mandatory ventilation (PC-CMV) or pressure control-inverse ratio ventilation (PC-IRV) has demonstrated advantages over volume control-continuous mandatory ventilation (VC-CMV). The Cochrane tool for risk of bias was used for methodologic quality. We also introduced physiologic criteria as quality indicators for selecting the studies. Outcomes included compliance, gas exchange, hemodynamics, work of breathing, and clinical outcomes. Analyses were completed with RevMan5 using random effects models.

Results

Thirty-four studies met inclusion criteria, many being at high risk of bias. Comparisons of PC-CMV/PC-IRV and VC-CMV did not show any difference for compliance or gas exchange, even when looking at PC-IRV. Calculating the oxygenation index suggested a poorer effect for PC-IRV. There was no difference between modes in terms of hemodynamics, work of breathing, or clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

The two modes have different working principles but clinical available data do not suggest any difference in the outcomes. We included all identified trials, enhancing generalizability, and attempted to include only sufficient quality physiologic studies. However, included trials were small and varied considerably in quality. These data should help to open the choice of ventilation of patients with acute respiratory failure.

### Liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults: an Official American College of Chest Physicians / American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: inspiratory pressure augmentation during spontaneous breathing trials, protocols minimizing sedation, and noninvasive ventilation immediately after extubation [^6f687f27]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults — executive summary scope and methodology — states that the guideline addresses six questions related to liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults and is a collaborative effort between the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST). A multidisciplinary panel posed six clinical questions in a population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) format, performed a comprehensive literature search with evidence appraisal using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and applied the Evidence-to-Decision framework considering problem importance, confidence in evidence, public values, balance of outcomes, resources, disparities, acceptability, and feasibility. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated by subcommittees, modified after full panel discussions, and confirmed by confidential electronic voting with approval requiring that at least 80% of panel members agree with the recommendation.

### Pressure-controlled versus volume-controlled ventilation: does it matter? [^07206209]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) are not different ventilatory modes, but are different control variables within a mode. Just as the debate over the optimal ventilatory mode continues, so too does the debate over the optimal control variable. VCV offers the safety of a pre-set tidal volume and minute ventilation but requires the clinician to appropriately set the inspiratory flow, flow waveform, and inspiratory time. During VCV, airway pressure increases in response to reduced compliance, increased resistance, or active exhalation and may increase the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. PCV, by design, limits the maximum airway pressure delivered to the lung, but may result in variable tidal and minute volume. During PCV the clinician should titrate the inspiratory pressure to the measured tidal volume, but the inspiratory flow and flow waveform are determined by the ventilator as it attempts to maintain a square inspiratory pressure profile. Most studies comparing the effects of VCV and PCV were not well controlled or designed and offer little to our understanding of when and how to use each control variable. Any benefit associated with PCV with respect to ventilatory variables and gas exchange probably results from the associated decelerating-flow waveform available during VCV on many ventilators. Further, the beneficial characteristics of both VCV and PCV may be combined in so-called dual-control modes, which are volume-targeted, pressure-limited, and time-cycled. PCV offers no advantage over VCV in patients who are not breathing spontaneously, especially when decelerating flow is available during VCV. PCV may offer lower work of breathing and improved comfort for patients with increased and variable respiratory demand.

Take-Home Points

Study Question: Does the choice among 3 common ventilator modes (volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control) for critically ill adults affect the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation?

Results: Among 566 patients included in the primary analysis of this cluster-randomized crossover pilot trial, the number of ventilator-free days did not differ among patients treated with volume control, pressure control, or adaptive pressure control (P = 0.60). Although the median tidal volume received was similar in the 3 groups, other measures of protective mechanical ventilation differed among groups.

Interpretation: This pilot trial established the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial of ventilator mode among critically ill adults and demonstrated differences in intermediate outcomes that warrant further investigation in a larger trial.

Millions of critically ill adults receive invasive mechanical ventilation each year. Although potentially lifesaving, mechanical ventilation itself may injure the lungs, diaphragm, and other organs. In-hospital mortality among critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation in the United States remains > 30%.

To provide invasive mechanical ventilation, clinicians must select a ventilator mode, which determines how the ventilator delivers each breath. The ventilator can administer a set volume and can measure the change in pressure that occurs with the breath (eg, volume control mode), can administer a set pressure and measure the change in volume that occurs with the breath (eg, pressure control mode), or can use an algorithm to titrate the pressure administered breath by breath to maintain a target volume set by the clinician (eg, adaptive pressure control mode). Although previous studies have shown that avoiding large volumes, high pressures, and deep sedation may all improve patient outcomes, each ventilator mode delivers breaths in a way that prioritizes these variables differently. Volume control can facilitate tighter control of the volume administered, but can lead to higher pressures. Pressure control can facilitate tighter control of the pressure administered, but lead to higher volumes. As a dual-control mode, adaptive pressure control can provide the benefits of both volume control and pressure control.

### PSV versus ASV with intellisync mode for delivery of NIV in AECOPD (PAINT-COPD) [^cbe5c254]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is defined acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring additional therapy. COPD exacerbations affects the health status and quality of life of affected patients. The inpatient mortality during exacerbation is 3 to 4% while, intensive care unit mortality approaches 43 to 46%. Each episode of exacerbation increases the risk of mortality subsequently Non-invasive ventilation therapy has established role in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD. But the use of NIV therapy outside of acute exacerbation is uncertain NIV use has been shown to prevent endotracheal intubation and improved hospital and ICU survival. NIV decreases the work of breathing by unloading the respiratory muscles through assisting the inspiratory phases and counterbalancing the intrinistic positive end expiratory positive pressure.

NIV is delivered through face mask, although newer interfaces like helmet available. Tradionally pressure targeted mode is used in NIV therapy and is often given intermittently rather than continuously. NIV therapy via face mask was first used by Meduri et. Al in acute respiratory failure patients. Subsequent multiple randomized control trials established the role of NIV therapy in better gas exchange, reducing PCO2, reducing endotracheal intubation thereby reducing mortality, length of stay in hospital. Non-invasive methods of ventilation can be used in mild to moderate exacerbation of COPD. They prevent most of the complications of invasive mechanical ventilation and has also reduces mortality in acute exacerbations of COPD. In mild to moderate COPD exacerbations, non-invasive ventilation failure rate is found to be 15% to 20%. In severe COPD exacerbations, NIV failure rate approaches upto 52% to 62%.

This mode supports patient with pressure support when patient has spontaneous breath and when target ventilation is not reached it delivers pressure control breath to achieve adequate ventilation. In this mode, minute volume is controlled via Vt/RR combination based on respiratory mechanics of the patient to keep the work of breathing at minimum. This mode calculates the tidal volume and respiratory rate to be delivered by otis equation in its algorithm after %minute volume being set by the clinician to ensure effective ventilation at the alveolar level. These measurements are used to determine the initial targets of breath rate and tidal volume. After which based on respiratory rate and effort of the patient, inspiratory pressure, mandatory breath are adjusted automatically to meet the set %minute volume.

ASV mode can be used as initiation, maintenance and weaning phases of mechanical ventilation and it provides full, partial or minimal ventilator support during any of these phases. In a randomized control study done by c. kirakli et. Al found out that in COPD patients ASV mode of ventilation has shorter weaning duration compared to pressure support mode of ventilation. of intellivent- ASV and conventional mode of ventilation found out that tidal volume delivery and spo2 were most of the time in the optimal range for intellivent-ASV compared to conventional mode of ventilation. However it was found that Pmax was higher with intellivent-ASV mode than conventional ventilation.

### Controversies in the critical care setting. should adaptive pressure control modes be utilized for virtually all patients receiving mechanical ventilation? [^05aff2b0]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Traditional mechanical ventilation is provided with either a constant volume or constant pressure breath. In recent years, dual-control (adaptive pressure control) has been introduced in an attempt to combine the attributes of volume ventilation (constant tidal volume and minute ventilation) with the attributes of pressure ventilation (rapid, variable flow and reduced work of breathing). Adaptive pressure control is a pressure-controlled breath that utilizes closed-loop control of the pressure setting to maintain a minimum delivered tidal volume. Prior to the introduction of adaptive pressure control, no clinical studies were accomplished. Studies have shown that adaptive pressure control reduces peak inspiratory pressure, compared to volume control. When compared to traditional pressure-control ventilation, no differences have been identified. While adaptive pressure control can guarantee a minimum tidal volume, it cannot guarantee a constant tidal volume. One concern is that the ventilator cannot distinguish between improved pulmonary compliance and increased patient effort. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of adaptive pressure control and understand when other breath delivery techniques are more suitable.

### Protocol and statistical analysis plan for the mode of ventilation during critical illness (MODE) trial [^1b8acf81]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the absence of evidence regarding the ideal mode of mechanical ventilation, significant variation in the choice of mode exists in current clinical practice. Observational cohort studies in the United States and internationally have demonstrated that volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control are each used routinely in the management of critically ill adults. Because the mode of mechanical ventilation must be set for every critically ill patient receiving mechanical ventilation and the relationship between the commonly used modes and patient outcomes remains uncertain, a large, randomized trial at multiple centers is needed to inform the optimal mode of mechanical ventilation for critically ill adults. – Before such a trial can be conducted, additional data are needed regarding the feasibility of assigning the mode of mechanical ventilation for critically ill adults, of maintaining adherence to group assignment, and of using days alive and free of ventilation as a primary outcome for a trial comparing ventilator modes.– To address this lack of preliminary data, we designed the Mode of Ventilation During Critical Illness (MODE) trial as a prospective, randomized pilot trial comparing modes of continuous mandatory ventilation among critically ill adults in a medical ICU.

### Historical and potential modern uses of negative-pressure ventilation for critically ill patients [^d4303013]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Negative-pressure ventilation (NPV) is a form of noninvasive respiratory support in which an external subatmospheric pressure is applied to the thorax to facilitate lung expansion. Although largely supplanted by positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) in modern-day practice, NPV has garnered renewed interest as a potential noninvasive adjunct or alternative to PPV. Appropriate patient selection would be key, particularly in the ICU setting, where NPV is generally contraindicated in patients with severe upper airway obstruction, high oxygenation requirements, or absent airway reflexes. Clinical studies have investigated the use of NPV in patients with respiratory muscle weakness, acute on chronic respiratory failure, impaired airway clearance, and in the postoperative management of cardiac surgery patients. NPV can be delivered through tank, cuirass, and jacket ventilators, with supplemental oxygen provided as needed via nasal cannula or face mask. Modern negative pressure ventilators can support both spontaneous and controlled modes, including continuous negative extrathoracic pressure, synchronized negative pressure, cyclical negative pressure, high-frequency oscillation, and biphasic ventilation. In addition to providing respiratory support, NPV may also offer hemodynamic benefits in some patients, reduce sedation requirements, and improve patient well-being in the ICU by allowing for oral intake, verbal communication, and increased mobility. Still, the use of NPV has been stymied by challenges around device ergonomics, patient comfort, and clinical familiarity. Further research is needed to better define its role in contemporary medicine in terms of patient selection, equivalency or improvement of outcomes, optimization of interface design and portability, and exploration of applications such as hybrid ventilation strategies and synchronization. This narrative review provides a comprehensive evaluation of NPV in the intensive care unit, including its historical significance, physiologic principles, modern evidence for potential clinical use, modes of delivery, and key opportunities for innovation.

Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/CHEST ventilator liberation guideline — methods and scope — Six cochairs were appointed and proposed six clinical questions; outcomes were weighted using the Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach, and recommendations were developed via the Evidence-to-Decision framework. Each recommendation was considered strong or conditional and required at least 80% panel consensus for approval, and any recommendation not meeting this threshold was revised and resubmitted for vote. The guideline consists of six questions and is published as three manuscripts: an executive summary and two manuscripts that address three questions each; one of two manuscripts is published in CHEST and the other in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. The panel made recommendations but did not support specific protocols for any of the six questions, and clinicians are not expected to adhere to these recommendations blindly or universally.

### Respiratory support in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an expert opinion [^1706b574]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

In severe ARDS, there is no outcome advantage of using volume-controlled compared to pressure-controlled forms of ventilation

Rationale and literature findings

For the same tidal volume, there is no outcome advantage of using pressure-controlled versus volume-controlled ventilation in terms of the amount of stress and strain generated in the lung. However, use of volume-controlled ventilation during passive inflation facilitates the measurement of respiratory mechanics and driving pressure and is recommended in the early stage. Pressure-controlled ventilation does not guarantee a fixed tidal volume, but may result in better respiratory comfort at a later stage during assisted breathing because it does not limit inspiratory flow.

Use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is not recommended

Rationale and literature findings

Although high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is theoretically an attractive technique that could ensure adequate gas exchange and avoid excessive tidal stretching and atelectrauma, prospective RCTs have not shown benefit over "lung-protective" strategies implemented at conventional respiratory rates, and have even suggested harm when used from a high pressure baseline early in the course of ARDS. Whether this technique could be used as a "rescue therapy" in very severe ARDS is unknown, but a recent meta-analysis suggests some potential advantage in these patients (P/F < ~ 70 mmHg).

### What links ventilator driving pressure with survival in the acute respiratory distress syndrome? A computational study [^e50bab5d]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute heterogeneous inflammation of the lungs leading to deterioration in effective gas exchange, worsening of lung compliance, increasing pulmonary shunt, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability. Almost 1 in 10 intensive care admissions meet the ARDS criteria, 70% of which are categorized as 'moderate' or 'severe' ARDS, with mortality rates exceeding 40%. The most common means of reinstating adequate oxygenation in patients with ARDS is through mechanical ventilation (MV), with the aim of meeting patients' oxygenation and CO 2 removal requirements while the underlying pathology is treated. However, the lungs of patients suffering from ARDS are highly susceptible to damage introduced by mechanical ventilation, commonly known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Minimizing lung injury, while maintaining adequate gas exchange ("protective ventilation"), is thus a crucial requirement in the effective clinical management of ARDS. Currently, there is widespread confusion regarding how best to achieve protective ventilation in ARDS, with multiple debates ongoing regarding the problem. Many strategies have been proposed, and are in use; each with its own rationale, advocates and evidence of effectiveness. Evaluating the relative benefits of different strategies using only traditional approaches (e.g. randomized trials) is challenging and costly, due to the number of potential strategies and disease states, and to the difficulty of recruiting critically ill patients to clinical trials.

### Comparison of pressure-controlled ventilation with volume-controlled ventilation during one-lung ventilation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^303b2d5c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our meta-analysis has provided evidence that peak inspiratory pressure is significantly lower in PCV. In terms of oxygenation, although the use of low tidal volume with PCV was associated with improved oxygenation, no definitive conclusions could be drawn because the duration of ventilation in the studies reviewed was insufficient to rule out important differences if they exist. Most of the studies included in the meta-analysis were crossover studies involving 30 min of ventilation, and used high tidal volumes that are risk factors for lung injury. Therefore, to evaluate the influence of PCV on occurrence of the lung injury/ARDS, well-controlled randomized non-crossover studies using low tidal volumes with adequate durations of each ventilator mode, are needed.

### Recent advances in mechanical ventilation [^7945c80f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Important advances have been made over the past decade towards understanding the optimal approach to ventilating patients with acute respiratory failure. Evidence now supports the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in selected patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and for facilitating the discontinuation of ventilatory support in patients with chronic pulmonary disease. The concept of a lung protective ventilatory strategy has revolutionized the management of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. The process of liberation from mechanical ventilation is becoming more standardized, with evidence supporting daily trials of spontaneous breathing in all suitable mechanically ventilated patients. This article critically reviews the most important recent advances in mechanical ventilation and suggests future directions for further research in the field.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation in adult ARDS — higher versus lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was tested in eight RCTs including 2,728 patients; on Day 1, mean ± SD PEEP was 15.1 ± 3.6 versus 9.1 ± 2.7 cm H2O. Overall mortality showed no significant difference (six studies, 2,580 patients; RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80–1.03), while oxygenation improved with higher PEEP (61 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 46–77 mm Hg). An individual patient data meta-analysis found that in moderate or severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200) higher PEEP had lower mortality (adjusted RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–1.00), with no significant effect in mild ARDS (adjusted RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.91–1.83; P = 0.02 for comparison). We suggest that adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS receive higher rather than lower levels of PEEP (conditional recommendation, moderate confidence in effect estimates). This recommendation is based primarily on evidence supporting a statistically significant reduction in mortality in moderate or severe ARDS, and clinicians should consider risks when plateau pressure is greater than or equal to 30 cm H2O.

### Protocol and statistical analysis plan for the mode of ventilation during critical illness (MODE) trial [^3aa9c606]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Approximately 2 to 3 million critically ill adults receive invasive mechanical ventilation in an ICU each year. – Although clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of smaller tidal volumes and lower plateau pressures can improve the outcomes of critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the optimal ventilator mode to achieve these targets remains unknown.

The tidal volume and the inspiratory airway pressure are directly related. For patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, delivering larger tidal volumes generates higher airway pressures, and conversely, increasing airway pressures usually generates higher tidal volumes. Ventilator modes allow clinicians to control either the volume ("volume control" mode) or the pressure ("pressure control" mode) administered during inspiration. By controlling one variable, each mode provides indirect control over the other variable, which varies in a proportion dictated by the patient's unique respiratory physiology. Modern ventilators also offer hybrid modes such as adaptive pressure control, a pressure-targeted mode in which a clinician sets a target tidal volume (eg, pressure-regulated volume control) and the ventilator achieves that target by titrating the inspiratory pressure over multiple breaths to account for changes in patient effort and respiratory physiology.

Volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control all can achieve low tidal volume and low plateau pressures, the key components of lung protective ventilation, a strategy proven to improve outcomes for critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation. – Each mode differs, however, in the specifics of how it delivers inspiratory pressure, volume, and flow. For example, volume control directly controls tidal volumes but permits more breath-to-breath variability in inspiratory pressure, increasing the risk for barotrauma. Pressure control directly controls inspiratory pressure but allows more breath-to-breath variability in tidal volume, which could result in more exposure to excessive tidal volumes. Adaptive pressure control automatically titrates inspiratory pressures to reach a target tidal volume, which could provide both the benefits and harms of volume control and pressure control. These differences could theoretically affect pulmonary physiology, patient comfort, sedation requirements, risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, and clinical outcomes. No studies have found conclusive benefit from any mandatory mode of ventilation. Furthermore, the only clinical trials comparing modes of mechanical ventilation among critically ill adults have been small and occurred when deep sedation and paralysis were common and spontaneous awakening and breathing trials had not yet become routine practice.

Included studies — We included 11 studies with 1971 participants (table 2). The sample sizes ranged from 15 to 357 participants. All studies took place in intensive care units in hospitals. Trials were conducted in the United States, Brazil, Italy, Germany, and Australia. Participants were recruited from various intensive care units including medical, coronary, surgical, surgical/trauma, mixed (including medical, surgical/trauma patients), neurosurgical, and cardiac surgical. Three trials were conducted in multiple unitsand seven in single units. One trial specified the population (neurosurgical) rather than the unit. Four studies described the ventilatory modes used in "usual practice" in the control group, and these involved a reduction in respiratory rate in synchronised intermittent mechanical ventilation and a reduction in pressure support in pressure support ventilation, a reduction in positive end expiratory pressure and pressure support ventilation, and a reduction in pressure support ventilation. The seven remaining described usual practice as weaning according to the physician's discretion without describing what this constituted.

### Indications for mechanical ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure [^1e6543ed]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Increased understanding of the mechanisms and effects of acute respiratory failure has not been accompanied by more precise criteria by which the clinician can determine when intubation should be carried out and invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) instituted in a given patient. The indications traditionally offered in reviews and textbooks have tended to be either so broad as not to be very helpful in an individual case, or of questionable clinical relevance and too cumbersome for practical use. This review updates the indications for IPPV in adult patients with acute respiratory failure by examining available evidence from clinical trials and by considering new management alternatives that have become available in the last 20 years. Indications for IPPV based on specific threshold values for P(CO2) and pH or on various indices of arterial oxygenation have generally not been validated by clinical evidence, and it is unlikely that any cutoff value would be applicable to all patients or all categories of acute respiratory failure. Stated another way, there is probably no single value for arterial P(CO2), pH, or P(O2) that by itself constitutes an indication for IPPV. Compelling face validity justifies the use of IPPV in cases of apnea or when it appears certain that respiratory arrest is about to occur. However, dyspnea, tachypnea, or the subjective impression of respiratory distress are probably not in themselves justification for emergency intubation. It should be possible to avoid IPPV and its attendant complications in many cases of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. In acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) should be the initial ventilation approach unless the patient has one of several specific exclusion criteria such as cardiovascular instability or severely impaired mental status. It may also be possible to avoid intubation through the use of NPPV in certain immunocompromised patients with early acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, in other settings of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, such as acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, this has not been shown. The use of IPPV may improve outcomes in patients with severe cardiogenic shock. However, IPPV has not proven to be beneficial in traumatic brain injury and flail chest, in the absence of other indications.

### Acute applications of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [^b5b8bb02]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been used increasingly to treat acute respiratory failure (ARF). The best indications for its use are ARF in patients with COPD exacerbations, acute pulmonary edema, and immunocompromised states. For these indications, multiple controlled trials have demonstrated that therapy with NPPV avoids intubation and, in the case of COPD and immunocompromised patients, reduces mortality as well. NPPV is used to treat patients with numerous other forms of ARF, but the evidence is not as strong for its use in those cases, and patients must be selected carefully. The best candidates for NPPV are able to protect their airway, are cooperative, and are otherwise medically stable. Success is optimized when a skilled team applies a well-fitted, comfortable interface. Ventilator settings should be adjusted to reduce respiratory distress while avoiding excessive discomfort, patient-ventilator synchrony should be optimized, and adequate oxygenation should be assured. The appropriate application of NPPV in the acute care setting should lead to improved patient outcomes and more efficient resource utilization.

Patients at high risk for failure of extubation may include those patients with hypercapnia, COPD, congestive heart failure, or other serious comorbidities, and physicians who choose to use NIV should apply such treatment immediately after extubation to realize the outcome benefits. The evidence synthesis indicated that preventive NIV was superior to no preventive NIV regarding extubation success, ICU length of stay, and both short- and long-term mortality.

### The ventilator of the future: key principles and unmet needs [^c1b93d79]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

As currently implemented, mechanical ventilation with positive pressure aims to provide appropriately conditioned gas and adequate ventilating energy while maintaining sufficient lung expansion to prevent atelectasis and its consequences. Importantly, invasive ventilation also enables monitoring of airway pressures, flows, frequency, and tidal volume (Vₜ). Impressive advances have produced a wide spectrum of flow delivery patterns, and sophisticated on-line processing now provides key indicators of interest derived from primary data. For routine applications such as post-operative ventilation and neuromuscular weakness, machines of the present day already perform admirably well and continually undergo incremental improvements. Unfortunately, however, fundamental shortcomings of invasive positive pressure ventilation currently make it less than ideal for the most critically ill, who need wise and timely interventions that take account of its potential benefits and risks to metabolic and cardiovascular systems as well as provide safe and effective support of gas exchange.

Impressive advances in technology and engineering have extended and diversified the ventilator's capability and safety. As importantly, however, clinical experience and scientific investigation have helped define the limitations and potential hazards of all forms of ventilation for the seriously ill. Along this line, strongly spontaneous breathing efforts may promote tissue injury (P-SILI), patient-ventilator dysynchrony, respiratory muscle fatigue, hypoxemia and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Deep sedation and invasive ventilation help alleviate these, but certain vital aspects of support with controlled positive airway pressure have received scant attention in machine design. Because positive pressure simultaneously influences the performance of the cardiovascular system, tracking its net physiologic effect currently requires both independent detection and integration of this disconnected information by individual caregivers who often have limited experience, expertise and time to spend at the bedside. Timely, proactive interventions are often central to clinical outcome, but in today's ICU environment, adjustments to the ventilator are made intermittently and often in reaction to overt abnormalities that violate clinician-set alarms. To underscore such under addressed problems and possibilities for improving ICU survival, we focus the following discussion on the ventilatory support of the intubated patient with life-threatening respiratory failure receiving controlled, volume-targeted ventilation.

Effects of Different Ventilation Modes on Airway Pressure and Intracranial Pressure in Patients in the Trendelenburg Position ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The goal of this clinical trial is to understand the impact of three different ventilation modes-pressure-controlled ventilation, volume-controlled ventilation, and pressure-regulated volume-controlled ventilation -on airway pressure and intracranial pressure in patients undergoing resuscitation positioning. It aims to evaluate the effects of these ventilation modes on patients in resuscitation positions. The main questions it seeks to answer are: Does the PRVC mode more effectively control airway pressure and intracranial pressure in patients undergoing resuscitation positioning. Does it help to reduce the risk of increased intracranial pressure during surgery.

Randomization and blinding Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1: 1: 1 ratio using a random number table. The anesthesiologists and surgeons performing the anesthesia and assisting with the surgery were only informed of the mechanical ventilation mode to be used. Patients were unaware of their group assignment because mechanical ventilation was initiated after anesthesia induction when they were unconscious. The anesthetic nurses and doctors evaluating the patients postoperatively were also unaware of the group assignments.
2. 4. Anesthetic and analgesic managements Anesthesia was administered according to standardized institutional protocols. Patients received 1. 5–2 mg/kg propofol, 1–2 mg/kg rocuronium, and 1–2 μg/kg remifentanil for induction. Anesthesia was maintained with inhaled sevoflurane or desflurane, with the inhaled concentration adjusted based on the electroencephalogram.

Remifentanil was continuously infused at 0. 05–0. 2 μg/kg/min, adjusting blood pressure and heart rate to within ± 20% of baseline values. Thirty minutes before anesthesia emergence, all patients were administered 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine, 1 μg/kg fentanyl, and 4 mg tramadol, and a patient-controlled analgesia device was initiated. The PCA was set to deliver a bolus dose of 15 μg fentanyl with a 10-minute lockout interval and no basal infusion. Data on PCA usage were collected, including the time and dose of each administration. If the pain remained intolerable despite these measures, rescue analgesia was administered, including 1 μg/kg fentanyl or 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine IV.
2. 5.

Interventions Patients in the PCV group underwent mechanical ventilation in PC mode after induction. The ventilator Italy) settings were as follows: Adjust inspiratory pressure to maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration at 4. 0–5. 0 kPa. The investigators used 0. 3 L/min of pure oxygen and air each, with an oxygen concentration of 41%. Patients in the VCV group underwent mechanical ventilation in VC mode after induction. The ventilator was set with a tidal volume of 6–8 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure at 0 cmH2O, a ratio of inspiration to expiration of 1: 2, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen concentration of 41%. Patients in the PRVC group underwent mechanical ventilation in PRVC mode after induction. The respiratory parameters were the same as those in group Ⅱ.

Apart from compromised airway clearance and lower airway contamination imposed by endotracheal intubation, the primary hazards inherent to positive pressure ventilation may be considered in three broad categories: hemodynamic impairment, potential for ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI), and impairment of the respiratory muscle pump. Quite distinct from these concerns, current support by controlled ventilation is inconsistently applied and relatively insensitive to the continually changing needs of the critically ill individual. Once established, controlled patterns of tidal volume (Vₜ), flow profile and frequency often cycle monotonously until readjusted following the sounding of pre-set alarms. Surveillance of patient status is not continuous, and the data monitored are both incomplete and/ or only loosely related to the actual properties of interest. Positive pressure ventilation produces complex interactions among multiple vital organ systems. Unfortunately, varying training and expertise of caregivers is a serious and universal problem.

While often helpful as first approximations, ventilation guidelines are not enough, as they are based on imprecise definitions of diseases or syndromes and clinical trials of inherently diverse patient populations. Such factors limit our ability to appropriately personalize care. Yet, emerging technology opens the possibility that such gaps in meeting the key objectives of respiratory support might be addressed effectively by equipment of the future that consistently achieves all primary objectives of controlled ventilation. In essence, the goals are to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation and carbon dioxide balance while avoiding adverse side effects on gas exchange, hemodynamics, lung structure, and the respiratory muscle pump. Because no single set of parameters would suit all patients, personalized priorities and individually set 'guardrails' for these integrated goals would be essential. We envision clinician-determined operating ranges for essential cardiorespiratory variables while automated machine interventions stay within them.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^0bac6bdc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine ARDS mechanical ventilation guideline — evidence synthesis and recommendation strength follow the GRADE approach: recommendations are either "strong" or "conditional", with the phrases "we recommend" for strong recommendations and "we suggest" for conditional recommendations; the committee weighed GRADE evidence profiles and additional evidence when deliberating. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models in RevMan 5.2, binary outcomes are presented as risk ratios and continuous outcomes as weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and confidence in effect estimates was assessed with GRADE; randomized trials begin as high-quality evidence and can be rated down or up based on specified factors, and overall confidence was categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low. Primary analyses for each PICO question were limited to RCTs without important cointerventions.

### Protocol and statistical analysis plan for the mode of ventilation during critical illness (MODE) trial [^824fb719]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

For every critically ill adult receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, clinicians must select a mode of ventilation. The mode of ventilation determines whether the ventilator directly controls the tidal volume or the inspiratory pressure. Newer hybrid modes allow clinicians to set a target tidal volume; the ventilator controls and adjusts the inspiratory pressure. A strategy of low tidal volumes and low plateau pressure improves outcomes, but the optimal mode to achieve these targets is not known.

Research Question

Can a cluster-randomized trial design be used to assess whether the mode of mandatory ventilation affects the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation among critically ill adults?

Study Design and Methods

The Mode of Ventilation During Critical Illness (MODE) trial is a cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover pilot trial being conducted in the medical ICU at an academic center. The MODE trial compares the use of volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control. The study ICU is assigned to a single-ventilator mode (volume control vs pressure control vs adaptive pressure control) for continuous mandatory ventilation during each 1-month study block. The assigned mode switches every month in a randomly generated sequence. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days to study day 28, defined as the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation from the final receipt of mechanical ventilation to 28 days after enrollment. Enrollment began November 1, 2022, and will end on July 31, 2023.

Results

This manuscript describes the protocol and statistical analysis plan for the MODE trial of ventilator modes comparing volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control.

Interpretation

Prespecifying the full statistical analysis plan prior to completion of enrollment increases rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of the trial results.

Clinical Trial Registration

The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov on October 3, 2022, before initiation of patient enrollment on November 1, 2022 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05563779).

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^d08b0961]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

In certain details, recent guidelines have diverged. We felt that the evidence supporting the role of recruitment manoeuvres was so poor and the concept so ill-defined that we were unable to make a recommendation. By contrast, the American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine group has given a conditional recommendation, although with low-to-moderate confidence. Similarly, our group did not consider airway pressure release ventilation owing to the paucity of high quality, relevant evidence, despite the knowledge that this ventilatory mode is widely used. Hopefully there will be sufficient evidence to justify including these interventions in the next version of the guidelines.

We have synthesised available evidence with the clinical practice of the GDG into a management algorithm (figure 1). Hence, for a patient presenting with for example severe ARDS, low tidal volume (< 6 ml/kg IBW) and low plateau pressure (< 30 cmH 2 O), mechanical ventilation using higher PEEP is recommended with the addition of neuromuscular blockade for the first 48 hours and prone positioning for at least 12 hours per day. After initial resuscitation of the circulation, a neutral or, if tolerated, a negative fluid balance target should be set. Consideration of escalation to extracorporeal lung support (ECMO or ECCO₂R) is indicated by the failure to achieve adequate gas exchange using protective ventilatory settings as described above. To what extent is this synthesis evidence-based? While the individual components are to an extent evidence-based, the combination of interventions has evolved rather than being formally tested. For example, attempts have been made to test a so-called 'open lung approach', by combining higher PEEP levels with low tidal volume ventilation both in early studies concentrating on low tidal volume ventilation, in subsequent PEEP trials and more recently in studies combining the use of recruitment manoeuvres and high levels of PEEP. The rationale for the open lung approach is that increasing airway pressure will increase the volume of ventilatable lung, thereby decreasing VALI and a large clinical trial was supported by encouraging pilot data. This Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (ART) carried out in 1010 patients with severe ARDS surprisingly showed significantly higher 6-month mortality (65.3% vs 59.9%) in the intervention group. These data demonstrate the enduring value of large well-conducted clinical trials of complex interventions in this challenging patient group.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation in ARDS — prone positioning recommendation states that adult patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receive prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-high confidence in effect estimates. The panel notes a lack of consensus on providing a conditional recommendation for prone positioning in patients with moderate ARDS with a Pao₂/Fio₂ of 101–150 because of lower confidence in the balance of outcomes, and it is unknown whether higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can potentiate the lung-protective effects of prone positioning; trials to date have used moderate levels of PEEP and further research is required to evaluate the benefit of higher PEEP during prone positioning.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^65dd3793]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/ESICM/SCCM ARDS ventilation — Low tidal volume and plateau pressure limits: We recommend that adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receive ventilation strategies that limit tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight [PBW]) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) (strong recommendation, moderate confidence in effect estimates). In nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 1,629 patients comparing low tidal volume (LTV) with traditional volumes (10–15 ml/kg PBW), delivered volumes averaged 6.8 ± 1.2 ml/kg PBW versus 11.4 ± 1.1 ml/kg PBW, with no significant mortality difference overall (seven studies, 1,481 patients; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.70–1.08), and no significant differences in barotrauma (three studies, 1,029 patients; RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.67–1.37) or ventilator-free days (two studies, 977 patients; 0.3 more VFDs; 95% CI, –5.88 to 5.95). For implementation, the initial tidal volume should be set at 6 ml/kg PBW and can be increased up to 8 ml/kg PBW if the patient is double triggering or if inspiratory airway pressure decreases below PEEP.

### Ventilatory management of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^a926812b]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

The acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are critical illnesses associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Mechanical ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive therapy. However, despite several important advances, the optimal strategy for ventilation and adjunctive therapies for patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome is still evolving.

Evidence Acquisition

To identify reports of invasive ventilatory and adjunctive therapies in adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, we performed a systematic English-language literature search of MEDLINE (1966–2005) using the Medical Subject Heading respiratory distress syndrome, adult, and related text words, with emphasis on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were similarly searched. The search yielded 1357 potential articles of which 53 were relevant to the study objectives and considered in this review.

Evidence Synthesis

There is strong evidence to support the use of volume- and pressure-limited lung-protective ventilation in adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The benefit of increased levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers is uncertain and is being further evaluated in ongoing trials. Existing randomized controlled trials of alternative ventilation modes, such as high-frequency oscillation and adjunctive therapies, including inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning demonstrate no significant survival advantage. However, they may have a role as rescue therapy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with refractory life-threatening hypoxemia.

Conclusions

Volume- and pressure-limited ventilation strategies should be used in managing adult acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Further research is needed to identify barriers to widespread adoption of this strategy, as well as the role of alternative ventilation modes and adjunctive therapies.

### Effect of ventilator mode on ventilator-free days in critically ill adults: a randomized clinical trial [^e9b17e02]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in this clinical trial, the number of ventilator-free days did not differ among patients treated with volume control, pressure control, or adaptive pressure control. Measures of protective mechanical ventilation differed among groups, with patients in the volume control group experiencing higher peak inspiratory pressures, patients in the pressure control group experiencing a higher percentage of breaths with a tidal volume of > 8 mL/kg of PBW, and patients in the adaptive pressure control group experiencing less deep sedation.

For each of the millions of adults who receive invasive mechanical ventilation every year, clinicians must select a ventilator mode. Only 2 previous randomized trials have compared the effects of commonly used mandatory ventilator modes on outcomes for critically ill adults. These trials enrolled a total of 106 patients combined, compared only volume control and pressure control, and were completed before lung-protective ventilation and daily interruption of sedation were established as evidence-based practices. To our knowledge, no prior randomized trial has examined the effect of adaptive pressure control on clinical outcomes. Among almost 600 patients in the current trial, the assigned ventilator mode affected the tidal volumes and inspiratory pressures that patients experienced, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in the number of ventilator-free days. These findings provide clinicians with reassurance that the choice of ventilator modes does not result in a large overall difference in death or the duration of mechanical ventilation. However, because the numerical differences in ventilator-free days among the adaptive pressure control (24 days), volume control (23 days), and pressure control (22 days) groups and the associated CIs include differences that could be meaningful clinically, the effects of ventilator mode on patient outcomes warrant further evaluation in randomized trials.

### Are there benefits or harm from pressure targeting during lung-protective ventilation? [^44defd7e]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Mechanically, breath design is usually either flow/volume-targeted or pressure-targeted. Both approaches can effectively provide lung-protective ventilation, but they prioritize different ventilation parameters, so their responses to changing respiratory-system mechanics and patient effort are different. These different response behaviors have advantages and disadvantages that can be important in specific circumstances. Flow/volume targeting guarantees a set minute ventilation but sometimes may be difficult to synchronize with patient effort, and it will not limit inspiratory pressure. In contrast, pressure targeting, with its variable flow, may be easier to synchronize and will limit inspiratory pressure, but it provides no control over delivered volume. Skilled clinicians can maximize benefits and minimize problems with either flow/volume targeting or pressure targeting. Indeed, as is often the case in managing complex life-support devices, it is operator expertise rather than the device design features that most impacts patient outcomes.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — conclusions emphasize individualized application of recommendations and research gaps: Significant advances have been made in the ventilatory management of ARDS in the last few decades, and clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline, and they should be careful when comparing the relative benefits of one intervention over another if they have the same rating. The potential benefits or synergies of combined or sequential treatments with interventions included in this guideline have not been explicitly studied, and therefore no recommendations have been made, while most recent studies of ventilatory interventions, however, have used LTV ventilation in recognition of supportive clinical and experimental evidence.

### Ten important articles on noninvasive ventilation in critically ill patients and insights for the future: a report of expert opinions [^e972f231]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), as it is commonly known, includes the application of negative pressure to the airways by iron lung or body ventilators, the delivery of noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or application of noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via noninvasive interface. NIV, used as NIPPV or CPAP, is nowadays, a medical intervention used in daily practice worldwide in many clinical settings. Since the first pioneering studies of noninvasive ventilation in critical care in the late 1980s thousands of studies and manuscripts have been published on this topic exploring different clinical applications, modalities, interfaces and comparisons with other therapies. Its effectiveness has been proven for common clinical conditions in critical care, such as cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as for ventilatory support for patients with ventilatory pump failure and to prevent extubation failure. However, although extensively studied, some aspects remain controversial such as its role in hypoxemic "de novo" respiratory failure, the best interface and ventilatory modality to optimize patient-ventilator interaction and comfort and side effects (e.g. skin breakdown and non-intentional air-leaks). Recently, its role has been questioned and re-analyzed in light of a widespread use of a new ventilator support mode (high flow nasal therapy - HFNT), better drugs for sedation and emerging patho-physiological concepts such as NIV-induced lung damage due to high transpulmonary pressure/driving pressure or generated tidal volume. Thus, during the past decades, some NIV applications have become established, others are being re-examined and need further exploration in the near future. The present survey among some of the worldwide leading experts aims to: 1) select and review 10 important articles published on NIV in critical care setting 2) highlight future directions for both research and clinical applications of this fundamental mode of ventilation that all critical care physicians should be skilled in applying.

### Pressure control plus spontaneous ventilation versus volume assist-control ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. A randomised clinical trial [^65be9c74]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Study population

A total of 2371 patients with inclusion criteria were screened for participation (Fig. 1). Seven hundred patients were included of whom 348 were randomised to the PC-SV strategy and 352 to ACV strategy between February 2013 and October 2018 in 22 French ICUs. One patient assigned to the PC-SV group withdrew his consent prior to protocol initiation. The median number of enrolled patients across the 22 participating sites was 27 [IQR 6–50]. Six hundred and ninety-nine patients completed 60-day follow-up and were included in analyses of all clinical endpoints.

### Driving pressure is not associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated patients without ARDS [^efc98fa1]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

We did identify a significant association between lower tidal volume and improved survival in non-ARDS patients. This association, which supports the findings of other studies in non-ARDS patients, is not consistent with a recent prospective randomized clinical trial. Our non-linear model suggested a non-linear relationship between tidal volume and mortality in patients without ARDS. One possible explanation for this non-linear relationship might be confounding by indication, where healthier non-ARDS patients might be more likely to receive lower tidal volumes.

We are reassured that our data supports an association between tidal volume and mortality in ARDS patients and supports the recent meta-analysis confirming the association of ΔP and mortality in ARDS patients. While the current state of evidence is not mature enough to recommend ΔP as a management strategy for ARDS, our data demonstrates no justification at this time to recommend it as a management strategy for non-ARDS patients.

We noted a large percentage of patients in our study cohort were managed with APC ventilation, which is a dual-controlled ventilation wherein the ventilator attempts to achieve tidal volume using a pressure-limited delivery format at the lowest possible airway pressure. While this mode of ventilation may decrease peak inspiratory pressures, no evidence exists that APC improves outcomes. It is possible some of the differences we observed may be confounded by varying management strategies at different ICUs, some of which use APC more than others. The role of respiratory effort may affect the accuracy of ΔP in APC. In a passively ventilated patient, ΔP might be erroneously interpreted if the flow is not zeroed, while in a spontaneously breathing patient the ΔP might be affected by the changes in delivered volume associated with respiratory effort. Synchronization with the ventilator was not consistently recorded and therefore may affect the measurement of ΔP.

### We do not need mechanical ventilation any more [^70a1e111]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving treatment delivered to patients with a wide spectrum of medical and surgical diseases. However, significant limitations of the clinical application of mechanical ventilation in current practice have emerged, prompting the definition of novel therapeutic perspectives, especially concerning the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory failure. In the past few decades, there has been a consistent scientific and technologic effort to develop alternative strategies to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation. In particular, several studies have explored the feasibility and efficacy of extracorporeal oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. Furthermore, promising results on the prevention of the occurrence of severe acute respiratory failure have been provided by clinical studies on the noninvasive application of continuous positive airway pressure as well as by experimental investigations in basic science. Therefore, further development in this direction will occur only with a permanent integration and exchange of knowledge among industry, clinicians, and scientific investigators.

### Approaches to conventional mechanical ventilation of the patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^6b93373c]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

To minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, attention should be directed toward avoidance of alveolar over-distention and cyclical opening and closure of alveoli. The most impressive study of mechanical ventilation to date is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network study of higher versus lower tidal volume (V(T)), which reported a reduction in mortality from 39.8% to 31.0% with 6 mL/kg ideal body weight rather than 12 mL/kg ideal body weight (number-needed-to-treat of 12 patients). To achieve optimal lung protection, the lowest plateau pressure and Vₜ possible should be selected. What is most important is limitation of V(T) and alveolar distending pressure, regardless of the mode set on the ventilator. Accumulating observational evidence suggests that V(T) should be limited in all mechanically ventilated patients-even those who do not have ALI/ARDS. Evidence does not support the use of pressure controlled inverse-ratio ventilation. Although zero PEEP is probably injurious, an area of considerable controversy is the optimal setting of PEEP. Available evidence does not support the use of higher PEEP, compared to lower PEEP, in unselected patients with acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. However, results of a meta-analysis using individual patients from 3 randomized controlled trials suggest that higher PEEP should be used for ARDS, whereas lower PEEP may be more appropriate in patients with ALI. PEEP should be set to maximize alveolar recruitment while avoiding over-distention. Many approaches for setting PEEP have been described, but evidence is lacking that any one approach is superior to any other. In most, if not all, cases of ALI/ARDS, conventional ventilation strategies can be used effectively to provide lung-protective ventilation strategies.

### Does a higher positive end expiratory pressure decrease mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^40c5a3ff]. Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is an important component of therapy in patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The independent effect of PEEP on mortality is currently unknown.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the use of higher and lower levels of PEEP.

Results

Six trials with a total of 2,484 patients from 102 intensive care units and 9 countries met the eligibility criteria. In three trials, the effect of different levels of PEEP was compared in groups receiving comparable tidal volumes. Three trials accounted for more than 85% of total weighting in the meta-analyses. The pooled relative risk obtained from these three trials showed a trend towards improved mortality with high PEEP, even though the difference did not reach statistical significance: Pooled cumulative risk of 0.90 (95% CI 0.72–1.02, P = 0.077). The reduction in absolute risk of death was approximately 4%. There was no evidence of a significant increase in baro-trauma in patients receiving high PEEP, with a pooled risk of 0.95 (95% CI 0.62–1.45, P = 0.81).

Conclusion

High PEEP strategy may have a clinically relevant independent mortality benefit. Despite a possible increase in baro-trauma, the benefits far outweigh potential risks. Current evidence therefore favors the use of high PEEP as the preferred option when ventilating patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. As the reduction in absolute risk of death is less than 5%, a future clinical trial aimed at demonstrating statistical significance is likely to pose considerable financial and ethical burdens.

Ventilator mode — adaptive ventilation at night versus pressure support in critically ill adults — We make no recommendation regarding the use of an adaptive mode of ventilation at night (vs pressure support ventilation) for improving sleep in critically ill adults (no recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Five small randomized controlled crossover trials compared an adaptive mode of ventilation versus a pressure support mode in primarily medical critically ill adults, and due to feasibility/availability concerns and limited data, we were not able to make a recommendation regarding the use of adaptive ventilation at night.

### Effect of ventilator mode on ventilator-free days in critically ill adults: a randomized clinical trial [^a40e78fe]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Each of the 3 ventilator modes evaluated in this trial can be used to deliver ventilation that targets the low tidal volumes and low plateau pressures that have been demonstrated to decrease mortality for critically ill adults; however, it has been hypothesized that, in practice, a ventilator mode that directly controls the tidal volume, such as volume control, may be superior at ensuring the consistent delivery of low tidal volumes, whereas a ventilator mode that directly controls the inspiratory pressure, such as pressure control or adaptive pressure control, may be superior at limiting inspiratory pressure. The results of the current trial seem to confirm this hypothesis and suggest that the choice of ventilator mode in practice may involve a trade-off between optimizing the tidal volume received and optimizing the inspiratory pressure experienced. Whether the observed differences among ventilator modes in tidal volume, inspiratory pressure, and sedation translate into small but clinically meaningful differences in downstream patient outcomes overall, or larger differences in outcome for specific types of patients, remains uncertain.

Study Strengths and Limitations

The current trial has several strengths. Enrollment of all eligible patients in the study location increased generalizability. Adherence to the assigned ventilator mode was assessed frequently (every 1 minute) and was excellent (> 92% compliance in all 3 trial groups). Cluster-level allocation allowed patients to begin receiving the assigned mode at or within minutes of the first breaths of invasive mechanical ventilation in the study unit. This early delivery of the study intervention is important because ventilator settings early in critical illness may have the greatest effects on clinical outcomes. Finally, all aspects of ventilator management aside from ventilator mode were guided by unit-wide protocols that standardized the administration of evidence-based best practices in mechanical ventilation of critically ill adults.

This trial has several important limitations. Although conducting the trial in a single ICU increased internal validity by facilitating fidelity to the intervention and the collection of detailed data on separation among the groups, this limits generalizability. Patients and clinicians were aware of the assigned ventilator mode. Despite being the largest trial examining ventilator modes to date, this pilot trial had insufficient statistical power to detect small but potentially clinically meaningful treatment effects, overall or for specific types of patients such as those with severe lung injury. All trial data were collected within routine clinical care; dedicated physiologic measurements of respiratory system compliance and patient-ventilator synchrony were not performed. The trial protocol did not control other aspects of care such as positive end-expiratory pressure or the approach to ventilator weaning. However, these treatments were standardized according to institutional protocols and did not differ among the groups.

Study design

This was a multicentre open-labelled randomised clinical trial. The trial enrolled participants from February 2013 to October 2018 at 22 French university (16) and non-university hospitals (6) intensive care units (ICUs) of the REVA (Réseau Européen de recherche en Ventilation Artificielle) Network. In agreement with French regulation, the study protocol was approved for all centres by the ethics committee of the Angers University Hospital (Comité de Protection des Personnes, CHU d'Angers, ID RCB #2012-A00551-42). Informed consent was provided by study participants or their surrogates in written form before study inclusion. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01862016).

The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are provided in the electronic supplementary material (ESM).

Patients

Patients with moderate to severe ARDS (partial pressure of arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO₂/FiO₂) ratio ≤ 200 mmHg with PEEP ≥ 5 cmH₂O) were eligible for enrolment if the four criteria of the Berlin definition were met for no more than 48 h.

Main exclusion criteria were suspected or confirmed increased intracranial pressure, sickle cell disease, severe chronic respiratory disease requiring long-term oxygen therapy or home mechanical ventilation, actual body weight exceeding 1 kg/cm of height, severe burns, severe chronic liver disease (Child–Pugh class C), bone marrow transplant or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, pneumothorax, expected duration of mechanical ventilation shorter than 48 h, decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment, ventilator recommended for the study not available. Additional exclusion criteria are detailed in ESM, page 2.

Randomisation

Patients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks stratified by centre. Blinding treating clinicians to group assignment was not feasible, but analyses were conducted blindly.

### Pressure control plus spontaneous ventilation versus volume assist-control ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. A randomised clinical trial [^c926a0cc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The study BiRDS was published by Jean-Christophe M Richard and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the BiRDS study, the trial question was: what is the role of pressure control plus spontaneous ventilation in patients with ARDS? In the BiRDS study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BiRDS study, the population was: 699 patients (218 female, 481 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS. The key exclusion criteria were suspected or confirmed increased ICP; sickle cell disease; severe chronic respiratory disease requiring long-term oxygen therapy or home mechanical ventilation; severe burns; severe chronic liver disease; bone marrow transplant or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia; pneumothorax; expected duration of mechanical ventilation < 48 hours. In the BiRDS study, the interventions were: n = 347 pressure control plus spontaneous ventilation (sedation and/or ventilator settings adjusted to maintain the objective of spontaneous ventilation, modifying either minute ventilation or sedation) n = 352 volume assist-control ventilation (daily assessment of patient-ventilator asynchronies based on simple definitions recommended to further adapt sedation and/or ventilator settings). In the BiRDS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death in the hospital at day 60 (34.6% vs. 33.5%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.27). In the BiRDS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of death in the first 28 days (25.1% vs. 22.4%; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.46) No significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (11.8 days vs. 12.2 days; AD -0.4 days, 95% CI -1.6 to 0.9) Significant decrease in use of adjunctive therapy (33.1% vs. 41.3%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98). In the BiRDS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS, pressure control plus spontaneous ventilation was not superior to volume assist-control ventilation with respect to death in the hospital at day 60.

Summary of recommendations

Principles of mechanical ventilation

Modes of mechanical ventilation

Recommendation

1. Pressure targeted ventilators are the devices of choice for acute NIV (grade B).

Good practice points
Pressure support and pressure control modes are effective.
Only ventilators designed specifically to deliver NIV should be used.

Choice of interface for NIV

Recommendation

2. A full face mask should usually be the first type of interface used (grade D).

Good practice points
A range of masks and sizes is required and staff involved in delivering NIV need training in and experience of using them.
NIV circuits must allow adequate clearance of exhaled air through an exhalation valve or an integral exhalation port on the mask.

Indications for and contraindications to NIV in AHRF

Recommendation

3. The presence of adverse features increase the risk of NIV failure and should prompt consideration of placement in HDU/ICU (grade C) (see figure 1).

Good practice points
Adverse features should not, on their own, lead to withholding a trial of NIV.
The presence of relative contra-indications necessitates a higher level of supervision, consideration of placement in HDU/ICU and an early appraisal of whether to continue NIV or to convert to IMV.

Monitoring during NIV

Good practice points
Oxygen saturation should be continuously monitored.
Intermittent measurement of pCO2 and pH is required.
ECG monitoring is advised if the patient has a pulse rate > 120 bpm or if there is dysrhythmia or possible cardiomyopathy.

Supplemental oxygen therapy with NIV

Recommendations

4. Oxygen enrichment should be adjusted to achieve SaO2 88–92% in all causes of AHRF treated by NIV (grade A).

5. Oxygen should be entrained as close to the patient as possible (grade C).

Good practice points
As gas exchange will improve with increased alveolar ventilation, NIV settings should be optimised before increasing the FiO2.
The flow rate of supplemental oxygen may need to be increased when ventilatory pressure is increased to maintain the same SaO2 target.
Mask leak and delayed triggering may be caused by oxygen flow rates > 4 L/min which risks promoting or exacerbating patient-ventilator asynchrony. The requirement for high flow rates should prompt a careful check for patient-ventilator asynchrony.
A ventilator with an integral oxygen blender is recommended if oxygen at 4 L/min fails to maintain SaO2 > 88%.

Methods and Analysis

This manuscript was written by the MODE trial investigators, in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines (e-Appendix 1, section 1). In this manuscript, we describe key elements of the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan.

Supplementary materials in e-Appendix 1 provide additional background on design decisions (sections 2, 19, 22), mode monitoring and management (sections 3, 4, 12, 15, 23, 24), institutional protocols and management of critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (sections 5–11), a complete list of data elements (section 13), additional outcome definitions (section 14), details of the interim analysis (section 16), and secondary analysis considerations (sections 17, 18).

Study Design

The MODE trial is a prospective, cluster-randomized, multiple-crossover trial being conducted in the medical ICU at a single center. This trial compares use of volume control vs pressure control vs adaptive pressure control among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the study ICU. Consistent with the goals of a pragmatic trial, delivery of the intervention is embedded in routine clinical care and managed by bedside clinicians. The primary outcome is the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation to study day 28 after enrollment. Feasibility measures are reported to inform the conduct of a subsequent multicenter trial. The trial protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center institutional review board (IRB# 220446) on July 21, 2022, and was registered with on October 3, 2022, before initiation of patient enrollment on November 1, 2022.

### A clinical guide to non-invasive respiratory support in acute respiratory failure: ventilation settings, technical optimization and clinical indications [^15621075]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)

CPAP delivery systems

During CPAP, a constant positive pressure is applied throughout the entire respiratory cycle. CPAP can be delivered through various types of devices, allowing for adaptation to different environments and constraints. Both helmet and facemask interfaces can be employed. When facemask is used, CPAP can be administered by any kind of ventilator (e.g. ICU, transport, homecare ventilators), either directly in CPAP mode or in pressure support ventilation mode with the pressure support (PS) set to zero. In this situation, delivering pure CPAP is impossible because the ventilator cycles between inspiratory and expiratory phases, resulting in a pressure that is not truly continuous throughout the entire breathing cycle, unlike in pure CPAP mode.

Additionally, CPAP can be provided using easy-to-use, non-electric, single-use devices that require minimal equipment, giving CPAP a frugal dimension and making it suitable for providing respiratory support in resource-limited settings, such as during a pandemic. Examples include a fresh gas flow generated by a Venturi system (e.g. Ventumask - Intersurgical, Wokingham, United Kingdom) coupled with a PEEP valve, or virtual valves, that convert gas flow into pressure within the mask (e.g. Boussignac CPAP-Vygon, Ecouen, France- and O-Two CPAP - O-Two medical technologies, Brampton, Canada). Finally, innovative oxygen-saving CPAP have recently been developed (e.g. Bag-CPAP-Air Liquide Medical Systems, Antony, France).

CPAP via low flow systems, such as ventilator CPAP mode, should be avoided, as pressure may not remain constant throughout the respiratory cycle, increasing WOB due to "insufficient flow" (see "Helmet CPAP" section). Therefore, when CPAP is delivered via a mechanical ventilator, using high-flow O 2 therapy ensures adequate fresh gas flow and stable pressure during the respiratory cycle.

### Liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults: an Official American College of Chest Physicians / American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: inspiratory pressure augmentation during spontaneous breathing trials, protocols minimizing sedation, and noninvasive ventilation immediately after extubation [^719699a0]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/CHEST guideline — early mobilization rehabilitation after mechanical ventilation > 24 h: For acutely hospitalized adults who have been mechanically ventilated for > 24 h, we suggest protocolized rehabilitation directed toward early mobilization (Conditional Recommendation, Low Quality Evidence), and there is insufficient evidence to recommend any rehabilitation protocol over another. The evidence synthesis demonstrated that patients who received an intervention directed toward early mobilization had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and were more likely to be able to walk at hospital discharge. There were no differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, ability to walk at ICU discharge, 6-min walk distance, or ventilator-free days. Low rates of serious adverse events, including arrhythmias, have been reported. This recommendation places a high value on reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and maintenance of ambulation and a lower value on cost and resource use.

Discussion

The summary of the group's recommendations emphasises the importance of avoiding VALI in patients with ARDS, as all of the interventions with positive recommendations apart from maintaining a conservative fluid balance, arguably act through this process. Despite at best moderate quality evidence by MA, we have strongly supported the use of low tidal volume and low airway pressure mechanical ventilation. This ventilation strategy is supported by results of the ARDS Network ARMA study, data from studies whose primary outcome was the prevention of ARDS and a large volume of evidence from preclinical and mechanistic studies. It is now so universally accepted that it is mandated for all patients in clinical trials of ARDS. When applied to patients with moderate/severe ARDS for at least 12 hours per day, prone positioning was also strongly recommended because the most recent studies focused enrolment on the most severe strata of patients with ARDS and involved a multimodal intervention comprising lung-protective ventilation with prolonged prone positioning producing highly favourable outcomes. By contrast, despite a strong theoretical rationale as a means of preventing VALI, high frequency oscillatory ventilation was ineffective or deleterious in two large studies leading to our recommendation strongly against its use.

While broadly similar recommendations for the management of ARDS have been produced, many questions remain. Fundamentally the parameters characterising optimal protective mechanical ventilation are unknown, as are the optimal means of achieving them. We have recommended targeting < 6 mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW), but, based on the absence of evidence of a safe tidal volume threshold on retrospective reanalysis of the ARMA studyand a dose-response effect seen in observational studies, it would be reasonable to recommend minimising tidal volume as far as possible. Similarly, analysing individual patient data from RCT concluded that driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) was a better predictor of outcome than tidal volume or plateau pressure alone. Finally, there is no consensus regarding the means used to optimise PEEP (oxygenation or various lung mechanical parameters) or to manage the respiratory acidosis that commonly accompanies protective ventilation.

### Protocol and statistical analysis plan for the mode of ventilation during critical illness (MODE) trial [^1d3b2931]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Ventilator Mode:

The MODE trial compares volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control (Table 2). On initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, nearly all patients require a ventilator mode that initiates breaths at a set frequency (mandatory mode of ventilation). The three most commonly used modes of mandatory ventilation are volume control, pressure control, and adaptive pressure control. Each of these modes provides continuous mandatory ventilation, in which every inspiratory effort by a patient triggers a machine-cycled breath delivered by the ventilator, and a set minimum respiratory rate is maintained by machine-triggered breaths as needed.

For patients enrolled in the MODE trial, clinicians are instructed to use the assigned mode beginning at the first receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in the study ICU and ending at the first of (1) extubation from mechanical ventilation, (2) transfer out of the study ICU, (3) treating clinician deciding that optimal care requires a different mode (with completion of a ventilator mode modification sheet), or (4) end of the 1-month study block (e-Appendix 1, section 15). Any patients who remain mechanically ventilated during a "crossover" from one month to the next will, after the "crossover", have their mode of ventilation determined by the clinical team. The treating team may opt to continue the mode assigned during the prior month, use the mode assigned to the current month, or use any other mode they believe would be best for the patient. If a patient is enrolled, extubated, and reintubated during the same study block, the study protocol will determine the ventilator mode until they meet one of the criteria listed above. The study protocol does not determine the ventilator mode during periods in which the patient is not receiving a mandatory mode of ventilation (eg, use of pressure support ventilation such as during a spontaneous breathing trial), is not physically located in the study ICU (eg, during transport), or is undergoing an invasive procedure (eg, bronchoscopy).

### The standard of care of patients with ARDS: ventilatory settings and rescue therapies for refractory hypoxemia [^faca0979]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Ventilatory setting I: tidal volume/respiratory rate

Low tidal volume in hypoxemic ARDS

Low V T ventilation (6 ml/kg predicted body weight, PBW) reduces 28-day and total hospital mortality, but PBW-based V T ignores the lung volume actually available for ventilation. The applied volume is only distributed to aerated regions, and the larger the non-aerated regions, the greater the associated hyperinflation (strain). The driving pressure for a given V T is responsible for opening lung areas which are collapsed at end-expiration. A lower pressure will not reopen these areas and hypoxemia will worsen. The solution is to increase PEEP in order to reap the potential benefits of such a protective approach, especially in severe ARDS. This will also reduce the driving pressure required. It would allow more individualized settings based on physiologic measurements and considerations.

Volume- or pressure-controlled mode

Whether pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) can reduce ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) compared to volume-controlled (VCV) ventilation is a matter of debate. A meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concluded that PCV was not superior to VCV, with a relative risk of hospital and ICU mortality for PCV versus VCV of 0.83 (95% CI 0.67–1.02; p = 0.08) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.71–0.99; p = 0.04), respectively. Another systematic review which included 34 studies concluded that outcome is "unlikely influenced by simply using one breath type vs the other for all patients". Since flow, driving pressure, and frequency determine the power, and the factor by which ventilation injures the lungs, it seems unlikely that the manner in which this power is delivered (i.e. flow pattern) plays a major role. Airway pressure release ventilation provides a potential recruitment by increased airway pressure and allows spontaneous breathing, with some potential benefits (decreased sedation, shorter mechanical ventilation, and improvement in cardiac performance). High-frequency oscillatory ventilation delivers very small tidal volumes, to prevent volutrauma, at a constant (relatively high) mean airway pressure. Despite their theoretical benefits, the clinical evidence of both techniques remains unproven and controversial for ARDS patients.

### Perioperative anaesthetic management of patients with or at risk of acute distress respiratory syndrome undergoing emergency surgery [^3e59d46b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventilation modes and spontaneous breathing

Volume- (VCV) or pressure-controlled (PCV) mode can be applied unrestrictedly in ARDS patients with no influence on outcome, and no clear advantage in surgical patients. However, observational data concerning patients at risk of developing PPCs showed that, during surgery, VCV might offer more benefits than PCV. Alternative modes of mechanical ventilation include airway pressure release ventilation and high frequency ventilation, but the lack of outcome data preclude a recommendation on their routine use. While spontaneous breathing activity should be suppressed in severe ARDS, it might have a protective role in mild ARDS and high risk of ARDS surgical patients.

### High versus low positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels for mechanically ventilated adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^a415b5d4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality remains high. These patients require mechanical ventilation, which has been associated with ventilator-induced lung injury. High levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) could reduce this condition and improve patient survival. This is an updated version of the review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of high versus low levels of PEEP in adults with ALI and ARDS.

Search Methods

For our previous review, we searched databases from inception until 2013. For this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the Web of Science from inception until May 2020. We also searched for ongoing trials (www.trialscentral.org; www.clinicaltrial.gov; www.controlled-trials.com), and we screened the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared high versus low levels of PEEP in ALI and ARDS participants who were intubated and mechanically ventilated in intensive care for at least 24 hours.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. We contacted investigators to identify additional published and unpublished studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included four new studies (1343 participants) in this review update. In total, we included 10 studies (3851 participants). We found evidence of risk of bias in six studies, and the remaining studies fulfilled all criteria for low risk of bias. In eight studies (3703 participants), a comparison was made between high and low levels of PEEP, with the same tidal volume in both groups. In the remaining two studies (148 participants), the tidal volume was different between high- and low-level groups. In the main analysis, we assessed mortality occurring before hospital discharge only in studies that compared high versus low PEEP, with the same tidal volume in both groups. Evidence suggests that high PEEP may result in little to no difference in mortality compared to low PEEP (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.04; I² = 15%; 7 studies, 3640 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, high PEEP may result in little to no difference in barotrauma (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.57; I² = 63%; 9 studies, 3791 participants; low-certainty evidence). High PEEP may improve oxygenation in patients up to the first and third days of mechanical ventilation (first day: mean difference (MD) 51.03, 95% CI 35.86 to 66.20; I² = 85%; 6 studies, 2594 participants; low-certainty evidence; third day: MD 50.32, 95% CI 34.92 to 65.72; I² = 83%; 6 studies, 2309 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably improves oxygenation up to the seventh day (MD 28.52, 95% CI 20.82 to 36.21; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1611 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Evidence suggests that high PEEP results in little to no difference in the number of ventilator-free days (MD 0.45, 95% CI -2.02 to 2.92; I² = 81%; 3 studies, 1654 participants; low-certainty evidence). Available data were insufficient to pool the evidence for length of stay in the intensive care unit.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that high levels compared to low levels of PEEP do not reduce mortality before hospital discharge. Low-certainty evidence suggests that high levels of PEEP result in little to no difference in the risk of barotrauma. Low-certainty evidence also suggests that high levels of PEEP improve oxygenation up to the first and third days of mechanical ventilation, and moderate-certainty evidence indicates that high levels of PEEP improve oxygenation up to the seventh day of mechanical ventilation. As in our previous review, we found clinical heterogeneity - mainly within participant characteristics and methods of titrating PEEP - that does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions regarding the use of high levels of PEEP in patients with ALI and ARDS. Further studies should aim to determine the appropriate method of using high levels of PEEP and the advantages and disadvantages associated with high levels of PEEP in different ARDS and ALI patient populations.

### Ventilatory management of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome… [^bbd58c18]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Evidence Synthesis There is strong evidence to support the use of volume- and pressure-limited lung-protective ventilation in adult patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The benefit of increased levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers is uncertain and is being further evaluated in ongoing trials. Existing randomized controlled trials of alternative ventilation modes, such as high-frequency oscillation and adjunctive therapies, including inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning demonstrate no significant survival advantage. However, they may have a role as rescue therapy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with refractory life-threatening hypoxemia. Conclusions Volume- and pressure-limited ventilation strategies should be used in managing adult acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.

Further research is needed to identify barriers to widespread adoption of this strategy, as well as the role of alternative ventilation modes and adjunctive therapies. This improved understanding of ALI and ARDS and ventilator-associated lung injury has been important in designing lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies aimed at attenuating ventilator-associated lung injury and improving outcomes. Such strategies for the invasive ventilatory management of adult ALI and ARDS have recently been tested in a number of important clinical trials, which we review in this article. In addition, we discuss alternative invasive ventilatory modes and adjunctive therapies, with a focus on those that we believe are widely available for clinical use in adults at the present time. We also highlight recent controversies and suggest areas for future research.

Conventional lung-protective ventilation involves strategies designed to mitigate further lung injury in patients with ALI or ARDS using a standard mechanical ventilator. Five randomized controlled trials23-27 and 3 meta-analyses28-30 have evaluated lung-protective ventilation compared with conventional approaches, using a variety of volume- and pressure-limited strategies. Quiz Ref IDThe largest trial of volume- and pressure-limited ventilation was conducted by the ARDS Network. 27 This trial of 861 patients demonstrated a 9% absolute decrease in mortality when patients with ALI or ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation have reduced tidal volumes and reduced pressures.

In many instances, lung-protective ventilation may lead to an elevation of arterial carbon dioxide, referred to as permissive hypercapnia. Other important consequences of lung-protective ventilation possibly include worsened oxygenation and the need for increased sedation or analgesia compared with patients receiving conventional ventilation. Of note, patients in the intervention arm of the ARDSNet study had reduced oxygenation in the first few days but improved survival. 27 Furthermore, a recent analysis of a subset of the ARDSNet study revealed no significant differences in sedation or analgesia use between lung-protective and conventional mechanical ventilation groups. 33 However, the effect of any potential increase in sedation or analgesia use in patients receiving lung-protective ventilation requires further study. In addition to pressure and volume limitation, higher PEEP and the use of recruitment maneuvers may be important components of a lung-protective ventilation strategy.

### Proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors in critically ill patients: comparison with pressure support [^2c9602d5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

It is not known if proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV+) may be used as a mode of support in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of sustained use of PAV+ in critically ill patients and compare it with pressure support ventilation (PS).

Design and Setting

Randomized study in the intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Methods

A total of 208 critically ill patients mechanically ventilated on controlled modes for at least 36 h and meeting certain criteria were randomized to receive either PS (n = 100) or PAV+ (n = 108). Specific written algorithms were used to adjust the ventilator settings in each mode. PAV+ or PS was continued for 48 h unless the patients met pre-defined criteria either for switching to controlled modes (failure criteria) or for breathing without ventilator assistance.

Results

Failure rate was significantly lower in PAV+ than that in PS (11.1 vs. 22.0%, P = 0.040, OR 0.443, 95% CI 0.206–0.952). The proportion of patients exhibiting major patient-ventilator dyssynchronies at least during one occasion and after adjusting the initial ventilator settings, was significantly lower in PAV+ than in PS (5.6 vs. 29.0%, P < 0.001, OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.06–0.4). The proportion of patients meeting criteria for unassisted breathing did not differ between modes.

Conclusions

PAV+ may be used as a useful mode of support in critically ill patients. Compared to PS, PAV+ increases the probability of remaining on spontaneous breathing, while it considerably reduces the incidence of patient-ventilator asynchronies.

### Severe hypoxemia: which strategy to choose [^b3633c9d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Modality of mechanical ventilation

Presently the two most commonly used modes of mechanical ventilation are pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). With PCV the delivered volume changes according to the characteristics of the respiratory system, and the inspiratory flow presents a decelerating shape; in VCV the delivered volume remains constant, while the airway pressure is variable and the inspiratory flow has a constant shape. It has been hypothesized that PCV could present higher benefits in reducing VILI, due to decelerating inspiratory flow and the changes in delivered tidal volume according to the patient's disease. In order to assess any possible advantage of PCV compared with VCV, Chacko et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis without showing any difference in mortality or risk of barotrauma between the two modes.

Compared with controlled mechanical ventilation, assisted mechanical ventilation could provide some beneficial effects by reducing the level of sedation, maintaining the respiratory muscle activity, and promoting a more homogeneous distribution of the ventilation. In a small cross-over study of moderate ARDS, similar tidal volumes and lung distending pressure were found among pressure support ventilation (PSV), PCV, and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). When not properly applied, however, the use of assisted mechanical ventilation in severe ARDS, similarly to NIV, could negatively affect the outcome and increase VILI by increasing the transpulmonary pressure, work of breathing, and rapid shallow breathing. Further studies are required to clarify the role of PSV and NAVA in severe ARDS.

Oxygenation and CO 2 target

The commonly recommended oxygenation target ranges between 88 and 95%. However, in clinical practice a more liberal approach aimed to maintain an arterial saturation higher than 96% is often used, due to physician perception of higher patient safety. To better understand the possible benefits of a more liberal strategy, Panwar et al. randomized ARDS patients to receive an arterial saturation higher than 96% or between 88 and 92%. The liberal strategy did not influence both the number of organ failures and the outcome.

The application of a low tidal volume ventilation strategy can result in hypercapnia, but does not present major side effects and is well tolerated. However, hypercapnia can increase a patient's respiratory drive, and was independently related to the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). Although the optimal CO 2 level is still unclear, in the absence of right cardiac failure and raised intracranial pressure up to 70 mmHg of arterial CO₂ with a pH of 7.20 has been found to be safe.

### Lung protective ventilation strategy for the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^2f7c71ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury require mechanical ventilatory support. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are further complicated by ventilator-induced lung injury. Lung-protective ventilation strategies may lead to improved survival.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ventilation with lower tidal volume on morbidity and mortality in patients aged 16 years or older affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. A secondary objective was to determine whether the comparison between low and conventional tidal volume was different if a plateau airway pressure of greater than 30 to 35 cm H20 was used.

Search Strategy

In our original review, we searched databases from inception until 2003. In this updated review, we searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3). We updated our search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Web of Science from 2003 to 2006. We also updated our search of intensive care journals and conference proceedings; databases of ongoing research, reference lists and 'grey literature' from 2003 to 2006.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing ventilation using either lower tidal volume (Vt) or low airway driving pressure (plateau pressure 30 cm H2O or less), resulting in tidal volume of 7 ml/kg or less versus ventilation that uses Vt in the range of 10 to 15 ml/kg, in adults (16 years old or older).

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Wherever appropriate, results were pooled. We applied fixed- and random-effects models.

Main Results

We found one new study in this update for a total of six trials, involving 1297 patients, which were eligible for inclusion. Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation: relative risk (RR) 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.88); hospital mortality was reduced: RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92); overall mortality was not significantly different if a plateau pressure less than or equal to 31 cm H2O in control group was used: RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.45). There was insufficient evidence about morbidity and long term outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Clinical heterogeneity, such as different lengths of follow up and higher plateau pressure in control arms in two trials, make the interpretation of the combined results difficult. Mortality is significantly reduced at day 28 and at the end of hospital stay. The effects on long-term mortality are unknown, although the possibility of a clinically relevant benefit cannot be excluded.

### Positive end-expiratory pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome: should the 'open lung strategy' be replaced by a' protective lung strategy'? [^49ee12a4]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, positive end-expiratory pressure is associated with alveolar recruitment and lung hyperinflation despite the administration of a low tidal volume. The best positive end-expiratory pressure should correspond to the best compromise between recruitment and distension, a condition that coincides with the best respiratory elastance.

### Pressure-regulated volume control ventilation vs synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation for very low-birth-weight infants… [^72e1fb03]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

The rate at which surviving children reached final extubation did not differ between study groups. SIMV indicates synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation; PRVC, pressure-regulated volume control. Objective To test the hypothesis that pressure-regulated volume control, an assist/control mode of ventilation, would increase the proportion of very low-birth-weight infants who were alive and extubated at 14 days of age as compared with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. Lung injury following mechanical ventilation remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in premature infants who require respiratory support. Intermittent mandatory ventilation using pressure-limited, time-cycled ventilators was, for many years, the only practical mode of mechanical ventilation for these infants.

Advances in ventilator technology have made it possible to ventilate newborns using ventilator breaths synchronized to an infant's spontaneous breaths and thereby to provide assist/control ventilation in which the infant receives a full mechanical breath with each spontaneous breath. The objective of this study was to compare pulmonary outcomes in very low-birth-weight infants receiving ACV with those in infants receiving SIMV. We hypothesized that, among infants who weighed 500 to 1249 g at birth, pressure-regulated volume control ventilation would increase the proportion of infants who were alive and extubated at 14 days of age as compared with SIMV. This study was conducted in 2 level III neonatal intensive care units. Infants with birth weights of 500 to 1249 g and gestational ages of 24 weeks or older at birth who required mechanical ventilation were eligible for enrollment.

Obstetrical dating was used to assign gestational age unless it was unavailable or varied from new Ballard examination8 by more than 2 weeks. In these cases, Ballard dating was used. Infants were enrolled before 6 hours of age, following informed consent. The University of Rochester and Vassar Brothers Medical Center institutional review boards approved this study. Subjects assigned to the PRVC group were placed on PRVC, a synchronized, pressure-limited assist/control mode that sequentially varies the delivered pressure to approximate a target inspiratory tidal volume. The modes of ventilation were not masked. Target PaCO2 values were 45 to 55 torr regardless of gestational age at birth. Specific ventilator settings to achieve these targets were determined by the clinical team. Infants continued to receive their randomized assigned mode of ventilation until they were extubated, died, or met the failure criteria. PaCO2 of higher than 60 torr on 2 blood gas determinations at least 4 hours apart, with the infant receiving a mean airway pressure of 9 cm H₂O or higher for infants who weighed less than 1000 g or 10 cm H₂O for infants who weighed 1000 g or more at the time of failure. PaCO2 of less than 30 torr on 2 blood gas determinations over 4 hours, with the infant receiving a mean airway pressure of 4 cm H₂O or less in infants who still required mechanical ventilation owing to apnea or other reasons. A trial of extubation was required if an infant met all of the following criteria: The FIO2 was 0. 35 or less and was not increasing. The mean airway pressure was 6 cm H₂O or less for infants with a current weight of less than 1000 g or 8 cm H₂O or less for infants with a current weight of 1000 g or more. A current weight of 900 g or more in an infant who was at 80% of birth weight or greater.

### Does using pressure-controlled ventilation to rest respiratory muscles improve sleep in ICU patients? [^9f4d025b]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Sleep is commonly altered in critically ill patients. Ventilatory mode may impact on quality of sleep. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect on sleep of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) to spontaneous ventilation with 6 cm H₂O inspiratory pressure (low-PSV).

Methods

Thirty-five patients intubated and mechanically ventilated for acute-on-chronic respiratory failure were included in this prospective randomized cross-over study. Nine were discarded, 13 received PCV first (10 p.m.-2 a.m.) and then low-PSV (2–6 a.m.) and 13 patients received low-PSV first and then PCV.

Results

Sleep architecture was altered (50.4% of the night was spent in wakefulness). PCV was associated with significantly improved sleep quality and quantity compared to low-PSV: sleep efficiency (total sleep time/total recording time) was 63% (range: 9–100) vs. 37% (0–96; p = 0.0002), stage 2 NREM sleep was 33% vs. 13% (p = 0.0005), stages 3 and 4 NREM sleep were 9% vs. 3.5% (p = 0.003) and REM sleep was 6.5% vs. 0% (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Sleep quantity and quality were significantly improved with PCV compared to low-PSV. Nocturnal respiratory muscles rest through PCV is recommended to improve sleep in ICU patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^1607a6c7]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Updated SSC COVID-19 recommendations — noninvasive respiratory support in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: For adults with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite conventional oxygen therapy, we suggest using high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) over conventional oxygen therapy, and we also suggest using HFNC over noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). If HFNC is not available and there is no urgent indication for endotracheal intubation, we suggest a trial of NIPPV with close monitoring and short-interval assessment for worsening of respiratory failure. We were not able to make a recommendation regarding the use of helmet NIPPV compared with mask NIPPV; it is an option, but we are not certain about its safety or efficacy in COVID-19. In adults with COVID-19 receiving NIPPV or HFNC, we recommend close monitoring for worsening of respiratory status and early intubation in a controlled setting if worsening occurs. There is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on the use of awake prone positioning in nonintubated adults with severe COVID-19.

Ventilator mode — assist-control at night versus pressure support in critically ill adults — We suggest using assist-control ventilation at night (vs pressure support ventilation) for improving sleep in critically ill adults (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Pooled estimates of three studies (n = 61) found an increase in sleep efficiency with assist-control (MD, 18.33%; 95% CI, 7.89–28.76), while pooled estimates of two studies (n = 41) found it was not associated with a difference in the percentage of total sleep time (TST) in stage 1 (MD, 0.31%; 95% CI, –5.17 to 5.79) or stage 2 (MD, 2.59%; 95% CI, –4.38 to 14.97) sleep; it was associated with more time in REM sleep (MD, 2.79%; 95% CI, 0.53–5.05).

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation in adult ARDS — recruitment maneuvers (RMs) involve transient elevations in applied airway pressures and include prolonged high continuous positive airway pressure (30–40 cm H₂O). Across six RCTs including 1,423 patients, RMs were associated with lower mortality in the trial without cointervention (one study, 101 patients; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–0.98; low confidence) and when considering all trials (six studies, 1,423 patients; RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69–0.95; moderate confidence), with no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.21). RMs were also associated with higher oxygenation at 24 hours (six studies, 1,400 patients; 52 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 25–83; low confidence), reduced need for rescue therapy (two studies, 1,003 patients; RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.35–0.93; moderate confidence), and were not significantly associated with barotrauma (four studies, 1,293 patients; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.46–1.55; low confidence) or hemodynamic compromise (three studies, 330 patients; RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.92–1.83).

### Characteristics and outcomes in adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a 28-day international study [^31e73f6e]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

The outcome of patients receiving mechanical ventilation for particular indications has been studied, but the outcome in a large number of unselected, heterogeneous patients has not been reported.

Objective

To determine the survival of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and the relative importance of factors influencing survival.

Design, Setting, and Subjects

Prospective cohort of consecutive adult patients admitted to 361 intensive care units who received mechanical ventilation for more than 12 hours between March 1, 1998, and March 31, 1998. Data were collected on each patient at initiation of mechanical ventilation and daily throughout the course of mechanical ventilation for up to 28 days.

Main Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality during intensive care unit stay.

Results

Of the 15 757 patients admitted, a total of 5183 (33%) received mechanical ventilation for a mean (SD) duration of 5.9 (7.2) days. The mean (SD) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 11.2 (13.7) days. Overall mortality rate in the intensive care unit was 30.7% (1590 patients) for the entire population, 52% (120) in patients who received ventilation because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 22% (115) in patients who received ventilation for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Survival of unselected patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 12 hours was 69%. The main conditions independently associated with increased mortality were (1) factors present at the start of mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 2.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.44–3.63; P < .001 for coma), (2) factors related to patient management (OR, 3.67; 95% CI, 2.02–6.66; P < .001 for plateau airway pressure > 35 cm H₂O), and (3) developments occurring over the course of mechanical ventilation (OR, 8.71; 95% CI, 5.44–13.94; P < .001 for ratio of PaO(2) to fraction of inspired oxygen < 100).

Conclusion

Survival among mechanically ventilated patients depends not only on the factors present at the start of mechanical ventilation, but also on the development of complications and patient management in the intensive care unit.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^37644a1e]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Low tidal volume ventilation for sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): for adults with sepsis-induced ARDS, we recommend using a low tidal volume ventilation strategy (6 mL/kg), over a high tidal volume strategy (> 10 mL/kg). Tidal volumes > 6 cc/kg coupled with plateau pressures > 30 cm H2O should be avoided in ARDS. Clinicians should use as a starting point the objective of reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours from its initial value toward the goal of a low tidal volume (≈ 6 mL/kg PBW) achieved with an end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O; if plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H2O after reduction to 6 mL/kg PBW, tidal volume may be further reduced to as low as 4 mL/kg PBW, and respiratory rate should be increased to a maximum of 35 breaths/ min to maintain minute ventilation. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes > 6 mL/kg PBW, as long as plateau pressure can be maintained ≤ 30 cm H2O, and patients with very stiff chest/abdominal walls and high pleural pressures may tolerate plateau pressures > 30 cm H2O. A driving pressure below 12–15 cm H2O may be advantageous in patients without spontaneous breathing efforts, but prospective validation of tidal volume titration by driving pressure is needed before this approach can be recommended.

### An observational cohort study to determine efficacy, adherence and outcome of the early initiation of pressure support ventilation during mechanical ventilation [^fe14ecb0]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Data from this prospective observational cohort study demonstrated that in a cohort of mixed medical and surgical ICU patients managed without a weaning protocol, PSV initiated early in the course of MV, prior to fulfilment of conventional screening criteria for weaning, was well tolerated in the majority of patients. The four individual and specific criteria, similar to those commonly applied in weaning trials and guidelines, were not associated with PSV failure. Acidosis at the time of initiation of PSV was the only factor independently associated with PSV failure. Failure to maintain PSV for 24 h was associated with prolonged MV and increased ICU mortality and thus has the potential to be used as an important screening tool to identify high-risk patients.

These data add to the current literature on PSV as a ventilatory support mode as well as a weaning mode. Previous studies of PSV as a support mode have been relatively small and have commonly examined physiological rather than clinical endpoints. Although use of PSV may represent common practice, it has not been systematically reported. Indeed, a large prospective cohort study found less than 20% of patients in PSV mode up to 28 days after the onset of MV.

### Carbon dioxide in the critically ill: too much or too little of a good thing? [^e0e71de5]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercapnia and hypocapnia commonly complicate conditions that are present in critically ill patients. Both conditions have important physiologic effects that may impact the clinical management of these patients. For instance, hypercapnia results in bronchodilation and enhanced hypoxic vasoconstriction, leading to improved ventilation/perfusion matching. Hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood volume through arterial vasoconstriction. These effects have also been exploited for therapeutic aims. In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypocapnia is often utilized to control intracranial pressure. However, this effect is not sustained, and prolonged hypocapnia increases the risk of mortality and severe disability in patients with TBI. Hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis are common consequences of lung-protective ventilation in ARDS. Hypercapnic acidosis reduces ischemic lung injury and preserves lung compliance, but concern has arisen over hypercapnia-induced immunosuppression and the potential for bacterial proliferation in sepsis. Experimental studies suggest that buffering hypercapnic acidosis attenuates these effects, whereas hypocapnia appears to potentiate lung injury through increased capillary permeability and decreased lung compliance. Several areas of uncertainty surround the role of hypercapnia/hypocapnia in treating TBI and ARDS. Current data support recommendations to avoid hypocapnia in treating TBI, with the exception of emergent treatment of elevated intracranial pressure, while awaiting definitive management. Permissive hypercapnia is commonly accepted as a consequence of lung-protective ventilation in ARDS, but there is insufficient evidence to support the induction of hypercapnic acidosis in clinical practice. Buffering hypercapnic acidosis should be considered only for a specific clinical indication (eg, hemodynamic instability). For clinicians choosing to buffer hypercapnic acidosis, tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane is recommended over sodium bicarbonate, as it is more effective in correcting pH and is not associated with increased carbon dioxide production. Future studies should aim to address these areas of uncertainty to help guide clinicians in the therapeutic use and management of hypercapnia/hypocapnia in critically ill patients.

### Mechanical ventilation in ARDS: a state-of-the-art review [^96ed7be0]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is an essential component of the care of patients with ARDS, and a large number of randomized controlled clinical trials have now been conducted evaluating the efficacy and safety of various methods of mechanical ventilation for the treatment of ARDS. Low tidal volume ventilation (≤ 6 mL/kg predicted body weight) should be utilized in all patients with ARDS as it is the only method of mechanical ventilation that, to date, has been shown to improve survival. High positive end-expiratory pressure, alveolar recruitment maneuvers, and prone positioning may each be useful as rescue therapy in a patient with severe hypoxemia, but these methods of ventilation do not improve survival for the wide population of patients with ARDS. Although not specific to the treatment of ARDS, protocol-driven weaning that utilizes a daily spontaneous breathing trial and ventilation in the semirecumbent position have proven benefits and should be used in the management of ARDS patients.

### Noninvasive ventilation for critical care [^99649948]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), the provision of ventilatory assistance without an artificial airway, has emerged as an important ventilatory modality in critical care. This has been fueled by evidence demonstrating improved outcomes in patients with respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbations, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or immunocompromised states, and when NIV is used to facilitate extubation in COPD patients with failed spontaneous breathing trials. Numerous other applications are supported by weaker evidence. A trial of NIV is justified in patients with acute respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbations and postoperative states, extubation failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, or a do-not-intubate status. Patients must be carefully selected according to available guidelines and clinical judgment, taking into account risk factors for NIV failure. Patients begun on NIV should be monitored closely in an ICU or other suitable setting until adequately stabilized, paying attention not only to vital signs and gas exchange, but also to comfort and tolerance. Patients not having a favorable initial response to NIV should be considered for intubation without delay. NIV is currently used in only a select minority of patients with acute respiratory failure, but with technical advances and new evidence on its proper application, this role is likely to further expand.

### Emerging modes of ventilation in the intensive care unit [^e945008d]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Potentially harmful effects of positive pressure mechanical ventilation have been recognized since its inception in the 1950s. Since then, the risk factors for and mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) have been further characterized. Publication of the ARDSnet tidal volume trial in 2000 demonstrated that a ventilator strategy limiting tidal volumes and plateau pressure in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with a 22% reduction in mortality. Since then, a variety of ventilator modes have emerged seeking to improve gas exchange, reduce injurious effects of ventilation, and improve weaning from the ventilator. We review here emerging ventilator modes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Airway pressure release ventilation seeks to optimize alveolar recruitment and maintain spontaneous ventilatory effort. It is associated with improved indices of respiratory and cardiovascular physiology, but data to support outcome benefit are lacking. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation is associated with improvements in gas exchange, but outcome data are conflicting. Extracorporeal modes of ventilation continue to evolve, and extra-corporeal CO(2) removal is a technique that could be used in non-specialist ICUs. Proportional-assist ventilation and neutrally adjusted ventilator assist are modes that vary level of assistance with patient ventilatory effort. They result in greater patient-ventilator synchrony, but at present there is no evidence of a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation or outcome benefit. Although the use of many of these modes is likely to increase in intensive care units, further evidence of a beneficial effect is desirable before they are recommended.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Selecting higher PEEP and esophageal pressure guidance: The optimal method of selecting a higher PEEP level is not clear. Options include titrating PEEP by thoracopulmonary compliance to obtain the best compliance or lowest driving pressure, titrating PEEP upward while receiving a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW until the plateau airway pressure is 28 cm H2O, or using a PEEP/FiO2 titration table; a PEEP > 5 cm H2O is usually required to avoid lung collapse. Esophageal pressure guided PEEP titration has been evaluated; while a pilot suggested benefit, a subsequent 200 patient multicenter RCT comparing esophageal measurement versus empirical high PEEP-FiO2 titration showed no significant difference in a composite outcome.

### Mechanical ventilation in sepsis-induced acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome: an evidence-based review [^a254f738]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for mechanical ventilation in sepsis-induced acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

A minimum amount of positive end-expiratory pressure should be set to prevent lung collapse at end expiration in ARDS. Setting the level of positive end-expiratory pressure may be guided by Fio2 requirement or measurement of thoracopulmonary compliance. Role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in acute lung injury/ARDS is undefined. Small tidal volume ventilation and limitation of end-inspiratory plateau pressure is important in the management of ARDS and may be facilitated by permissive hypercapnia. Prone positioning should be considered in the severest of ARDS patients. The ideal fluid management strategy in ARDS is unknown. Weaning protocols should be in place that include spontaneous breathing trials and criteria for initiating such trials. The role of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and airway pressure release ventilation in ARDS is uncertain.

### Positive end-expiratory pressure setting in adults with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^e1a5f7f0]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

The need for lung protection is universally accepted, but the optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome remains debated.

Objective

To compare the effect on outcome of a strategy for setting PEEP aimed at increasing alveolar recruitment while limiting hyperinflation to one aimed at minimizing alveolar distension in patients with ALI.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A multicenter randomized controlled trial of 767 adults (mean [SD] age, 59.9 [15.4] years) with ALI conducted in 37 intensive care units in France from September 2002 to December 2005.

Intervention

Tidal volume was set at 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight in both strategies. Patients were randomly assigned to a moderate PEEP strategy (5–9 cm H(2)O) (minimal distension strategy; n = 382) or to a level of PEEP set to reach a plateau pressure of 28 to 30 cm H₂O (increased recruitment strategy; n = 385).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was mortality at 28 days. Secondary end points were hospital mortality at 60 days, ventilator-free days, and organ failure-free days at 28 days.

Results

The 28-day mortality rate in the minimal distension group was 31.2% (n = 119) vs 27.8% (n = 107) in the increased recruitment group (relative risk, 1.12 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.40]; P = 0.31). The hospital mortality rate in the minimal distension group was 39.0% (n = 149) vs 35.4% (n = 136) in the increased recruitment group (relative risk, 1.10 [95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.32]; P = 0.30). The increased recruitment group compared with the minimal distension group had a higher median number of ventilator-free days (7 [interquartile range {IQR}, 0–19] vs 3 [IQR, 0–17]; P = 0.04) and organ failure-free days (6 [IQR, 0–18] vs 2 [IQR, 0–16]; P = 0.04). This strategy also was associated with higher compliance values, better oxygenation, less use of adjunctive therapies, and larger fluid requirements.

Conclusions

A strategy for setting PEEP aimed at increasing alveolar recruitment while limiting hyperinflation did not significantly reduce mortality. However, it did improve lung function and reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation and the duration of organ failure.

### Positive pressure mechanical ventilation [^b35416b1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

There have been numerous advances in the application of positive pressure mechanical ventilation in the last two decades. As knowledge of pulmonary physiology expands, the application of modes and parameters to maximize the efficacy and minimize the complications of ventilatory support continues to advance. As the use of noninvasive ventilation becomes more widespread, its usefulness in certain clinical entities such as COPD exacerbations and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema will become more prominent. The role of specific modes and parameters of these devices likely will be further refined to maximize outcomes.
