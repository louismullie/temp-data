## Question

What is the first line blood pressure agent in African-Americans?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line blood pressure agent should be for African-American patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guidelines and their exact wording. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and the key trials that underpin those recommendations. Next, I will consider nuances such as stage 1 versus stage 2 hypertension, comorbidities like CKD, and the role of combination therapy. After that, I should review conflicting evidence and contemporary debates about race-based prescribing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the guideline anchor points. JNC 8 gives a moderate-strength, Grade B recommendation that in the general Black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or a calcium channel blocker, and it explicitly recommends against ACE inhibitor monotherapy in Black patients due to inferior blood pressure and stroke outcomes in ALLHAT subgroup analyses [^6aaf7f16] [^9a9bc620]. The VA/DoD guideline similarly recommends against ACEI or ARB monotherapy in African-American patients and supports thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first-line choices, with combination strategies when appropriate [^b52b5735] [^a62a7af0]. The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline aligns by recommending a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB for initial therapy in Black adults without heart failure or CKD, again reflecting ALLHAT and related data [^b6b2f575].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base behind this. ALLHAT showed that in Black participants, lisinopril was less effective than chlorthalidone or amlodipine for blood pressure lowering and was associated with higher risks of stroke, heart failure, and combined cardiovascular disease, whereas chlorthalidone and amlodipine had comparable major cardiovascular outcomes, supporting diuretics or CCBs over ACEI monotherapy in this population [^6aaf7f16] [^a3a6a6de]. A meta-analysis of 13 trials quantified a smaller systolic/diastolic blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors in Black adults versus White adults, reinforcing the attenuated monotherapy response in this group [^4eca6d1b]. Mechanistically, lower renin phenotypes and salt sensitivity are more prevalent in people of African ancestry, which plausibly explains greater efficacy of diuretics and CCBs and less response to RAS blockade in monotherapy, though interindividual overlap exists [^f4ab54ac] [^c0509e48].

> Hold on, I should verify how recent guidelines frame initiation strategy by stage. The 2025 ACC/AHA/AANP guideline recommends initiating two first-line agents of different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination, for stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg), while stage 1 hypertension (130–139/80–89 mmHg) can reasonably start with a single first-line agent and titrate or add as needed, which operationalizes faster control and addresses the higher likelihood of needing combination therapy in many patients, including African Americans [^ec9d8898] [^1d4164a4]. This does not change the preferred classes; it changes the starting cadence when blood pressure is more severely elevated, and it still avoids ACEI or ARB monotherapy in Black patients without compelling indications [^b6b2f575].

> I need to check comorbidity exceptions, especially CKD. For Black patients with CKD, particularly with albuminuria, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended to slow kidney disease progression, but they should generally be combined with a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB rather than used as monotherapy, given the inferior blood pressure control with ACEI monotherapy in this population and the need for multidrug regimens in CKD [^f146dee3] [^e1679b84]. So, the "avoid ACEI monotherapy" rule still applies; RAS blockade is used for renal protection and in combination, not as solo first-line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension in African Americans [^b52b5735].

> But wait, what if I am overgeneralizing by race? Contemporary critiques argue that race is a social construct and that within-race variability in blood pressure response is substantial, so a race-agnostic, intensified, guideline-concordant approach with close follow-up and combination therapy can close control gaps without relying on race-based drug selection, and some programs have demonstrated improved control in Black patients using standardized algorithms that still prioritize thiazides/CCBs when monotherapy is chosen but emphasize timely combination and adherence support [^c3dc19fe] [^cd5bc321]. I should acknowledge this debate while noting that major guidelines still reflect the ALLHAT-era signal and maintain the thiazide/CCB preference for initial therapy in Black patients absent compelling indications for RAS blockade [^6aaf7f16] [^b6b2f575].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For African-American adults with hypertension and no compelling comorbid indications, the first-line agents are a thiazide-type diuretic (prefer chlorthalidone when feasible) or a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (e.g., amlodipine). ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not be used as monotherapy in this population, though they are appropriate when CKD with albuminuria is present, in which case they should be paired with a thiazide or CCB to achieve blood pressure targets [^6aaf7f16] [^b52b5735] [^f146dee3]. If blood pressure is stage 2, start two complementary first-line agents, ideally as a single-pill combination, to accelerate control and improve adherence, reserving monotherapy for stage 1 or when combination therapy is not tolerated or is contraindicated [^ec9d8898] [^1d4164a4].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring. African Americans have a higher risk of ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema, which strengthens the case to avoid ACEI monotherapy and to monitor closely if ACEIs are used for CKD indications; thiazide-induced hypokalemia and metabolic effects warrant periodic labs, and CCBs may cause peripheral edema that can limit titration, so counseling and follow-up are essential [^63f281f3] [^79117bde]. Given the prevalence of resistant hypertension in African Americans, early consideration of combination therapy, adherence assessment, and evaluation for secondary causes are prudent to avoid therapeutic inertia and to close control gaps [^69c8fc55] [^c3dc19fe].

The first-line blood pressure medications for African Americans are **thiazide-type diuretics** (especially chlorthalidone) [^6aaf7f16] or **calcium channel blockers (CCBs)** (particularly amlodipine) [^b6b2f575], based on stronger blood pressure lowering and better cardiovascular outcomes in this population [^a3a6a6de]. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are **less effective as monotherapy** in African Americans and should be avoided as initial therapy unless there is a compelling indication (e.g. CKD with proteinuria or heart failure) [^4eca6d1b] [^b52b5735]. For stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg), **initial combination therapy** with two agents (often a thiazide or CCB plus a renin–angiotensin system blocker) is recommended to improve control and adherence [^ec9d8898] [^a475d284].

## Evidence-based first-line agents

### Thiazide-type diuretics

- **JNC 8 recommendation**: Thiazide-type diuretics are recommended as first-line therapy for African Americans, including those with diabetes [^6aaf7f16] [^083a9f8b].
- **ALLHAT trial**: Chlorthalidone was superior to lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) in preventing stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events in African Americans [^a3a6a6de].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Thiazide diuretics are cost-effective and widely available [^b97c4929].

---

### Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)

- **JNC 8 recommendation**: CCBs, particularly amlodipine, are recommended as first-line therapy for African Americans [^6aaf7f16] [^b6b2f575].
- **ALLHAT trial**: Amlodipine was comparable to chlorthalidone in preventing cardiovascular events and was superior to lisinopril in African Americans [^a3a6a6de].
- **Meta-analysis**: CCBs are particularly effective in African Americans, likely due to lower renin levels and salt sensitivity [^426400f6].

---

## Agents not recommended as first-line monotherapy

### ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)

- **JNC 8 recommendation**: ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended as first-line monotherapy in African Americans due to attenuated blood pressure response and inferior cardiovascular outcomes [^6aaf7f16] [^b52b5735].
- **ALLHAT trial**: Lisinopril was associated with higher risks of stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events compared to chlorthalidone or amlodipine in African Americans [^a3a6a6de].
- **Meta-analysis**: African Americans have a significantly smaller blood pressure reduction with ACE inhibitors compared to white patients [^4eca6d1b].

---

### Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are **not recommended as first-line therapy** in African Americans without compelling indications (e.g. heart failure, coronary artery disease) due to less effective blood pressure control and inferior cardiovascular outcomes [^6aaf7f16] [^b6b2f575].

---

## Role of combination therapy

Combination therapy is **recommended for stage 2 hypertension** (≥ 140/90 mmHg) or when blood pressure is > 20/10 mmHg above target [^ec9d8898] [^a475d284]. Preferred combinations include a thiazide diuretic or CCB with an ACE inhibitor or ARB to enhance efficacy and adherence [^29937ba2] [^b1623a3f].

---

## Clinical considerations and patient-specific factors

- **Comorbidities**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated for patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or heart failure, regardless of race [^f146dee3] [^f2b491a1].
- **Adverse effects**: Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia; CCBs can cause peripheral edema and hypotension.
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential to optimize adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Drug class** | **First-line recommendation for african americans** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | Yes | - Superior cardiovascular outcomes <br/> - Cost-effective <br/> - Effective in low-renin hypertension [^6aaf7f16] [^a3a6a6de] [^b97c4929] |
| Calcium channel blockers | Yes | - Effective blood pressure lowering <br/> - Favorable cardiovascular outcomes [^6aaf7f16] [^a3a6a6de] |
| ACE inhibitors | No (monotherapy) | Attenuated blood pressure response and inferior cardiovascular outcomes [^6aaf7f16] [^4eca6d1b] |
| ARBs | No (monotherapy) | Attenuated blood pressure response and inferior cardiovascular outcomes [^6aaf7f16] [^4eca6d1b] |
| Beta-blockers | No (unless indicated) | Less effective blood pressure control and inferior cardiovascular outcomes [^6aaf7f16] [^7313dc10] |

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^b97c4929]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

### Impact of antihypertensive drug classes on cardiovascular outcomes: insights from the STEP study [^f916370b]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a significant global health concern, particularly in China and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and mortality. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that lowering blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs effectively reduces major cardiovascular events and mortality; this benefit is primarily attributed to the extent of blood pressure reduction rather than the specific properties of individual drug classes. However, different classes of antihypertensive drugs have been reported to exert distinct effects on specific cardiovascular outcomes.

Despite extensive research, evidence on comparative effectiveness of different antihypertensive drug classes remains inconsistent, and clinical guidelines vary significantly. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Treatment Guidelines recommended thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as first-line agents. The 2023 European Society of Hypertension Guidelines provide a comparable broad recommendation, but also include beta-blockers as first-line option. The NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline recommends ACEIs or ARBs as first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, or for adults younger than 55 years who are not of Black African or African Caribbean family origin; for all other patient groups, CCBs are recommended. These inconsistencies highlight the need for further research to identify which antihypertensive drug class provides the most favourable cardiovascular outcomes and should be prioritised as the optimal first-line antihypertensive therapy. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether prolonged exposure to specific antihypertensive drug classes is associated with a reduced risk of composite cardiac outcome in individuals with well-controlled blood pressure, using data from the STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) trial.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to do not use α-blockers as first-line therapy in patients with uncomplicated HTN. Do not use β-blockers as first-line therapy in ≥ 60 years old patients with uncomplicated HTN. Do not use ACEis as first-line therapy in black patients with uncomplicated HTN.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns and effectiveness [^1768af10]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analysis of prescription patterns showed that since 2018, 63.5% of Black participants were prescribed a 2017 ACC/AHA guideline-recommended first-line HTN treatment, compared with 75.8% of White participants and 81.8% of Hispanic participants. Given prior studies of efficacy and the relative SBP effects of different classes of HTN medications in this study, it is possible that greater adherence to 2017 AHA/ACC Guideline-recommended first-line treatments could result in fewer total medications prescribed, especially in the Black population.

CCBs and diuretics were among the most effective medications in Black participants in our dataset after adjusting for starting SBP, which corroborates previous studies and the 2017 AHA/ACC Guideline recommendations for diuretics and CCBs as first-line prescriptions in the Black population. In the Hispanic population, the medications with the greatest predicted effectiveness included diuretics, the central alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine, the ACEI lisinopril, and the beta-blocker atenolol. Notably, these top medications were different from both Black and White populations. However, overlapping confidence intervals caution the interpretation of these results.

Currently, 2017 AHA/ACC Guidelines do not recommend different first-line treatments in Hispanic patients. Our results suggest that it may be worthwhile to create a separate set of recommendations for HTN management in the Hispanic population, though further study would be needed. Since many patients started on one agent will later require additional agents to reach the blood pressure target, optimizing medication effectiveness in a manner which considers self-reported race and ethnicity may minimize the number of medications prescribed.

A previous study reported that personalizing HTN medication decisions between four commonly used HTN drugs (lisinopril, losartan, HCTZ, and amlodipine) can lead to a 4 mmHg greater reduction in SBP, compared with a nonpersonalized approach. Research has demonstrated that a 10 mmHg reduction in SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 20%, coronary heart disease by 17%, stroke by 27%, HF by 28%, and all-cause mortality by 13%, while a 5 mmHg reduction in SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 10%, suggesting that personalized approaches that maximize SBP lowering will be beneficial to public health. Reductions of mean SBP across both African American and White populations as small as 1 mmHg are associated with reductions in HF events, indicating that even modest SBP population-wide shifts can reduce CVD burden.

Recommendation 7 — initial drug selection for the general black population — states that "in the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB," graded as "Moderate Recommendation – Grade B" for the general black population and "Weak Recommendation – Grade C" for black patients with diabetes. The text further states that "both thiazide-type diuretics and CCBs are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension in black patients," and "the panel recommended a CCB over an ACEI as first-line therapy in black patients because there was a 51% higher rate (relative risk, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.22–1.86) of stroke… with the use of an ACEI as initial therapy compared with use of a CCB"; it also notes "there were no differences in other outcomes" between a CCB and a diuretic and that "There were no outcome studies… that compared diuretics or CCBs vs β-blockers, ARBs, or other renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in black patients."

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^16531810]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Twenty-two guidelines (59%) mentioned race at least once in reference to pharmacology. Guidelines emphasized the need for different first-line medications based on whether a patient belonged to a "Black" or "African American" racial group. A 1991 guideline asserted that "black patients tend to respond better to diuretics and calcium antagonists than to beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as monotherapy."Whelton et al. recommended "[f]or black adults with hypertension (without HF or CKD), initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or CCB."The two most recent hypertension guidelines included in this review recommended different pharmacologic medications based on race.

Fourteen guidelines (38%) referenced interventions designed to address existing differences in hypertension outcomes between racial groups due to lifestyle or behavioral factors. Ten guidelines discussed interventions to decrease sodium intake –, and increase potassium intake. Multiple guidelines described a unique relationship between salt and high blood pressure in African Americans. From the time this association was mentioned in 1991 ("limiting salt intake is recommended for all hypertensive patients, particularly those who are considered salt-sensitive, such as black and older adults"), the reference did not substantially change. A 2006 guideline stated: "The potential benefits of these dietary approaches are amplified because survey data indicate that blacks consume high levels of sodium while their potassium intake is less than that of nonblacks."The AHA's 2014 guideline asserted: "A reduction of salt intake is recommended in patients who are 'salt sensitive,' which may be a fairly common finding in black communities."The 2018 guideline on resistant hypertension noted: "Other subgroups of individuals (e.g. those with CKD350 and obesity, blacks) are often more sensitive and can derive particularly robust benefits from sodium restriction."Other guidelines highlighted the need for interventions to increase physical activity, decrease obesity rates, and encourage smoking cessation. For example, Egan et al. wrote, "special attention to smoking cessation is especially important for African Americans with diabetes as they have more lower-extremity amputations than Caucasians with diabetes."

### Recommendations for the management of special populations: racial and ethnic populations [^de30c2b8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

One of the current challenges in the treatment of hypertension is the variation in the incidence and morbidity among ethnic populations. For example, in the recent Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), in which 35% of the patients were African American, the diuretic chlorthalidone was associated with greater reductions in blood pressure (BP) than the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and was also associated with a relative risk reduction in stroke compared with lisinopril. However, the increased stroke risk associated with lisinopril was experienced among African American but not non-African American patients. ALLHAT did not permit combination therapy with ACE inhibitors plus diuretics; therefore, the benefits of such regimens in this patient population could not be assessed. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, in contrast to the overall study population, African American patients with left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) than African Americans treated with losartan, with or without diuretics. On the other hand, in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, African American patients treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril had a significantly lower incidence of the primary composite end point (glomerular filtration rate reduction, end-stage renal disease, or death) than African Americans treated with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Although the use of diuretics in African American patients may be a logical first-line choice for BP reduction, most patients will require combination therapy. African American patients with systolic BP ≥ 15 mm Hg above target level or a diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg above target should be considered for first-line combination therapy. Although certain combinations have been shown to be effective in non-African American patients, the choice of drugs for combination therapy in African American patients may be different.

### Comparative effectiveness of calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme / angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics on cardiovascular events likelihood in hypertensive African-American and non-hispanic caucasians: a retrospective study across HCA healthcare [^56b8db85]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood pressure guideline recommends calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide diuretics as first‐line agents for non‐Hispanic (NH) Black adults with hypertension who do not have heart failure or renal disease. The guideline also emphasizes the use of antihypertensive medications from two or more different classes. Conversely, the International Society of Hypertension in Blacks (ISHIB) advises combination therapy with a CCB and a renin‐angiotensin blocking agent (preferably an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) as the primary treatment for NH Black patients with hypertension. Numerous trials have assessed the efficacy of different antihypertensive regimens, yielding conflicting results, particularly in racial and ethnic‐specific studies. The Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CCBs, and alpha‐receptor blockers were not superior to thiazide diuretics in lowering blood pressure. Thiazide diuretics were also more effective in preventing strokes among NH Black individuals compared to other medications. However, the African American Study of Kidney Disease indicated that ACE inhibitors were more effective than beta‐blockers and CCBs in slowing the progression of renal disease in NH Black Americans with nondiabetic renal disease, contradicting ALLHAT's findings that ACE inhibitors were not superior to other antihypertensive classes for preventing kidney disease.

Understanding the optimal first‐line antihypertensive medications for preventing cardiovascular events and mortality is crucial for clinical decision‐making. Previous studies have explored the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments in reducing cardiovascular events. Identifying the most effective treatments for controlling hypertension and reducing cardiovascular events and mortality with minimal side effects is essential for guiding clinicians and reducing the global burden of cardiovascular disease. To provide an updated perspective on the comparative efficacy of antihypertensive medications, we aimed to investigate the association between prior antihypertensive medication use and the likelihood of cardiovascular events and to assess whether this relationship is influenced by the patient's race. The findings from this study will be relevant for contemporary clinical management of hypertension, especially considering the new ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^fb4ed8af]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Black patients of African or Caribbean descent

Latin American Society of Hypertension and ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a thiazide-like diuretic or a CCB as the first-line treatment for black patients in monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy.

Several studies support the idea that diuretics are particularly efficacious in this patient population. In a sub-analysis of ALLHAT in black patients (n = 11 792), the relative risks for stroke, heart failure, and combined endpoints for coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease were significantly lower with chlorthalidone treatment than with lisinopril treatment. Moreover, in an analysis of an electronic record database, after propensity score matching (n = 10 674), treatment of black patients with ACE inhibitors was associated with a significantly higher risk of the primary outcome [composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke: hazard ratio 1.65 (95% CI: 1.33–2.05), P < 0.0001], myocardial infarction [hazard ratio 4.00 (95% CI: 1.34–11.96), P = 0.01], stroke [hazard ratio 1.97 (95% CI: 1.34–2.92), P = 0.001], heart failure [hazard ratio 3.00 (95% CI: 1.99–4.54), P < 0.0001], and all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 1.35 (95% CI: 1.03–1.76), P = 0.03] compared with treatment with diuretics.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^15cb6dbd]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects more than one in four adults globally and is a major modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Internationally, guideline based approaches to pharmacotherapy for hypertension have been adopted to simplify clinical practice and improve blood pressure control. Although some evidence suggests that the effectiveness of drug treatment for hypertension does not differ across the general population, guideline recommendations hinge on the understanding that the effect of these drugs differs among specific subpopulations.

In the United Kingdom (UK), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) as first line treatment for hypertension in people younger than 55, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for people without diabetes aged 55 and older, replacing CCB with thiazides for those with drug intolerance. The presence of an age based recommendation is unique among major international guidelines for hypertension treatment, and is based on differences in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with age. Since this threshold was introduced in the first iteration of NICE hypertension guidance in 2004, the evidence base for hypertension treatment in older age, including the use and safety of ACEI/ARB drugs in older populations has evolved.

Furthermore, in NICE guidelines, use of CCB or thiazides is recommended as first line treatment for black people of African or Caribbean ethnic origin (referred to in this article as black people to reflect diversity). The same drugs are recommended, after consideration of comorbidities, in international guidelines. The pathophysiology of hypertension in this population has been thought to differ importantly from people of white heritage; lower levels of renin result in a reduced response to hypertension drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system such as ACEI/ARB. However, treatment recommendations based on historical categorisations of ethnicity have recently been criticised, because ethnicity can be considered a social construct rather than a biological one, and the proportion of people with mixed ethnic heritage has increased.

Contemporary routine care is characterised by an increasingly older, more ethnically diverse and multi-morbid population. For people initiating hypertension drugs, it is not known whether current age and ethnicity based treatment recommendations translate to greater blood pressure reductions in these settings.

### Initial combination therapy for hypertension in patients of African ancestry: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f6bfe6c6]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that consider the effect of initial dual antihypertensive combination treatment on blood pressure (BP), morbidity, or mortality in hypertensive African ancestry adults, using the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. Main outcomes were difference in means (continuous data) and risk ratio (dichotomous data). We retrieved 1728 reports yielding 13 RCTs of 4weeks to 3years duration (median 8weeks) in 3843 patients. Systolic BP was significantly higher on β-adrenergic blocker vs. other combinations, 3.80 [0.82;6.78] mmHg, but comparable for other combinations. Hypokalemia and hyperglycemia occurred with calcium channel blocker (CCB)+diuretics > diuretics+angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-II-type-1-receptor antagonist (ARB) > CCB+ACEI/ARB. An RCT including high-risk patients reported combined morbidity/mortality for hydrochlorothiazide (mg) 25+benazepril 40 vs. amlodipine 10+benazepril 40 of respectively 8.9% vs. 6.6% (n = 1414, risk ratio 1.35 [0.94;1.94]; all patients, N = 11 506, 1.23 [1.11;1.37]). We conclude that limited evidence supports CCB+ACEI rather than HCT+ACEI as first-line initial combination therapy in African ancestry patients with hypertension.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^3f95558f]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Another important consideration is race in antihypertensive medication selection. African American patients have higher risk of treatment resistant hypertension and are more likely to require more agents for adequate control. To this end, current guidelines promote the use of dual drug antihypertensive drug therapy. Recommended treatment is a combination drug therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker combined with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic.

Our recommendations are consistent with the 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) clinical policy which, based on expert opinion and panel consensus, states that in order to gradually lower BP and/or facilitate chronic BP management, "emergency physicians may choose to initiate hypertension treatment for markedly elevated BP" (defined as SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg based on expert opinion). The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines similarly note that prompt management of very high BP is important to limit the risk of target-organ damage. Additionally, clinicians should consider factors such as poor primary care follow-up, geriatric patients, or patients at greater risk for adverse outcomes from elevated hypertension such as African American patients in making ED prescribing decisions. Prescribing antihypertensive medication in the ED setting is effective and can be done safely. Additional resources include mobile health follow-up and engagement, home BP monitor, and community health workers.

### Association of race / ethnicity-specific changes in antihypertensive medication classes initiated among Medicare beneficiaries with the eighth Joint National Committee panel member report [^30f00329]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In December 2013, the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC8) published a report with evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients initiating antihypertensive medication. Both the JNC8 panel member report and the previous seventh (JNC7) guideline recommended thiazide-type diuretics as first-line therapy, regardless of race/ethnicity, among patients without compelling indications for specific classes of antihypertensive medication. However, the JNC8 panel member report differed from the JNC7 guideline by including race/ethnicity-specific recommendations for additional initial medications, either alone or as components of combination therapy. For non-Black adults, the JNC8 panel member report recommended thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Black adults were recommended thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs. The panel did not recommend β-blockers as first-line therapy in the absence of either coronary heart disease (CHD) or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

The race/ethnicity-specific treatment recommendations in the JNC8 panel member report were based on randomized trial data showing that Black adults have smaller blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk decreases than White adults when treated with an ACEI. Prespecified subgroup analyses of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that the risks of stroke, heart failure, and CVD were higher in Black participants randomized to an ACEI vs a thiazide-type diuretic, and the risk of stroke was higher in Black participants randomized to an ACEI vs a CCB. No differences were present for White participants. β-Blockers were not recommended for first-line therapy because there is evidence of increased CVD risk with β-blockers compared with ARBs.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate changes in the initial antihypertensive medication regimens filled between 2011 and 2018 among older US adults who were Black, White, or of other race/ethnicity. In addition, we evaluated changes in the initial classes of antihypertensive medication filled before vs after December 18, 2013, the date the JNC8 panel member report was published.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^d27f3537]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The burden of hypertension is rising rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), posing significant health challenges and economic costs that hinder national development. Despite being well-studied in clinical medicine, the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension in SSA remain inadequate. This is due to barriers across the care continuum, including individual-, provider-, and system-level obstacles within the health system. A critical issue is the lack of contextualized mechanistic research to understand the mechanisms, phenotypes, and treatment responses in native SSA populations. Current treatment approaches are often based on data from diaspora Africans, particularly African Americans. Consequently, most guidelines do not recommend angiotensin system drugs as first-line agents for Black patients, a stance that should be reconsidered given some evidence of their effectiveness in native SSA populations. Addressing these barriers requires a comprehensive, multisectoral strategy that includes both preventative and clinical measures at the population and individual levels. Preventative approaches should encompass health and nutrition education, improving food supply quality, and implementing comprehensive transportation and environmental policies. In addition, strategies should be developed to increase the detection of undiagnosed cases through enhanced screening and treatment access to those not receiving care, and revisit current treatment approaches to ensure that they are more tailored to the specific populations and settings. In conclusion, innovative strategies are needed to identify and overcome barriers to hypertension diagnosis and management. A coordinated, multisectoral approach that includes a contextualized mechanistic research agenda, as well as task shifting and task sharing, will help prevent and reduce hypertension in SSA.

### A rational approach to the treatment of hypertension in special… [^fafc2485]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Hypertension in Black Patients The prevalence of hypertension in adult black patients in the United States is 32. 4 percent, compared with
23. 3 percent in white patients. 2 This increased prevalence is accompanied by an 80 percent higher rate of mortality associated with stroke, a 50 percent higher rate of mortality associated with heart disease and a striking, sixfold greater rate of hypertension-related end-stage renal disease. TREATMENT WITH ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS The excellent blood pressure–lowering efficacy of diuretics and calcium channel antagonists in hypertensive black patients is related to their characteristic volume expansion, salt sensitivity and low renin profile. As recommended by JNC VI, diuretics should be used for initial therapy unless there is an absolute or relative contraindication.

The problem of a reduced blood pressure-lowering effect of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors is moot if diuretics are used as initial or second-line drug therapy in black patients with hypertension. The combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors or beta blockers produces equivalent lowering of blood pressure in whites and blacks, perhaps as a result of diuretic-induced stimulation of renin release. This is true even for combination-type drugs that contain as little as 6. 25 to
12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. 14 Most hypertensive black patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to control systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg, the current goals recommended by JNC VI for patients with uncomplicated hypertension. In the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study, 15 only 46 percent of black hypertensive patients with stage 1 or stage 2 disease achieved a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg with monotherapy.

In the absence of contraindications, special efforts should be made to ensure that black patients with hypertension who have had a myocardial infarction are receiving a beta blocker and that hypertensive black patients with systolic heart failure or diabetic nephropathy are receiving an ACE inhibitor. In these cases, the protective effect of the drugs is due to more than just reduction of blood pressure. In black hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, evidence now shows that non–dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists can slow the chronic progression of renal disease.

### Management of high blood pressure in blacks: an update of the international society on hypertension in blacks consensus statement [^3a9729a6]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Since the first International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on the "Management of High Blood Pressure in African American" in 2003, data from additional clinical trials have become available. We reviewed hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment guidelines, pharmacological hypertension clinical end point trials, and blood pressure-lowering trials in blacks. Selected trials without significant black representation were considered. In this update, blacks with hypertension are divided into 2 risk strata, primary prevention, where elevated blood pressure without target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, or overt cardiovascular disease for whom blood pressure consistently < 135/85 mm Hg is recommended, and secondary prevention, where elevated blood pressure with target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, for whom blood pressure consistently < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. If blood pressure is ≤ 10 mm Hg above target levels, monotherapy with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker is preferred. When blood pressure is > 15/10 mm Hg above target, 2-drug therapy is recommended, with either a calcium channel blocker plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker or, alternatively, in edematous and/or volume-overload states, with a thiazide diuretic plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Effective multidrug therapeutic combinations through 4 drugs are described. Comprehensive lifestyle modifications should be initiated in blacks when blood pressure is ≥ 115/75 mm Hg. The updated International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on hypertension management in blacks lowers the minimum target blood pressure level for the lowest-risk blacks, emphasizes effective multidrug regimens, and de-emphasizes monotherapy.

### Recognition and management of hypertension in older persons: focus on African Americans [^a114cb82]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hypertension is the most commonly diagnosed condition in persons aged 60 and older and is the single most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke), kidney disease, and dementia. More than half of individuals with hypertension in the United States are aged 60 and older. Hypertension disproportionately affects African Americans, with all age groups, including elderly adults, having a higher burden of hypertension-related complications than other U.S.

Populations

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of blood pressure (BP) reduction on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with most of the evidence in individuals aged 60 and older. Several guidelines have recently been published on the specific management of hypertension in individuals aged 60 and older, including in high-risk groups such as African Americans. Most recommend careful evaluation, thiazide diuretics and calcium-channel blockers for initial drug therapy in most African Americans, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in those with chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Among the areas of controversy is the recommended target BP in African Americans aged 60 and older. A recent U.S. guideline recommended raising the systolic BP target from less than 140 mmHg to less than 150 mmHg in this population. This article will review the evidence and current guideline recommendations for hypertension treatment in older African Americans, including the rationale for continuing to recommend a SBP target of less than 140 mmHg in this population.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns and effectiveness [^ae4eec5b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Racial and ethnic differences in HTN drug prescribing patterns

Within our entire dataset, 60.5% of Black participants were prescribed a 2017 AHA/ACC guideline-recommended first-line HTN treatment (diuretic or CCB; ACEI or ARB if preexisting CKD; beta blocker if preexisting HF; Table S11), compared with 73.8% of White participants and 81.3% of Hispanic participants (diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB; Figure S6). After selecting only participants who initiated pharmacological HTN treatment after 2018 (following the release of the ACC/AHA guidelines), we found that 63.5% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first-line treatment, compared with 75.8% of White participants and 81.8% of Hispanic participants (Figure 4).

The patterns of first medications prescribed starting in 2018 for HTN medicines varied by racial and ethnic population (P < 1e-08; Figure 4). Starting in 2018, ACEI were the most prescribed first medication in White and Hispanic populations, while CCBs were the most prescribed in Black participants, which ranked third and second in White and Hispanic participants, respectively.

### Special populations… [^bd7fbec6]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA recommends chlortha lidone as the preferred thiazide diuretic and recommends that central-acting alpha agonists be avoided. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. 4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5. HEART FAILURE ACEIs are associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. ACEIs and ARBs reduce proteinuria and decrease progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with proteinuria.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Editor's Note: As we continue to navigate the complexities of managing chronic disease in our patients, we must remember that many conditions, including hypertension, are affected by environmental, behavioral, and sociocultural factors as opposed to genetics alone. While guidelines from the US and other countries continue to use race as a surrogate in determining pharmacotherapy, it is critical for us to determine the true underlying cause for differences in morbidity/mortality and differences in response to therapies rather than assuming it is based on one's skin tone or identifying as Black.

In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of another medication.

### 2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth Joint National Committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations [^18b99f42]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled "2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ≥ 60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of < 150 mm Hg in the general population age ≥ 60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Prevention and management of CVD in LMICs: why do ethnicity, culture, and context matter? [^6276728a]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventions for CVD: why drugs and models of care may need region-specific fine tuning

Similar to epidemiologic data on CVD, the evidence for its therapeutic interventions has largely been derived from high-income settings. However, just as CVD phenotypes may vary by race and ethnicity, so does the effectiveness of therapies for CVD and associated risk factors.

Clinicians have long recognized that antihypertensives have disparate blood pressure lowering effects by race/ethnicity, yet few observational studies or clinical trials have been designed to directly compare effectiveness across these strata. In fact, application of therapies without a trial has led to inappropriate treatment guidelines. For example, the South Asian ethnicity is characterized by high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high propensity to diabetes, and low physical activity. Based on prior Western guidelines, the Indian Society of Hypertension advocated beta-blockers (which have all the side effects mentioned above) as the first line treatment. Furthermore, nuanced effects of combination antihypertensive therapy are often not apparent without race- or ethnicity-specific data; secondary subgroup analyses have demonstrated preliminary evidence for variable blood pressure-lowering results upon addition of a second antihypertensive agent, depending not only on the pharmacologic regimen but also on race/ethnicity. The recently completed CREOLE study represents one of the only examples of a study whose primary aim was to determine race-specific treatment strategies for high blood pressure. This study found that combination regimens, including calcium channel blockers, were more effective than a regimen based on renin-angiotensin system blockade and thiazide diuretics in sub-Saharan Africa. None of these studies have been launched to compare initial blood pressure treatment strategies in other races or ethnicities. Clearly, the differential effects of pharmacologic agents on blood pressure by race can influence the downstream risk for CVD events, perhaps most famously shown by the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), in which African Americans in the renin-angiotensin blockers arm experienced higher risk for strokes and other CVD events.

### A review of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in black patients with hypertension [^c12280d7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current guidelines and recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in black hypertensive patients.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating race-specific outcomes in hypertension were gathered using a MEDLINE search with keywords black, African American, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin system, and hypertension. Studies published from 2000 through April 2018 were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Six guidelines, 8 monotherapy publications, and 5 combination therapy publications included race-specific results and were included in the review. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

Numerous monotherapy trials indicate that black patients may have a reduced blood pressure (BP) response with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with white patients. Conversely, additional studies propose that race may not be the primary predictor of BP response. Reduced efficacy is not observed in trials involving combination therapy. Some studies suggest increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in black patients; however, data are conflicting. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article clarifies vague guideline statements and informs clinicians on the appropriate use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for hypertension treatment in black patients through an in-depth look into the evidence.

Conclusions

Potentially reduced efficacy and limited outcomes data indicate that ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not routinely be initiated as monotherapy in black hypertensive patients. Use in combination with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic is efficacious in black patients, and there are no data showing that this increases or decreases cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns and effectiveness [^45f88a79]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half the United States (US) population and contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and stroke. Research has shown that hypertension is harder to control in non-Hispanic Black (Black) than non-Hispanic White (White) patients, and Black individuals have been shown to have higher rates of hypertension than White individuals, while Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) individuals have been shown to have lower rates of hypertension than White individuals.–

Black and Hispanic populations have been underrepresented in clinical trials in the United States despite National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy changes to mandate the analysis and reporting of race and ethnicity differences in phase III clinical trials in 2001. – Previous research has shown differences in the effectiveness of drug classes among Black and White populations. For example, calcium channel blockers (CCB) and thiazide-type diuretics were more effective antihypertensive (HTN) medications in Black individuals, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) were more effective in White individuals. The data supporting the differences in effectiveness in the Black population has led to different recommendations for first-line HTN medications by race in the 2014 Management of High Blood Pressure Report from the Panel Members Appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) and the 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for High Blood Pressure. For non-Black individuals without chronic kidney disease (CKD), initial HTN medications in the 2014 and 2017 recommendations included a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). For Black individuals without CKD or heart failure (HF), this recommendation was limited only to a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. For all individuals with CKD, an ACEI or ARB was recommended, and for Black individuals with HF, a beta blocker was recommended.

### Diuretic use in black patients with uncontrolled hypertension [^0ffcaa44]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Highly publicized recommendations favor the use of diuretics as a first-line or add-on agent in the management of hypertension, particularly among black patients and patients with resistant hypertension. Failure to follow such guidelines might contribute to high rates of uncontrolled hypertension. This study assessed diuretic prescribing patterns in a sample of black patients with uncontrolled hypertension who were identified from a population of home care recipients.

Methods

The study was conducted in an urban home health organization. Participants were black, aged 21 to 80 years, and had a diagnosis of hypertension. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension were identified, and in-home interviewers collected information on prescribed antihypertensive medications.

Results

Of 658 participants, 5.5% were not prescribed any antihypertensives, and only 46% were prescribed a diuretic. Participants who were not taking a diuretic were taking fewer antihypertensive medications (1.7 vs. 2.9; P < 0.0001), had a higher mean diastolic blood pressure (89.2 vs. 85.5; P = 0.0005), and were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure ≥ 160mm Hg (57.6% vs. 49.0%; P = 0.04). The adjusted mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 5 and 4mm Hg lower, respectively, in patients who were taking a diuretic.

Conclusions

In this sample of black patients with uncontrolled hypertension, despite wide publicizing of the recommendations for use of diuretics, a majority are still not receiving a diuretic. This important issue merits continued attention.

### Evolving the role of black race in hypertension therapeutics [^c3dc19fe]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Black race has been used to guide antihypertensive drug selection for Black patients based on predominant between race (same drug) and intra-race (different drugs) blood pressure (BP) response patterns. Accordingly, thiazide diuretics and calcium antagonists have been recommended over renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and beta blockers for Black patients. Current antihypertensive drug prescribing reflects historical guidance as calcium antagonists and thiazide diuretics are prescribed more and RAS blockers less in Black than White patients. Hypertension control rates in Blacks, lag those for Whites despite their greater use of combination drug therapy and lesser use of monotherapy. This is also true across drug regimens containing any of the 4 recommended classes for initial therapy as well as for evidence-based combination drug therapy (calcium antagonist or thiazide diuretic+RAS blocker) regimens for which there is no known racial disparity in BP response. Current recommendations acknowledge the need for combination drug therapy in most, especially in Black patients. One exemplary comprehensive hypertension control program achieved > 80% control rates in Black and White patients with minimal racial disparity while utilizing a race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm. Black patients manifest robust, if not outsized, BP responses to diet/lifestyle modifications. Importantly, race neither appears to be a necessary nor sufficient consideration for the selection of effective drug therapy. Accordingly, we urge the initiation of adequately intense race-agnostic drug therapy coupled with greater emphasis on diet/lifestyle modifications for Black patients as the cornerstone of a race-informed approach to hypertension therapeutics.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^cd5bc321]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The appropriateness of using the Black race to guide the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, therefore, warrants careful consideration. While practice guidelines, favor calcium-channel blockers and diuretics for Black adults with hypertension, these are typically recommended as part of combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker rather than as monotherapy. Importantly, race-specific differences in average blood pressure responses do not reliably predict individual responses to single-drug therapy, as the BP response distributions overlap significantly between Black and White adults. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using race as a determinant for selecting single-drug therapy in patients for whom monotherapy is otherwise appropriate.

The Kaiser Permanente's Gardena Medical Offices in the United States implemented a comprehensive hypertension control program to address racial disparities in blood pressure management. The program that included a patient population that was 65% Black utilized a team-based approach, culturally tailored communication, physician-led initiatives to reduce therapeutic inertia, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. A race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm was also introduced to guide treatment decisions. The program initially aimed to close the racial gap in blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), which stood at 6.3% (76.6% control in Black patients versus 82.9% in others). Over several years, blood pressure control rates among Black patients improved to 81.4%, reducing the disparity to 2.8%. This demonstrated that high blood pressure control rates and reduced racial disparities can be achieved without race-specific prescribing, particularly when combined with intensive, guideline-aligned care and efforts to avoid therapeutic inertia.

Introduction

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing an epidemic of cardiovascular disease, mainly driven by hypertension. Depending on the age range in published studies, hypertension currently affects from 30% up to 60% of blacks, born and living in Africa. The 2003 guidelines of the World Health Organization and International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) propose that for the majority of hypertensive patients without a compelling indication for another class of drugs, a low-dose diuretic should be considered as the first choice of therapy on the basis of comparative trial data, availability and cost. However, recent trials, proved benefit of newer vs older antihypertensive drugs in terms of blood pressure control, reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and metabolic side effects. They also indicated that the majority of hypertensive patients require multiple drugs to achieve control. Modern guidelines for the management of hypertension, endorse the use of single-pill combinations of antihypertensive drugs to initiate treatment. Recommendations for the management of hypertension in native black African patients are to a large extent extrapolations of studies conducted in blacks living in the United States or Europe and do not account for differences in selection in previous generations, ethnic admixture, and lifestyle. We therefore designed the newer versus older antihypertensive agents in African hypertensive patients (NOAAH) to compare in native black African patients a single-pill combination of newer drugs, not involving a diuretic, with a combination of older drugs, including a diuretic.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns and effectiveness [^314748d8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Variability in drug effectiveness and provider prescribing patterns have been reported in different racial and ethnic populations. We sought to evaluate antihypertensive drug effectiveness and prescribing patterns among self-identified Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), Non-Hispanic Black (Black), and Non-Hispanic White (White) populations that enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a US longitudinal cohort. We employed a self-controlled case study method using electronic health record and survey data from 17,718 White, Hispanic, and Black participants who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and prescribed at least one of 19 commonly used antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness was determined by calculating the reduction in systolic blood pressure measurements after 28 or more days of drug exposure. Starting systolic blood pressure and effectiveness for each medication were compared for self-reported Black, Hispanic, and White participants using adjusted linear regressions. Black and Hispanic participants were started on antihypertensive medications at significantly higher SBP than White participants in 13 and 7 out of 19 medications, respectively. More Black participants were prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications (58.46%) than White (52.35%) or Hispanic (49.9%) participants. First-line HTN medications differed by race and ethnicity. Following the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline release, around 64% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first-line antihypertensive drug compared with 76% of White and 82% of Hispanic participants. Effect sizes suggested that most antihypertensive drugs were less effective in Hispanic and Black, compared with White, participants, and statistical significance was reached in 6 out of 19 drugs. These results indicate that Black and Hispanic populations may benefit from earlier intervention and screening and highlight the potential benefits of personalizing first-line medications.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^33a6ddb7]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a great need for individual treatment options in hypertensive patients of African ethno-geographical ancestry. Compared with hypertension in other population subgroups, the disorder in these patients is often more severe, more resistant to treatment, and leads to earlier end organ damage and premature death. Thus, hypertension seems to be a more aggressive disease in patients of African ancestry. This has important implications for the choice of an antihypertensive agent.

Antihypertensive drugs were the first cardiovascular therapy for which there was wide recognition of differences in clinical efficacy related to ethno-geographical ancestry. Patients of African ancestry as a group respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics, while the response to β-adrenergic blockade and inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme is attenuated (Table 1). However, there is considerable interindividual variation in this response.

Table 1
Differences in clinical efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in ancestry groups

Legend: Data depicted are pooled estimates (95% confidence intervals) from systematic reviews. ACE-i, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. *Mean blood pressure reduction (mm Hg). † The depicted difference is the weighted pooled difference in response between ancestry groups, with positive values indicating a greater response in patients of African ancestry and negative values indicating a greater response in patients of European ancestry.

Greater knowledge about the potential causes for these differences might lead to more individualized treatment regimens, but to our knowledge, no previous study has systematically addressed why patients of African ancestry may have this specific pattern of responses. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic overview of the factors associated with the differential drug response of patients of African ancestry to antihypertensive drug therapy.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^c097de05]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are indispensable drugs in the treatment of hypertension, their role as first-line or even second-line drugs is a provoking debate.

The European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guidelines recommend that thiazide diuretics should be considered as suitable as β-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment.

Another European position, endorsed by the British Hypertension Society, is that diuretics and calcium channel blockers should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients aged ≥ 55 years or black patients of any age, whereas ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers in the case of intolerance to ACE inhibitors) should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients younger than 55 years of age.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC VII) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that thiazide diuretics should be preferred drugs in "most" hypertensive patients, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes.

The present review does not intend to negate the important role of diuretics in certain groups of patients (blacks, salt-sensitive patients, concomitant heart failure) or to underestimate their role in multiple-drug combinations in patients with resistant hypertension. The main argument that will be discussed is the place of diuretics as first-line drugs or add-on drugs in the context of the available antihypertensive armamentarium.

The pro side of the controversy will argue that diuretics should remain the preferred drugs for initial treatment in many hypertensive patients, whereas the cons side will contend that emerging evidence from outcome-based studies is casting doubt on the role of these drugs as first-line and even second-line antihypertensive treatment.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^8d129a6f]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients of African ancestry tend to suffer from more severe hypertension, characterized by enhanced vascular contractility and salt retaining capacity, therapy resistance, and higher morbidity and mortality of the condition and its complications. Because of the need for individual treatment options, as well as the increasing objections to the use of ancestry as a surrogate marker for therapeutic responses, we systematically gathered evidence on biomarkers that may predict the response of individual persons of African ancestry to different types of antihypertensive drugs. However, pharmacogenomics yield heterogeneous, insufficient evidence, and the low renin levels found with greater frequency in patients of African ancestry do not, or do not adequately, predict responses to antihypertensive drugs. Finally, there are no convincing clinical data yet of the emerging paradigm that low NO bioavailability and associated high cellular ATP buffer capacity predict the response to specific antihypertensive drugs. Currently, self-identified ethno-geographic ancestry remains the best available predictor of blood pressure lowering responses to antihypertensive drugs.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^d28f7fcf]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

The ALLHAT (Antihypertensive Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) was one of the largest BP trials performed to date, which enrolled over 33 000 patients with HTN and one CHD risk factor. The objective of this landmark trial was to determine whether the incidence of CHD or other CV diseases would be lower in those patients treated with a CCB, an ACEI, or a diuretic. Patients were randomised to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril with a mean follow-up of about 4.9 years. Primary outcomes included fatal CHD or non-fatal MI and secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. There was no significant difference among the groups for the reduction in the primary or secondary outcome of all-cause mortality. It was determined that thiazide diuretics are superior in preventing one or more forms of CV disease and also since they are less expensive should be a first-line agent in the treatment of HTN. However, other commentaries suggested that this finding may be attributed to the fact that thiazides are better at treating volume-dependent HTN, such as the elderly and African-Americans who comprised a large portion of the patient demographics for this study. Although this may be the case, this very large study showed that amlodipine was neither superior nor inferior to thiazide diuretics or ACEIs in managing HTN in patients with other comorbid conditions.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to black patients, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to use a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB for initial antihypertensive treatment in black adults with HTN but without HF or CKD, including those with diabetes mellitus.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^15bac069]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations

It is possible that people initiating hypertension drugs other than first line options suggested by current guidance were prescribed them for other indications. Despite good balance on baseline comorbidities in matched cohorts, residual confounding caused by unrecorded heart failure and kidney disease could have attenuated the blood pressure response to treatment. However, we endeavoured to reduce confounding by indication by including only people with hypertension; undertaking our analyses only in people who did not have diabetes; and matching by propensity score on multiple factors, inclusive of heart failure. This last approach achieved highly balanced cohorts for each drug comparison within each group. Furthermore, we used multiple strategies to help detect bias in our matched cohorts; our negative outcome analysis demonstrated no increased risk of herpes zoster in any drug group. Additionally, our positive outcome analyses showed that our data and methods were sensitive to drug effects anticipated to be causally associated with specific hypertension drugs.

Our results related to ethnicity have wide margins of uncertainty, which could have occurred for several reasons. Firstly, we compared changes in blood pressure between black and non-black people, consistent with current UK guidance. Much of the original clinical research that informs this guidance compared people with an African or Caribbean ethnic origin versus people classified as white. If people of non-black and non-white ethnicity in our study had intermediate responses to the hypertension drug classes, their inclusion in the non-black group could have contributed to the overlapping confidence intervals observed for non-black and black people. Secondly, we had small numbers of black people initiating ACEI/ARB as a first line treatment for hypertension, suggesting that current NICE guidance is closely adhered to. Thirdly, the uncertainty we observed could have reflected the wide variation in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system across all ethnic groups.

Our outcomes relied on measurements of blood pressure at clinics because these measurements are recommended by NICE to monitor hypertension in primary care and to guide treatment decisions, except for patients suspected of white coat hypertension or resistant hypertension, in whom ambulatory or home monitoring is recommended. Therefore, the blood pressure measurements used in this study reflect the provision of care as it occurs routinely. Furthermore, we do not expect that any one method of blood pressure measurement was more or less concentrated in any one drug group, thus removing the risk of measurement bias. Our study did not look at the issue of adherence to hypertension drugs, although our as-treated analysis did censor individuals if they discontinued their index drug.

### Race and ethnicity in trials of antihypertensive therapy to prevent cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review [^ac645dca]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We wanted to systematically review (1) the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials of antihypertensive drug therapy and (2) racial differences in the efficacy of these therapies for the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, African Index Medicus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from their inception to December 2005 for randomized controlled trials testing the efficacy of antihypertensive drug therapy in preventing myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, or cardiovascular death. MEDLINE was also searched from 2005 through 2006. The 2 authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and quality.

Results

Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Eight trials reported results by racial subgroup. Trials with black and Hispanic participants (ALLHAT, INVEST, VALUE) found similar primary outcomes, but ALLHAT found a greater magnitude of benefit for blacks on diuretic therapy compared with nonblacks. One trial (PROGRESS) compared Asians with non-Asians, reporting that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (vs placebo) were equally effective for preventing stroke in both groups. In the LIFE trial, post hoc analyses showed different outcomes for blacks and nonblacks, raising questions about the usefulness of angiotensin-receptor blockers as first-line antihypertensive agents in blacks. In 3 studies conducted exclusively in Asians (JMIC-B, FEVER, NICS-EH), calcium channel blockers were effective in preventing cardiovascular outcomes. No trials described cardiovascular outcomes in Native Americans.

Conclusions

Five trials made interethnic group comparisons; 4 had similar primary outcomes for ethnic minorities and whites. Increased minority participation in future studies is needed to determine optimal prevention therapies, especially in outcome-driven trials comparing multidrug antihypertensive treatment regimens.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^426400f6]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Wider context

Akin to African-Americans, calcium channel blockers appear to be the most efficacious single agents in African patients. Vascular smooth muscle contractility in those of African descent is purportedly governed by higher concentrations of creatine kinase and lower nitric oxide, pertaining to dual targets for CCBs, which both decrease CK and increase nitrous oxide. However, this has not been verified in SSA participants. Our finding of CCBs' superiority is thus important in supporting consensus from both Pan-African guidance and global public health initiatives.

Similarly, early initiation of combination therapy is a key pillar of the most recent hypertension guidelines. Advantages of combination therapy include tighter, earlier blood pressure control and reduction in dose-dependent side effects, plus augmentation of class effects. Addition of CCBs or diuretics can override the ineffectiveness of ACEi/ARBs in a low-renin/salt sensitivity phenotype, typical of those with African heritage. Our results, predominantly based on the data from CREOLE, support using a CCB backbone combined with ACEi or thiazide diuretic. Policymakers may be keen to adopt a 'magic bullet' solution with a single top choice option for both mono and combination therapy aiding drug procurement and distribution as well as task-shifting in constrained health services. Whilst this is understandable, it would not take account of the heterogeneity in population risk factors and the potential benefits of drug classes outside of their direct effect on blood pressure. For example, none of the studies in our review included participants with co-existing cardiovascular or renal disease, patients in whom treatment with ACEi may be more appropriate than other blood pressure-lowering therapies.

### Diuretics versus others for long-term clinical outcomes as first-line antihypertensive medications: analysis of national real-world database [^22e5ad04]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Although several large trials that included African American patients with hypertension have demonstrated the superiority of diuretics as an initial monotherapy, its applicability to other ethnicities remains questionable. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diuretics as first-line antihypertensive medications are superior to other classes of drugs in the Korean population. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, we analyzed 95,201 Korean hypertensive patients without prior history of cardiovascular disease who started a single antihypertensive drug between January 2002 and December 2017. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Each endpoint was compared among five classes of antihypertensive drugs [diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and beta-blockers (BBs)]. In multivariable Cox analysis, diuretics were superior to ACEIs (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58–2.01), inferior to ARBs (HR, 0.37–0.43) and similar to CCBs and BBs for the primary endpoint. Similar findings were obtained for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and stroke. This result was consistently observed in the longer treatment group and in the propensity score-matched pairs. In Korean hypertensive patients without cardiovascular disease, initiation with diuretics could not be superior to other medications, but rather inferior to ARBs in preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Randomized studies are needed to confirm our results.

Initial combination therapy versus monotherapy — In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^f146dee3]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

JNC 8 — Recommendation 8 (chronic kidney disease with hypertension) states that in adults aged 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, initial (or add-on) antihypertensive treatment should include an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to improve kidney outcomes, and this applies to all CKD patients with hypertension regardless of race or diabetes status; Moderate Recommendation – Grade B. The recommendation is based primarily on kidney outcomes, and neither ACEIs nor ARBs improved cardiovascular outcomes for CKD patients compared with a β-blocker or calcium channel blocker (CCB); direct renin inhibitors are not included in this recommendation because there were no studies demonstrating their benefits on kidney or cardiovascular outcomes. Use of an ACEI or an ARB will commonly increase serum creatinine and may produce other metabolic effects such as hyperkalemia, and although an increase in creatinine or potassium level does not always require adjusting medication, use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in the CKD population require monitoring of electrolyte and serum creatinine levels, and in some cases, may require reduction in dose or discontinuation for safety reasons. In black patients with CKD and proteinuria, an ACEI or ARB is recommended as initial therapy, whereas in black patients with CKD but without proteinuria the choice for initial therapy is less clear and includes a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB; if an ACEI or ARB is not used as the initial drug, an ACEI or ARB can be added as a second-line drug if necessary to achieve goal blood pressure (BP), and because the majority of patients with CKD and hypertension will require more than 1 drug to achieve goal BP, an ACEI or ARB will be used either as initial therapy or as second-line therapy in addition to a diuretic or CCB in black patients with CKD.

### Hypertension in cancer patients and survivors: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^db5aa6df]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Selection of agents for the management of hypertension in patients on cancer therapy

Figure 2 presents an approach to therapy in the cancer patient whose blood pressure warrants drug treatment. Currently, no 1 class of antihypertensive drug is preferred. Because hypertension results from nephrotoxicity in several cancers and cancer treatments, our approach is to first assess for the presence of proteinuria. If proteinuria is present (spot albuminuria-to-creatinine ratio of ≥ 300 mg/g, or spot protein-to-creatinine ratio of ≥ 500 mg/g), drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system are reasonable agents to initiate or titrate. Similarly, if left ventricular dysfunction is present, neurohormonal antagonists may be appropriate first-line drugs. Moreover, limited retrospective data suggest that the use of renin-angiotensin system–blocking drugs may improve survival in cancer patients. Although there was initial concern that lowering blood pressure using medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors could, theoretically, offset the antitumor effect of VEGF inhibitors, this has not been observed in clinical practice, and antihypertensive therapy is recommended for these patients. In the absence of proteinuria, either a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a renin-angiotensin system–blocking drug can be initiated. In our experience, the efficacy of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine is reasonably high, particularly in African American patients, and these drugs' tendency to drug interactions and serious side effects are relatively low. Thus, we prefer adding, or titrating, amlodipine first when proteinuria is absent.

Figure 2
Approach to Treating Hypertension in Patients Receiving Cancer Therapy

The blood pressure threshold for initiation and titration of treatment will vary depending on an individual's risk factors and goals of care. It may be beneficial to defer ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretic agents, and mineralocorticoid antagonists in individuals at risk of volume depletion, or to employ sick-day protocols. The yellow box at the lower left indicates fourth-line agents; we recommend exhausting other options before using these agents. The orange box at the lower right indicates a possible choice of action, made in collaboration with the patient and medical providers, when the blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite the addition or titration of multiple antihypertensive agents. ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; BP = blood pressure; CCB = calcium channel blocker.

### Association of race / ethnicity-specific changes in antihypertensive medication classes initiated among Medicare beneficiaries with the eighth Joint National Committee panel member report [^67a6d008]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In December 2013, the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC8) published a recommendation that non-Black adults initiate antihypertensive medication with a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), whereas Black adults initiate treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic or calcium channel blocker. β-Blockers were not recommended as first-line therapy.

Objective

To assess changes in antihypertensive medication classes initiated by race/ethnicity from before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This serial cross-sectional analysis assessed a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years or older who initiated antihypertensive medication between 2011 and 2018, were Black (n = 3303 [8.0%]), White (n = 34 943 [84.5%]), or of other (n = 3094 [7.5%]) race/ethnicity, and did not have compelling indications for specific antihypertensive medication classes.

Exposures

Calendar year and period after vs before publication of the JNC8 panel member report.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportion of beneficiaries initiating ACEIs or ARBs and, separately, β-blockers vs other antihypertensive medication classes.

Results

In total, 41 340 Medicare beneficiaries (65% women; mean [SD] age, 75.7 [7.6] years) of Black, White, or other races/ethnicities initiated antihypertensive medication and met the inclusion criteria for the present study. In 2011, 25.2% of Black beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive monotherapy did so with an ACEI or ARB compared with 23.7% in 2018 (P = 0.47 for trend). Among beneficiaries initiating monotherapy, the proportion filling a β-blocker was 20.1% in 2011 and 15.4% in 2018 for White beneficiaries (P < .001 for trend), 14.2% in 2011 and 11.1% in 2018 for Black beneficiaries (P = 0.08 for trend), and 11.3% in 2011 and 15.0% in 2018 for beneficiaries of other race/ethnicity (P = 0.40 for trend). After multivariable adjustment and among beneficiaries initiating monotherapy, there was no evidence of a change in the proportion filling an ACEI or ARB before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report overall (prevalence ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.03) or in Black vs White beneficiaries (prevalence ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83–1.12; P = 0.60 for interaction). Among beneficiaries initiating monotherapy, the proportion filling a β-blocker decreased from before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report (prevalence ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.93) with no differences across race/ethnicity groups (P > .10 for interaction).

Conclusions and Relevance

A substantial proportion of older US adults who initiate antihypertensive medication do so with non-guideline-recommended classes of medication.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^69f07091]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^f8718f3c]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry generally respond better to diuretics and calcium blockers and less well to ACE and β-adrenergic blockade? Many clinicians use the self-defined ancestry of a patient as a clinical guide to select antihypertensive drugs, but considerable overlap in response is known to occur between ancestry groups. Therefore, many health care workers and patients object to using ancestry as a proxy for drug response, and it is advocated that reduction of blood pressure and related mortality should be achieved through individual treatment options. However, to reach this end, ethno-cultural and biological differences in drug response behind the surrogate measures of 'ancestry' or 'ethnicity' need to be identified.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on environmental, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors that may contribute to the differential clinical response to different types of drugs observed in patients of African ancestry. In this paper, we also addressed genetic variation thought to affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, of which phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism and receptor function have been most extensively studied.

African American hypertension — ALLHAT and LIFE trial findings identify differential effects by drug class. Among ALLHAT participants, 35% were African American, and subgroup analyses found that the ACEI (lisinopril) was less effective in lowering blood pressure than the thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone) or the long-acting dihydropyridine (LA DHP) CCB (amlodipine); African American participants randomized to the ACEI versus the thiazide-type diuretic were at a 40% greater risk of stroke, 30% greater risk of heart failure, 19% greater risk of CVD, and 15% greater risk of combined CHD, with no difference in major CVD outcomes between the thiazide-type diuretic and the LA DHP CCB other than a higher incidence of heart failure with the CCB, and amlodipine showed greater adherence and fewer medications to reach blood pressure goals than lisinopril, while the LIFE study reported better cardiovascular outcomes with the beta-blocker (atenolol) than with the ARB (losartan) in African Americans.

### Efficacy of different drug classes used to initiate antihypertensive treatment in black subjects… [^3347ca92]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Men and women, aged 18 to 70 years, with a mean ambulatory daytime diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 114 mm Hg, were randomized to 13 months of open-label treatment starting with the nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system, sustained-release verapamil hydrochloride, hydrochlorothiazide, or enalapril maleate. Conclusions In contrast to current recommendations, calcium channel blockers are more effective than thiazides as initial treatment in black subjects with hypertension. If treatment is started with thiazides or converting-enzyme inhibitors, combination therapy is more likely to be required to control blood pressure and reduce left ventricular mass.

SIMILAR TO the recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 1 the South African guidelines for antihypertensive therapy2 recommend the use of low-dose thiazides as the preferred first-line drug, to which calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, β-blockers, or reserpine may be added to achieve blood pressure control. If at the first monthly follow-up visit the target BP was not attained, the daily dose of the first-line drug was increased as follows: nifedipine GITS to 60 mg/d, verapamil hydrochloride SR to 360 mg/d, hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg/d, and enalapril maleate to 20 mg/d. In keeping with other studies, 3, 15 most of our black patients with mild to moderate hypertension required multiple drug treatment to achieve adequate control, especially if treatment was initiated with a thiazide or an ACE inhibitor.

This observation suggests that BP control rather than drug class is the predominant factor determining left ventricular mass regression. In contrast with the modified South African guidelines, 1, 2 long-acting calcium channel blockers are more effective than thiazides as initial treatment in African blacks with hypertension. Outcome trials in hypertension were largely conducted in white22, 23 and Asian subjects. 24–26 Because such information is not yet available for African blacks, the present findings should be subject to further investigation in prospective morbidity and mortality trials in African blacks.

Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in the U.S. is particularly prevalent and devastating among black individuals, who disproportionately suffer the consequences of this condition to a greater extent compared with persons in other racial/ethnic groups. Furthermore, African Americans are often underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical trials, limiting the ability to reliably apply the results from many outcome studies in this specific population. In this review, we summarize and analyze the currently available evidence, specifically related to the risk factors, manifestations, complications and management of HTN in this often difficult-to-treat population. The aim of the review is to improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and identify the optimal approach to deliver the best care for African American patients.

Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for both mortality and disability‐adjusted life‐years worldwide. Cardiovascular events remain the primary cause of death globally and are responsible for almost 18 million deaths annually, which constitutes about one‐third of all deaths worldwide. Hypertension is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events. The introduction of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association hypertension guidelines in 2017 resulted in an increase in the estimated number of individuals diagnosed with hypertension. Despite varying diagnostic criteria for hypertension, the treatment recommendations remain similar and are primarily based on the risk of cardiovascular events.

Despite efforts to enhance blood pressure (BP) control and management, hypertension management has not been equitable among racial and ethnic minority groups. An analysis of hypertension control rates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) revealed that BP control was achieved less frequently among Hispanic individuals (40%), non‐Hispanic (NH) Black individuals (39%), and Asian American individuals (38%) compared to NH White individuals (49%). Furthermore, NH Black individuals are diagnosed with hypertension earlier and suffer from higher hypertension‐related morbidity and mortality than NH White individuals. They face a 30% higher risk of fatal stroke and a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Overall, NH Black individuals experience hypertension‐related mortality rates that are four to five times higher than those of NH White Americans. Additionally, NH Black adults have lower hypertension control rates and less treatment intensification.

### Differences in hypertension medication prescribing for black Americans and their association with hypertension outcomes [^6faf3fcf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

National guidelines recommend different pharmacologic management of hypertension (HTN) without comorbidities for Black/African Americans (BAA) compared with non-BAA. We sought to 1) identify if these recommendations have influenced prescription patterns in BAA and 2) identify the differences in uncontrolled HTN in BAA on different antihypertensive medications.

Methods

We constructed a linked retrospective observational cohort using 2 years of electronic health records data, comprising of patients aged 18 to 85 with HTN on 1- or 2-drug regimens, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), thiazide diuretics, or calcium channel blockers (CCB). We examined prescribing differences and HTN control in BAA versus non-BAA.

Results

Among 10,875 patients identified, 20.6% were identified as BAA. 46.4% of BAA had uncontrolled HTN (≥ 140/90 mmHg) compared with 39.0% of non-BAA (P < .001). 61.8% of BAA were treated with 1-drug compared with 68.4% of non-BAA. Of BAA on monotherapy: 41.3% were on thiazide, 40.1% on CCB, and 18.6% on ACE/ARB. Of non-BAA on monotherapy, 27.7% were on thiazide, 30.1% were on CCB, and 42.3% were on ACE/ARB. Of BAA patients on 1 drug, 45.2% had uncontrolled HTN compared with 38.0% of non-BAA (P < .001). Of BAA on 2 drugs, 48.2% had uncontrolled HTN compared with 41.1% non-BAA (P < .001). For each drug regimen, there was more variation in HTN control within each group than between BAA and non-BAA.

Conclusions

Providers seem to be following race-based guidelines for HTN, yet HTN control for BAA remains worse than non-BAA. An individualized approach to HTN therapy for all patients may be more important than race-based guidelines.

### Hypertension treatment in blacks: discussion of the U.S. clinical practice guidelines [^d31e6e65]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Blacks are especially susceptible to hypertension (HTN) and its associated organ damage leading to adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal outcomes. Accordingly, HTN is particularly significant in contributing to the black-white racial differences in health outcomes in the US. As such, in order to address these health disparities, practical clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on how to treat HTN, specifically in blacks, are needed. This review article is a timely addition to the literature because the most recent U.S. CPG more explicitly emphasizes race into the algorithmic management of HTN. However, recent clinical research cautions that use of race as a proxy to determine therapeutic response to pharmaceutical agents may be erroneous. This review will address the implications of the use of race in the hypertension CPGs. We will review the rationale behind the introduction of race into the U.S. CPG and the level of evidence that was available to justify this introduction. Finally, we will conclude with practical considerations in the treatment of HTN in blacks.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^173d94f4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the key factors that drives BP control is the prescribing patterns of clinicians, which is highly variable. There are numerous factors that contribute to the choice of antihypertensive medication for individual patients, including patient and clinician preferences. To encourage evidence‐based treatment and standardization of prescribing patterns for antihypertensive regimens, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) published a report on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in 2014, and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published a joint recommendation for the management of hypertension in 2017 (2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines). Briefly, the JNC 8 recommended thiazide diuretics, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as acceptable first‐line treatment options for non‐Black patients and recommended only thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first‐line options for Black patients. Beta blockers were no longer recommended as a first‐line option, in contrast to its previous report. The adoption of the JNC 8 recommendations varied across health care providers, with some controversies mostly centering around an established higher treatment threshold for older adults (150 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for adults 60 years and older); this recommendation deviated from more aggressive targets recommended by other organizations. This controversy later contributed to the development of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, which differed primarily in the choice of initial medications and the target blood pressure goals. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a broader use of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs for all patients, regardless of race, and emphasized selecting medications based on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities. Compared with the JNC 8 report, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a lower target BP broadly, particularly in high‐risk patients. Following the publication of those guidelines, several international studies have characterized prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medications in select subpopulations (ie, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD])or in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Prescribing patterns have also been studied in a population‐based cohort in the United Kingdom. To date, there has been limited exploration of how prescribing patterns overall may have changed since publication of the JNC 8 report or 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in the United States. In addition, previous studies have suggested that it can take more than a decade for clinical guidelines to be adopted into routine clinical practice and that those guidelines can be adopted differentially for patients from minority populations. Thus, understanding how the adoption of clinical practice guidelines for antihypertension management may vary by sociodemographic variables may help identify opportunities for more equitable prescribing practices nationally.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^b1623a3f]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of hypertension compared with the Joint National Committee 8 panelists' recommendations [^fa677953]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The panelists of the Joint National Committee recently published new recommendations for the management of hypertension. Our study aims to evaluate how current practice compares.

Hypothesis

Current practice likely deviates from the recent JNC 8 panelists' recommendations.

Methods

A survey was sent to cardiology providers at 3 academic medical centers: Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona; and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Providers were asked to select which blood-pressure goal would be deemed appropriate in various cases based on individual practice in both the maintenance of patients already on therapy as well as threshold of when to initiate therapy. Comparisons with current recommendations were made, as well as geographic location and level of experience.

Results

A total of 251 survey requests were sent (May 2014), and 77 responses (30.7%) were received. Cardiologists tended not to practice according to the new guidelines, with most variation seen in patients age > 60 years without comorbidities on active treatment. Providers' selection of initial pharmacologic agents in non-African American patients, African American patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus reflected congruency with guidelines.

Conclusions

Our study found that clinical practice does not correlate well with the new blood-pressure goal recommendations published by the Joint National Committee 8 panelists, particularly in patients age > 60 years. Practitioners are likely to follow the recommendations in regard to pharmacologic management.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^428ab060]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Additional Insights

While JNC 8 has the same treatment recommendations for people with or without diabetes, most other societies suggest that only ACEIs or ARBs should be first‐line treatment for patients with diabetes. In the case of patients with diabetes and a history of CKD, we agree that ACEIs or ARBs should be first line.

In the black population with hypertension, CCBs and thiazide diuretics generally tend to be favored as initial therapy over renin‐angiotensin system blockers. 13, 14, 45 The evidence for this recommendation comes from ALLHAT, which showed in prespecified subgroup analysis that black patients treated with lisinopril had higher rates of stroke, CVD, and HF plus 4 mm Hg higher SBP compared with those treated with chlorthalidone. 49

On the other hand, the primary and secondary outcomes were similar in the chlorthalidone and amlodipine groups except for higher rates of HF with amlodipine. Compared with lisinopril, the black patients in the amlodipine group had lower stroke rates and improved BP control. Therefore, both CCBs and thiazide diuretics are considered first line for black patients with hypertension.

If a black patient has coexisting CKD, initial treatment should be an ACEI or ARB if the patient also has albuminuria, as supported by the KDIGO guidelines. This recommendation, for starting with CCBs and thiazides is generalized to black patients with diabetes, because nearly half of the black patients in ALLHAT had diabetes. Given that most patients require > 1 agent to control hypertension, it is important to know that combination treatment with CCB or diuretics plus rennin‐angiotensin system blockade leads to the same efficacy in black or white patients. The International Society for Hypertension in Blacks suggests starting with a CCB or thiazide diuretic if < 10 mm Hg above target or using a 2‐drug approach if > 15/10 mm Hg over with a CCB or diuretic plus a rennin‐angiotensin system blocker. 13

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^4eca6d1b]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Among African-Americans adults, arterial hypertension is both more prevalent and associated with more complications than among white adults. Hypertension is also epidemic among black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The treatment of hypertension among black adults may be complicated by lesser response to certain classes of anti-hypertensive agents.

Methods

We systematically searched literature for clinical trials of ACE-inhibitors among hypertensive adults comparing blood pressure response between whites and blacks. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response. Further analysis including meta-regressions, funnel plots, and one-study-removed analyses were performed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity or bias.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 13 trials providing 17 different patient groups for evaluation, black race was associated with a lesser reduction in systolic (mean difference: 4.6 mmHg (95% CI 3.5–5.7)) and diastolic (mean difference: 2.8 mmHg (95% CI 2.2–3.5)) blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors, with little heterogeneity. Meta-regression revealed only ACE-inhibitor dosage as a significant source of heterogeneity. There was little evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions

Black race is consistently associated with a clinically significant lesser reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to ACE-inhibitor therapy in clinical trials in the USA and Europe. In black adults requiring monotherapy for uncomplicated hypertension, drugs other than ACE-inhibitors may be preferred, though the proven benefits of ACE-inhibitors in some sub-groups and the large overlap of response between blacks and whites must be remembered. These data are particularly important for interpretation of clinical drug trials for hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa and for the development of treatment recommendations in this population.

### Blood pressure, antihypertensive therapy and risk for renal injury in African-Americans [^765b332d]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

African-Americans are more likely than Caucasians to develop hypertension-related end-stage renal disease. Elevations in blood pressure levels clearly potentiate pre-existing renal disease and also contribute to kidney injury independently of other primary renal diseases in this cohort. Until recently, data relevant to a full examination of the issue of blood pressure levels and end-stage renal disease in African-Americans have largely been from post-hoc analyses of clinical trials or from small, prospective, short-term studies.

Recent Findings

The most recent United States Renal Data Systems data show hypertension as the primary cause of end-stage renal disease in African-Americans until 1997, diabetes now being the most prevalent etiology. Data from post-hoc analyses of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study demonstrated that African-Americans with a mean arterial pressure above 98 mmHg had a higher risk of end-stage renal disease than Caucasians. The African-American Study of Kidney Disease tested the hypothesis that a blood pressure well below the usual recommended level will further reduce renal disease progression in African-Americans. The study concluded that a blood pressure lower than that needed to reduce cardiovascular events, as defined by the Sixth Joint National Committee Report on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, i.e. 135–140/80–85 mmHg, will not further slow renal disease progression in African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Moreover, a regimen of blood pressure lowering anchored on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antihypertensive agents that are touted as ineffective in African-Americans, was more effective than one based on either beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers in slowing the progression of renal injury.

Summary

Systolic blood pressure reduction in the range 130–139 mmHg is appropriate to reduce risk of nephropathy progression and cardiovascular risk in African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Moreover, a regimen that is initiated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should be the antihypertensive treatment of choice in African-Americans with kidney disease.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^f4ab54ac]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Salt-sensitive and low-renin hypertension

Lastly, though not addressed in most guidelines, patients with salt-sensitive hypertension and/or low-renin hypertension have characteristics that lend themselves well to treatment with a diuretic. In most cases, low levels of renin are an indication that the RAS is suppressed because of volume overload and sodium retention. In such patients, as well as in salt-sensitive patients, treatment with diuretics, which reduce volume and increase sodium excretion, would be expected to be efficacious, whereas treatment with RAS inhibitors would be expected to suppress the RAS further. In fact, in the few clinical trials that have looked at patients with low-plasma renin activity and/or salt sensitivity, effective blood pressure lowering strategies include HCTZ, chlorthalidone, indapamide, or spironolactone.

As salt-sensitive hypertension is especially common in black patients, older adults, and in patients with more severe blood pressure or with comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease and as low-renin hypertension is particularly common in African Americans, the elderly, and patients with resistant hypertension, it is not surprising that diuretics have been shown to be particularly effective in these patient populations.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^74989d21]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study confirms and quantifies the hypothesis that adult black hypertensive patients do generally have a lesser mean reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to ACEI monotherapy when compared to whites. This meta-analysis provides evidence for current guidelines that recommend that drugs other than ACEI should be preferred for uncomplicated, mild-moderate hypertension in blacks, guidelines that have particular import in sub-Saharan Africa. These results, though, must be taken in the context of other research that provides strong evidence for the benefits of ACEIs in some subgroups of hypertensive black adults, particularly those with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and those requiring multi-drug therapy for their hypertension. For hypertensive black adults in whom ACEI monotherapy is indicated, higher doses may be necessary to obtain the desired reduction in blood pressure.

### First-line treatment for hypertension… [^98a242b2]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 53-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presents with persistent hypertension despite lifestyle changes. She saw an advertisement on television about a new hypertension medication and asks about it for treatment. Clinical Question What class of medications is the best first-line treatment for hypertension. 1 ACE inhibitors and CCBs reduced mortality and morbidity as much as thiazide diuretics, but the evidence is less robust. Because the use of thiazide diuretics is supported by a strong body of evidence and no other class of antihypertensive medications has been shown to be better at improving outcomes, they are the first-line drugs for most patients with hypertension. Current evidence does not support using beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension.

Cochrane Abstract Background: Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug is the best first-line option. This review answers that question. Objectives: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers. However, only low-dose thiazide diuretics were effective; high-dose thiazide diuretics were no different than placebo in risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. 1 Although there were fewer trials of ACE inhibitors and CCBs as first-line agents, the current evidence suggests that they were also effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, or as secondary prevention.

The strongest body of evidence indicates that for most patients with hypertension, thiazide diuretics are the best proven first-line treatment in reducing morbidity and mortality. They are particularly effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in all patients with hypertension, and in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Current evidence does not support the use of beta blockers, particularly atenolol, as first-line treatment for hypertension. Although there is increasing evidence that ACE inhibitors and possibly CCBs may be equivalent to thiazide diuretics in reducing morbidity and mortality, the relative expense of these medications makes thiazide diuretics a more favorable first-line choice in patients who do not have contraindications for their use.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^3394adf6]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the leading global risk factor for death, accounting for 13% of mortality. Recent epidemiological trends show that the burden of disease in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has overtaken many European and North American states. In large urban areas, 30–50% of adults are classed as hypertensive; prevalence in rural areas is 15–25%. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, which accounts for up to 11% of adult deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. Management of both the acute and chronic consequences of hypertension remains poorly optimised across much of the continent, with delays in the presentation, limited access to diagnostic imaging services and rudimentary follow-up care.

Only 25% of countries have a national framework for hypertension, and just 7% of those with hypertension in Africa achieve control. The Pan-African Society for Cardiovascular Disease guidelines provide a roadmap towards the WHO non-communicable disease target of 25% reduction in high blood pressure by 2025. Though pragmatic, these are predominantly based upon European and American guidelines, with little reference to research conducted on the continent. It is well established that black people living in the Northern Hemisphere respond differently to antihypertensive agents compared to white populations due to a variety of phenotypic differences including lower circulating renin and higher concentrations of skeletal muscle creatine kinase. Studies in African-Americans are not necessarily generalisable to SSA populations, due to both genetic diversity and contrasting environmental settings. Emerging evidence suggests that hypertension in SSA is more severe, more resistant to treatment and more likely to lead to premature morbidity and mortality. Additionally, many African states are resource-limited and focus on public health strategies on maximising distribution of a restricted formulary, to minimise costs and improve consistency of services. Delivery of care is common by lower-skilled healthcare workers, especially in rural localities, and access to medical care may require high out-of-pocket expenditure.

There have been no systematic reviews to comprehensively synthesise the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of hypertension in SSA. African populations are also underrepresented in global trials and meta-analysis. Two previous reviews do make some specific reference to the continent; however, comparisons are limited to monotherapy only. In light of this, we aimed to review the evidence for all common pharmacological treatments, for persons living in SSA, with regard to both the reduction in blood pressure and prevention of associated cardiovascular disease.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg) are recommended to start two first-line agents of different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination (SPC), to improve blood pressure control and adherence. In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiating therapy with a single first-line drug is reasonable with dose titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve control. In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — stage-based recommendations are: In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended (1 B-R). In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control (2a C-EO). In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

Changes in Trends After Guidelines

After publication of the JNC 8 report in 2014, which removed beta blockers as a first‐line therapy for most patients (except those with CAD and congestive heart failure) and recommended the use of thiazide diuretics and CCBs alone as first‐line therapies for Black patients, the probability of receiving a beta blocker prescription did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 but was 3% (95% CI, 2%–4%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with the pre‐JNC 8 time period of 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4A). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving CCB was 20% (95% CI, 18%–22%) higher in 2015 to 2017, and 41% (95% CI, 38%–41%) higher in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving thiazide diuretics did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 and was 6% (95% CI, 8%−5%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B).

Despite a recommended increased use of dual therapy and FDC among patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg by the 2017 Hypertention Clinical Practice Guidelines, we observed a decreasing trend instead. Compared with 2015 to 2017, there was a 9% (95% CI, 11%−8%) decrease in use of dual therapy and 11% (95% CI, 12%−9%) decrease in the use of any FDC in 2018 to 2019 (Figure 4C).

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^9b609f23]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### Self-reported antihypertensive medication class and temporal relationship to treatment guidelines [^8726de28]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The greater antihypertensive responses to initial therapy with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or thiazide-type diuretics than renin-angiotensin system blockers as initial therapy in non-Hispanic Black (NHB) adults was recognized in the US High BP guidelines from 1988 to 2003. The 2014 Report from Panel Members Appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (2014 aJNC8 Report) and the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline were the first to recommend CCBs or thiazide-type diuretics rather than renin-angiotensin system blockers as initial therapy in NHB. We assessed the temporal relationship of these recommendations on self-reported CCB or thiazide-type diuretics monotherapy by NHB and NHW adults with hypertension absent compelling indications for β-blockers or renin-angiotensin system blockers in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2015 to 2018 versus 2007 to 2012 (after versus before 2014 aJNC8 Report). CCB or thiazide-type diuretics monotherapy was unchanged in NHW adults (17.1% versus 18.1%, P = 0.711) and insignificantly higher after 2014 among NHB adults (43.7% versus 38.2%, P = 0.204), although CCB monotherapy increased (29.5% versus 21.0%, P = 0.021) and renin-angiotensin system blocker monotherapy fell (44.5% versus 31.0%, P = 0.008). Although evidence-based CCB monotherapy increased among NHB adults in 2015 to 2018, hypertension control declined as untreated hypertension and monotherapy increased. While a gap between recommended and actual monotherapy persists, evidence-based monotherapy appears insufficient to improve hypertension control in NHB adults, especially given evidence for worsening therapeutic inertia. Initiating treatment with single-pill combinations and timely therapeutic intensification when required to control hypertension are evidence-based, race-neutral options for improving hypertension control among NHB adults.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy are recommended first-line options from thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence "supports 4 classes of first-line agents," and a meta-analysis reported "50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals," while "all other antihypertensive agents are considered secondary" and "BBs were less effective than first-line antihypertensive classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications."

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^c0509e48]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians are encouraged to take an individualized approach when treating hypertension in patients of African ancestry, but little is known about why the individual patient may respond well to calcium blockers and diuretics, but generally has an attenuated response to drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system and to β-adrenergic blockers. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the factors associated with the differential drug response of patients of African ancestry to antihypertensive drug therapy.

Methods

Using the methodology of the systematic reviews narrative synthesis approach, we sought for published or unpublished studies that could explain the differential clinical efficacy of antihypertensive drugs in patients of African ancestry. PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS, African Index Medicus and the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency databases were searched without language restriction from their inception through June 2012.

Results

We retrieved 3,763 papers, and included 72 reports that mainly considered the 4 major classes of antihypertensive drugs, calcium blockers, diuretics, drugs that interfere with the renin-angiotensin system and β-adrenergic blockers. Pharmacokinetics, plasma renin and genetic polymorphisms did not well predict the response of patients of African ancestry to antihypertensive drugs. An emerging view that low nitric oxide and high creatine kinase may explain individual responses to antihypertensive drugs unites previous observations, but currently clinical data are very limited.

Conclusion

Available data are inconclusive regarding why patients of African ancestry display the typical response to antihypertensive drugs. In lieu of biochemical or pharmacogenomic parameters, self-defined African ancestry seems the best available predictor of individual responses to antihypertensive drugs.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^e1679b84]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

African American hypertension with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — AASK and ALLHAT findings and add-on diuretic rationale are summarized. In the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), ACEIs were found to be more effective than beta-blockers or LA DHP CCBs in slowing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline among African American patients with proteinuria, and the AASK trial would suggest that African Americans with CKD should be placed on an ACEI, but the ALLHAT study reported that chlorthalidone was superior to lisinopril for CVD outcomes in African Americans; therefore, for African American patients with CKD on monotherapy with an ACEI or an ARB, the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic would be appropriate as additional therapy, and providers may refer to the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Kidney Disease for further discussion of use of an ACEI or ARB in patients with CKD.

### WITHDRAWN: effect of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure in blacks [^d92cdaf6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Black people have a greater prevalence of elevated blood pressure leading to excess morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To systematically review the effects of different antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure black adults with elevated blood pressure.

Search Strategy

Medline, Embase, LILACS, African Index Medicus, the Cochrane Library November 2003; Pubmed September 2003 to March 2004. Searches were conducted without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of drugs versus placebo (blood pressure outcomes) or versus placebo or other drugs (morbidity and mortality outcomes).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data unblinded. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Authors were contacted twice to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Full reports or abstracts from more than 2900 references of papers yielded 30 trials considering 53 interventions with 8 classes of antihypertensive drugs in 20,006 black patients from Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States of America, aged 18 to > 80 years. In one large trial the main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between initial treatment drug classes when drugs were added to reach goal blood pressures. However, the comparison ACE Inhibitors vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for stroke 1.40 [1.17 to 1.68]; combined CHD 1.15 [1.02 to 1.30] and combined CVD 1.19 [1.09 to 1.30] and the comparison alpha blocker vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for combined CVD 1.40 [1.25 to 1.57]. In addition, all comparisons for heart failure favoured diuretic (1.47 [1.24 to 1.74] vs calcium blocker; 1.32 [1.11 to 1.58] vs ACE Inhibitor; and 2.18 [1.73 to 2.74] vs alpha blocker. The results also showed a greater occurrence of diabetes with diuretics. No significant differences were detected between placebo and beta adrenergic blockers in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference [95% CI], -3.52 [-7.50 to 0.46] mm Hg). In addition, ACE inhibitors did not significantly differ from placebo in achievement of goal diastolic blood pressure (risk difference [95% CI], 5% [-10% to 21%]). Calcium blockers, diuretics, centrally acting agents, alpha adrenergic blockers and angiotensin II antagonists were all more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure in the pooled analyses. Only calcium blockers remained effective in all prespecified subgroups, including baseline diastolic blood pressure > 109 mm Hg.

Authors' Conclusions

When first-line drugs from different classes are compared in the treatment of black people, there is no evidence of differential effects on most mortality and morbidity outcomes. Those morbidity differences that were found favoured diuretics. Drugs differ in their ability to reduce blood pressure in black people. Calcium blockers were the only drug class that reduced blood pressure in all subgroups of black people including those with severe hypertension. Beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, alpha blockers and ACE Inhibitors were least good at reducing blood pressure in black adults.

### Resistant hypertension: a clinical perspective [^69c8fc55]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a common clinical entity, defined as suboptimal blood pressure response to multiple therapies after excluding medication nonadherence and secondary forms of hypertension. Patients with resistant hypertension generally share several comorbidities. Resistant hypertension is more common in individuals of African descent. Blood pressure should be optimized using multiple strategies, including lifestyle changes and single-pill combination therapies, with the aim of reducing cardiovascular events while reducing side effects from using antihypertensive therapy. A renin/aldosterone-based diagnostic and treatment approach will help tailor therapy. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or amiloride as appropriate is favored.

African American hypertension — angioedema risk with renin–angiotensin agents versus other classes is highlighted. The Work Group noted the potential for harm with an ACEI in African American patients due to an increased risk for angioedema reported to be up to five times greater than in white patients; in ALLHAT, angioedema as a serious adverse event was more frequent in African American ACEI recipients (0.72%) versus non-African American patients (0.31%) and more frequent than in African American patients receiving a thiazide-type diuretic (0.04%) or a LA DHP CCB (0.06%); per FDA product information, angioedema has been reported rarely in patients treated with an ARB.

### Efficacy and safety of a four-drug, quarter-dose treatment for hypertension: the QUARTET USA randomized trial [^e55b0925]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than 1 billion adults have hypertension globally. Despite widespread availability of generic blood pressure lowering drugs for decades, hypertension control rates (defined as a blood pressure < 140/ < 90 mm Hg) remain persistently low (< 50%) among adults in the United States. Control rates are even lower (< 25%) when accounting for newer, lower blood pressure targets (defined as a blood pressure < 130/ < 80 mm Hg) recommended by national and international clinical practice guidelines. Hypertension is more prevalent in racially and ethnically minoritized individuals, in whom control rates are also lower than other groups. Most patients with hypertension are initially treated with a single blood pressure lowering drug that is titrated up over multiple, monthly office visits with additional medications added sequentially. Therapeutic inertia contributes to persistently low hypertension control rates and has not improved. Thus, a new approach is needed. New strategies are especially important among low-income individuals who seek care within federally qualified health centers, where the burden of hypertension is high and control rates are lower than the general population.
