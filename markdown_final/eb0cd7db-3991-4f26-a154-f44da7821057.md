## Question

Can immodoum increase potassium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "immodoum" can increase potassium levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what drug "immodoum" refers to and confirm whether it appears in the provided sources. Then, I should review which medications and mechanisms are actually documented to raise serum potassium. Next, I will consider whether antidiarrheal agents like loperamide have any plausible pathway to cause hyperkalemia. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and outline caveats, monitoring, and when to suspect other causes of hyperkalemia based on the references provided [^1157By8d].

> Let me first confirm the medication identity; "immodoum" does not appear in the provided documents, and "Wait, let me verify… " the closest match by spelling and common use is Imodium, the brand name for loperamide, an over-the-counter antidiarrheal agent, although I should acknowledge the possibility of a regional brand or a discontinued product that is not captured here [^116uEiHT].

> Next, I should review what the documents say about drugs that increase potassium; the consistent, well-documented culprits are potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone and eplerenone, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, direct renin inhibitors, NSAIDs, and agents like trimethoprim and tolvaptan, with additive risk from exogenous potassium salts and salt substitutes, whereas "Hold on, I should verify" that none of the provided sources list loperamide among these drug classes [^117PoTZA] [^113BaoYt] [^1117ZdWj] [^115VmnK9] [^113uFQi8] [^112NZoGD] [^114m1r4B].

> I will now examine the antidiarrheal context; diarrhea commonly causes potassium loss and hypokalemia, and "Wait, let me verify… " the provided materials discuss diarrhea in the context of potassium depletion rather than potassium retention, while the mechanism of loperamide is peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor agonism that slows intestinal transit without a recognized effect on aldosterone signaling or renal potassium excretion in these sources [^116uEiHT].

> Let me think about pathophysiology; sustained hyperkalemia arises from decreased renal excretion, transcellular shifts out of cells, and, less commonly in isolation, increased intake, so I should confirm whether loperamide fits any of these pathways, and "Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions… " because on review it neither impairs GFR or distal sodium delivery nor causes acidemia or other shifts, nor does it contribute potassium load in these references [^114dKtnY] [^1157By8d].

> Hmm, wait a minute… at first glance I wondered if opioid effects could theoretically suppress renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity and retain potassium, but let me reconsider; there is no supporting signal for loperamide in the provided materials among the drugs that raise serum potassium, whereas classic teaching and these sources instead emphasize RAAS inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, and trimethoprim as the principal medication-related drivers of hyperkalemia here [^115VmnK9] [^117PoTZA] [^113BaoYt] [^112NZoGD].

> I should synthesize the evidence-based conclusion; based solely on the provided documents, there is no evidence that "immodoum" (interpreted as Imodium/loperamide) increases serum potassium, and in fact treating diarrhea often mitigates potassium loss rather than causing retention, while unrelated comparators like inhaled beta-agonists are documented here to lower potassium, reinforcing that drug effects on potassium are mechanism-specific and not shared by antidiarrheals in these sources [^116uEiHT] [^114xC8hQ].

> Important caveats: I need to ensure I state that the reference set is not a comprehensive pharmacopeia, so absence of mention is not absolute proof; clinical hyperkalemia is multifactorial and is strongly influenced by renal function, concomitant RAAS blockade, NSAIDs, potassium supplements or salt substitutes, and acute illness, so I should double-check for these contributors and monitor per guideline recommendations when risk is present [^116NkTYS] [^115VmnK9] [^111XW4c8] [^114ndiGF].

> Final check and clinical take-away: there is no signal in the provided literature that Imodium/loperamide increases potassium, so if hyperkalemia is observed clinically, I would first confirm it is real (exclude pseudohyperkalemia), then review kidney function, acid-base status, diet, and higher-risk medications, and manage according to guideline-based monitoring and mitigation strategies; if uncertainty persists about a non-indexed brand or formulation, I should confirm with a pharmacist or a comprehensive drug database [^114dKtnY] [^116EoAM1] [^116NkTYS].

No, loperamide (Imodium) does **not increase potassium levels**; it is more likely to prevent or correct hypokalemia by reducing gastrointestinal potassium losses through diarrhea control [^111QJpsS]. There is **no evidence that loperamide causes hyperkalemia**, and it should be used cautiously in patients with existing electrolyte imbalances or renal impairment, with serum potassium monitored as clinically indicated [^116z2yMe] [^113YChVW].

---

## Pharmacological properties of loperamide

Loperamide is a synthetic opioid that **acts on peripheral μ-opioid receptors** in the gut, slowing motility and increasing water and electrolyte absorption. It has **minimal systemic absorption** and negligible central nervous system penetration due to P-glycoprotein efflux at the blood-brain barrier, which limits central opioid effects.

---

## Mechanism of action and potassium balance

Loperamide's primary effect is to **reduce gastrointestinal motility**, thereby decreasing fluid and electrolyte losses in diarrhea. Potassium homeostasis is maintained by a balance between dietary intake, gastrointestinal losses, renal excretion, and cellular shifts [^116xnthA]. Diarrhea can cause significant potassium loss, leading to hypokalemia [^111QJpsS]. By reducing diarrhea, loperamide **decreases gastrointestinal potassium loss**, potentially stabilizing or slightly increasing serum potassium levels in patients with diarrhea-induced hypokalemia. However, this effect is indirect and is not associated with hyperkalemia [^116z2yMe].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding loperamide and potassium levels

There is **limited clinical evidence** directly linking loperamide to significant changes in serum potassium levels; moreover, most available literature and clinical guidelines do not mention it as a medication associated with hyperkalemia or meaningful potassium elevation. A review of clinical guidelines and pharmacological references indicates that loperamide is **not listed among medications known to cause hyperkalemia** [^116z2yMe]; instead, medications such as potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, and certain antibiotics are commonly associated with increased potassium levels [^114B3ziV].

---

## Potential indirect effects on potassium levels

While loperamide itself does not directly increase potassium levels, certain indirect scenarios could theoretically lead to hyperkalemia. For example, **severe constipation or ileus** from excessive loperamide use can cause bowel obstruction; in rare cases, obstruction-related cellular breakdown may release potassium and raise serum levels, though this is extremely uncommon and not a typical clinical scenario. In patients with **renal impairment**, reduced potassium excretion means any medication that causes significant constipation or bowel obstruction could theoretically worsen hyperkalemia risk; however, loperamide does not directly impair renal potassium excretion [^111XW4c8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not specifically address loperamide** in the context of hyperkalemia. General recommendations for managing hyperkalemia include:

- **Identifying and discontinuing medications**: Known to increase potassium levels, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and NSAIDs [^112sDH5S].

- **Monitoring serum potassium levels**: Regularly in patients at risk of hyperkalemia, particularly those with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or diabetes [^116NkTYS].

- **Dietary management**: Implementing dietary potassium restrictions in patients with persistent hyperkalemia [^111GoG94].

Loperamide is **not mentioned in these guidelines** as a medication requiring discontinuation or caution due to hyperkalemia risk.

---

## Clinical implications and patient management

Given the available evidence, loperamide does not significantly increase potassium levels and is **not associated with hyperkalemia**. However, clinicians should remain vigilant for potential indirect effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those at risk of severe constipation or bowel obstruction. Patients with chronic diarrhea-induced hypokalemia **may benefit from loperamide**, as it can help stabilize potassium levels by reducing gastrointestinal losses [^111QJpsS]. Regular monitoring of serum potassium is recommended in patients with underlying electrolyte imbalances or renal impairment [^116NkTYS].

---

## Conclusion

Loperamide (Imodium) **does not directly increase potassium levels** and is not associated with hyperkalemia [^116z2yMe]. Its primary effect is to **reduce gastrointestinal potassium loss** by controlling diarrhea, potentially stabilizing or slightly increasing potassium levels in patients with diarrhea-induced hypokalemia [^111QJpsS]. Clinicians should monitor serum potassium levels in patients with pre-existing electrolyte imbalances or renal impairment, but loperamide itself does not pose a significant risk of hyperkalemia [^113YChVW].

### Effect of nebulized albuterol on serum lactate and potassium in healthy subjects [^114xC8hQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The objectives were to determine if nebulized albuterol causes an increase in the serum lactate level compared to placebo and, secondarily, to confirm that albuterol decreases serum potassium levels compared to placebo in patients with normokalemia.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers were assigned to receive either 10 mg of nebulized albuterol or placebo (nebulized saline) over 1 hour. Serum lactate was measured prior to treatment and at 30 and 70 minutes after the start of treatment. Serum potassium level was measured prior to treatment and at 70 minutes. The primary outcome was the degree of change in lactate level. The secondary outcome was the degree of change in potassium level.

- **Results**: In the 14 subjects who received albuterol, the mean increase in lactate was 0.77 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 1.02 mmol/L), and the mean decrease in potassium level was 0.5 mEq/L (95% CI = -0.72 to -0.28 mEq/L). Among the subjects who received placebo, the lactate level decreased by 0.15 mmol/L (95% CI = -0.39 to 0.09 mmol/L) and there was no change in potassium level (0.0 mEq/L [95% CI = -0.21 to 0.21 mEq/L]). These differences are statistically significant (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively).

- **Conclusion**: Nebulized albuterol increases lactate levels and decreases potassium levels in healthy adults.

Humans are prone to sodium overload and potassium depletion, which are crucial factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death. Avoiding hypokalemia is beneficial in various cardiovascular disease states, such as acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hypertension. The evidence that underscores the significance of potassium homeostasis in cardiovascular disease is reviewed, along with possible mechanisms that explain the benefits of potassium. Additionally, targets for serum potassium concentration are suggested.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^116uEiHT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include:

- **History evaluation**: A careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea.
- **Physical examination**: Including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate.
- **Electrolyte measurement**: Measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes.

Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality among unselected cardiac intensive care unit patients [^114ndiGF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Although the association between hyperkalemia and adverse outcomes in this population may be explained by direct harmful effects of elevated potassium levels, we hypothesize that elevated potassium levels more likely serve as a marker to identify high-risk patients with higher illness severity or more severe comorbidities. Potassium is essential for normal cardiac myocyte function, including impulse conduction and coordinated myocardial contraction. Disturbances in potassium levels can predispose patients to arrhythmia, which may account for the increased mortality rate and more frequent arrhythmia diagnoses seen in our patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. However, we observed an increase in mortality at mildly elevated potassium levels below those usually associated with direct cardiac toxicity, indicating that arrhythmia alone is not the primary reason for the increase in mortality seen in our population.

Our patients with hypokalemia and hyperkalemia had higher illness severity; patients with hyperkalemia also had worse renal function. This implies that potassium abnormalities identify sicker patients with increased risk of mortality, and the effects of hypokalemia on mortality appeared to be mediated primarily by illness severity. Hyperkalemia remained associated with higher short‐ and long‐term mortality after adjustment for illness severity and markers of renal function, implying that hyperkalemia may identify patients with more dangerous forms of renal dysfunction. Our observed relationships between AKI severity and the mortality effects of these electrolyte disturbances underscore the complex interaction between potassium levels and patient outcomes.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^111XW4c8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article, we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and consequences of hyperkalemia, highlighting aspects that are particularly relevant for clinical practice.

Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, explicable only in part by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Sodium as an important regulator of immunometabolism [^116Hr5iG]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Earlier, all was clear. The intracellular composition (muscle, for instance) exhibited a sodium concentration of approximately 10 mmol/L, potassium concentration of approximately 160 mmol/L, and magnesium concentration of approximately 35 mmol/L. Anions consisted of protein and phosphate. In the extracellular plasma water, the corresponding concentrations were sodium at approximately 151 mmol/L and potassium at approximately 4.3 mmol/L. In humans, electrolytes were distributed within the total body water of about 40 liters; two-thirds were inside cells and one-third outside cells. Sodium was mostly exchangeable and extracellular, although some was deposited in bone, the fate of which was largely unclear but not so exchangeable.

By the 1970s, the regulation of these constituents had been well established, and balance concepts were sufficiently accepted to support pressure natriuresis of blood pressure regulation and our understanding of salt and water balance. These ideas, and the supportive body of evidence, served us clinically well and were convincing. A valuable clinical tool was the knowledge generated by Edelman et al. and Birkenfeld et al. They studied the relationship between plasma sodium, exchangeable sodium, exchangeable potassium, and total body water. Their insights showed us that by calculating effective free water clearance, clinicians could predict whose plasma sodium was going up or down and even at what rate the changes would occur. As a result, there was a fairly clear understanding of total body water, electrolyte contents, plasma concentrations, and subsequent speculations on blood pressure regulation.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular risk factors and disease: Systematic review and meta-analyses [^113UUt58]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

This review is the first to attempt to determine an optimum level of potassium intake for affecting health outcomes. Moderate and high-quality evidence showed that a higher potassium intake of 90–120 mmol/day reduced blood pressure and was associated with a lower risk of incident stroke. Intake above 120 mmol/day did not seem to have any additional benefit. However, the evidence from the randomized controlled trials and cohort studies in adults was limited in that it did not identify a precise optimal level of potassium intake for maximum health benefits.

If a person consumes 90 mmol/day or more of potassium and the WHO recommended sodium intake of less than 2 g/day, their intake would have a molar ratio of sodium to potassium of approximately one to one, a ratio considered beneficial for health. A subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled trials to explore whether different levels of sodium intake influenced the effect of potassium on blood pressure showed no statistically significant difference in the effect estimates among subgroups based on sodium intake. However, the results suggest that potassium may be more effective in reducing blood pressure at higher levels of sodium consumption, consistent with previous findings.

The largest benefit was detected when sodium intake was more than 4 g/day, which is the intake of most populations globally, so increased potassium intake should benefit most people in most countries. However, we also found a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure with increased potassium when sodium in- [Text appears to be truncated]

### Potassium chloride for oral solution [^113gJdZZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Administration and monitoring**: If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes (including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium), electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate. Dilute the potassium chloride for oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Take with meals or immediately after eating.

- **Adult dosing**: For the treatment of hypokalemia, the daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq, given in 2 to 5 divided doses. Limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period. For maintenance or prophylaxis, the typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize the dose based upon serum potassium levels. Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of the use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is unclear.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: Foe or friend [^115ALSKw]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a frequent and sometimes life-threatening condition that may be associated with arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure (HF). High potassium levels in HF represent both a direct risk for cardiovascular complications and an indirect biomarker of the severity of the underlying disease, reflecting neurohormonal activation and renal dysfunction. Evaluating the prevalence and significance of hyperkalemia in HF patients is essential for optimizing the use of potassium-sparing agents, such as renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which represent a well-established cornerstone and life-saving therapy.

In this review, we discuss recent findings and concepts related to the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms, and implications of hyperkalemia, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to counteract it in patients with HF. The balance between optimizing life-saving potassium-sparing medication and minimizing hyperkalemia-associated risk is much needed in patients with HF. Although older potassium-binding agents are associated with serious adverse events, novel potassium-binding drugs are effective in lowering potassium levels and are generally well tolerated.

Novel potassium-binding drugs, such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may help to optimize therapy in HF and achieve guideline-recommended doses. Hyperkalemia is common in HF patients and is associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^111ziYaz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

An unresolved issue is whether predialysis hyperkalaemia or a high dialysate–serum potassium gradient is the most important risk factor for adverse outcomes in haemodialysis patients (Figure 1). The most commonly used dialysate potassium concentration varies widely by country, with some countries using predominantly 1–2 mmol/L and others using 3–4 mmol/L. Pun and Middleton reviewed nine retrospective studies that analyzed the association between the dialysate potassium concentration and patient outcomes, typically sudden cardiac death or all-cause mortality. Although five studies identified an increased risk of adverse outcomes with lower dialysate potassium (defined as < 2 or < 3 mmol/L), two studies found no association, and two studies found associations that favored lower dialysate potassium.

Using sales data, Mercadal et al. show that, over time, a lower dialysate potassium concentration was being used less frequently. For example, the percentage of centers using < 2 mmol/L decreased from 57% to 49%, whereas the use of 3 mmol/L or ≥ 4 mmol/L increased from 89% to 91% and from 3% to 13%, respectively. This trend seems to echo the recent literature, in which most studies linked low dialysate potassium to an increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, this was not a universal finding, as Mercadal et al. also showed that the occasional use of dialysate potassium < 2 mmol/L was associated with lower mortality compared with no use. This heterogeneity seems to suggest that it is impossible to select one ideal dialysate potassium concentration.

### Derangements of potassium [^115kCKyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and gastrointestinal systems, along with shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces, cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended to do so when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes.

Treatment of hyperkalemia includes:

- **Cardiac membrane stabilization**: Administer intravenous calcium.
- **Intracellular potassium shift**: Use insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly.
- **Dialysis**: Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexalate are recommended.

Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of oral or intravenous repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A pooled analysis [^1121x4me]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of mild hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population were slightly more frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. As expected, these episodes were more common in patients receiving loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics both in patients taking dapagliflozin and placebo, with no relevant difference between the groups. Few adverse events (AEs) of hypokalemia were reported in either group (0.4% with dapagliflozin vs. 0.2% with placebo) and did not lead to discontinuation. There were no reports of severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population.

A trend towards increased hypokalemia risk could be consistent with dapagliflozin's mild diuretic effect; however, a lack of any difference between the groups when used with typical diuretics is both reassuring and somewhat unexpected. Renal potassium excretion is a complex process that is primarily determined by the serum aldosterone concentration and driven by the sodium concentration in the distal nephron. Due to the co-transportation of sodium and glucose, transient increases in urinary sodium excretion are seen for a few days upon initiation of dapagliflozin, after which levels tend to normalize. Thus, unlike typical diuretics, long-term treatment with dapagliflozin should not affect sodium delivery to the distal nephron. However, it should be acknowledged that in a previous small exploratory study, dapagliflozin treatment increased median plasma renin activity relative to placebo to approximately a quarter of the hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg effect, and increased median serum aldosterone.

### Effects of potassium or sodium supplementation on mineral homeostasis: A controlled dietary intervention study [^116tAEjw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

In this post hoc analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial with dietary control, both potassium and sodium supplementation reduced FGF23 levels. During potassium supplementation, this reduction was accompanied by a concomitant increase of renal phosphate reabsorption and plasma phosphate levels without an effect on PTH or 25(OH)-vitamin D3. In contrast, during sodium supplementation, the reduction of FGF23 was accompanied by a decrease in plasma phosphate. Furthermore, potassium supplementation decreased fractional calcium excretion, whereas sodium supplementation led to an increase in urinary and fractional calcium excretion. Together, these findings suggest that sodium and potassium intake have differential effects on mineral metabolism, although the underlying mechanisms seem complex and are not fully elucidated by the study.

In the original study, four weeks of potassium supplementation decreased blood pressure, which was mitigated by vasopressin, stimulation of renin and aldosterone, and an increased heart rate. The study shows that higher potassium intake, independent of phosphate or protein intake, decreased FGF23 levels. This is consistent with findings from previous studies showing that individuals consuming a potassium-poor Western diet display higher FGF23 levels and that potassium excretion was inversely associated with FGF23. Effects of potassium on phosphate metabolism have been reported previously in preclinical and clinical studies. Potassium supplementation was shown to stimulate phosphate reabsorption in rats.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: A dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115fMGN5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

By using a new "1-stage" model that allows for inclusion of trials with only two levels of exposure, as is the case for most RCTs, we detected a dose-response curve for the blood pressure (BP) effects of potassium that was curvilinear across a wide range of treatment differences and absolute values of potassium exposure. This may have major implications in the risk assessment of potassium supplementation. Our finding of a U-shaped relationship between potassium intake and BP was somewhat unexpected based on previous clinical trial meta-analyses and assessments. Although it confirms previous reports that a minimum dose of potassium is necessary for a BP-lowering effect of potassium supplementation, it also suggests that high doses of potassium may result in a higher level of BP.

The BP-increasing effect of high potassium exposure was observed in both our overall results and the subgroup analyses of participants with hypertension or a normal level of BP, although it was stronger in the former group. The optimal levels of "supplemental" (net difference between the two arms) and overall (achieved) potassium excretion appeared to be 30 and 90 to 130 mmol/d (1200 and 3500–5100 mg/d), respectively. The corresponding intakes would be higher (i.e. by using the generally adopted conversion factor of 1.3, approximately 1500 mg/d of supplemental potassium and an overall intake of 4500–6500 mg/d). However, these estimates are based on a heterogeneous population mainly composed of adults with hypertension, and therefore may not necessarily represent the general population.

### Dexamethasone [^114bG8do]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Drug interactions are important considerations when administering dexamethasone:

- **Aminoglutethimide**: Aminoglutethimide may diminish adrenal suppression by corticosteroids.

- **Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents**: When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (e.g. amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for the development of hypokalemia. In addition, there have been cases reported in which the concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.

- **Antibiotics**: Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance (see drug interactions: CYP 3A4 inducers, CYP 3A4 inhibitors, and CYP 3A4 substrates).

- **Anticholinesterases**: Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

- **Anticoagulants, oral**: Co-administration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.

- **Antidiabetics**: Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.

- **Antitubercular drugs**: Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.

- **Cholestyramine**: Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.

In conclusion, this is the first meta-analysis to investigate the effects of potassium supplementation on BP levels with a specific focus on the dose-response relationship. We found evidence for a nonlinear association and for effect modification in those with hypertension, taking antihypertensive medication, or having a high sodium intake. Our findings for the effects of potassium intake on BP may explain, at least in part, the recently observed U-shaped associations between serum potassium levels and risk of adverse outcomes in observational studies. They also support European and US dietary recommendations for potassium intake and underscore the need to carefully address and manage potassium intake within comprehensive efforts to prevent CVD in both the general population and high-risk subgroups.

### Potassium and its discontents: New insight, new treatments [^112XawKj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is common in patients with impaired kidney function or those who take drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Over the past decade, substantial advances have been made in understanding how the body controls potassium excretion, which may lead to improved standards of care for these patients. Renal potassium disposition is primarily handled by a short segment of the nephron, comprising part of the distal convoluted tubule and the connecting tubule. Regulation results from the interplay between aldosterone and plasma potassium.

When dietary potassium intake and plasma potassium are low, the electroneutral sodium chloride cotransporter is activated, leading to salt retention. This effect limits sodium delivery to potassium secretory segments, thereby limiting potassium losses. In contrast, when dietary potassium intake is high, aldosterone is stimulated, and potassium inhibits the sodium chloride cotransporter. Consequently, more sodium is delivered to potassium secretory segments, primed by aldosterone, resulting in kaliuresis. When these processes are disrupted, hyperkalemia results.

Recently, new agents capable of removing potassium from the body and treating hyperkalemia have been tested in clinical trials. This development suggests that more effective and safer approaches to the prevention and treatment of hyperkalemia may be on the horizon.

- **Lithium**: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**:
	- **Olmesartan medoxomil**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including olmesartan medoxomil) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.
	- **Hydrochlorothiazide**: In some patients, the administration of an NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics. Therefore, monitor blood pressure closely.

- **Dual blockade of the renin angiotensin system**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren can lead to further complications, necessitating close monitoring.

### Regulation of potassium homeostasis [^116xnthA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Potassium is the most abundant cation in the intracellular fluid, and maintaining the proper distribution of potassium across the cell membrane is critical for normal cell function. Long-term maintenance of potassium homeostasis is achieved by alterations in renal excretion of potassium in response to variations in intake. Understanding the mechanism and regulatory influences governing the internal distribution and renal clearance of potassium under normal circumstances can provide a framework for approaching disorders of potassium commonly encountered in clinical practice. This paper reviews key aspects of the normal regulation of potassium metabolism and is designed to serve as a readily accessible review for the well-informed clinician as well as a resource for teaching trainees and medical students.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder, occurring more frequently in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with the use of certain medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by an electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypical presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations with morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia, but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and differing clinical presentations.

Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and the degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia in determining patient outcomes. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: A dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114u8tnJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

The public health implications of our findings of a U-shaped relationship between potassium excretion and blood pressure (BP) levels appear to be considerably more important for a potassium intake that is too "low" rather than too "high". This is particularly relevant in clinical practice, where the risk associated with hyperkalemia presents a different pattern and requires distinct therapeutic approaches. Potassium intake, even in "acculturated" populations with an adequate diet, tends to be lower, and sometimes much lower, than the levels identified and recommended as adequate by risk assessment agencies, public health authorities, and professional societies. Therefore, dietary advice to increase potassium intake is likely to have beneficial effects and result in decreased BP levels in most populations.

On the other hand, some populations, selected subgroups, and particularly certain individuals, such as those with hypertension treated with antihypertensive medication, should be advised not to exceed the optimal potassium intake levels identified in this meta-analysis if they already have a high baseline potassium intake. This guideline may also apply to individuals with low-to-intermediate sodium intake, as our analysis suggests. Individuals with high sodium intake, which is typical in Western populations, may benefit disproportionately from potassium supplementation and may also be more resistant to BP increases following high potassium intake. This suggests an interaction between the two minerals.

### Potassium homeostasis [^112aMnj7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Potassium homeostasis is essential for maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of excitable cells. Yet daily dietary potassium typically far exceeds total extracellular potassium, thus the body has developed elegant strategies to shift potassium into cells promptly following a meal, followed by the efficient excretion of potassium by the kidneys. Potassium excretion depends on adequate kidney perfusion and filtration, sodium delivery to the distal nephron, and aldosterone action on the distal nephron. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia have been associated with an increase in mortality. In this piece, we share five challenging cases to explore normal potassium homeostasis and disorders that can lead to derangements in potassium balance or excretion.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depend on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration.

Treatment initially focuses on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period, and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of non-plant sources of K+.

Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining balance.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

### Potassium chloride [^114Mbv4L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Monitoring the administration of potassium chloride involves adjusting serum potassium levels. For treating hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more frequently, depending on the severity, until they return to normal. For maintenance or prophylaxis, monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually.

- **Treatment considerations**: In cases of potassium depletion accompanied by cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, pay careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, and electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium. Monitor electrocardiograms and assess the patient's clinical status. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as needed.

- **Administration guidelines**: Dilute one pouch of potassium chloride oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water. Take the solution with meals or immediately after eating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. If serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L, consider using intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

The adult dosing for the treatment of hypokalemia ranges from a daily dose of 40 to 100 mEq, administered in 2 to 5 divided doses. Limit each dose to 40 mEq, ensuring the total daily dosage does not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

- **Maintenance or prophylaxis dosing**: A typical dose is 20 mEq per day, individualized based on serum potassium levels.

Research supports potassium replacement in managing digitalis toxicity. In the presence of alkalosis, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit, necessitating careful consideration of potassium replacement use.

### Management of hyperkalemia: An update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels.

Because many such medications, especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represents an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of two new potassium-binding medications for the acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia.

This review article provides an overview of the physiology and pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by the inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life-threatening.

Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta-2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular risk factors and disease: Systematic review and meta-analyses [^111Mrdp7]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials reporting changes in blood lipids showed no significant adverse effect of increased potassium on total cholesterol (mean difference −0.12 (−0.33 to 0.09) mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−0.10 (−0.38 to 0.18) mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (−0.01 (−0.13 to 0.11) mmol/L), or triglyceride concentrations (−0.11 (−0.48 to 0.26) mmol/L). No studies measured urinary catecholamine concentrations. The meta-analyses of three randomized controlled trials reporting plasma catecholamine concentrations detected no effect of increased potassium intake on plasma adrenaline (−3.94 (−9.22 to 1.34) pg/mL) or plasma noradrenaline (−4.32 (−23.78 to 15.13) pg/mL). Three studies measured renal function by serum creatinine, and the meta-analysis showed that increased potassium intake decreased serum creatinine by a non-significant 4.86 (−3.87 to 13.59) µmol/L. No studies reported minor side effects or other potential adverse effects from increased potassium intake.

- **Effect of increased potassium intake on blood lipid concentrations, catecholamine concentrations, and renal function in adults**: The summary of findings, as depicted in several analyses, indicates no significant changes or adverse outcomes related to blood lipid concentrations or catecholamine levels due to increased potassium intake.

In meta-analyses of the three randomized controlled trials with five comparisons in children, increased potassium intake decreased systolic blood pressure by a non-significant 0.28 (−0.49 to 1.05) mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.92 (−0.16 to 2.00) mm Hg.

### Potassium intake: The Cinderella electrolyte [^113dEA5T]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Dietary guidelines recommend intake targets for some essential minerals based on observational and experimental evidence relating mineral intake levels to health outcomes. For the prevention of cardiovascular disease, reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake are the principal tools. While reducing sodium intake has received the greatest public health priority, emerging evidence suggests that increasing potassium intake may be a more important target for cardiovascular prevention. Increased potassium intake reduces blood pressure and mitigates the hypertensive effects of excess sodium intake. The recent large Phase III SSaSS trial reported that increasing potassium intake (and reducing sodium intake) in populations with low potassium intake and high sodium intake, through salt substitution (25% KCl, 75% NaCl), reduces the risk of stroke in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. As key sources of potassium intake include fruit, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, higher potassium intake may be associated with healthy dietary patterns. The review makes the case that increasing potassium intake might represent a more advantageous dietary strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Future research should focus on addressing the independent effect of potassium supplementation in populations with low or moderate potassium intake and determining effective strategies to increase potassium intake from diet.

It is essential to closely monitor potassium levels in patients receiving RAAS therapy.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: NSAIDs may cause potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin-angiotensin system. Potassium levels should be closely monitored in patients taking concomitant NSAIDs.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A pooled analysis [^113JwUf2]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium level greater than 5.5 mmol/L, is a potentially life-threatening condition that causes increased cardiac depolarization and can lead to rapid electrocardiographic changes and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Conversely, hypokalemia is defined as a serum potassium level of less than 3.5 mmol/L (mild) or less than 2.5 mmol/L (severe) and can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Maintaining stable serum potassium values within physiological levels is important because fluctuations in serum potassium are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of hyperkalemia, and diabetes itself is an independent risk factor for this condition. In an outpatient population of patients with diabetes, the prevalence of hyperkalemia has been estimated at 4%, whereas, in the general population, it has been estimated to be lower at 0.3%. Diabetes is also associated with a high incidence of renal impairment, which is an additional independent risk factor for hyperkalemia.

- **Antihypertensive medications**: Frequently prescribed to patients with diabetes, these medications can increase serum potassium. For example, medications that reduce renal potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are known to have this effect.

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A pooled analysis [^112AL756]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

The risk of hyperkalemia is greater in patients with diabetes, which may be partly attributed to hyperosmolarity caused by hyperglycemia, resulting in a shift in potassium out of cells. Impaired elimination of potassium can also increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with reduced renal function or those treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Monitoring potassium levels is an important consideration in patients with diabetes, particularly as these patients often have hypertension and may be treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or potassium-sparing diuretics, making them more susceptible to hyperkalemia. Likewise, potassium monitoring may be important in patients with renal impairment, who are also considered to be at high risk of hyperkalemia. Clinicians should balance the opposing risks of avoiding hyperkalemia and causing hypokalemia, or vice versa. For example, potassium-sparing diuretics have been shown to prevent diuretic-induced hypokalemia but are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Furthermore, combinations of drugs with an associated risk of hyperkalemia (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics) or hypokalemia (e.g. thiazides or loop diuretics) may rapidly precipitate serious serum electrolyte abnormalities. Therefore, knowledge of the presence or absence of an effect on potassium homeostasis with antidiabetic drugs is important. Previous studies indicate that dapagliflozin does not affect potassium levels when taken in combination with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides, or loop diuretics.

Potassium ions participate in several essential physiological processes, including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter, while the normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent, and under steady-state conditions, the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Based on published literature, the rate of absorption and urinary excretion of potassium from KCl oral solution was higher during the first few hours after dosing relative to modified release KCl products. The bioavailability of potassium, as measured by the cumulative urinary excretion of K+ over a 24-hour post-dose period, is similar for KCl solution and modified release products.

### Inspra [^113BaoYt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hyperkalemia is a concern for patients with decreased renal function, diabetes, proteinuria, or those taking ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. These patients are at an increased risk. It is important to monitor serum potassium levels and adjust the dose as necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Hyperkalemia risk management**: The risk of hyperkalemia is higher in patients with impaired renal function, proteinuria, or diabetes, as well as those concomitantly treated with ACEs, ARBs, NSAIDs, and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Minimize this risk by selecting patients carefully and ensuring ongoing monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor patients for hyperkalemia until the effect of Inspra is established. Patients who develop hyperkalemia (5.5–5.9 mEq/L) may continue Inspra therapy with proper dose adjustment. Dose reduction can decrease potassium levels. For patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors that cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of eplerenone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^113sjWHt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

This editorial has focused on the effects of potassium interventions on the predialysis serum potassium concentration and the dialysate–serum potassium gradient. However, potassium is primarily an intracellular cation, where it plays a crucial role in cellular function. Therefore, it is also important to consider how interventions change intracellular potassium concentration and total body potassium, and how this relates to outcomes.

Measurement of intracellular electrolyte concentrations and whole-body counting of naturally radioactive potassium can provide insight into the 'black box' of the intracellular compartment. Unexpectedly, such measurements reveal that patients with CKD or patients on haemodialysis often have a total body potassium deficit, despite their tendency to develop hyperkalaemia. For example, the intracellular potassium concentration and the resting membrane potential were lower in muscle cells of patients with CKD compared with healthy subjects. The initiation of haemodialysis normalized intracellular potassium, but did not improve the resting membrane potential.

Total body potassium is up to 10% lower in haemodialysis patients compared with control subjects. When patients transition from predialysis care to haemodialysis, total body potassium was restored in some patients, whereas in others it decreased. Preliminary data suggest that total body potassium depletion is also associated with increased mortality.

### Aldactone [^117PoTZA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drugs and supplements increasing serum potassium**: Concomitant administration of Aldactone with potassium supplementation or drugs that can increase potassium may lead to severe hyperkalemia. In general, discontinue potassium supplementation in heart failure patients who start Aldactone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Check serum potassium levels when ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is altered in patients receiving Aldactone. Examples of drugs that can increase potassium include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), heparin and low molecular weight heparin, and trimethoprim.

- **Lithium**: Like other diuretics, Aldactone reduces the renal clearance of lithium, thus increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. Monitor lithium levels periodically when Aldactone is coadministered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: In some patients, the administration of an NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of diuretics. Therefore, when Aldactone and NSAIDs are used concomitantly, monitor closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Digoxin**: Spironolactone and its metabolites interfere with radioimmunoassays for digoxin and increase the apparent exposure to digoxin. It is unknown to what extent, if any, spironolactone may increase actual digoxin exposure. In patients taking concomitant digoxin, use an assay that does not interact with spironolactone.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is impaired. It can lead to adverse outcomes, particularly due to severe cardiac arrhythmias, and can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium-rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents, patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate, are effective treatment options for hyperkalemia. The use of these agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely in high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients who would benefit from diets or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium. This indicates that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

### Carospir [^115iksbM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug interaction studies**: Concomitant administration of CAROSPIR with potassium supplementation, salt substitutes containing potassium, a diet rich in potassium, or drugs that can increase potassium, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), heparin, and low molecular weight heparin, may lead to severe hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Lithium**: CAROSPIR reduces the renal clearance of lithium, inducing a high risk of lithium toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: In some patients, the administration of an NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Acetylsalicylic acid**: A single dose of 600 mg of acetylsalicylic acid inhibited the natriuretic effect of spironolactone, which was hypothesized to be due to inhibition of tubular secretion of canrenone, causing decreased effectiveness of spironolactone [see Drug Interactions (7.6)].

- **In vitro studies**: Spironolactone is an irreversible inhibitor for CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5.

- **Digoxin**: CAROSPIR increased the Cmax and AUC0–96 of a single dose of digoxin by 55% and 18% compared to digoxin administered alone. Renal clearance of digoxin decreased by approximately 11%, and the tmax and terminal t1/2 of digoxin were not changed when coadministered with spironolactone [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1157By8d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article, we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance to clinical practice.

Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, which is only partly explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis.

Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Potassium chloride [^111RuL44]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range due to the potential for hyperkalemia development. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently, and renal function should be assessed periodically.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly concerning potassium replacement, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend establishing adequate renal function with a urine output of approximately 0.5 mL/kg/h. Monitoring serum potassium levels is essential for potassium replacement:

- **Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L**: Faster potassium replacement will require central venous access.
- **Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L**: Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to maintain serum potassium levels between 4–5 mmol/L.
- **Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L**: Start insulin administration, but do not administer potassium. Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.

### Klor-Con [^111FpuNh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if they are on RAAS inhibitors or NSAIDs, should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently, and renal function should be assessed periodically.

### Potassium chloride [^114B3ziV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Potassium-sparing diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are of particular concern.

- **Potassium-sparing diuretics**: Use with potassium-sparing diuretics can produce severe hyperkalemia. Avoid concomitant use.

- **Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors**: Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren, produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: NSAIDs may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin-angiotensin system. Closely monitor potassium in patients on concomitant NSAIDs.

### Potassium disorders: Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^116z2yMe]. American Family Physician (2015). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia is associated with varied conditions and treatments, including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, tumor lysis syndrome, palpitations, and cardiac arrhythmias. Additional symptoms and conditions may include decreased P wave amplitude, Addison's disease, muscle cramps, increased QRS duration, elevated serum potassium, recent diarrheal illness, and the use of epithelial sodium channel blockers.

Often characterized by increased T wave amplitude and bradycardia, hyperkalemia can also result from recent excessive vomiting, use of ACE inhibitors (ACEis), absent P waves, nausea, and the use of trimethoprim. Peaked T waves, vomiting, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diabetes mellitus, and the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are also noted contributors. Patients may experience chest pain, ascending paralysis, AV block, sickle cell disease, increased PR interval, hyperreflexia, myocardial infarction, digoxin use, chronic kidney disease (CKD), ileus, muscle weakness, and P wave flattening.

Additional associations include rhabdomyolysis, heart failure (HF), cardiac arrest, direct renin inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, diarrhea, alcohol use disorder, acute kidney injury (AKI), traumatic injury, and paresthesia.
