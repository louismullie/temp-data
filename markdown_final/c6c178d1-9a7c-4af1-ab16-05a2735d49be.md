## Question

Can ADHD medications cause tics in a 9-year-old?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ADHD medications can cause tics in a 9-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized evidence on stimulants and tic risk. Then, I should verify how this reconciles with FDA label warnings. Next, I will consider baseline tic risk in ADHD, typical age of tic onset, and the likelihood of temporal confounding. After that, I need to differentiate stimulant versus nonstimulant classes with respect to tics. Then, I should outline a practical management algorithm if tics emerge during treatment. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion tailored to a 9-year-old and note rare exceptions and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence base before drawing conclusions. The 2015 meta-analysis of 22 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials including 2,385 children with ADHD found that new-onset or worsening tics occurred in 5.7% with psychostimulants versus 6.5% with placebo; wait, let me verify the effect estimate and p value — yes, the risk ratio was 0.99 with 95% CI 0.78–1.27 and p = 0.962, indicating no increased risk with stimulants compared with placebo, and subgroup analyses by stimulant type, dose, duration, recorder, and age showed no differential risk either [^1115qntn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions just because the RCTs are reassuring; I should review regulatory labeling that often drives clinical caution. FDA labeling for dexmethylphenidate warns about onset or exacerbation of motor and vocal tics and Tourette's, and recommends screening and monitoring for tics, which can influence prescriber behavior; but I need to reconcile that these warnings often derive from spontaneous reports and historical concerns rather than controlled trial signals, and the meta-analysis did not corroborate a causal increase in tics with stimulants under randomized conditions [^1166URtx].

> Next, I should review comorbidity and timing, because misattribution is common. Tic disorders occur in roughly one-fifth of youth with ADHD, and the usual age of tic onset is around 7–8 years, which is later than the emergence of ADHD symptoms; for a 9-year-old, the appearance of tics during ongoing ADHD treatment is statistically likely to be the natural emergence of a comorbid tic disorder rather than a drug effect, so I need to ensure we do not conflate correlation with causation when timing aligns by chance [^116PXjXN].

> I will now examine differences across medication classes because not all ADHD treatments act similarly on tics. Stimulants, based on the meta-analysis, do not increase tic risk on average in controlled settings, whereas alpha-2 adrenergic agonists like guanfacine and clonidine can reduce tic severity and simultaneously help ADHD symptoms; let me double-check one pivotal trial — guanfacine reduced tic severity by about 31% versus placebo in children with comorbid ADHD and tics, supporting its role as an adjunct or alternative when tics are clinically significant [^111adewG].

> Now, I should outline a pragmatic clinical algorithm while keeping self-checks in place. If tics begin immediately after starting or after a dose increase of a stimulant, I should confirm the temporal link and consider a small dose reduction or a brief drug holiday to test for a direct pharmacologic effect; if tics appear after a stable treatment period, I should verify that this likely reflects the natural course of a comorbid tic disorder and generally continue the effective stimulant while adding a tic-targeted treatment such as guanfacine or clonidine and offering Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, avoiding premature discontinuation of the stimulant that controls ADHD impairment [^116PXjXN] [^114xv58J] [^1115qntn].

> But wait, I should also ensure we respect developmental context for a 9-year-old. This is a peak window for tic onset given the maturation of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical motor circuits and the typical waxing–waning course of tics, so an apparent "on-medication" emergence at this age is often coincidental; I should confirm pattern, triggers, and impairment over weeks to months before attributing causality, and I must remember that natural fluctuations can mislead clinicians about treatment effects if assessed too briefly [^1121hA21] [^116PXjXN].

> I need to check for exceptions and rare adverse motor phenomena so I do not overlook outliers. There are rare reports of stimulant-associated hyperkinetic movements such as chorea with amphetamine dose escalation that resolve with discontinuation, which is distinct from tics; this underscores the importance of careful characterization of movements, dose–response probing, and reconsideration of the regimen if an atypical movement disorder clearly emerges [^1136rTtb] [^1166URtx].

> Let me reconsider behavioral options and combined strategies because families often ask what else they can do. CBIT has high-quality evidence for reducing tic severity in children and adolescents and can be paired with ongoing ADHD pharmacotherapy; I should confirm access and coordinate with schools and caregivers while titrating medications to the lowest effective doses, monitoring sleep, blood pressure, and daytime sedation when alpha-2 agonists are introduced [^114xv58J] [^111orm8m].

> In synthesis, I should confirm the following with the family: stimulants do not increase tic risk compared with placebo in children overall, and in a 9-year-old, the emergence of tics during treatment is most often the natural onset of a comorbid tic disorder rather than a causal medication effect; when tics co-occur and are impairing, maintain effective ADHD treatment, add guanfacine or clonidine and CBIT as needed, and use a brief stimulant dose adjustment only if the timing convincingly implicates the medicine, thereby avoiding unnecessary discontinuation of a treatment that reduces ADHD-related morbidity [^111adewG] [^116PXjXN] [^112QYJGY] [^114xv58J].

Tics can emerge or worsen in about **5–7%** [^111adewG] of children treated with stimulants; however, the risk is similar to placebo and often reflects the natural course of tics rather than a true medication effect [^111adewG]. Most tics are **mild and transient** and resolve with dose adjustment or by switching to non-stimulants (guanfacine, clonidine, atomoxetine) [^112QYJGY]. If tics persist or are severe, consider behavioral therapy (CBIT) [^114xv58J] or antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone) [^1115qntn]. Monitor closely and adjust treatment as needed [^1166URtx].

---

## Incidence and prevalence of tics associated with ADHD medications

- **Incidence of tics with stimulants**: Meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (n = 2,385) found new or worsening tics in 5.7% on stimulants vs 6.5% on placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78–1.27), indicating no significant excess risk [^111adewG].

- **Incidence of tics with non-stimulants**: Guanfacine and clonidine are associated with low tic risk and may reduce tics [^112QYJGY]; atomoxetine has a low risk of inducing tics.

- **Natural course of tics**: Tics commonly wax and wane, and new tics often reflect this natural course rather than a medication effect [^116PXjXN].

---

## Clinical characteristics of medication-induced tics

Medication-induced tics include **motor tics** — sudden, brief, repetitive movements such as eye blinking, facial grimacing, or shoulder shrugging [^116p6wTm]. **Vocal tics** are involuntary sounds like throat clearing, grunting, or sniffing. Tics typically **emerge within weeks** of starting or increasing stimulant therapy and often **resolve with dose reduction** or discontinuation.

---

## Risk factors for developing tics with ADHD medications

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history of tics or Tourette syndrome increases risk [^117VXQ2M].

- **Comorbid conditions**: Anxiety, OCD, and autism spectrum disorder may increase susceptibility [^116p6wTm].

- **Medication factors**: Higher doses and rapid titration may increase risk; start low and go slow [^116PXjXN] [^1121hADU].

---

## Management strategies for medication-induced tics

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or switch to a different stimulant formulation [^1166URtx].

- **Medication switch**: Consider non-stimulants (guanfacine, clonidine, atomoxetine) if tics persist [^112QYJGY] [^1115qntn].

- **Behavioral interventions**: CBIT is effective for reducing tic severity [^114xv58J].

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone) may be used for severe tics [^1115qntn].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Most medication-induced tics are **mild and transient**, resolving with dose adjustment or discontinuation. Long-term outcomes: Persistent tics may require ongoing management, but **most children experience improvement over time** [^116p6wTm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

AAP guidelines recommend combining **FDA-approved medications** with **behavioral interventions** [^111orm8m] and titrating to maximal benefit with tolerable side effects [^1145xUKk]. Monitoring should include regular assessment for tics, with **treatment adjustments** as needed [^1166URtx].

Tics can occur with ADHD medications, particularly stimulants, yet the risk is similar to placebo [^111adewG] and often reflects the natural course of tics [^112GBnSd]. Most tics are **mild and transient**, typically resolving with dose adjustment or by switching to non-stimulants [^1115qntn] [^112QYJGY]. Persistent or severe tics may require behavioral therapy [^114xv58J] or antipsychotics [^1115qntn].

### Meta-analysis: Risk of tics associated with psychostimulant use in randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^111adewG]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Clinical practice currently restricts the use of psychostimulant medications in children with tics or a family history of tics for fear that tics will develop or worsen as a side effect of treatment. Our goal was to conduct a meta-analysis to examine the risk of new onset or worsening of tics as an adverse event of psychostimulants in randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

We conducted a PubMed search to identify all double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of psychostimulant medications in the treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We used a fixed effects meta-analysis with risk ratio of new onset or worsening tics in children treated with psychostimulants compared to placebo. We used stratified subgroup analysis and meta-regression to examine the effects of stimulant type, dose, duration of treatment, recorder of side effect data, trial design, and mean age of participants on the measured risk of tics.

We identified 22 studies involving 2,385 children with ADHD for inclusion in our meta-analysis. New onset tics or worsening of tic symptoms were commonly reported in the psychostimulant (event rate = 5.7%, 95% CI = 3.7%-8.6%) and placebo groups (event rate = 6.5%, 95% CI = 4.4%-9.5%). The risk of new onset or worsening of tics associated with psychostimulant treatment was similar to that observed with placebo (risk ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.78–1.27, z = -0.05, p = .962). Type of psychostimulant, dose, duration of treatment, recorder, and participant age did not affect risk.

### A placebo-controlled study of guanfacine in the treatment of children with tic disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^112QYJGY]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). High credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of guanfacine in treating children with tic disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- **Method**: Subjects from a specialty tic disorders clinic were randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of treatment with guanfacine or placebo under double-blind conditions. Follow-up visits occurred every 2 weeks for safety monitoring and dose adjustment.

- **Results**: Thirty-four medication-free subjects (31 boys and three girls with a mean age of 10.4 years) with ADHD, combined type, and a tic disorder participated. After 8 weeks of treatment, guanfacine was associated with a mean improvement of 37% in the total score on the teacher-rated ADHD Rating Scale, compared to 8% improvement for placebo. Nine of 17 subjects who received guanfacine were blindly rated on the Clinical Global Improvement scale as either much improved or very much improved, compared with none of 17 subjects who received placebo. The mean score on the parent-rated hyperactivity index improved by 27% in the guanfacine group and 21% in the placebo group, not a significant difference. On the Continuous Performance Test, commission errors decreased by 22% and omission errors by 17% in the guanfacine group, compared with increases of 29% in commission errors and of 31% in omission errors in the placebo group. Tic severity decreased by 31% in the guanfacine group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. One guanfacine subject with sedation withdrew at week 4. Guanfacine was associated with insignificant decreases in blood pressure and pulse.

- **Tics/Tourette syndrome**: Is it best to replace methylphenidate with guanfacine or use it as adjunct when ADHD is present but tics require treatment as well?

	- Both methylphenidate and guanfacine are licensed for the treatment of ADHD and can be helpful and effective treatments for this condition. However, the co-occurrence of tics is unlikely to be treated adequately using methylphenidate. While treating ADHD with methylphenidate can have beneficial effects on associated symptoms that increase tics, such as frustration, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation, there does not appear to be a direct effect on tics.

	- The clinical decision whether to switch to guanfacine or to augment methylphenidate with guanfacine is based on: (i) the relative severity of ADHD and tic symptoms; (ii) whether methylphenidate is effectively managing the ADHD symptoms; and (iii) whether methylphenidate appears to be worsening tics. If methylphenidate is already effective in treating ADHD symptoms but tics worsen and/or require treatment, guanfacine may be added. In cases of mild to moderate ADHD symptoms with co-existing tics, and/or if methylphenidate is only partially effective or poorly tolerated, discontinuation of methylphenidate and switching to guanfacine may be considered. If tics improve with guanfacine alone but ADHD worsens, then methylphenidate may be restarted. In cases of mild-to-moderate ADHD with co-existing tics, where both require treatment, there is an argument to suggest that guanfacine monotherapy should be considered as the first-line medication choice rather than methylphenidate.

### Behavior therapy for children with Tourette disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^114xv58J]. JAMA (2010). High credibility.

Tourette disorder is a chronic and typically impairing childhood-onset neurologic condition. Antipsychotic medications, the first-line treatments for moderate to severe tics, are often associated with adverse effects. Behavioral interventions, although promising, have not been evaluated in large-scale controlled trials. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a comprehensive behavioral intervention for reducing tic severity in children and adolescents.

The study design was a randomized, observer-blind, controlled trial involving 126 children recruited from December 2004 through May 2007. The participants, aged 9 through 17 years and diagnosed with impairing Tourette or chronic tic disorder, were randomly assigned to either 8 sessions during 10 weeks of behavior therapy (n = 61) or a control treatment consisting of supportive therapy and education (n = 65). Responders received 3 monthly booster treatment sessions and were reassessed at 3 and 6 months following treatment.

The intervention under examination was a comprehensive behavioral intervention. The main outcome measures included the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (range 0–50, with a score greater than 15 indicating clinically significant tics) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (range 1 [very much improved] to 8 [very much worse]).

The results indicated that behavioral intervention led to a significantly greater decrease on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, from 24.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 23.1–26.3] to 17.1 [95% CI, 15.1–19.1], from baseline to endpoint compared with the control treatment, which showed a decrease from 24.6 [95% CI, 23.2–26.0] to 21.1 [95% CI, 19.2–23.0] (P < .001).

### Comprehensive systematic review summary: Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^1115qntn]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

To systematically evaluate the efficacy of treatments for tics and the risks associated with their use, this project followed the methodologies outlined in the 2011 edition of the American Academy of Neurology's guideline development process manual. We included systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on the treatment of tics that included at least 20 participants (10 participants if a crossover trial), except for neurostimulation trials, for which no minimum sample size was required. To obtain additional information on drug safety, we included cohort studies or case series that specifically evaluated adverse drug effects in individuals with tics.

There was high confidence that the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics was more likely than psychoeducation and supportive therapy to reduce tics. There was moderate confidence that haloperidol, risperidone, aripiprazole, tiapride, clonidine, onabotulinumtoxinA injections, 5-ling granule, Ningdong granule, and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus were probably more likely than placebo to reduce tics. There was low confidence that pimozide, ziprasidone, metoclopramide, guanfacine, topiramate, and tetrahydrocannabinol were possibly more likely than placebo to reduce tics. Evidence of harm associated with various treatments was also demonstrated, including weight gain, drug-induced movement disorders, elevated prolactin levels, sedation, and effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and ECGs.

There is evidence to support the efficacy of various medical and behavioral treatments for tics, although the associated risks should also be carefully considered.

### Common practical questions and answers at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111W8QUn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

When clonidine is being used in higher doses, is it best to go beyond the treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, is it best to reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine, or can you cross-taper?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are in the order of 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young people may be able to tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that the sedation has additional benefits for sleep and comorbidities. Therefore, in these children, higher doses may be beneficial with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. Clonidine can also be divided into two or three doses, and quite often children who are sensitive to guanfacine side effects find that a BID (twice daily) or TDS (three times daily) regime of clonidine suits them better than the once-daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is 10 times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, whereas guanfacine appears to be more potent at postsynaptic receptors. This translates into increased prefrontal activity, impulse control regulation, and improvement in behavior regulation. Therefore, in the case of comorbidities where behavioral modification is desired, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines indicate 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day, suggesting that a rough equivalency is: Guanfacine 1 mg = Clonidine 100 mcg.

If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective to reduce and withdraw clonidine first before initiating guanfacine, this should be considered.

### National estimates and factors associated with medication treatment for childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^11424gFj]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

In this study, we identified child and family-level characteristics associated with medication treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using nationally representative survey data.

- **Methods**: National Survey of Children's Health data from 79,264 youth aged 4 to 17 years were used. Data were weighted to adjust for the complex survey design of the National Survey of Children's Health. Gender-specific logistic regression models were generated to identify child and family-level characteristics collectively associated with medication status among youth with a reported diagnosis of ADHD.

- **Results**: Nationally, 7.8% of youth aged 4 to 17 years had a reported ADHD diagnosis, and 4.3% had both a diagnosis and were currently taking medication for the disorder. Medication treatment among youth with ADHD was associated with white race, younger age, English spoken in the home, health care coverage, a health care contact within the last year, and reported psychological difficulties. Gender-specific logistic regression models revealed that, together, younger age, higher income, health care coverage, having psychological difficulties, and a health care contact in the past year were associated with medication use among boys with ADHD. Among girls with the disorder, younger age, psychological difficulties, fair-to-poor paternal mental health status, and a health care contact within the last year were related to medication use.

### Impact of tic disorders on ADHD outcome across the life cycle: Findings from a large group of adults with and without ADHD [^113wb1wX]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The impact of tic disorders on the outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains a subject of high scientific and clinical interest. To evaluate the impact of comorbid ADHD and tic disorders from a lifespan perspective, the authors systematically examined data from adults with and without ADHD. They comprehensively evaluated 312 consecutively referred adults with ADHD and 252 comparison subjects without ADHD. Tic disorders were characterized along with a wide range of neuropsychiatric correlates, including other comorbid disorders as well as indexes of function in the domains of school, cognition, and interpersonal functioning.

A significantly greater proportion of adults with ADHD (12%) than those without ADHD (4%) had tic disorders. Tic disorders followed a mostly remitting course and had little impact on functional capacities. In addition, tic disorders were not associated with stimulant use.

These findings in adults with ADHD confirm and extend previous findings in young subjects with ADHD, documenting that although individuals with ADHD are at greater risk for tic disorders, the presence of tic disorders has a limited impact on ADHD outcome.

### Editorial: Two centimeters more or less. How much does it matter to an adolescent or a young adult with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^11741Ewy]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Stimulants are the first-line medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and methylphenidate (MPH) is the first choice in Europe, with good efficacy and acceptable tolerability in a short-term course during childhood and adolescence. ADHD is, however, a chronic condition, and patients can receive pharmacological treatment for a long period of time with understandable concerns related to long-term risks. Besides the well-known mild and transient adverse effects (i.e. sleep disturbance, nervousness, anorexia, headache, and abdominal pain), in the last decade, emphasis has been placed on several less common, but potentially more serious, effects occurring with prolonged use, and in particular on a possible drug-related impact of medications on growth and pubertal maturation.

### Tic disorders: from pathophysiology to treatment [^1121hA21]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are stereotypic behaviors, more frequent than once believed, and are likely to be encountered by primary care physicians. Tics usually begin in childhood and are the clinical hallmark of Tourette Syndrome (TS), the most common cause of tics. TS is a relatively common neurobehavioral disorder with a spectrum of manifestations that wax and wane during its natural course.

The pathophysiology of tics at the molecular and cellular levels is still unknown; however, structural and functional neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of the basal ganglia and related cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits and the dopaminergic neuronal system. Moreover, TS has a strong genetic background. The management of TS is often complicated by the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other behavioral disorders.

A correct diagnosis is a fundamental step for the proper management of these disorders, and a multimodal treatment is usually indicated. This approach includes educational and supportive interventions, as well as pharmacological treatments when tics are at their worst.

### Amphetamine-induced chorea in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder [^1136rTtb]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently treated with stimulants in both children and adults. While tics are occasional complications of stimulant therapy, chorea is reported rarely. In this study, we describe an adult ADHD patient who developed chorea upon dose escalation of mixed amphetamine salts, which resolved on discontinuation of the drug.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^116sHECT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Timely recognition and appropriate treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are essential to enhance long-term outcomes of individuals with ADHD. This study aimed to evaluate the multinational trends and patterns of ADHD medication consumption.

In this longitudinal trend study, we used pharmaceutical sales data of ADHD medication from the IQVIA-Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System between 2015 and 2019, covering 64 countries across the world. Consumption rates of ADHD medication were expressed as defined daily dose per 1000 child and adolescent inhabitants (aged 5–19) per day (DDD/TID). Linear mixed models were used to estimate the multinational, regional, and income level trend changes.

The results showed that multinational ADHD medication consumption increased by +9.72% (95% confidence interval, +6.25%, +13.31%) per year, from 1.19 DDD/TID in 2015 to 1.43 DDD/TID in 2019 across the 64 countries with marked differences between geographical locations. When stratified by countries' income levels, increases in ADHD medication consumption were observed in high-income countries but not in middle-income countries. In 2019, the pooled consumption rates of ADHD medication were 6.39 DDD/TID (95% CI, 4.63, 8.84) in high-income countries, 0.37 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.23, 0.58) in upper-middle-income countries, and 0.02 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.01, 0.05) in lower-middle-income countries.

ADHD prevalence estimates and rates of ADHD medication consumption in most middle-income countries are lower than expected.

### Getting to long-term effectiveness and safety of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications [^111hE6w8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use has dramatically increased in youth worldwide. Recent prevalence data in some European countries show expanded use, with one country now matching US usage. However, substantial geographic differences by country remain regarding the extent to which children receive ADHD medications. These geographic differences raise research questions about which country's prevalence data represents appropriate medication use. We urgently need country-level studies to contribute to our understanding of an appropriate prevalence of ADHD medication use.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^1166pWuR]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), provides diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, specifically focusing on the hyperactive-impulsive subtype. This clinical tool is designed to assist in diagnosing children who exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

- **Primary components**: The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD include nine specific behaviors related to hyperactivity and impulsivity. These behaviors are:
	- Fidgeting or squirming
	- Leaving the seat when expected to remain seated
	- Running or climbing inappropriately
	- Inability to engage in quiet leisure activities
	- Excessive talking
	- Blurting out answers prematurely
	- Difficulty waiting turns
	- Interrupting or intruding on others

	- Each behavior contributes to the overall score used to determine the presence of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype.

- **Diagnosis course considerations**: The DSM-5 criteria also account for the duration and impact of symptoms. The symptoms must be present for at least six months and at a level disruptive and inappropriate for the child's developmental level, significantly affecting the diagnostic score.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, are essential for determining whether a child meets the criteria for this particular subtype.

### Advancing the evidence base for child and adolescent psychopharmacology [^113EPur4]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). Low credibility.

Medications are an important component of the multimodal management strategy for many mental health conditions in children and adolescents. Clinical psychopharmacology for children and adolescents is generally considered to have begun in 1937, when Charles Bradley reported the serendipitous discovery of the beneficial effects of benzedrine, a stimulant, on symptoms that would now be considered under the diagnostic category of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since then, clinical child and adolescent psychopharmacology has evolved from an art into an evidence-based discipline, driven by the conduct and publication of numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. This body of research has significantly contributed to our understanding of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety/tolerability of medications used to treat mental health conditions in children and young people. However, uncertainties and unmet needs remain in the field.

Seven studies published in the BMJ Mental Health topic collection "Advances in Clinical Psychopharmacology in Children and Young People" help strengthen the evidence base for child and adolescent psychopharmacology. Collectively, these articles provide evidence that informs key steps in the psychopharmacological management of children and adolescents with mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions.

- **First study**: A study by Lyhmann et al. explored a key question that arises after the diagnostic process: Should the patient be treated with a medication?, with a specific focus on ADHD comorbidity.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term [^1157U9bf]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common diagnoses in child and adolescent mental health services, both in the United States and in many other countries. Medication, including stimulant and nonstimulant options, is an important element of the multimodal approach to ADHD management. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment.

A recent study including data from more than 150 million individuals in 13 countries showed an increase in the prevalence of ADHD medication use over the past 15 years in all countries, albeit with large variations across countries. One of the aspects that remains controversial in relation to stimulants pertains to their long-term effectiveness.

### Managing the risks of ADHD treatments [^114sALti]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a well-established and effective treatment modality. However, ADHD medications are not without side effects. Understanding the prevalence of adverse events and effective management of risks associated with stimulants and other medications used to treat ADHD is central to broad applicability and effective treatment. This review discusses the literature on the prevalence of adverse events and management strategies employed. We performed a search using online MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane databases, focusing on several keywords relating to adverse events associated with ADHD medication management. Our discussion covers relevant data on the significance and prevalence of side effects and adverse events, highlights recent updates in the field, and suggests approaches to clinical management.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Xj9pb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, particularly pharmacotherapy, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the use of methylphenidate in pediatric patients aged 4–5 years if behavioral interventions do not yield significant improvement. This is especially pertinent if there is a moderate-to-severe disturbance in the patient's functioning. It is essential to weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 against the potential harm of delaying treatment, particularly in areas lacking evidence-based behavioral treatments.

### Treatment of children and adolescents with tics and Tourette syndrome [^113b876h]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tics, patterned movements distinct from stereotypies, myoclonus, and other hyperkinetic movements, are quite common in children, particularly among those with developmental and psychiatric disorders. Thus, tics can indicate the presence of atypical neurodevelopment or broader difficulties with cognition or mood. Tics are also the cardinal feature of Tourette syndrome, a childhood-onset neurobehavioral disorder characterized by a chronic inability to suppress or an urge to perform patterned, repetitive movements.

Patients with Tourette syndrome most commonly have, in addition to tics, symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, obsessiveness, or anxiety. Achieving the most effective treatment for a child with tics is contingent on proper diagnosis of the movement disorder and thorough assessment for other problems, followed by consideration of both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for any and all symptoms interfering with the child's function and quality of life.

This review focuses primarily on the diagnosis and medical treatment of tics in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome.

### α2-adrenergic agonists or stimulants for preschool-age children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^112sHprY]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is diagnosed in approximately 2.4% of preschool-age children. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line medication treatment. However, up to 25% of preschool-age children with ADHD are treated with α2-adrenergic agonist medications, despite minimal evidence about their efficacy or adverse effects in this age group.

- **Objective**: To determine the frequency of reported improvement in ADHD symptoms and adverse effects associated with α2-adrenergic agonists and stimulant medication for initial ADHD medication treatment in preschool-age children.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective electronic health record review was conducted. Data were obtained from health records of children seen at seven outpatient developmental-behavioral pediatric practices in the Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics Research Network in the US. Data were abstracted for 497 consecutive children who were younger than 72 months when treatment with an α2-adrenergic agonist or stimulant medication was initiated by a developmental-behavioral pediatrician for ADHD. These children were treated between January 1, 2013, and July 1, 2017. Follow-up was completed on February 27, 2019.

- **Exposures**: α2-Adrenergic agonist vs. stimulant medication as initial ADHD medication treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Reported improvement in ADHD symptoms and adverse effects.

Data were abstracted from electronic health records of 497 preschool-age children with ADHD receiving α2-adrenergic agonists or stimulants. The median child age was 62 months at ADHD medication initiation.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^1121hADU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dosing**: Failing to 'start low and go slow'. When initiating medication, typically adverse effects occur before therapeutic benefits are seen and can lead to premature discontinuation. This can be avoided by gradual titration; 'starting low and going slow'. For example, initial syncope, due to postural hypotension, can be related to the initiation of clonidine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors) and guanfacine (which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors). Sedation is potentially related to all medications for tics. These adverse effects are often encountered if the initial dose is too high. However, with careful low-dose initiation and slow titration, these adverse effects are much less likely to occur. Doses of 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg guanfacine, and 0.5–1 mg aripiprazole once daily are suggested as appropriate initial doses, with titrations using a weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly approach according to the response. However, the initial dose and the titration speed could differ according to body weight, age, and other characteristics of the patient.

- **Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose**: When a medication has been initiated, it is important to titrate to recommended therapeutic doses. In the case of clonidine, this relates to an average daily dose of 3–5 mcg/kg; for aripiprazole around 5–10 mg daily; and for guanfacine between 1 and 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents according to weight. Often, young people are sub-optimally medicated to reduce potential side effects. However, it is a common issue.

### Prevalence of tics among 6- to 12-year-old schoolchildren in the Itagui municipality, Colombia, in 2010 [^1111N84W]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Tics are the most frequent movement disorder among children, particularly prevalent during the school-age years. Most tics are transitory; however, some can become chronic, causing negative repercussions at school, within the family, and socially. In certain cases, tics are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other conditions that require diagnosis and prompt treatment.

In South America, there are no indexed studies determining the prevalence of tics in school-age children. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of tics in schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years. From a population of 16,000 students enrolled in first to fifth grade, a sample of 346 children was chosen via a multistage sampling process. This process randomized the educational systems according to proportional size and stratification between public and private schools, and adjusted for the design effect.

The children were screened, and those who tested positive for tics underwent clinical evaluations and semistructured interviews conducted by the researchers to determine the prevalence of the condition. Surveys returned by the parents and teachers of 323 students accounted for a 93.3% response rate. A total of 138 students (42.7%) were considered positive for tics based on reports from parents and teachers. Clinical evaluation established a 17.97% prevalence of tics (58 students), with 25 students (43.2%) also meeting the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Among the students with tics, 27.6% had transitory tics, while 72.4% had chronic tics.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the following agents for patients with stimulant use disorder and co-occurring ADHD:

- **Topiramate combined with extended-release mixed amphetamine salts**: This combination may be effective in managing symptoms in these patients.

- **Long-acting amphetamine formulation psychostimulants**: Consider these formulations as a treatment option.

- **Long-acting methylphenidate formulations**: These can also be used as part of a comprehensive treatment strategy.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^116sm6ra]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Safe and effective medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is available and is recommended as the first-line treatment for the core symptoms of inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness. Despite impaired functioning during adolescence, many discontinue medication treatment. For children, healthcare decisions are usually made by the parent, whereas older youth make their own decisions. Beliefs and attitudes may differ widely among families. Some families understand that ADHD is a neurobiological condition and accept that medication is indicated; for others, such treatment is unacceptable.

Converging evidence describes negative perceptions of the burden associated with medication use, as well as concerns about potential short- and long-term adverse effects. Indeed, experiences of adverse effects are a frequent explanation for discontinuation among youth. Ways to improve shared decision-making among practitioners, parents, and youth, along with monitoring effectiveness, safety, and the onset of new difficulties, are likely to optimize outcomes.

### The phenomenology of tics in adults: Data from the Calgary and Paris adult tic disorders registry [^116APk1q]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are commonly associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders, of which attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, and anxiety disorders are the most common. Screening for these disorders is essential in clinical practice, as the presence and severity of comorbidities strongly influences health‐related quality of life. Adults with tic disorders also exhibit high rates of coexisting psychiatric disorders, including OCD, depression, anxiety disorders, and, less often, ADHD.

We have developed an Adult Tic Registry based in Calgary, Canada, and Paris, France, to prospectively study tic disorders in adults. The aim of this study is to assess the phenomenology of tics in adults with primary tic disorders by describing the types, distribution, and severity of tics and investigating how these features are influenced by sex. We also present data on the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions and psychotropic medication use and how these vary by sex.

### Botulinum toxin for the treatment of motor tics in children: A case series [^113ondrA]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, are characterized by brief, repetitive, and patterned movements or vocalizations. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) has emerged as a therapeutic option for motor tics, particularly when oral medications are insufficient or poorly tolerated. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin injections in 50 pediatric patients (aged 7–18 years) with motor tic disorders treated at a tertiary pediatric movement disorders clinic between May 2019 and January 2024.

Botulinum neurotoxin injections were tailored to individual symptomatology. Overall, 64% of patients reported improvement in tic severity, 36% noted no change, and 6% worsened. Response did not differ significantly by tic complexity, phenomenology (clonic vs dystonic), or presence of a premonitory urge. Comorbidities such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, and intellectual disability were not predictive of outcomes. These findings support botulinum neurotoxin as a safe and potentially effective treatment for pediatric motor tics, including complex and malignant presentations.

### Tourette's syndrome [^116p6wTm]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Tourette's syndrome is a movement disorder most commonly seen in school-age children. The incidence peaks around preadolescence, with half of the cases resolving in early adulthood. Tourette's syndrome is the most common cause of tics, which are involuntary or semivoluntary, sudden, brief, intermittent, repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (phonic tics). It is often associated with psychiatric comorbidities, mainly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Given its diverse presentation, Tourette's syndrome can mimic many hyperkinetic disorders, making the diagnosis challenging at times. The etiology of this syndrome is thought to be related to basal ganglia dysfunction.

Treatment can be behavioral, pharmacologic, or surgical, and is dictated by the most incapacitating symptoms. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists are the first line of pharmacologic therapy, but dopamine-receptor-blocking drugs are required for multiple, complex tics. Dopamine-receptor-blocking drugs are associated with potential side effects, including sedation, weight gain, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment can substantially improve quality of life and psychosocial functioning in affected children.

### Comparative study of the behavioral and neuropsychologic characteristics of tic disorder with or without attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^117NDj8J]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

To study the nature of the comorbidity of tic disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), patients with tic disorder with or without ADHD were compared based on clinical ratings and neuropsychologic tests. The study involved seventy-eight children: 16 with tic disorder, 19 with comorbid tic disorder and ADHD, 21 with ADHD, and 22 normal controls.

- **Rating scales**: The Child Behavior Checklist and the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale were completed in clinical groups to assess ADHD symptoms.

- **Neuropsychologic tests**: Seven tests were conducted to evaluate global cognitive abilities, attention, information-processing capacity, and fine motor skills among the four groups.

On most behavioral and neuropsychologic tests, the tic disorder with ADHD and the ADHD groups demonstrated similar performance patterns and marked deficits compared to the tic disorder and the control groups. However, in most attention tests, the ADHD group made more commission errors than the tic disorder with ADHD group.

These findings suggest that the tic disorder with ADHD group exhibits significant cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbances similar to the ADHD group, whereas the tic disorder group is more comparable to the control group. The tic disorder with ADHD group may represent a true comorbidity of the two disorders.

- **Psychostimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.

- **Non-stimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks.

- **Behavioral approaches**.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^115M3WeJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology has been conducted for more than 20 years and is currently a very popular course, attracting around 140 delegates per year from across the United Kingdom and abroad. As faculty of recent sessions of the course, we have selected the most common questions we have been asked in recent years and provided evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. We have included 27 questions and answers related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, epilepsy (in differential diagnosis or comorbid with mental health conditions), obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, and tics/Tourette syndrome in children and young people. We hope that this article will be helpful for prescribers in their daily clinical practice and we look forward to further, high-level evidence informing the answers to these and other questions in child and adolescent psychopharmacology.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (Against) [^116Fmx6p]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Definition of terms is necessary to address the motion. First, "psychostimulants" are defined as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which inherently are short-acting drugs characterized by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of immediate-release formulations that act for a few hours. Sustained effects across the day can be achieved by controlled-release formulations, but positive carry-over to the next day is not significant, so on subsequent days these medications must be administered again to reinstate pharmacological effects.

Second, "effective" refers to treatment-as-usual, whereas "efficacious" refers to enhanced or optimized treatment that may set a maximum for effectiveness. The magnitude of effectiveness (e.g. small, medium, or large effect size) depends on who is treated, how treatment is delivered, what outcome is evaluated, and other factors, including treatment adherence and study design.

Third, "long term" refers to a given timeframe (e.g. 1 year), which can be applied to specify the duration of treatment, length of follow-up, or both. Some studies evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment while it is continued, whereas others evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment during the follow-up after it is discontinued.

Given these definitions, the following questions address long-term effectiveness of stimulant medication.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Committee [^114ztx9P]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children, inattentive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. The primary purpose of this tool is to identify children who exhibit a significant number of inattentive behaviors, which are disruptive and inappropriate for their developmental level, for at least six months.

The diagnostic criteria consist of nine inattention-related behaviors:

- **Failing to give close attention to details**: Having trouble holding attention on tasks.
- **Not listening when spoken to directly**: Not following through on instructions.
- **Having trouble organizing tasks**: Avoiding tasks that require mental effort.
- **Losing things necessary for tasks**: Being easily distracted, and being forgetful in daily activities.

Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score. The presence of symptoms for at least six months, to the extent that it is disruptive and inappropriate for the person's developmental level, is a crucial component of the diagnostic criteria. This criterion significantly contributes to the overall score.

The diagnosis of ADHD, inattentive subtype, is confirmed if the total score is equal to or greater than 106. If the score is less than 106, the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, inattentive subtype, are not met. This scoring system allows clinicians to quantify the severity of inattentive behaviors and make a more objective diagnosis.

### Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children [^114M3dJx]. Health Psychology Research (2015). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric condition characterized by pervasive and impairing symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, as defined by the DSM-V.

- **Definition**: ADHD is a psychiatric disorder presenting symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

- **Pathophysiology**: ADHD is influenced by both biological factors, such as genetics and brain structure, and environmental factors, including pregnancy or birth complications, exposure to environmental toxins, chaotic parenting, and diet.

- **Disease course**: The disorder results from an interplay of genetic factors and dysfunction in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellum, leading to clinical manifestations of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Associated challenges include poor motor coordination, impaired academic functioning, unintentional physical injury, sleep disturbances, and reduced quality of life.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: ADHD is not associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality.

### Risks and benefits of available treatments for adult ADHD [^111XtjNg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Several pharmacotherapeutic options, both FDA-approved and off-label, exist for the treatment of adult ADHD. The most commonly used agents include several stimulants and atomoxetine, which have demonstrated significant, though similar, efficacy for ADHD versus placebo. Treatment should be selected according to patient comorbidity profiles, cardiovascular risks, and risk of abuse of prescription medications. In this activity, treatments for ADHD with and without comorbidity are discussed, including mechanisms of action, safety risks, and the potential for substance abuse. Implementing psychosocial education in conjunction with pharmacotherapy is recommended.

### Pediatric prevention: Tic disorders [^116KjSe9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether the development of tics can be prevented. Contextual variables can impact tic expression; therefore, shifting attention to behaviors that reduce tics is an important part of decreasing tic severity. Several medications are effective in reducing tic severity, but side effects restrict their use. Behavioral treatment is the gold standard psychotherapy intervention for tic disorders, with comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics being the most well-supported nonpharmacological treatment. Although children may be unable to prevent the development of tics, they can still use several strategies to reduce tic severity and impairment.

### Relexxii [^112JH4yT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a second uncontrolled study involving 682 pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years, the cumulative incidence of new-onset tics was observed to be 1% (9 out of 682). The treatment period extended up to 9 months, with a mean treatment duration of 7.2 months.

- **Blood pressure and heart rate increases**: In the laboratory classroom clinical trials involving pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years (Studies 1 and 2), both another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily and methylphenidate three times daily increased resting pulse by an average of 2 to 6 bpm. They produced average increases of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of roughly 1 to 4 mm Hg during the day, relative to placebo.

In the placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients aged 13 to 17 years (Study 4), mean increases from baseline in resting pulse rate were observed with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo at the end of the double-blind phase (5 and 3 beats/minute, respectively). Mean increases from baseline in blood pressure at the end of the double-blind phase for another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and placebo-treated patients were 0.7 and 0.7 mm Hg (systolic) and 2.6 and 1.4 mm Hg (diastolic), respectively.

In one placebo-controlled study involving adults (Study 6), dose-dependent mean increases of 3.9 to 9.8 bpm from baseline in standing pulse rate were observed with another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the end of the double-blind treatment versus an increase of 2.7 beats/minute with placebo.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (For) [^117MmqwR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Long-term effectiveness studies for ADHD medications are complicated to design well, and no single study design will capture the entire picture. Although randomized controlled trials are the highest level of evidence, most authorities agree that, when you have treatments as efficacious as ADHD medications (methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives and prodrugs, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine), it is neither practical nor ethical to conduct long-term placebo-controlled RCTs. As a consequence, almost all of the RCT evidence for ADHD medications relates to short-term studies. These provide strong evidence for short-term efficacy; however, they do not address long-term effectiveness.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the need for additional evidence of long-term effects before granting licenses for medications that will usually be required to be taken for several years. They therefore introduced a requirement for companies to demonstrate longer-term efficacy. This has generally been achieved through the use of randomized withdrawal designs intended to demonstrate continued efficacy over 6 to 12 months. Several such studies have been completed and published, all demonstrating continued efficacy as expected.

The EMA also insisted that all new ADHD medications demonstrate continued effectiveness and that adverse effects and safety be assessed up to 2 years. Studies completed so far support continued effectiveness and, although they highlight the presence of common, expected adverse effects, they have not identified any new concerns.

### The spectrum of functional tic-like behaviours: Data from an international registry [^1124iJ34]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Between 2019 and 2022, there was a marked rise in adolescents and young adults seeking urgent help for functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs). Given the global scale of this phenomenon, we aimed to pool cases from different institutions in an international registry to better characterize this spectrum and facilitate future longitudinal observation.

- **Methods**: An international collaborative group from 10 tertiary referral centres for tic disorders collected retrospective data on FTLB patients who sought specialists' attention between the last quarter of 2019 and June 2022. An audit procedure was used for the collection of data, which comprised demographics, course of presentation and duration, precipitating and predisposing factors, phenomenology, comorbidities, and pharmacological treatment outcome.

- **Results**: During the study period, we collected data on 294 patients with FTLBs, 97% of whom were adolescents and young adults and 87% of whom were female. FTLBs were found to have a peak of severity within one month in 70% of patients, with spontaneous remissions in 20%, and a very high frequency of complex movements (85%) and vocalizations (81%). Less than one-fifth of patients had pre-existing primary tic disorder, 66% had comorbid anxiety disorders, 28% comorbid depressive disorders, 24% autism spectrum disorder, and 23% attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Almost 60% explicitly reported exposure to tic-related social media content. The vast majority of pharmacologically treated patients did not report benefit with tic-suppressing medications.

- **Conclusions**:

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^114G2y2v]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 1.4–3.0% and is more common in boys than girls. Comorbidity with childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric disorders is substantial. ADHD is highly heritable and multifactorial; multiple genes and non-inherited factors contribute to the disorder. Prenatal and perinatal factors have been implicated as risks, but definite causes remain unknown.

Most guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment, beginning with non-drug interventions and then moving to pharmacological treatment in those most severely affected. Randomised controlled trials show short-term benefits of stimulant medication and atomoxetine. Meta-analyses of blinded trials of non-drug treatments have not yet proven the efficacy of such interventions. Longitudinal studies of ADHD show a heightened risk of multiple mental health and social difficulties, as well as premature mortality in adult life.

### Pediatric psychopharmacology: Too much or too little [^114hYe4F]. World Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

This paper provides a selective overview of the past, present, and future of pediatric psychopharmacology. The acceptance of medication use in child psychiatry was based on the results of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials documenting the efficacy of drug treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychoses. This period of success was followed by a series of challenges, including a growing awareness of the long-term adverse effects of medications and the inadequacy of long-term drug surveillance. There is great concern today that children are being overtreated with medication, especially in the US. Further advances in pediatric psychopharmacology may come from the examination of large medical data sets including both pharmacological and psychiatric information, which could lead to drug repurposing, as well as from preclinical translational studies such as those using human-induced pluripotent stem cells.

### Guanfacine toxic ingestion with subsequent cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^116aiznU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Guanfacine is a central alpha-2 agonist often prescribed for attention-deficit hyperactive disorder as well as tic disorder, with a usual dose of 1–4 mg per day. Due to its sympatholytic mechanism of action, guanfacine can cause autonomic instability and hypotension. It can additionally cause cardiac dysfunction, including symptomatic bradycardias and contractility suppression. This paper presents a case of a 17-year-old male with an ingestion of 80 mg of extended-release guanfacine resulting in delayed onset cardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring mechanical ventilation.

- **Case review**: Previous pediatric ingestions have generated bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased level of consciousness, responsive to intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and occasionally naloxone. However, cardiogenic pulmonary edema from reduced cardiac contractility is a novel consequence of extended-release guanfacine ingestion. With guanfacine's extended half-life, this unique case underscores the importance of emergency providers' familiarity with this toxidrome as well as the necessity for prolonged, close observation following guanfacine ingestion.

### Is persistent motor or vocal tic disorder a milder form of Tourette syndrome [^1176vBJv]? Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, all data are retrospective and may be subject to recall bias. Second, the study samples differed in mean age, presence of comorbid OCD, and ascertainment. Furthermore, the rates of psychotic disorders were very low in individual samples, and disruptive behavior disorders were assessed primarily in children, all of which could potentially confound the results. We addressed these potential confounds to the best of our ability by controlling for these factors in our analyses, and we see evidence that mean age at ascertainment and comorbid ADHD and/or OCD contribute to some, but not all, of the observed differences between studies. We do not have data on the severity or impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders or on treatment outcomes. Additional prospectively designed studies that eliminate these potential sources of bias would be useful to replicate and extend this work.

### Tic suppression in children with recent-onset tics predicts 1-year tic outcome [^113mqGZs]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Successful voluntary tic suppression is a key component of the behavioral interventions used to treat tic disorders. This study aimed to examine tic suppression in children with recent-onset tics and determine whether the capacity to suppress tics predicts future tic severity. We tested 45 children (30 male, mean age 7.74 years) with recent-onset tics (mean 3.47 months prior to the first study visit; baseline) and re-examined each child at the 12-month anniversary of the first recognized tic (follow-up).

At the baseline visit, children performed a tic suppression task with several conditions. They were asked to tic freely, inhibit tics given a verbal request, and inhibit tics in the presence of a reward. Children with tics for only a few months showed the ability to suppress their tics, and suppression was particularly successful when they received an immediate and contingent reward. Additionally, the ability to suppress tics in the presence of a reward predicted tic severity at follow-up. These findings suggest that better inhibitory control of tics shortly after tic onset may be an important predictor of future tic symptom outcomes.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications and long-term risk of cardiovascular diseases [^116Hedp8]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Pharmacological therapy, including both stimulants and nonstimulants, is recommended as the first-line treatment for ADHD in many countries. The use of ADHD medication has increased greatly in both children and adults during the past decades. Although the effectiveness of ADHD medications has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and other studies, concerns remain regarding their potential cardiovascular safety. Meta-analyses of RCTs have reported increases in heart rate and blood pressure associated with both stimulant and nonstimulant ADHD medications.

As RCTs typically evaluate short-term effects (average treatment duration of 75 days), it remains uncertain whether and to what extent the increases in blood pressure and heart rate associated with ADHD medication lead to clinically significant cardiovascular disease (CVD) over time. Longitudinal observational studies examining the association between ADHD medication use and serious cardiovascular outcomes have emerged in recent years, but the findings have been mixed. A meta-analysis of observational studies found no statistically significant association between ADHD medication and risk of CVD; however, the possibility of a modest risk increase cannot be ruled out due to several methodological limitations in these studies, including confounding by indication, immortal time bias, and prevalent user bias.

### Tics and functional tic-like movements: Can we tell them apart [^1164pnVv]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Within the broad spectrum of movement disorders, tics and functional tic-like movements belong to a particular clinical category. Both types of movements are within the range of normal movement kinematics and muscle synergies but appear repetitive and without appropriate context embedment. Historically, there have been many attempts to separate the two types of movements, but because of their phenomenological overlap, clinical distinction may be prone to error, and misdiagnoses may often occur. Most importantly, the two types of movement may coexist.

We review the available literature on the two types of motor phenomena and demonstrate some of the difficulties in distinguishing tics from functional tic-like movements on clinical grounds. We also highlight similarities and differences in pathophysiologic characteristics, documenting the significance of action monitoring, attentional allocation, and behavioral reinforcement in both types of movements, as well as their risk factors.

- **Behavioral treatments**: We discuss the overlap of behavioral treatments for tics and functional tic-like movements and emphasize implications of diagnostic mislabeling.

Such implications include the need to tailor behavioral treatment approaches to individual phenomenological profiles and guide decision-making for severe patients requiring invasive interventions, such as deep brain stimulation. A deeper insight from clinicians concerning persisting challenges in classifying and differentiating these motor phenomena could accelerate the development of reliable clinical and physiologic markers.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^115JpF7E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering arranging for a parent, health professional, such as a trained school nurse, or another trusted adult to directly observe the administration of medication. This is especially important when using a short-acting formulation in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder and ADHD. It is also advisable to counsel families on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications.

### Deep brain stimulation alleviates tics in Tourette syndrome via striatal dopamine transmission [^113auGdq]. Brain (2023). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the chronic presence of both motor and vocal tics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 350,000 to 450,000 people are affected by this syndrome in the United States alone. While it is primarily a disease of childhood that improves with age, a subset (~5%) of patients are refractory to conventional therapy and continue to suffer severe disability into adulthood. This can lead to a multi-faceted decrease in quality of life and, in children, can interfere with scholastic performance and social development.

Addressing Tourette syndrome requires an improved understanding of its underlying pathoneurophysiology. It has been hypothesized that striatal dysregulation mediates tic behavior. Consistent with this hypothesis, post-mortem studies of the brains of patients with Tourette syndrome have revealed a reduction of striatal GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. These neurons are important for regulating afferent dopamine neurons responsible for high dopaminergic tone in the striatum and for gating efferent medium spiny neuronal activity that regulates movement in the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia. Based on neuroimaging studies in patients, it has been postulated that high dopaminergic tone mediates tic generation. Here, we have instead hypothesized that decreased striatal dopamine transmission may account for the susceptibility to anomalous tic behavior and that increased transmission is therapeutic.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^11651sSZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we present here what we deem are the most common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology. In this paper, we specifically addressed common pitfalls in the pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder. Pitfalls in the treatment of other disorders are addressed in a separate paper (part II).

### The presence of comorbidity in Tourette syndrome increases the need for pharmacological treatment [^1158gKuJ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is often accompanied by other syndromes, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and its treatment is symptomatic. Due to the lack of European guidelines for pharmacological treatment in Tourette syndrome, we aimed to provide better insight into common practices in Scandinavia. Furthermore, we sought to elaborate on the influence of comorbidities and the severity of tics on pharmacological treatment. We examined the frequency, type, and reason for pharmacological treatment in a Danish clinical cohort of 314 children with Tourette syndrome. In total, 60.5% of the children had received pharmacological treatment at some point. The treatment was mostly initiated due to tics or ADHD. When ADHD or OCD were present, more children received pharmacological treatment, and more varied agents were used. Children who received pharmacological treatment had more severe tics compared to those who did not use medication.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^112GBnSd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Tics**: The natural course of tics is a waxing (increasing) and waning (decreasing) pattern over weeks or months. Over hours and days, tics can also worsen due to factors such as anxiety, anger, excitement, or tiredness. Tics often intensify during stressful periods like the start of a new school year or exams. A common pitfall is prematurely assuming treatment effectiveness during a natural waning phase, or conversely, deeming a drug treatment ineffective during a waxing phase. To avoid these pitfalls, it is crucial to evaluate treatment effects over a sufficiently long duration, typically 2–3 months, to compare peaks (waxing phases) and troughs (waning phases) before and after initiating treatment.

- **Assessing the effectiveness of drug treatments**: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented rise in functional tics, especially in teenage girls. Functional tics can be challenging to differentiate from a primary tic disorder and may co-occur with primary tics. Nonetheless, functional tics do not respond to standard tic medications. A common pitfall is failing to observe a tic treatment response at standard doses, leading to continued dose escalation and increasing adverse effects. Another diagnostic pitfall involves distinguishing between motor mannerisms and stereotypies in autism that mimic complex motor tics but are unresponsive to tic treatments.

### Children with comorbid attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and tic disorder: Evidence for additive inhibitory deficits within the motor system [^1133nYyC]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

For children with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or tic disorder (TD), we recently reported deficient inhibitory mechanisms within the motor system using transcranial magnetic stimulation. These deficits, stated as reduced intracortical inhibition in ADHD and shortened cortical silent period in TD, could be seen as neurophysiological correlates of motor hyperactivity and tics, respectively. To investigate the neurophysiological aspects of comorbidity, we measured motor system excitability for the first time in children with combined ADHD and TD. The findings of reduced intracortical inhibition as well as a shortened cortical silent period in these comorbid children provide evidence for additive effects at the level of motor system excitability.

### Mental health in the United States. Prevalence of diagnosis and medication treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder — United States, 2003 [^1126m4tj]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), previously known as attention deficit disorder, is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by pervasive inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that often results in substantial functional impairment. Prevalence estimates of ADHD in school-aged children have ranged from 2% to 18% in community samples. Although stimulant medications are an effective first-line treatment for ADHD, concern persists regarding the possible side effects and long-term health outcomes associated with stimulant consumption. Estimating the number of children who have had ADHD diagnosed and are currently taking medication for the disorder is an important step toward understanding the overall burden of ADHD in the United States.

Previously, population-based estimates of medication treatment for ADHD were not available or were limited by their lack of generalizability. To estimate rates of parent-reported ADHD diagnosis and medication treatment for ADHD, the CDC analyzed data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, in 2003, approximately 4.4 million children aged 4–17 years were reported to have a history of ADHD diagnosis; of these, 2.5 million (56%) were reported to be taking medication for the disorder. Because both substantial health risks and benefits might be associated with medication treatment for ADHD, further study of this population of children with ADHD is needed.

CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics, as well as the worsening of Tourette's syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Before initiating Focalin XR, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette's syndrome. Regularly monitor Focalin-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^112diL7P]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology has been run for more than 20 years and is currently a very popular course, attracting around 140 delegates per year from across the United Kingdom and abroad. As faculty of recent sessions of the course, we have selected the most common questions we have been asked in recent years and provided evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers.

We have included 27 questions and answers related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, epilepsy (in differential diagnosis or comorbid with mental health conditions), obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, and tics/Tourette syndrome in children and young people.

We hope that this article will be helpful for prescribers in their daily clinical practice and we look forward to further, high-level evidence informing the answers to these and other questions in child and adolescent psychopharmacology.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, specifically concerning patients with ADHD, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of extended-release formulations when initiating psychostimulant medications in patients with co-occurring ADHD. It is advised to maintain a level of monitoring that matches the risk profile of the medication and patient. This may include pill counts, drug testing, increased clinical contact, and more frequent prescription drug monitoring program checks (Clinical consensus, strong recommendation).

### Advances in understanding and treatment of Tourette syndrome [^117VXQ2M]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a hereditary, childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that was first clearly described in France in 1885. This disorder is characterized by sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal or phonic tics), often preceded by premonitory sensations or urges. Some individuals also have psychiatric comorbidities, notably attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Tourette syndrome occurs worldwide, affecting all races and ethnicities, in both sexes, and in both children and adults. Estimates of its prevalence in children vary, with rates of up to 1% being reported, but rates of 0.3–0.8% are thought to accurately reflect the occurrence of the disorder.

Research has led to progress in many aspects of Tourette syndrome, although many questions and unmet needs remain. For example, except for rare cases, the genetic basis remains elusive. The anatomical and neuronal changes in the brain that underlie Tourette syndrome are also unclear, although evidence increasingly implicates alterations in basal ganglia function. Treatment is often unnecessary for individuals with mild tics, but for those with moderate to severe forms of the syndrome, some drugs are available, albeit frequently ineffective. Behavioral and surgical therapies, in particular deep brain stimulation, are currently undergoing development and show promising results. This review examines the history of Tourette syndrome and describes its clinical presentation. It also provides an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology.

### Medication-taking experiences in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review [^111qKreG]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition for which pharmacotherapy is considered an effective treatment, guidelines on the treatment of ADHD have been challenging to implement. Considering the views of patients and caregivers involved in medication-taking could help shed light on these challenges.

- **Objective**: This review combines the findings of individual studies of medication-taking experiences in ADHD in order to guide clinicians to effectively share decisions about treatment.

- **Methods**: Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and CINAHL) were systematically searched for relevant published research articles. Articles were assessed for quality using a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist, and synthesis was performed using meta-ethnography.

- **Results**: Thirty-one articles were included in the final synthesis, comprising studies of caregivers, pediatric patients, and adult patients across seven countries. Findings were categorized into five different constructs, including coming to terms with ADHD, anticipated concerns about medication, experiences of the effects of medication, external influences, and the development of self-management. The synthesis demonstrates that decisions surrounding medication-taking for ADHD evolve as the child patient enters adulthood and moves towards autonomy and self-management. In all parts of this journey, decisions are shaped by a series of 'trade-offs', where potential benefits and harms of medication are weighed up.

- **Conclusions**: This review offers comprehensive insight into the medication-taking experiences in ADHD.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^116qw8bT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

In cases of moderate-to-severe ADHD with tics, ADHD symptoms are likely to require treatment with psychostimulants, which are the first-line treatment choice for ADHD. Therefore, when tics are also present, augmenting methylphenidate with guanfacine to address the symptoms of both conditions seems preferable. The use of guanfacine in this context also may benefit ADHD symptoms, as shown by recent studies. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate, and combined treatment showed no differences in safety or tolerability.

While acknowledging that it is best for children and young people to receive as few medications as possible at the lowest effective dose, when there is clear impairment from both disorders, combining treatments may be beneficial. Thus, especially when ADHD symptoms are more severe and impairing, a combination of methylphenidate and guanfacine is worth considering.

The addition of guanfacine can also potentially benefit sleep difficulties and night-time settling and decrease the need for alternatives such as melatonin, which may be a beneficial consideration.

- **Consideration of antipsychotics vs. clonidine/guanfacine**:
	- When would I consider antipsychotics more appropriate than clonidine or guanfacine when treating tics in children and young people? In a recent prescribing survey among 59 European expert clinicians who were members of the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome, the most commonly used medications for tics in children and adolescents, in descending order, were aripiprazole, clonidine, and tiapride (not available in the United Kingdom).

### Treatment use among children with Tourette syndrome living in the United States, 2014 [^1116FiG7]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS) can be complicated by changes over time in tic expression, severity, and co-occurring disorders. Using the 2014 National Survey of the Diagnosis and Treatment of ADHD and Tourette Syndrome, this study provides descriptive estimates of the use of behavioral interventions and medication among children living with TS. Parent-reported data on 115 children aged 5–17 years ever diagnosed with TS were analyzed to provide descriptive, unweighted results.

Overall, 77.4% of children had or past use of any TS treatment; 59.1% ever used behavioral interventions and 56.1% had ever taken TS medication. Children with "moderate" or "severe" versus "mild" TS, those with ≥ 1 co-occurring disorders, and those with tics that interfered with functioning were significantly more likely to have used one or more TS treatments. Side effects were reported for 84.4% of children who took TS medication.

Most parents of children with TS (87.2%) were satisfied with the management of their child's TS. However, parents of children with "moderate" or "severe" TS were significantly more dissatisfied compared to parents of children with "mild" TS. Findings from this study could be used to inform efforts to support children living with TS and their families.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^116PXjXN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Misidentifying new-onset tics as an adverse effect of stimulant medication for ADHD

Tic disorders occur in around 20% of young people with ADHD. However, the onset of tics (typically around 7–8 years of age) is later than the emergence of ADHD symptoms. A common pitfall when observing new-onset tics in children receiving stimulants for ADHD is to erroneously assume that the tics are a stimulant adverse effect, leading to medication being stopped, swapped, or reduced, when in fact it is an emerging co-morbid tic disorder. If tics emerge very soon after starting stimulant medication, a dose reduction is warranted to observe if tics reduce. However, if tics emerge following a stable period of ADHD treatment and tics also require treatment, then augmentation with clonidine or guanfacine should be considered.

- **Augmenting medication with behavioural therapy**: It is a common pitfall to assume that medication should only be tried after using psychological approaches such as behavioural therapy. Whilst acknowledging that in reality these resources are scarce, when available, it is not always beneficial to consider medication only after first attempting psychological therapies. Often, barriers to successfully implementing these therapies can relate to the age or intellectual ability of the young person, comorbidities such as ADHD and autism, family and environmental factors, and the severity or impairment of the tics. For more severe tics, medication may reduce tic intensity and frequency, thus making behavioural techniques easier to implement.
