## Question

"Facilitation of perioperative management in adults (for pain, anxiety, and vomiting, and to reduce opioid requirements) " - Hydroxyzine hydrochloride 25-100 mg IM once

What is the recommended dosage for: "Facilitation of perioperative management in adults (for pain, anxiety, and vomiting, and to reduce opioid requirements) "?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage of hydroxyzine hydrochloride for facilitating perioperative management in adults, specifically for pain, anxiety, vomiting, and reducing opioid requirements. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact labeled indication and route. Then, I should verify the FDA-referenced dose range and whether it is a single-dose regimen. Next, I will check for any conflicting sources or alternative formulations. After that, I need to consider safety, drug–drug interactions, and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the indication and route. Multiple FDA sources explicitly list "facilitation of perioperative management in adults (for pain, anxiety, vomiting, and to reduce opioid requirements)" as a labeled use for hydroxyzine hydrochloride, and they specify intramuscular administration for this purpose, which aligns with the question's framing [^20bd90dc] [^06188056] [^cc9217c0].

> I should confirm the dose. The FDA labeling consistently states the dosage as 25–100 mg IM once for this indication, which supports a single-dose regimen rather than repeated dosing in the perioperative context, and this is echoed across several FDA entries and the DailyMed compendium [^20bd90dc] [^b5db2c07] [^06188056] [^674fb87c].

> Wait, let me verify whether any conflicting dosing appears elsewhere. Some FDA documents detail oral dosing for anxiety, pruritus, or premedication (for example, 50–100 mg PO for premedication), but those oral regimens are distinct from the IM perioperative facilitation indication and should not be conflated with the IM dose for perioperative management, reinforcing that the correct perioperative IM dose remains 25–100 mg once [^674fb87c] [^6a0d5477] [^c8238159].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic rationale and whether it aligns with the claimed benefits. The FDA pharmacology and precautions sections note hydroxyzine's anxiolytic, antiemetic, and sedative properties, and explicitly state that when used preoperatively, narcotic requirements may be reduced by as much as 50 percent, which provides a pharmacologic basis for the labeled perioperative use and the opioid-sparing claim [^f0da2c77] [^60383590].

> Next, I should review safety and interactions. Hydroxyzine potentiates CNS depressants, so concomitant opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or alcohol warrant dose reductions of those agents and close monitoring; rare cardiac arrests have been reported with IM hydroxyzine combined with other CNS depressants, so I need to ensure we emphasize minimizing concurrent sedatives and vigilant observation [^60383590].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In older adults, hydroxyzine is considered highly anticholinergic and is on Beers lists to avoid due to delirium and cognitive risks; if used at all, it should be at the lowest effective dose with heightened monitoring, and many geriatric perioperative guidelines prioritize non-anticholinergic alternatives and opioid-sparing multimodal strategies instead [^f05f79fc] [^1754e5e2] [^69e679dd].

> Let me consider alternatives and context. Contemporary PONV guidelines do not prominently feature hydroxyzine for prophylaxis or rescue, favoring agents like 5-HT3 antagonists, NK1 antagonists, dexamethasone, droperidol, haloperidol, or low-dose promethazine; thus, if the goal is antiemesis, hydroxyzine should be viewed as an off-label or secondary option rather than first-line in modern practice [^5b9eee63] [^7308df31] [^4482ed1d].

> I should double-check that my synthesis is precise. The labeled, evidence-aligned regimen for hydroxyzine hydrochloride to facilitate perioperative management in adults is 25–100 mg IM once, administered as a single dose, with subsequent analgesic and anxiolytic needs managed by individualized, multimodal strategies and careful titration of concomitant CNS depressants; in older adults, use the lowest effective dose only if absolutely necessary and monitor closely for anticholinergic effects and delirium [^20bd90dc] [^60383590] [^f05f79fc].

---

The recommended dose of hydroxyzine hydrochloride for perioperative management in adults is **25–100 mg IM once** [^20bd90dc] [^06188056], given 30–60 minutes preoperatively to reduce anxiety, control nausea/vomiting, and lower opioid requirements [^60383590]. Use the **lowest effective dose**, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities, and monitor for sedation and anticholinergic effects [^f05f79fc] [^d2147b1b].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Standard adult dose**: 25–100 mg IM once, administered 30–60 minutes before surgery [^20bd90dc] [^06188056].
- **Dose selection**: Use the lowest effective dose within the range, tailored to patient factors such as age, weight, comorbidities, and concomitant medications [^f05f79fc].
- **Maximum dose**: 100 mg IM per dose; avoid repeat dosing due to prolonged sedation and anticholinergic effects [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosage

Hydroxyzine is **FDA-approved** for perioperative use to reduce anxiety, control emesis, and lower opioid requirements [^06188056] [^cc9217c0]. Clinical studies show that preoperative IM hydroxyzine reduces anxiety and opioid consumption without significant hemodynamic instability [^60383590] [^8d2b74e4]. Its anxiolytic, antiemetic, and sedative properties support its role as part of multimodal perioperative care [^f0da2c77].

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

- **Sedation**: Hydroxyzine causes dose-related CNS depression; monitor patients for excessive sedation, especially when combined with other CNS depressants [^60383590].
- **Anticholinergic effects**: Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, and constipation may occur, particularly in older adults [^f05f79fc].
- **Drug interactions**: Hydroxyzine potentiates opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates; reduce concomitant sedative doses by up to 50% to avoid respiratory depression and hypotension [^60383590].
- **Contraindications**: Use with caution in patients with QT prolongation, hepatic impairment, or hypersensitivity to antihistamines [^7ceb76ff].

---

## Special populations

In special populations, **older adults** should receive lower initial doses due to increased sensitivity and anticholinergic burden; monitor closely for delirium and cognitive impairment [^f05f79fc] [^d2147b1b]. Patients with hepatic impairment should also start low and titrate cautiously because hydroxyzine is metabolized in the liver. For patients with renal impairment, no specific dose adjustment is required, but monitor for increased sedation.

## Comparison with alternative medications

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Recommended dose** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hydroxyzine | - Anxiety <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Sedation <br/> - Opioid-sparing | 25–100 mg IM once | - Effective <br/> - Anticholinergic <br/> - Sedating |
| Promethazine | - Nausea <br/> - Sedation | 12.5–25 mg IV/IM once | - Effective antiemetic <br/> - Sedating <br/> - Tissue injury risk |
| Midazolam | - Anxiety <br/> - Sedation | 1–2.5 mg IV once | - Rapid onset <br/> - Short-acting <br/> - Respiratory depression risk |
| Ondansetron | Nausea | 4 mg IV once | - Effective antiemetic <br/> - Minimal sedation |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

ASA guidelines endorse **multimodal analgesia** and anxiolysis, with hydroxyzine as a reasonable option when sedation and antiemesis are desired [^e98f8904]. Geriatric guidelines advise using the lowest effective dose and monitoring for anticholinergic effects and delirium [^f05f79fc] [^d2147b1b].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Recommended dose**: 25–100 mg IM once, 30–60 minutes preoperatively [^20bd90dc] [^06188056].
- **Dose selection**: Use the lowest effective dose, individualized to patient factors [^f05f79fc].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for sedation, anticholinergic effects, and drug interactions [^60383590].
- **Special populations**: Use lower doses in older adults and those with hepatic impairment [^f05f79fc].

---

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride 25–100 mg IM once is effective for perioperative anxiety, nausea, and opioid sparing, but **use the lowest effective dose** and monitor for sedation and anticholinergic effects, especially in older adults [^20bd90dc] [^f05f79fc].

PRECAUTIONS

THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, BARBITURATES AND ALCOHOL. Rarely, cardiac arrests and death have been reported in association with the combined use of hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscularly and other CNS depressants. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine their dosage should be reduced up to 50 percent. The efficacy of hydroxyzine as adjunctive pre- and postoperative sedative medication has also been well established, especially as regards its ability to allay anxiety, control emesis, and reduce the amount of narcotic required.

HYDROXYZINE MAY POTENTIATE NARCOTICS AND BARBITURATES, so their use in preanesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug.

When hydroxyzine is used preoperatively or prepartum, narcotic requirements may be reduced as much as 50 percent. Thus, when 50 mg of hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscular solution is employed, meperidine dosage may be reduced from 100 mg to 50 mg. The administration of meperidine may result in severe hypotension in the postoperative patient or any individual whose ability to maintain blood pressure has been compromised by a depleted blood volume. Meperidine should be used with great caution and in reduced dosage in patients who are receiving other pre- and/or postoperative medications and in whom there is a risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation or coma occurring. Before using any medications concomitant with hydroxyzine, the manufacturer"s prescribing information should be read carefully.

Clinical Pharmacology

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is unrelated chemically to phenothiazine, reserpine, and meprobamate. Hydroxyzine has demonstrated its clinical effectiveness in the chemotherapeutic aspect of the total management of neuroses and emotional disturbances manifested by anxiety, tension, agitation, apprehension or confusion.

Hydroxyzine has been shown clinically to be a rapid-acting true ataraxic with a wide margin of safety. It induces a calming effect in anxious, tense, psychoneurotic adults and also in anxious, hyperkinetic children without impairing mental alertness. It is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.

Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally.

Hydroxyzine has been shown experimentally to have antispasmodic properties, apparently mediated through interference with the mechanism that responds to spasmogenic agents such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine.

Antihistaminic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically.

An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases provides mild antisecretory benefits.

OVERDOSAGE

The most common manifestation of overdosage of hydroxyzine pamoate is hypersedation. Other reported signs and symptoms were convulsions, stupor, nausea and vomiting. As in the management of overdosage with any drug, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken.

If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and vasopressors (do not use epinephrine as hydroxyzine counteracts its pressor action.) Caffeine and Sodium Benzoate Injection, USP, may be used to counteract central nervous system depressant effects.

Hydroxyzine overdose may cause QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes. ECG monitoring is recommended in cases of hydroxyzine overdose.

There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with hydroxyzine. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated. There is no practical method to quantitate hydroxyzine in body fluids or tissue after its ingestion or administration.

DOSAGE

For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested: in adults, 50–100 mg q.i.d.; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; and over 6 years, 50–100 mg daily in divided doses.

For use in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses, and in histamine-mediated pruritus: in adults, 25 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; and over 6 years, 50–100 mg daily in divided doses.

As a sedative when used as a premedication and following general anesthesia: 50–100 mg in adults, and 0.6 mg/kg in children.

When treatment is initiated by the intramuscular route of administration, subsequent doses may be administered orally.

As with all medications, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy.

Indications and Usage

The total management of anxiety, tension, and psychomotor agitation in conditions of emotional stress requires in most instances a combined approach of psychotherapy and chemotherapy. Hydroxyzine has been found to be particularly useful for this latter phase of therapy in its ability to render the disturbed patient more amenable to psychotherapy in long term treatment of the psychoneurotic and psychotic, although it should not be used as the sole treatment of psychosis or of clearly demonstrated cases of depression.

Hydroxyzine is also useful in alleviating the manifestations of anxiety and tension as in the preparation for dental procedures and in acute emotional problems. It has also been recommended for the management of anxiety associated with organic disturbances and as adjunctive therapy in alcoholism and allergic conditions with strong emotional overlay, such as in asthma, chronic urticaria, and pruritus.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride intramuscular solution is useful in treating the following types of patients when intramuscular administration is indicated:

1. The acutely disturbed or hysterical patient.

2. The acute or chronic alcoholic with anxiety withdrawal symptoms or delirium tremens.

3. As pre- and postoperative and pre- and postpartum adjunctive medication to permit reduction in narcotic dosage, allay anxiety and control emesis.

Hydroxyzine hydrochloride has also demonstrated effectiveness in controlling nausea and vomiting, excluding nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In prepartum states, the reduction in narcotic requirement effected by hydroxyzine is of particular benefit to both mother and neonate.

Hydroxyzine benefits the cardiac patient by its ability to allay the associated anxiety and apprehension attendant to certain types of heart disease. Hydroxyzine is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and may be used concurrently with this agent.

The effectiveness of hydroxyzine in long term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

INDICATIONS & USAGE For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. Useful in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses and in histamine-mediated pruritus. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally.

Bronchodilator activity, and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases has mild antisecretory activity.

### Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on acute pain management [^be2b35be]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Perioperative acute pain management—purpose, focus, and application—aims to facilitate the safety and effectiveness of acute pain care, reduce adverse outcomes, maintain patients’ functional abilities and well‑being, and enhance quality of life, with a focus on adult (including geriatric) and pediatric patients undergoing inpatient or outpatient surgery. Modalities addressed require a higher level of professional expertise and organizational structure than “as needed” intramuscular or intravenous injections of opioid analgesics, the document is not an exhaustive compendium, and complex interactions in certain populations make it impractical to address their pain management within this document. Although patients undergoing painful procedures may benefit from anxiolytics and sedatives with analgesics and local anesthetics when indicated, these Guidelines do not specifically address the use of anxiolysis or sedation during such procedures. The Guidelines are intended for use by anesthesiologists and individuals who deliver care under anesthesiologist supervision and may also serve as a resource for other physicians and healthcare professionals and may be used by policymakers to promote effective and patient‑centered care.

Medication classes associated with postoperative delirium in older adults—Current evidence most strongly associates use of anticholinergic drugs, meperidine and benzodiazepines with increased postoperative delirium, and studies have identified the following medications with increased delirium: diphenhydramine, meperidine, midazolam, and anticholinergic medications. Relevant medications or medication classes include benzodiazepines, anticholinergics (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, oxybutynin, chlorpromazine, promethazine, tricyclic antidepressants, paroxetine and drugs with high anticholinergic properties), diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, histamine-receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine), sedative-hypnotics, and meperidine. Drugs that contribute to serotonin syndrome can increase delirium risk, as can the use of multiple medications (five or greater). Specific conditions may warrant use of these medications; for example, a patient with a history of alcohol abuse or chronic benzodiazepine usage may require treatment with a benzodiazepine to prevent withdrawal complications, or a patient may require treatment with diphenhydramine for a severe allergy or transfusion reaction.

### Nalbuphine hydrochloride [^a09a942c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be administered as a supplement to general anesthesia only by persons specifically trained in the use of intravenous anesthetics and management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids.

Naloxone, resuscitative and intubation equipment and oxygen should be readily available.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time ‎consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. ‎Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve ‎titration to higher doses of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection ‎for patients in whom lower ‎doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of ‎using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.‎

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to ‎adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual ‎patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, ‎especially when initiating and following dosage increases with ‎Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection‎. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when ‎making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].‎

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

Initial Dosage

The usual recommended adult dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary. Use the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain, physical status of the patient, and other medications which the patient may be receiving [see WARNINGS]. In nontolerant individuals, the recommended single maximum dose is 20 mg with a maximum total daily dose of 160 mg.

The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection as a supplement to balanced anesthesia requires larger doses than those recommended for analgesia. Induction doses of nalbuphine hydrochloride range from 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg intravenously to be administered over a 10-to-15-minute period with maintenance doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg in single intravenous administrations as required. The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may be followed by respiratory depression which can be reversed with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride.

### Label: HYDROXYZINE HYDROCHLORIDE tablet (...) [^ea51ea21]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydroxyzine's clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration. INDICATIONS AND USAGE For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. Useful in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses and in histamine-mediated pruritus. Anticholinergic: Dry mouth. Central Nervous System: Drowsiness is usually transitory and may disappear in a few days of continued therapy or upon reduction of dose. Involuntary motor activity including rare instances of tremor and convulsions have been reported, usually with doses considerably higher than those recommended. Clinically significant respiratory depression has not been reported at recommended doses. If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced.

Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and levarterenol or metaraminol. Do not use epinephrine as hydroxyzine counteracts its pressor action. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested: adults, 50 to 100 mg q. i. d. ; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; children over 6 years, 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses. For use in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses and in histamine-mediated pruritus: adults, 25 mg t. i. d. or q. i. d. ; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; children over 6 years, 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses.

As a sedative when used as a premedication and following general anesthesia: 50 to 100 mg for adults and 0. 6 mg/kg of body weight in children. When treatment is initiated by the intramuscular route of administration, subsequent doses may be administered orally. As with all potent medication, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy.

### Hydroxyzine for lowering patient's anxiety during prehospital morphine analgesia: a prospective randomized double blind study [^4b98e2a0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine drug used for symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension. We hypothesized that managing the anxiety of patients with severe pain by adding hydroxyzine to a conventional intravenous morphine titration would relieve their pain more effectively.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled group study of prehospital patients with acute pain scored greater than or equal to 6 on a 0-10 verbal numeric rating scale (NRS). Patients'anxiety was measured with the self-reported Face Anxiety Scale (FAS) ranking from 0 to 4. The percentage of patients with pain relief (NRS score ≤ 3) 15 min after the first injection was the primary outcome.

Results

One hundred forty patients were enrolled. Fifty-one percent (95% CI 39% to 63%) of hydroxyzine patients versus 52% (95% CI 40% to 64%) of placebo patients reported a pain numeric rating scale score of 3 or lower at 15 min. Ninety-one percent (95% CI 83% to 98%) of patients receiving hydroxyzine reported no more severe anxiety versus 78% (95% CI 68% to 88%) of patients with placebo (p > 0.05). Adverse events were minor, with no difference between groups (6% in hydroxyzine patients and 14% in placebo patients).

Conclusion

Addition of hydroxyzine to morphine in the prehospital setting did not reduce pain or anxiety in patients with acute severe pain and therefore is not indicated based on our results.

Institutional responsibilities for perioperative pain management—For optimal pain management, ongoing education and training are essential for new personnel, to maintain skills, and whenever therapeutic approaches are modified. Anesthesiologists and other healthcare providers should use standardized, validated instruments to facilitate the regular evaluation and documentation of pain intensity, the effects of pain therapy, and side effects caused by the therapy. Anesthesiologists responsible for perioperative analgesia should be available at all times to consult with ward nurses, surgeons, or other involved physicians, should assist in evaluating patients who are experiencing problems with any aspect of perioperative pain relief, should provide services within the framework of an Acute Pain Service, and should participate in developing standardized institutional policies and procedures.

Preoperative and Postoperative Use

As an adjunct to preoperative or postoperative medication, 25 to 50 mg of promethazine hydrochloride injection in adults may be combined with appropriately reduced doses of analgesics and atropine-like drugs as desired. Dosage of concomitant analgesic or hypnotic medication should be reduced accordingly (see Precautions - Drug Interactions).

Promethazine hydrochloride is contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age.

Obstetrics

Promethazine hydrochloride injection in doses of 50 mg will provide sedation and relieve apprehension in the early stages of labor. When labor is definitely established, 25 to 75 mg (average dose, 50 mg) promethazine hydrochloride injection may be given with an appropriately reduced dose of any desired narcotic (see Precautions - Drug Interactions). If necessary, promethazine hydrochloride injection with a reduced dose of analgesic may be repeated once or twice at four-hour intervals in the course of a normal labor. A maximum total dose of 100 mg of promethazine hydrochloride injection may be administered during a 24-hour period to patients in labor.

Pediatric Patients

Promethazine hydrochloride injection is contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age (see Warnings - Respiratory Depression). Caution should be exercised when administering promethazine hydrochloride to pediatric patients 2 years of age or older. It is recommended that the lowest effective dose of promethazine hydrochloride be used in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older and concomitant administration of other drugs with respiratory depressant effects be avoided (see Warnings - Respiratory Depression).

In pediatric patients 2 years of age and older, the dosage should not exceed half that of the suggested adult dose. As an adjunct to premedication, the suggested dose is 1.1 mg per kg of body weight in combination with an appropriately reduced dose of narcotic or barbiturate and the appropriate dose of an atropine-like drug (see Precautions - Drug Interactions). Antiemetics should not be used in vomiting of unknown etiology in pediatric patients.

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^69e679dd]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Perioperative analgesia in the older adult—Older adults (>65 years) in particular are sensitive to opioid analgesics, and use of medications beyond the minimum doses needed to achieve adequate analgesia should be avoided; opioids can lead to complications such as cognitive dysfunction or delirium, and older adults are at higher risk for hemodynamic and respiratory impairments associated with opioid analgesics. Anesthesiologists offering perioperative analgesia services should provide, in collaboration with other health care professionals as appropriate, ongoing education and training to ensure that hospital personnel are knowledgeable and skilled with regard to the effective and safe use of the available treatment options within the institution. Every older adult patient should receive a directed pain history and physical examination. An appropriate analgesic plan should be developed in every older adult patient prior to an operation, and this plan should be multimodal in nature and accomplish the following: be appropriately titrated for the increased sensitivity and altered physiology of the older adult; include a prophylactic pharmacologic bowel regimen such as a stool softener (for example, docusate) and stimulant laxative (for example, bisacodyl) when appropriate, and Oral mineral oil should be avoided (Beers criteria); avoid potentially inappropriate medications as defined by the American Geriatrics Society Beers criteria, with common analgesics and anxiolytics to avoid including Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon), Pentazocine, Meperidine, Skeletal muscle relaxants (carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine), and Non-Cox NSAIDs; and Use opioid-sparing techniques, which may include preoperative, intraoperative, and/or scheduled postoperative acetaminophen or the addition of regional techniques such as neuraxial blockade or peripheral nerve blocks.

Anesthetic protocol

Hydroxyzine 2 mg.kg -1 was given orally 12 h and 2 h before anesthesia as premedication. Before induction of anesthesia, patients were randomly allocated to either Placebo group or Propacetamol group. Randomization was based on computer-generated codes maintained in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. The preparation of the propacetamol or saline infusion was done by a nurse who was not in charge of the patient. The anesthetist, the patient and the nurse's staff caring for the patients in the recovery room were unaware of the treatment group. In both groups, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2.5 mg.kg -1 followed by a slow bolus (1 min) of remifentanil 1 mcg.kg -1. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by atracurium 0.5 mg.kg -1. Anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil 0.1 mcg.kg -1.min -1 and isoflurane (0.5–1.0% end-tidal) with nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in 50% oxygen. Remifentanil infusion rate was increased or decreased by 0.05 mcg.kg.min -1 in order to maintain an arterial systolic pressure of 20% more or less than the baseline value. One hour before the end of surgery, which corresponded to the beginning of the skin closure, patients received either propacetamol 2 g in 50 cc saline (Propacetamol group) or 50 cc saline alone (Placebo group) infused over 10 min. At the end of surgery, administration of isoflurane and N 2 O were withdrawn and the patient was transferred in the recovery room. The anaesthetist, the patient and the nurse's staff caring for the patients in the recovery room were unaware of the treatment group. Remifentanil infusion was interrupted when the patient arrived in recovery room. Tracheal extubation was performed within a few minutes after remifentanil discontinuation. Clinical monitoring included heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oxymetry, respiratory rate, and sedation score (0: awake, 1: drowsy and 2: asleep).

Other subpopulations—guidance notes that patients who are critically ill, cognitively impaired, or who have communication difficulties present unique challenges; techniques that reduce drug dosages required to provide effective analgesia (e.g., regional analgesia and multimodal analgesia) may be suitable for such patients, whereas behavioral modalities and techniques such as PCA that depend upon self-administration are generally less suitable for the cognitively impaired; the literature is insufficient to evaluate methods specific to these populations (Category D evidence); anesthesiologists should recognize that such patients may require additional interventions and should consider a therapeutic trial of an analgesic in patients with increased blood pressure and heart rate or agitated behavior when causes other than pain have been excluded.

WARNINGS

Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation

Adults and Pediatrics: Intravenous midazolam hydrochloride has been associated with respiratory depression and respiratory arrest, especially when used for sedation in noncritical care settings. In some cases, where this was not recognized promptly and treated effectively, death or hypoxic encephalopathy has resulted. Intravenous midazolam hydrochloride should be used only in hospital or ambulatory care settings, including physicians’ and dental offices, that provide for continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function, e.g., pulse oximetry. Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be assured (see WARNINGS). For deeply sedated pediatric patients, a dedicated individual, other than the practitioner performing the procedure, should monitor the patient throughout the procedure.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS/Drug Interactions).

Individualization of Dosage

Midazolam hydrochloride must never be used without individualization of dosage. The initial intravenous dose for sedation in adult patients may be as little as 1 mg, but should not exceed 2.5 mg in a normal healthy adult. Lower doses are necessary for older (over 60 years) or debilitated patients and in patients receiving concomitant narcotics or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. The initial dose and all subsequent doses should always be titrated slowly; administer over at least 2 minutes and allow an additional 2 or more minutes to fully evaluate the sedative effect. The use of the 1 mg/mL formulation or dilution of the 1 mg/mL formulation is recommended to facilitate slower injection. Doses of sedative medications in pediatric patients must be calculated on a mg/kg basis, and initial doses and all subsequent doses should always be titrated slowly. The initial pediatric dose of midazolam for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia is age, procedure, and route dependent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete dosing information).

Neonates : Midazolam hydrochloride should not be administered by rapid injection in the neonatal population. Severe hypotension and seizures have been reported following rapid IV administration, particularly with concomitant use of fentanyl (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete information).

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^64d38a83]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

2012 AGS Beers Criteria—central nervous system medications in older adults identify multiple potentially inappropriate drugs and explicit avoidances. Tertiary tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), alone or in combination (Amitriptyline; Chlordiazepoxide-amitriptyline; Clomipramine; Doxepin >6 mg/day; Imipramine; Perphenazine-amitriptyline; Trimipramine) are highly anticholinergic, sedating, and cause orthostatic hypotension; the safety profile of low-dose doxepin (≤6 mg/day) is comparable to that of placebo. Antipsychotics, first- (conventional) and second- (atypical) generation, have increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and mortality in persons with dementia, and the recommendation is to Avoid use for behavioral problems of dementia unless nonpharmacologic options have failed and patient is threat to self or others. Thioridazine and Mesoridazine are noted as highly anticholinergic with greater risk of QT-interval prolongation. Barbiturates are described as having a high rate of physical dependence, tolerance to sleep benefits, and greater risk of overdose at low dosages. For benzodiazepines, older adults have increased sensitivity and decreased metabolism of long-acting agents and in general all benzodiazepines increase risk of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle accidents in older adults; the recommendation is to Avoid benzodiazepines (any type) for treatment of insomnia, agitation, or delirium, while they may be appropriate for seizure disorders, rapid eye movement sleep disorders, benzodiazepine withdrawal, ethanol withdrawal, severe generalized anxiety disorder, periprocedural anesthesia, and end-of-life care.

### Comparison of the effects of clonidine and hydroxyzine on haemodynamic and catecholamine reactions to microlaryngoscopy [^8d2b74e4]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

This study compares the effect of oral clonidine vs. hydroxyzine on the haemodynamic and catecholamine responses to microlaryngoscopy.

Methods

Thirty-five ASA II-III patients were included in this double-blind randomized trial. The patients received either hydroxyzine 1 mg kg-1 (n = 18) or clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 (n = 17) for their oral premedication 100 min before an intravenous induction of anaesthesia using propofol (2-3 mg kg-1) and fentanyl (2 micrograms kg-1). Arterial pressure and heart rate were measured before premedication, and throughout the procedure and recovery. Plasma catecholamine levels were determined before premedication, after induction, and 1.5, 30 and 120 min after laryngoscopy.

Results

Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower after clonidine, whereas there was no difference in heart rate and plasma catecholamine levels between the two groups.

Conclusions

Clonidine for premedication significantly decreased mean arterial pressure during microlaryngoscopy and the following recovery phase but did not modify the overall haemodynamic response to the suspension microlaryngoscopic nociceptive stimulus.

### Perioperative pain management [^d706ae66]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Perioperative pain management requires a multifaceted approach. The local inflammatory injury and the local and centrally mediated responses must be understood and evaluated to be treated appropriately. This article reviews the different classes of medication and where each one fits into a pain management plan. The implementation of multimodal therapy, which combines different techniques, routes of administration, and different drugs, must be managed. Our ultimate goals are to provide safe and effective pain management, reduce adverse outcomes, preserve patients' physical and psychological well-being, and improve the quality of life for patients with acute pain during the perioperative period.

As with all potent medication, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy. If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, it should be induced. Immediate gastric lavage is also recommended. General supportive care, including frequent monitoring of the vital signs and close observation of the patient, is indicated. Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and levarterenol or metaraminol. Do not use epinephrine as hydroxyzine counteracts its pressor action. For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. Useful in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses and in histamine-mediated pruritus. Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally.

Bronchodilator activity, and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically. An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated. Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases has mild antisecretory activity.

### Promethazine hydrochloride (Phenergan) [^be312cd7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Important Administration Information for Adult and Pediatric Patients 2 Years of Age and Older

The preferred route of administration of PHENERGAN injection is by deep intramuscular administration (see WARNINGS - Severe Tissue Injury, Including Gangrene).
PHENERGAN injection may be administered intravenously after dilution as recommended below (see Preparation and Administration). If pain occurs at the injection site during intravenous infusion, immediately discontinue the infusion, and evaluate for possible arterial injection or perivascular extravasation.

Allergic Conditions

The average adult dose is 25 mg. This dose may be
 repeated within two hours if necessary, but continued therapy,
 if indicated, should be via the oral route as soon as existing
 circumstances permit. After initiation of treatment, dosage
 should be adjusted to the smallest amount adequate to relieve
 symptoms. The average adult dose for amelioration of allergic
 reactions to blood or plasma is 25 mg.

Sedation

In hospitalized adult patients, nighttime sedation may be
 achieved by a dose of 25 to 50 mg of PHENERGAN
 Injection.

Nausea and Vomiting

For control of nausea and vomiting, the usual adult dose
is 12.5 to 25 mg, not to be repeated more frequently than every
four hours. When used for control of postoperative nausea and
vomiting, the dosage of analgesics and barbiturates should be
reduced accordingly (see PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions).

Antiemetics should not be used in vomiting of unknown
etiology in children and adolescents (see PRECAUTIONS – Pediatric Use).

Preoperative and Postoperative Use

As an adjunct to preoperative or postoperative
medication, 25 to 50 mg of PHENERGAN Injection in adults may be
combined with appropriately reduced doses of analgesics and
atropine-like drugs as desired. Dosage of concomitant analgesic
or hypnotic medication should be reduced accordingly (see PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions).

PHENERGAN is contraindicated for use in pediatric
patients less than two years of age.

Obstetrics

PHENERGAN Injection in doses of 50 mg will provide
sedation and relieve apprehension in the early stages of labor.
When labor is definitely established, 25 to 75 mg (average dose,
50 mg) PHENERGAN Injection may be given with an appropriately
reduced dose of any desired narcotic (see PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions). If necessary,
PHENERGAN Injection with a reduced dose of analgesic may be
repeated once or twice at four-hour intervals in the course of a
normal labor. A maximum total dose of 100 mg of PHENERGAN
Injection may be administered during a 24-hour period to
patients in labor.

Geriatric surgical patient medication management—The patient’s complete medication list, including over the counter medications, supplements, vitamins, and herbal agents, should be reviewed and documented, and nonessential medications should be stopped in the days leading up to surgery while medications with withdrawal potential or that are medically indicated during the perioperative period should be continued. Ideally, a plan regarding the discontinuation or continuation for each of the patient’s chronic medications has already been implemented prior to the arrival to the holding area. In the immediate preoperative period, providers should repeat their review of the patient’s medications and confirm that recommendations regarding management have been implemented, including discontinuation of nonessential medications with general considerations that may include the potential for withdrawal, the progression of disease with interruption of drug therapy, and the potential for interactions with anesthetic agents, continuation of essential medications, and planning for the resumption of all other baseline outpatient medications in the postoperative period with consideration for minimizing polypharmacy risk.

5.4.4 Preoperative corticosteroids

Statement 108. We recommend that prior to elective surgery for Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, corticosteroids should be stopped or dose minimised wherever possible to reduce risk of postoperative complications (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 94.6%).

Patients undergoing IBD surgery while on corticosteroids have an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications and anastomotic leaks.There is some evidence that risks are greater for those taking high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisolone or more).A comparison of prednisolone doses greater than 20 mg versus 20 mg or less did not show a significant difference in risk of infections.Use of more than ≥15 mg oral corticosteroid in UC patients within 30 days of IPAA surgery, or more than ≥20 mg in the setting of proctocolectomy, is associated with increased risk of complications.IBD patients having elective surgery should have their corticosteroids stopped if possible, or brought to as low a dose that can be managed without deterioration.

Statement 109. We recommend that IBD patients who have been on oral corticosteroids for more than 4 weeks prior to surgery should receive an equivalent intravenous dose of hydrocortisone while nil by mouth in the perioperative period (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Patients who are on corticosteroids at the time of their IBD surgery should be given intravenous hydrocortisone in equivalent dosage until they can resume oral prednisolone.Prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to hydrocortisone 20 mg or methylprednisolone 4 mg. There is no value increasing steroid dosage to cover stress in the perioperative period, as shown in a randomised trial in IBD surgeryand case series.Anaesthetists will generally give a single steroid dose prior to induction (such as dexamethasone 4 mg intravenous or intramuscular) for those taking more than 5 mg prednisolone.Patients who are on physiological corticosteroid replacement because of disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (such as oral hydrocortisone 20 mg mane, 10 mg nocte) should receive supplementary doses in the perioperative period.For patients who have had complete resection of active disease, it is important to avoid inappropriate prolongation of steroids after surgery, and there is virtue in standardised steroid-taper protocols in the postoperative period, dependent on the dose and duration of steroids preoperatively (table 11).

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^7308df31]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) rescue after failed prophylaxis—The more important findings of the review were from trials where prophylaxis was given but failed. For patients failing ondansetron prophylaxis, redosing with ondansetron or other 5-HT3 antagonists did not provide further benefits (A3, low certainty). Promethazine 6.25 mg and higher shows to be more effective in patients who failed ondansetron prophylaxis over the redosing of ondansetron (B1, low certainty). For promethazine, there is not an apparent dose response in the range of 6.25-25 mg, hence the lowest dose is recommended. The higher doses of promethazine in this range have been associated with sedation.

Hospitalized Patients

As with outpatients, start with low doses and increase dosage gradually. In severe behavior disorders, higher dosages (50-100 mg daily, and in older children, 200 mg daily or more) may be necessary. There is little evidence that behavior improvement in severely disturbed mentally retarded patients is further enhanced by doses beyond 500 mg per day. Maximum IM Dosage: Patients up to 5 years (or 50 lbs.), not over 40 mg/day; 5-12 years (or 50-100 lbs.), not over 75 mg/day except in unmanageable cases.

NAUSEA AND VOMITING

Dosage and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms and response of the patient. The duration of activity following intramuscular administration may last up to 12 hours. Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary. IM: 1/4 mg/lb body weight q6-8h, prn. Maximum IM Dosage: Pediatric patients 6 months to 5 years (or 50 lbs.), not over 40 mg/day; 5-12 years (or 50-100 lbs.), not over 75 mg/day except in severe cases.

During Surgery

IM: 1/8 mg/lb body weight. Repeat in 1/2 hour if necessary and if no hypotension occurs. IV: 1 mg per fractional injection at 2-minute intervals and not exceeding recommended IM dosage. Always dilute to 1 mg/mL, i.e., 1 mL (25 mg) mixed with 24 mL of saline.

Study procedure

The patients were informed about the study protocol during the preoperative anaesthesia consultation. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients on the day before surgery. The study randomization was stratified by sex, the EuroSCORE II risk, and the surgery time slot (morning or afternoon) prior to each patient’s entrance to the operating room. The medical and paramedical teams in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the surgeons were all blind as to the allocated treatment. The patients’ premedication consisted of hydroxyzine associated (or not) with a benzodiazepine both the day before and on the morning of the intervention. Pregabalin and gabapentin were forbidden during the study.

General anaesthesia was induced via a target-controlled infusion of propofol and sufentanil. A bolus of cisatracurium (0.15 mg/kg) was realized prior to tracheal intubation. In the absence of any contra-indication, tranexamic acid was injected. Antibiotic prophylaxis was realized with cefamandole or vancomycin in case of allergy. Arterial and central venous catheters were inserted. Anaesthesia was maintained using a halogenated anesthetic at a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.8 for myocardial preconditioning with sufentanil and curare given as a bolus or via a continuous infusion. The hypnotic was replaced with propofol by means of a target-controlled infusion after the start of the cardiopulmonary bypass.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) continues to be a "big little problem" despite recent advances in anesthesia. Because of an increased interest in, and the abundant publications on this topic, guidelines for the management of PONV were published in 2003. Several key but controversial issues regarding PONV prophylaxis were left unaddressed, however. These included whether clinical differences exist between the 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, concern over optimal dosage and timing of administration, optimal 5-HT3 receptor antagonist combination therapy, and whether rescue therapy is effective after prior administration of the same or a different 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The application of these antiemetics in clinical practice has raised questions regarding the role of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in the treatment of postdischarge nausea and vomiting and opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. A brief overview of the incidence, risk factors and current management recommendations for PONV and current controversies with special emphasis on the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, is discussed.
