## Question

causes of burping

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of burping (eructation) and how to categorize them, with attention to mechanisms, populations, and red flags. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology of burping and the role of the upper esophageal sphincter. Then, I should verify the major etiologic buckets: aerophagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, functional disorders, medication effects, and structural or neuromuscular causes. Next, I will examine population-specific nuances in infants, adults, and patients with chronic kidney disease. After that, I should review diagnostic implications and when to escalate testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, hierarchical framework and highlight key takeaways, making sure I double-check any claims that might overstate evidence or conflate mechanisms along the way.

> Let me first confirm the basic physiology so I don't jump to conclusions: burping is the retrograde expulsion of gas from the stomach or esophagus through the mouth, which requires coordinated relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and cricopharyngeus to allow gas egress; failure of UES relaxation underlies the inability to burp seen in retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction, which helps anchor the mechanistic framework I'll use [^114pCdwq].

> Now, I will categorize the causes, but wait, let me verify that I'm not mixing mechanisms and labels: the most common driver is aerophagia, i.e., swallowed air from rapid eating/drinking, talking while eating, carbonated beverages, gum chewing, smoking, or anxiety; this aligns with standard definitions and behavioral descriptions of belching, and it explains why supragastric belching is often prominent in functional presentations [^116RfmGh].

> Next, I should review gastroesophageal reflux disease as a cause of burping; GERD frequently presents with heartburn, regurgitation, and burping due to transient LES relaxations and acid reflux, and burping is explicitly listed among GERD symptoms in regulatory and clinical sources, so I need to ensure I keep GERD high on the differential when burping coexists with reflux symptoms or sour taste [^113JcMmd] [^114QWyHV].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of functional disorders: excessive belching can be a behavioral manifestation of aerophagia and supragastric belching, and burping is commonly captured in dyspepsia symptom instruments, reflecting overlap with functional dyspepsia; Rome IV frameworks for bloating and distention also intersect with belching complaints, so I need to consider functional etiologies when structural disease is absent [^116RfmGh] [^113WJDW2] [^112Hgsxb].

> I will now examine medication-induced burping; omega-3 fatty acid formulations commonly cause burping and dyspepsia, and this is consistently noted in FDA labeling and guideline discussions of prescription omega-3 products, so I should double-check supplement and prescription histories when burping is new or dose-related [^111gULuZ] [^112xzTob] [^116V4aPf].

> But wait, what if the issue is structural or neuromuscular; I need to check for retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction, where impaired UES relaxation produces lifelong inability to burp with bloating, gurgling, and flatulence, and where botulinum toxin to the cricopharyngeus is effective; this is a distinct cause of "burping problems" rather than frequent burping per se, so I should not conflate the two [^114pCdwq] [^112VmnwV] [^114WfmBF].

> Let me consider population-specific nuances, starting with infants; burping is culturally ubiquitous after feeds, yet randomized and observational data suggest no reduction in colic and a possible increase in regurgitation with routine burping, so I should be cautious about recommending universal burping and instead tailor to infant risk and feeding context; conversely, reflux precautions in infants include upright positioning and smaller, more frequent feeds, with burping during feeds as a reasonable, evidence-informed option rather than a blanket mandate [^115z8SFk] [^1147CJEB] [^1129Tdzn].

> Next, I should review adult populations; GERD prevalence is substantial globally, and burping is a common symptom alongside heartburn and regurgitation, so in adults with frequent burping I should screen for reflux and modifiable risks like obesity, carbonated drinks, and late meals; additionally, in chronic kidney disease, belching appears more prevalent in peritoneal dialysis cohorts, suggesting intraperitoneal pressure and volume dynamics may modulate reflux and belching, though data are mixed and warrant cautious interpretation [^114QWyHV] [^115ySsBp] [^111TSjBb].

> I need to ensure I address diagnostic implications; when burping is accompanied by alarm features or refractory symptoms, I should consider endoscopy, pH-impedance testing, or esophageal manometry, and in suspected R-CPD, high-resolution manometry with a carbonated challenge can demonstrate characteristic UES abnormalities; conversely, in straightforward aerophagia or mild GERD without alarms, empiric lifestyle measures and PPI therapy may suffice, reserving invasive testing for nonresponders [^112Hgsxb] [^113EBvh7] [^112JJTpu].

> Let me synthesize a practical framework, but I should double-check that it reflects the evidence: primary causes include aerophagia, GERD, functional belching disorders, medication effects (notably omega-3s), and structural/neuromuscular causes like R-CPD; contributory factors include rapid eating, carbonated beverages, anxiety, and certain feeding practices; red flags include inability to burp, progressive dysphagia, weight loss, anemia, or refractory symptoms despite therapy, prompting targeted testing; management ranges from behavioral strategies and reflux control to botulinum toxin for R-CPD, with shared decision-making around risks and benefits [^1178meLf] [^114WfmBF].

> Key takeaway, and let me reconsider to ensure accuracy: burping is a normal reflex, but when excessive or accompanied by atypical features, I should distinguish swallowed air from reflux, functional disorders, medication effects, and UES dysfunction; evidence is strongest for GERD and aerophagia as common drivers, while infant burping practices lack robust benefit signals and should be individualized, and R-CPD represents a treatable cause of burping inability rather than frequent burping, which is a different clinical problem altogether [^114QWyHV] [^115z8SFk] [^114pCdwq].

Burping (eructation) is the release of gas from the stomach or esophagus through the mouth [^1178meLf]. The most common cause is **swallowed air (aerophagia)** from eating or drinking too fast, talking while eating, chewing gum, smoking, or anxiety [^11361Ytm]. Other causes include **carbonated beverages**, **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** [^113JcMmd], and certain medications such as omega-3 fatty acids [^111gULuZ] and proton pump inhibitors [^notfound]. Less common causes include Helicobacter pylori infection, gastroparesis, and retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (RCPD) [^notfound]. Burping is usually benign, but frequent or persistent burping with symptoms like heartburn, nausea, or abdominal pain may indicate an underlying condition and should be evaluated [^116RfmGh].

---

## Physiological mechanism of burping

Burping occurs when gas accumulates in the stomach or esophagus and is expelled through the mouth [^1178meLf]. This process involves **relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)** and expulsion of gas through the esophagus and mouth [^notfound].

---

## Common causes of burping

### Swallowed air (aerophagia)

Swallowed air is the **most common cause** of burping and results from behaviors that increase air intake, such as:

- Eating or drinking too quickly
- Talking while eating
- Chewing gum
- Smoking
- Anxiety or stress

---

### Carbonated beverages

Carbonated drinks release carbon dioxide gas in the stomach, increasing gastric gas and causing burping [^1178meLf].

---

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

GERD causes stomach acid to reflux into the esophagus, leading to irritation and increased burping [^113JcMmd]. Common symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation, and sour taste [^notfound].

---

### Medications

Certain medications can cause burping as a side effect, including:

- Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil supplements) [^111gULuZ]
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) [^notfound]
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

---

## Less common causes of burping

### Helicobacter pylori infection

H. pylori infection can cause gastritis or peptic ulcers, leading to increased burping and gastrointestinal symptoms [^1164BvgD].

---

### Gastroparesis

Delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) can cause gas accumulation and frequent burping [^notfound].

---

### Retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (RCPD)

RCPD is a rare disorder characterized by the inability to burp due to dysfunction of the cricopharyngeal muscle, leading to significant discomfort and bloating [^114pCdwq].

---

## When to seek medical attention

While burping is usually harmless, persistent or excessive burping accompanied by the following symptoms may indicate an underlying medical condition and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional:

- Heartburn or acid reflux
- Nausea or vomiting
- Abdominal pain or discomfort
- Difficulty swallowing
- Unintentional weight loss

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

If burping is persistent or accompanied by concerning symptoms, diagnostic evaluation may include:

- Detailed medical history and physical examination
- Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
- Esophageal manometry
- pH monitoring
- Imaging studies (e.g. X-ray, ultrasound)

---

## Treatment and management

Treatment of burping depends on the underlying cause and may include:

- Lifestyle modifications (e.g. eating slowly, avoiding carbonated beverages, managing stress) [^notfound]
- Dietary changes (e.g. avoiding trigger foods, smaller meals)
- Medications (e.g. antacids, proton pump inhibitors, prokinetics) [^113JcMmd]
- Behavioral therapy for aerophagia [^notfound]
- Botulinum toxin injection for RCPD [^114WfmBF]

---

Burping is a common physiological process caused by the release of gas from the stomach or esophagus. Common causes include swallowed air, carbonated beverages, **GERD**, and certain medications. Persistent or excessive burping with **concerning symptoms** may indicate an **underlying medical condition** and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.

Conclusion

Burping remains a nearly universal part of newborn care, yet its continued use is largely rooted in cultural tradition rather than evidence. Current data, including the only available randomised controlled trial, indicate no benefit in preventing colic and a possible increase in regurgitation episodes. This review highlights the mechanical diversity and practical considerations of common burping techniques while reinforcing that no standardised, evidence-based guideline currently exists. Future studies should aim to delineate whether specific subgroups of infants, such as those with feeding intolerance or reflux, might benefit from targeted approaches and whether caregiver-reported comfort has measurable physiological benefits.

Abstract

Infantile colic and regurgitation are common benign causes of distress in infants, often leading caregivers to employ burping after feeds despite limited scientific evidence of its efficacy. Burping is widely believed to release swallowed air, reduce regurgitation and minimise colic; however, current research does not support its benefit for colic prevention. We summarise in this report common burping techniques, their mechanical basis and implications for infant care. This brief review highlights the lack of standardised guidelines and underscores the need for well-designed studies to clarify the role of burping in modern neonatal practice. Burping after feeding is commonly advised by medical care providers like paediatricians, nurses, relatives and parenting websites, even though the scientific evidence for the efficacy of burping is lacking. There is no literature on various techniques of burping and the benefits associated with each. The only literature on burping efficacy showed no benefits. Burping is a widely practiced caregiving routine in newborn care, believed to release swallowed air, reduce regurgitation and minimise colic. Despite its near-universal application, scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of burping in healthy term infants remains limited and conflicting. Caregivers employ various burping techniques based on cultural traditions, paediatric advice and experiential knowledge, yet there is no clear consensus or standardised guideline to recommend one method over another. This review aims to summarise and evaluate the commonly practiced burping techniques, examining their mechanical principles, practical considerations and potential benefits or limitations for newborns and caregivers.

Evidence gap

Despite widespread cultural reliance on burping, robust comparative studies are absent. The only randomised control trial (71 dyads) demonstrated no reduction in colic and a significant increase in regurgitation. Observational data highlight heavy reliance on family traditions rather than healthcare professionals, underscoring educational gaps.

Introduction

Burping is a long-standing and widely practiced caregiving technique in newborns, intended to release swallowed air and reduce discomfort, colic and regurgitation. Despite its routine use across cultures, the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of burping in reducing colic or regurgitation remains limited and mixed. Recent randomised controlled trials suggest that while burping is a common practice, it may not significantly lower colic episodes and could even increase regurgitation in healthy term infants.

In neonatal care, particularly in the neonatal intensive care unit, feeding intolerance, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) and delayed gastric emptying are critical concerns that can impact an infant's growth, development and length of hospital stay. Nurses often turn to non-invasive techniques such as positioning to support feeding tolerance, with right lateral positioning believed to enhance gastric emptying and left lateral positioning favoured for reducing GER symptoms. However, the complex interplay of gastric motility and reflux in individual infants often requires a nuanced approach.

This review article aims to critically examine the current evidence on burping techniques in newborns, explore the physiological basis behind their use and integrate findings on complementary strategies such as positioning. By synthesising available research, we hope to clarify the role of burping in modern neonatal practice and identify gaps where further investigation is needed to optimise care for both healthy and at-risk infants.

This report is not intended as clinical guidance but rather as a concise, evidence-based commentary to highlight the gap between widespread burping practices and limited empirical support. By summarising current knowledge and identifying areas requiring further research, we aim to stimulate academic and clinical discussion rather than issue practice recommendations.

Omeprazole can have other serious side effects. See "What are the possible side effects of omeprazole?"

What are omeprazole delayed-release capsules?

Omeprazole delayed-release capsules is a prescription medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Omeprazole delayed-release capsules reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are used in adults:

for up to 8 weeks for the healing of duodenal ulcers. The duodenal area is the area where food passes when it leaves the stomach.
with certain antibiotics to treat an infection caused by bacteria called H. pylori. Sometimes H. pylori bacteria can cause duodenal ulcers. The infection needs to be treated to prevent the ulcers from coming back.
for up to 8 weeks for healing stomach ulcers
for up to 4 weeks to treat heartburn and other symptoms that happen with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the tube (esophagus) that connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping.

Overview of burping techniques

The main burping techniques employed by caregivers can be grouped into six approaches. In the over-the-shoulder method, the infant is positioned upright against the caregiver's shoulder with the chin supported while the back is gently patted, a technique adaptable to sitting, standing or walking. In the face-down across the lap technique, the infant is laid prone across the caregiver's lap with the chin supported, offering stability but requiring the caregiver to remain seated. The sitting upright on the lap method involves seating the infant on the caregiver's lap with chest support and gentle chin stabilisation, leaning the infant slightly forward while patting the back to balance upright posture with forward tilt. In the prone on flat surface approach, the infant is placed tummy-down on a flat surface with the head turned to one side, allowing the caregiver to pat the back but requiring close airway monitoring. The walking or bouncing burp technique consists of holding the infant upright while the caregiver gently walks or bounces, providing soothing rhythmic motion, though it can be physically demanding. Finally, the over-arm burp (Tiger hold) involves laying the infant prone over the caregiver's forearm with head support, applying gentle abdominal pressure that may ease colic or gas but requiring caregiver confidence and skill (table 1).

Clinical implications

Healthy infants: no strong evidence that burping prevents colic or reduces regurgitation.
High-risk infants (GER, feeding intolerance): positioning strategies may play a larger role than burping.
Caregiver considerations: over-the-shoulder and sitting techniques are versatile; walking or prone methods may impose higher demands or risks.

### Science of the burp: understanding aerophagia and eructation in newborns [^112av6Qp]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Each burping technique is built on principles of anatomy, gravity and motion, aiming to aid the passage of swallowed air from the stomach through the oesophagus. While the over-the-shoulder method remains the most popular due to its adaptability, sitting and prone techniques offer alternative options depending on caregiver preference, the infant's condition and contextual factors. For infants with gastrointestinal challenges, such as slowed gastric motility or GER, positioning strategies drawn from broader neonatal nursing practices suggest that the right lateral position may enhance gastric emptying, while the left lateral position may reduce reflux episodes. However, it is important to note that burping techniques and positioning are not interchangeable; their mechanisms and intended effects differ, and infants may present with overlapping digestive issues that complicate straightforward recommendations.

Despite the widespread cultural and clinical reliance on burping, robust research evidence comparing these techniques is lacking. Studies examining the incidence of colic and regurgitation have not shown significant reductions associated with burping, and some evidence suggests that certain techniques may even increase regurgitation episodes. The walking burp, while soothing, introduces physical strain that may not be sustainable for all caregivers. Ultimately, decisions about which burping technique to use are often guided by caregiver experience, infant comfort and contextual factors rather than clear scientific directives.

### Maternal knowledge and practices regarding infantile colic in palestine: a need for enhanced education and awareness [^111ph3Xy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile colic is a common condition affecting healthy infants, characterized by excessive crying and fussiness, causing discomfort for the child and psychological distress for their caregivers, particularly mothers. While the exact cause remains unknown, understanding maternal knowledge and practices regarding colic is crucial for effective management and support. This study aimed to assess Palestinian mothers' knowledge and practices regarding infantile colic, focusing on their understanding of the etiology and management strategies.

Methods

This cross-sectional study involved 450 mothers of infants diagnosed with colic attending pediatric clinics. A face-to-face questionnaire assessed maternal knowledge of the etiology, management strategies, and information sources. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 20. Chi-square tests identified any significant associations.

Results

The study revealed a wide range of maternal knowledge regarding infantile colic, with a significant proportion of mothers (55.6%) claiming prior understanding of this condition. Mothers relied heavily on family friends (40.2%) and personal experience (35.3%) for information about colic, with less reliance on healthcare professionals (13.3%). Cow's milk allergy (33.8%) and bottle feeding (29.6%) were perceived as risk factors while burping (50.4%) and keeping warm (25.6%) were seen as preventive measures. Surprisingly, few mothers linked maternal anxiety or diet (6.4%) to colic. Popular management strategies included massage (77.3%), wrapping (58.7%), and herbal remedies (53.4%). Notably, only 18.9% of mothers sought professional advice.

Conclusion

The study findings revealed a limited understanding of infantile colic among Palestinian mothers. This highlights the need for educational interventions. Healthcare providers should be more active in educating mothers and addressing the knowledge gaps.

### Comparison of gastrointestinal symptoms and findings in renal replacement therapy modalities [^111TSjBb]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Regurgitation, heartburn, dyspeptic complaints, dry cough and burping are common symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. It is stated that gastroesophageal reflux is more common in peritoneal dialysis patients than in the general population and hemodialysis patients. It is stated that the presence of excess dialysis fluid in the abdomen and high intraperitoneal pressure increase acid reflux from the stomach. Dejardin et al. evaluated the relationship between intraperitoneal pressure, intraperitoneal volume and GER in a study and found that intraperitoneal pressure had no effect on reflux formation. Holscher et al. reported that GER symptoms are seen around 30% in the normal population. In our study, the prevalence of GER was 38% in the predialysis patient group, 34% in the HD group and 45% in the PD group. Although these rates were higher than the general population, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups compared. Our study may give an idea that peritoneal dialysis treatment does not significantly increase the incidence of GER in patients with CKD; but the effect of peritoneal dialysis treatment on GER, the relationship of intraperitoneal pressure and intraperitoneal volume with GER is a less studied topic in the literature and deserves further studies.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: teach caregivers reflux precautions [^112rhKXu]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To decrease symptoms of physiological infant reflux, nonpharmacological techniques named "reflux precautions" are taught to families. Reflux precautions do not have a universal definition but can include burping, holding an infant upright pre- and postfeed, smaller and more frequent feedings, and elevating the head of the bed. Despite a lack of consensus on what constitutes reflux precautions, and a paucity of research, physicians and other providers continue to recommend them. In recommending reflux precautions, we pathologize normal physiology, sending mixed messages to families. Routine recommendation of reflux precautions for infant reflux is a Thing We Do for No Reason.

### Operating room or in-office injection for retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction botulinum toxin injection [^114pCdwq]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (RCPD), commonly known as "No Burp Syndrome", is characterized by an inability to burp. Symptoms include bloating, gurgling sounds, chest and abdominal discomfort, and excessive flatulence, all contributing to a reduced quality of life (QOL).

The cricopharyngeus muscle relaxes during swallowing and burping. to allow for the release of air. In patients with RCPD, relaxation during burping does not occur effectively, leading to the aforementioned symptoms. Although the etiology of RCPD remains unclear, one hypothesis is that abnormalities in the nerve signals controlling the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) result in inadequate muscle relaxation. Anxiety and stress may exacerbate symptoms by influencing muscle tension. Literature suggests that RCPD has a higher prevalence amongst younger, female patients and in individuals with underlying anxiety disorders or other neuromuscular conditions.

RCPD is a clinical diagnosis made following a comprehensive history and physical examination. Botulinum toxin injection to chemically denervate the CP muscle has been proposed as both diagnostic and therapeutic for this disorder. Botulinum toxin injection can be performed in the operating room (OR) or in‐office, with specific risks and benefits to each, driving physician and patient preference.

### Dexlansoprazole (kapidex) [^115WRfr3]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

KAPIDEX is used in adults:

To treat heartburn related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
To heal acid-related damage to the lining of the esophagus (called erosive
esophagitis or EE).
To stop erosive esophagitis from coming back.

What is GERD and EE?

GERD happens when acid from your stomach enters the tube (esophagus) that
connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your
chest or throat, sour taste or burping.

In some cases, acid can damage the lining of your esophagus. This damage is
called erosive esophagitis or EE.

Who Should Not Take KAPIDEX?

The active ingredient in KAPIDEX is dexlansoprazole. You should not take
KAPIDEX if you are allergic to KAPIDEX or any of its ingredients [see What is in KAPIDEX ?].

### Prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and its associated risk factors among medical students: a nation-based cross-sectional study [^114QWyHV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic disorder characterised by the regurgitation of stomach contents into the oesophagus. GERD is predicted to impact 13.98% of the adult population worldwide. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) typically present with regurgitation and heartburn following a meal; they also describe a burning sensation in the retrosternal area that may radiate to the neck or the back; heartburn may worsen when lying supine or bending over; and other, less common symptoms of GERD include dysphagia, chest pain, water brash, pain during swallowing, burping, hiccups, nausea, and vomiting.

In the absence of alarm symptoms, the diagnosis of GERD is primarily made based on symptoms. Patients with symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and regurgitation, can be diagnosed and treated empirically with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

The GerdQ questionnaire is a helpful tool, with a sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 71%, for guiding the diagnosis based on symptoms. If symptoms persist despite PPI treatment or patients presented with extraoesophageal symptoms, further diagnostic investigations may be necessary. Endoscopy, pH monitoring, and esophageal manometry are reserved for such cases.

Causes of GERD include anatomical factors like hiatal hernia and functional factors such as poor lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) resting tone and acid clearance, as well as transient LES relaxation. Obesity, dietary factors like coffee, spicy food, and carbonated beverages, smoking, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, alcohol intake, and psychological stress are all modifiable risk factors for the development of GERD.

The symptoms of GERD have been shown to be exacerbated by exposure to psychosocial stressors. An increase in heartburn symptoms was found in a study of people who already suffer from heartburn when they were exposed to stress. Although their actual acid levels are within the usual range, anxious people have a more exaggerated perception of acid events. It is theorised that stress makes patients more sensitive to acid reflux, which may explain why it seems to exacerbate symptoms. The consequences of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be extremely serious, including diminished quality of life and an increased risk of contracting other diseases.

### Esomeprazole magnesium (esomeprazole magnesium) [^117QHLZJ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules are used in adults:

- for 4 to 8 weeks to treat the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules may also be prescribed to heal acid-related damage to the lining of the esophagus (erosive esophagitis), and to help continue this healing. GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the tube (esophagus) that connects your mouth to your stomach. This may cause a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping.

- for up to 6 months to reduce the risk of stomach ulcers in some people taking pain medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

- to treat patients with a stomach infection (Helicobacter pylori), along with the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin.

- for the long-term treatment of conditions where your stomach makes too much acid, including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is a rare condition in which the stomach produces a more than normal amount of acid.

For children and adolescents 1 year to 17 years of age, esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules may be prescribed for up to 8 weeks for short-term treatment of GERD.

Burial avoidance — physical maneuvers to reduce exposure emphasize positioning and movement: When entering a high-risk avalanche path for rescue or avalanche control work, use of a belay line, securely anchored outside the path, can prevent an individual from being swept downslope by an avalanche. Travelers should cross dangerous slopes one at a time while being watched by a partner and should move between safe areas such as rock outcroppings, tree clusters, or safer adjacent slopes. Planning an escape route before entering an avalanche-prone area can increase the likelihood of avoiding being caught, and slope-cutting techniques in which one person rapidly traverses a potentially unstable slope to test stability may trigger an avalanche.

Avalanche burial — self-rescue actions — We recommend that if caught in an avalanche, immediately attempt to escape the moving snow, or, if engulfed, use any motion possible to avoid critical burial (Strong recommendation, low quality evidence). We suggest if caught in avalanche and unable to escape, attempt to jettison skis or a snowboard but do not remove a backpack (Ungraded: Expert consensus). A person about to be caught in an avalanche should immediately attempt to escape to adjacent terrain outside the avalanche, and kicking off skis or removing a snowboard may improve the likelihood of survival while victims should not remove backpacks.

### Effect evaluation of kangaroo mother care in liping area, guizhou province, China [^112TSns4]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The influence of KMC on newborn health indicators In this study, newborns' sleep time, vomiting frequency, crying time and frequency were selected as the observation indicators of neonatal health. During the research process, it was found that the number of sleep times and total sleep time in the KMC group were significantly longer than those in the control group. The analysis reasons were as follows: 1. KMC helps stabilize the newborn's vital signs, keep the newborn's sleep in a stable and comfortable state, which is conducive to long sleep 2. KMC gives newborns a sense of security, which makes it easier for newborns to fall asleep; 3. KMC can reduce the spontaneous or blind movement of the limbs caused by external stimuli after birth, and help to improve the quality of newborns' sleep. 4. The transmission of mother's temperature, heartbeat, breathing, etc. helps to reduce the incompatibility of newborns to the outside world after birth, increase comfort and form a good sleep. Good sleep helps the development of the central nervous system and promotes the growth of newborns. development. Vomiting and overflowing milk are a common phenomenon in newborns. The common causes are that the newborn's stomach volume is small, the structure and function development is not perfect, or the inhalation of more amniotic fluid causes swallowing syndrome. The increase in frequency and degree can lead to a series of Complications affect the health of newborns. This study found that after newborns were fed and burped, the vomiting rate of newborns who carried KMC was lower than that of newborns in the side lying state in the control group. Studies have reported that the effective alveolar ventilation of newborns in the prone position increases. The intestinal blood flow and gastrointestinal blood oxygen content increase, promote the development of neonatal gastrointestinal function. In the first half an hour after feeding, he was in the prone position, and the residual gastric volume was reduced, thereby reducing the feeding intolerance caused by the immature gastrointestinal function of the newborn. Kangaroo care can also reduce neonatal nervousness, promote the secretion of neurotransmitters, regulate growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin levels, promote metabolism, and increase neonatal intake through early and continuous skin contact between mother and baby.

Questionnaires

To measure current gastric symptoms, the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was used. The GSRS is a disease-specific instrument used to evaluate common symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders. This scale contains 15 questions with a seven-point Likert scale ranging from no discomfort to very severe discomfort. These fifteen questions were then broken down into four categories – abdominal pain (stomach pain, hunger pains, nausea), reflux syndrome (heartburn, acid reflux), diarrhea syndrome (diarrhea, loose stools, bowel urgency), indigestion syndrome (rumbling, bloating, burping, passing gas) and constipation syndrome (constipation, hard stools, feeling of incomplete evacuation).

Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Duke University.

Asphyxia avoidance if buried — deflating avalanche airbags: Some airbags deflate automatically, 3 min after deployment, to create an air pocket. A study that buried 12 subjects and monitored vital signs for 1 h found that eleven maintained normal vital signs for 60 min, while 1 maintained normal vital signs for 49 min before requiring extraction with increasing heart rate, increasing end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), and anxiety. We recommend that an airbag that deflates after burial may help prevent asphyxia by creating an air pocket. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

### Prevalence of pH-documented laryngopharyngeal reflux in Chinese patients with clinically suspected reflux laryngitis [^111YEKfm]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is one of the main factors behind different laryngeal pathology according to the Western literature. Literature reported that the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in Chinese population was considerably lower than that in Western countries. To date, however, there is no study to evaluate the prevalence of pH-documented LPR in the Chinese ethnicity.

Materials and Methods

We thus recruited 28 consecutive Chinese patients with reflux symptoms including globus, throat discomfort, throat clearing, chronic cough, or burping lasting more than 1 month in the preceding 1 year, together with stroboscopic evidence suggestive of reflux laryngitis according to the reflux finding score in our study. All patients underwent thorough head and neck examination and transnasal endoscopic assessment. The prevalence of pH-documented LPR and GERD was then documented using ambulatory 24-hour pH biprobe study.

Results

Six (21%) of the 28 patients had pH-documented LPR. Four (14%) of the 28 patients had GERD with 3 of them having concomitant LPR. Only burping was associated with pH-documented LPR (P < .05). No relationship was observed between pH-documented LPR and other factors, including age, sex, other reflux symptoms except burping, and the reflux finding score.

Conclusion

Chinese patients do have and present with symptoms of extraesophageal reflux, and we observed a lower prevalence of pH-documented LPR in Chinese patients with clinically suspected reflux laryngitis compared with white patients.

### A cross-sectional study on stool-and gastrointestinal-related outcomes of Mexican infants consuming different formulae [^112LxNuT]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Next to the stool characteristics, gastrointestinal symptoms were also studied. As the study population consisted of healthy infants, it was in line with expectations that many gastrointestinal symptoms were reported to be absent or very mild in many of the registrations. This is in line with observations of several countries where mild gastrointestinal disorders have previously been observed in otherwise healthy infants. In this study, only burping and flatulence were reported more often. Due to the low prevalence of GI symptoms, the differences between study products were expected to be limited. Nonetheless, the current study revealed that infants consuming IF A had lower odds of more severe burping and diarrhea compared to infants consuming IF C and infants on IF B and IF D, respectively. Significant differences were thus found in otherwise healthy infants.

The inflammatory marker calprotectin was lower in fecal samples of infants consuming IF A compared to IF D. Interestingly, fecal calprotectin correlated with the gastrointestinal symptoms burping, flatulence, and diarrhea. With respect to gastrointestinal complications, fecal calprotectin has limited use in standard clinical practice. Fecal calprotectin is, for example, only informative in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease and to distinguish it from functional gastrointestinal disorders, whereas application in the diagnosis of colic and constipation is limited. Although clinical relevance will therefore be limited in healthy infants, the correlation of fecal calprotectin with the symptoms burping, flatulence, and diarrhea may highlight a potential mechanistic interaction which may be interesting for future studies.

### Organic carbon burial during OAE2 driven by changes in the locus of organic matter sulfurization [^112VCGpW]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Organic matter (OM) burial in marine sediments is a central flux in the global carbon cycle, impacting both global biogeochemistry and climate. It tends to be concentrated in shallow, productive, and relatively O₂-depleted environments –, where microbial communities utilize a variety of nitrogen-based, metal-based, and sulfur-based metabolisms to gain energy. Still, it remains difficult to predict rates of OM burial in marine sediments and how those rates might respond to environmental changes, with implications for modern climate change as well as many key intervals of biogeochemical disruption in Earth history.

Only a very small fraction of the carbon that primary producers fix in the surface ocean is buried in underlying sediments, while the vast majority is remineralized by heterotrophic organisms. In the presence of abundant O₂, remineralization is generally fast and thorough, leaving organic carbon concentrations in open-ocean sediments below 0.5 wt%. In anoxic environments, which can produce rocks with up to 52 wt% organic carbon, a larger proportion of OM is resistant to degradation than in oxic environments, even though rates of microbial heterotrophy can be similar to those in oxic systems. OM may be more effectively recalcitrant under O₂-limited conditions for several reasons, including reduced efficacy of exoenzymes, lack of macrofaunal bioturbation, thermodynamic inhibition, and/or transformation of OM due to abiotic reactions with sulfide, called 'sulfurization'. It is this latter process that we focus on in this work. Sulfurization is thought to limit OM bioavailability by removing energy-yielding functional groups, increasing OM molecular weight, and potentially making structures incompatible with exoenzyme degradation. OM sulfurization thus provides a potentially strong mechanistic link between sedimentary sulfur and carbon burial.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^113a7YG3]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Nonphysiological coping strategies in breastfeeding dyads — strategies used to avoid bedsharing include nighttime nonnutritive pumping with bottle feeding, sleep training, formula feeding or early solids, and infant tracking apps, each with potential drawbacks and often involving lighting that disrupts circadian rhythms. Nighttime pumping while feeding an infant a bottle of expressed milk would be expected to markedly disrupt maternal sleep, and milk pumped at a different time of day would not provide the appropriate level of melatonin; circadian rhythms are disrupted not only by lights but by sitting up and engaging in any active activity. Additional considerations include burping needs for bottle-fed infants and that exclusively pumping is associated with shorter breast milk feeding duration and earlier introduction of formula compared with feeding at the breast with or without pumping.

Infant gastroesophageal reflux (GER) nonpharmacologic measures: "Measures that have been shown to be helpful in the nonpharmacologic management of GER in infants include avoiding overfeeding, frequent burping during feeding, upright positioning in the caregiver's arms after feeding, and avoidance of secondhand smoke". Thickening "does not alter esophageal acid exposure detected by esophageal pH study but has been shown to decrease the frequency of regurgitation", and "although the frequency of reflux events is unchanged with thickened formula, the height of the column of refluxate is decreased". Posturally, "holding the infant on the caregiver's shoulders for 10 to 20 minutes… before placing the infant in the "back to sleep position" can decrease the frequency of GER in infants", whereas semisupine positions "exacerbates esophageal reflux and should be avoided". Because "The frequency of GER has been reported to be decreased in breastfed compared with formula-fed infants", "exclusive breastfeeding should be encouraged whenever possible".

The IAPT phobia scale–avoidance is a single-item scale taken from the routine outcome measures administered by the UK National Health Service's IAPT programme, which treats common emotional disorders. We asked participants to rate their avoidance of heights on a scale from 0 (would not avoid it) to 8 (always avoid it). Higher scores indicated greater avoidance.

We also recorded the occurrence of any known serious adverse events in participants, which we defined as death, suicide attempts, serious violent incidents, admissions to psychiatric hospital, and formal complaints about the intervention. We used the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)to assess levels of discomfort provoked by a VR session. The SSQ is the most commonly used assessment of VR simulator sickness, but it was not developed in the context of the treatment of anxiety, and the 16 items in the scale overlap completely with symptoms of anxiety — eg, increased salivation, sweating, nausea, vertigo, burping, headache, blurred vision, and feeling dizzy. We administered the SSQ four times: before and after the first and last VR treatment sessions. Participants rated the items for how much they were experienced at that time, on a 4-point scale (from 0 [none] to 3 [very strong]). We used a simple raw total score of all items, because we wanted to see absolute levels and potential increases in discomfort. The total score, therefore, can range between 0 and 48, with higher scores indicating greater discomfort.

### Differences in gastrointestinal symptoms according to gender in Rome II positive IBS and dyspepsia in a latin American population [^111Ppf2P]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation, and bloating are more prevalent in women than men, but gender differences associated with dyspepsia are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to determine gender differences in the prevalence of symptoms diagnostic for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in subjects with IBS and dyspepsia, as well as in controls in Mexico.

Methods

A database of 1,021 subjects (61% women) who completed the Rome II Modular Questionnaire (RIIMQ) in Spanish Mexico was analyzed. Gender differences in the frequency of all symptoms included in the RIIMQ between those fulfilling criteria for IBS (28.9%), dyspepsia (4.0%) and controls without any FGIDs (38.2%) were studied. Subjects fulfilling criteria only for other FGIDs were excluded.

Results

There were higher proportions of women with IBS (67.8%) and dyspepsia (85.4%) compared with the control group (55.9%) (P < 0.001). In IBS, women more frequently reported changes in the number of bowel movements (BMs) associated with the onset of abdominal discomfort/pain, fewer than three BMs/week and abdominal fullness/bloating/swelling than men. Men with IBS more frequently reported swallowing air to belch and abdominal pain that improved after a BM than women. In controls, burping and hard or lumpy stools were both more frequent in men.

Conclusions

In Mexico, gender differences in FGIDs exist, with both IBS and dyspepsia being more common in women than men. In IBS, symptoms related to constipation and bloating were more common in women, but the dyspepsia group was too small to draw any conclusions. Finally, this is the first study to report that belching is more common in men than women controls not fulfilling criteria for any FGID.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for prevention and management of avalanche and nonavalanche snow burial accidents: 2024 update [^115ZBu45]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Strategic shoveling for avalanche extrication — Using a scooped shovel, the amount of snow cleared increased 47% compared to a flat shovel, and men moved 44% more snow per unit time than women. Shoveling should begin downhill at least 1.5 times the distance of burial depth based on the probe strike or best estimated location. When multiple rescuers are available, a conveyor belt method may be used with rescuers rapidly paddling snow downhill in succession, and rescuers should rotate positions frequently, typically every few minutes, to prevent fatigue. In a simulated avalanche study with manikins, 1 or 2 rescuers required approximately 10 min to locate, excavate the manikin from 1 m below the surface and initiate CPR. We recommend that all travelers in avalanche terrain should carry and know how to use a scooped metal shovel; we suggest shoveling techniques should include using the shovel like a paddle to plow snow downhill, and we suggest a conveyor system should be used if multiple rescuers are available (Strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

Overlap syndromes/symptoms in FD

One-third (33%) of FD patients also fulfilled criteria for IBS. Frequencies for GERD-related symptoms are shown in Table 2. At least one symptom was reported by 74%, 2 or more symptoms by 49%, 3 or more symptoms by 29%, and all 4 symptoms by 6% of patients. Patients with mild histologic esophagitis reported higher frequencies compared to those with normal histology for bitter/salty taste (52 vs. 29%; p = .046), belching/burping (62 vs. 22%; p = .001), regurgitation (64 vs. 54%; p = .042), and heartburn (71 vs. 32%; p = .001). Frequencies for OBS-related symptoms are shown in Table 2. Of the patients reporting night time urination, 67% reported that this occurred at least weekly. At least one symptom was reported by 44%, 2 or more symptoms by 23%, and all 3 symptoms by 8%. No differences were found in the frequencies of overlap relative to age or gender with one exception. Specifically, IBS overlap was more common in females 13 years of age and older as compared to younger females (36 vs. 13%; p = .037).

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in which burrowing behaviour was assessed in rodent models of disease-associated persistent pain [^112iWjas]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate whether burrowing behaviour represents an appropriate outcome measure to assess rodent disease models of injury or pathological-related persistent pain. This review also aimed to inform the impacts of animal characteristics on rodent burrowing behaviour. We expect that our summary of empirical evidence will assist researchers in making appropriate selection of animal models, outcome measures, and interventions for future experimental designs.

Our systematic review identified 48 studies. Of which, 45 studies were used in the meta-analysis, comprising the effects of 16 disease models associated with persistent pain and 27 classes of drug interventions on burrowing behaviour in 3232 rodents. Our analysis suggests that burrowing is an adequate pain-related ethologically relevant outcome measure in rats as decreased burrowing behaviour was associated with somatic inflammation and trauma-induced neuropathy. Furthermore, this generic behaviour was contextualised to pain as burrowing deficits in rats with experimental persistent pain were attenuated by gabapentinoid and NSAID drug classes. Burrowing is generally considered to be more ethologically relevant to rats than mice, although previous studies have shown that some laboratory mouse strains have exhibited burrowing behaviour. The magnitude of how mice burrowing was affected by disease models and drug interventions could not be determined because of limited data; hence, it remains unclear whether burrowing is also an appropriate pain-related outcome measure for use in mice. Subgroup analyses were conducted to gain useful insights into how rat model characteristics and drug classes influence the burrowing behaviour; however, some analyses were restricted because of limited data.

### Identification of the source events for aerosol generation during oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy [^115dvY7q]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine if oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) generates increased levels of aerosol in conscious patients and identify the source events.

Design

A prospective, environmental aerosol monitoring study, undertaken in an ultraclean environment, on patients undergoing OGD. Sampling was performed 20cm away from the patient's mouth using an optical particle sizer. Aerosol levels during OGD were compared with tidal breathing and voluntary coughs within subject.

Results

Patients undergoing bariatric surgical assessment were recruited (mean body mass index 44 and mean age 40years, n = 15). A low background particle concentration in theatres (3L⁻¹) enabled detection of aerosol generation by tidal breathing (mean particle concentration 118L⁻¹). Aerosol recording during OGD showed an average particle number concentration of 595L⁻¹ with a wide range (3–4320L⁻¹). Bioaerosol-generating events, namely, coughing or burping, were common. Coughing was evoked in 60% of the endoscopies, with a greater peak concentration and a greater total number of sampled particles than the patient's reference voluntary coughs (11710vs 2320L⁻¹ and 780vs 191 particles, n = 9 and p = 0.008). Endoscopies with coughs generated a higher level of aerosol than tidal breathing, whereas those without coughs were not different to the background. Burps also generated increased aerosol concentration, similar to those recorded during voluntary coughs. The insertion and removal of the endoscope were not aerosol generating unless a cough was triggered.

Conclusion

Coughing evoked during OGD is the main source of the increased aerosol levels, and therefore, OGD should be regarded as a procedure with high risk of producing respiratory aerosols. OGD should be conducted with airborne personal protective equipment and appropriate precautions in those patients who are at risk of having COVID-19 or other respiratory pathogens.

### Organic carbon burial in global lakes and reservoirs [^117C8kKx]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Anthropogenic increase in erosion and aquatic productivity (eutrophication), together with river damming, are responsible for a large increase in OC burial since pre-industrial times, estimated as ~0.05 Pg C per yearor 33% of our average OC burial. Similarly, recent average carbon accumulation rates in European lakes were twice as high as compared to the mean accumulation rate over the Holocene. Despite the increase in soil erosion due to anthropogenic land cover change, sediment delivery to the sea has decreased by 15% compared to pre-Anthropocene values owing to the proliferation of dams. Efficient sediment trapping by dams combined with frequently low dissolved oxygen in bottom waters has been related to reservoirs in general accumulating OC at higher rates than natural lakes. Indeed, our scenarios result on average six times (4–12, range of scenarios) higher OC burial rates per unit of area in reservoirs than in natural lakes. Consequently, total burial in reservoir sediments (0.06 Pg C per year, mean of the four scenarios) amounts to ~60% of OC burial in natural lakes, even though lakes occupy a ~10 times larger total area (Table 1). In this context, it is important to note that the extent to which land-derived OC burial in reservoir sediments can be accounted as a new sink is not known; if the OC originated from land, it may also have been buried elsewhere (e.g. in floodplains or in the ocean) in the absence of the dams and, therefore, simply represents a change in storage location but not a new sink. Some studies indicate, though, that the burial of land-derived OC may be more efficient in reservoirs than in other depositional environments. Thus, the additional fraction of land-derived OC that escapes mineralization because it is buried in a reservoir, and not in another depositional environment, may be accountable as a new, and anthropogenic, sink of land-derived OC. It is worth noting that this argument also applies to the burial of land-derived OC in natural lakes, which may only be counted as a new sink with regard to that fraction of OC that is more efficiently preserved in inland water sediments than in soils. Independently of this reasoning, a large share of the present-day annual inland water OC burial takes place in reservoirs, and this calls for the development of strategies in order to protect the accumulated carbon stock at dam decommissioning.

Percentage of distribution of gastrointestinal system diseases in patients with chronic kidney disease

Gastrointestinal system complaints and findings of the patients were compared between predialysis-hemodialysis, predialysis-peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis-peritoneal dialysis patient groups.

Epigastric pain and burning were present in 45% of both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, and 42% of predialysis patients and there was no difference between the groups. Abdominal pain was detected as 29% in the HD group, 37% in the PD group, 26% in the predialysis group and there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. However, abdominal pain was higher in the PD group than in the other groups. Nausea was present 45% in the HD group, 39% in the PD group, 53% in the predialysis group; vomiting was present in 35% of HD patients, 32% of PD patients, 33% of predialysis patients and no statistical difference were found between the groups in terms of these complaints. The results are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
The prevalence of gastrointestinal complaints in predialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patient groups

✱ p = 0.032: Belching is significantly higher in the PD group than in the HD group

✱✱ p = 0.016: Weight loss is significantly higher in the predialysis group than in the PD group

Although dyspepsia, regurgitation, heartburn and dry cough were more common in the peritoneal dialysis group than in HD and predialysis groups, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Weight loss was 20% in predialysis, 16% in hemodialysis and 8% in peritoneal dialysis. There was a statistically significant difference between the predialysis patients and the peritoneal dialysis patient group in terms of weight loss and it was statistically significantly higher in the predialysis patient group (p = 0.016). Although weight loss was more common in the HD group, no statistically significant difference was found between the HD and PD groups. Again, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of dysphagia and odynophagia complaints. Burping was detected in 46% of PD patients, 31% of HD patients, 33% of predialysis patients and the rate was statistically significantly higher in the PD group than in the HD group (p = 0.032), but the difference between PD and predialysis was not statistically significant (p = 0.075).

### Organic-inorganic interactions in petroleum-producing sedimentary basins [^113ENL9T]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Petroleum deposits form as a consequence of the increased temperatures that accompany progressive burial of organic matter deep within sedimentary basins. Recent advances in petroleum geochemistry suggest that inorganic sedimentary components participate in organic transformations associated with this process. Water is particularly important because it facilitates reaction mechanisms not available in dry environments, and may contribute hydrogen and oxygen for the formation of hydrocarbons and oxygenated alteration products. These findings suggest that petroleum generation and stability is influenced by subsurface chemical environments, and is a simple function of time, temperature and the composition of sedimentary organic matter.

### Organic carbon burial in global lakes and reservoirs [^115shmcf]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately one half of the total terrestrial carbon (C) pool transported by inland waters reaches the sea, due to large amounts of C being both emitted to the atmosphere and sequestered in sediments –. Carbon gases (carbon dioxide and methane) emitted from inland waters to the atmosphere act as greenhouse gases but are recycled in the biosphere on contemporary time scales, while C stored in sediments enters the long-term geological cycle. Studies at local and regional scales have shown that even if the C burial flux in lakes and reservoirs is often small compared to C emission, it represents a significant long-term C sink –. In addition, inland waters are more efficiently burying C than oceans, since a higher fraction of settling organic carbon (OC) escapes mineralization and stays in the sediments. This is due to higher sedimentation rates, lower oxygen availability, and higher proportion of land-derived OC in inland waters. Recent studies have also indicated that inland water OC burial rates have been increasing over the Anthropocene due to soil erosion, river damming, and eutrophication.

Even though the importance and efficiency of lake and reservoir sediment C burial is widely recognized, global estimates are not well constrained. While the entire oceanic sediment sequesters ~0.2 Pg C per year (IPCC, 2013), global estimates of inland water OC burial range from 0.2 to 1.6 Pg C per year –, –. Even though some of the discrepancy between these estimates arises from differences in environments that were considered (lakes, reservoirs, floodplains, wetlands, and colluvium), there is considerable uncertainty in estimates even when the same environments were studied. The lack of a robust global estimate of inland water OC burial is largely due to a lack of measurements, which is related to the complexity of methods and the heterogeneity of sedimentation. Global burial estimates rely typically on few data of limited geographical distribution, and many assumptions. The question of how much C is sequestered in global lakes and reservoirs, then, remains open even though the number of studies including direct OC burial measurements has increased over the last decade.

### Complications after outpatient upper GI endoscopy in children: 30-day follow-up [^111hNMwS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Upper GI endoscopy (UGE) is a common procedure performed for evaluation and treatment of various upper GI tract disorders in children. Limited comprehensive data are available on the complications of UGE in adults and particularly in children. The goals of this study were to identify complications and adverse events reported by patients and their parents after outpatient UGE under general anesthesia (GA).

Methods

Pediatric patients who underwent outpatient UGE under GA between April, 2000 and April, 2001 at the James Whitcomb Hospital for Children were identified. The interviewer obtained verbal consent and performed standardized telephone interviews 30 days after the outpatient UGE.

Results

A total of 393 patients participated in this survey. Of the patients, 165 (42%) had one or more complications or adverse events. The most common ones reported by patients or parents 30 days after the UGE under GA were sore throat or hoarseness (34.6%), fatigue (6.6%), cough (4.1%), headache (3.3%), excessive gas or burping (2.8%), nausea (2.5%), emesis (2.3%), abdominal pain (2%), fever (2%), behavior problems (1.8%), upper respiratory symptoms (1.3%), excessive drowsiness (0.5%), nosebleed (0.3%), perioral rash (0.3%), and chest pain (0.3%). Ten of 165 patients with complications or adverse events after UGE sought medical assistance.

Conclusions

Approximately one third of pediatric patients complained of sore throat or hoarseness after UGE under GA. All other reported complications or adverse events were infrequent. We conclude that UGE under GA is safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for prevention and management of avalanche and nonavalanche snow burial accidents [^114XAQgd]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Nonavalanche snow burial (NASB) — definition, limited evidence, prevention, and self-extrication: Nonavalanche snow burial (NASB), also called "non-avalanche-related snow immersion", differs from avalanche burial and has been reported to affect skiers, snowboarders, snowshoers, and snowmobilers who fall head first into tree wells or deep powder snow; victims who are unable to extricate themselves may die from asphyxia after snow compacts around the head. Only 1 review article and 1 small burial simulation study exist in the published literature, self-extrication is difficult, buried subjects who remove their skis sink deeper, and position seems to affect the chance of successful self-extrication. The best way to prevent NASB is to recognize and avoid tree wells and avoid burial in soft snow by staying within skill limits; other possibly effective preventive measures include maintaining vocal and visual contact with a partner, yelling to alert a partner to a fall, and grabbing tree branches while falling in an attempt to stay upright, though no evidence exists to confirm the effectiveness of these preventive measures. One study suggested that buried victims could use a gentle rocking motion to try to pack snow to get purchase for an attempt to self-extricate, and a simulated burial study found that struggling caused subjects to sink deeper; in 1 study, when a subject was upside down, the parka acted as a funnel to collect more snow, which was accentuated when skis or snowboards were removed. Whether skis and snowboards should remain attached or be jettisoned is unclear; in 2 cases, victims were spotted via skis and snowboards that were still attached. No data exist on use of an avalanche transceiver, radio, or mobile phone in NASB; one deceased victim was recovered using an avalanche beacon and 1 patient was found alive using a voice-activated 2-way radio. No data exist on the utility of avalanche airbags or artificial air pocket devices to prevent nonavalanche snow burial; one manufacturer has speculated that an air pocket may be created by deploying an airbag. Recommendation: Avoiding falling into tree wells and deep powder snow are the only known means of preventing NASB.

### Organic carbon burial in global lakes and reservoirs [^116ELanX]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Burial in sediments removes organic carbon (OC) from the short-term biosphere-atmosphere carbon (C) cycle, and therefore prevents greenhouse gas production in natural systems. Although OC burial in lakes and reservoirs is faster than in the ocean, the magnitude of inland water OC burial is not well constrained. Here we generate the first global-scale and regionally resolved estimate of modern OC burial in lakes and reservoirs, deriving from a comprehensive compilation of literature data. We coupled statistical models to inland water area inventories to estimate a yearly OC burial of 0.15 (range, 0.06–0.25)Pg C, of which ~40% is stored in reservoirs. Relatively higher OC burial rates are predicted for warm and dry regions. While we report lower burial than previously estimated, lake and reservoir OC burial corresponded to ~20% of their C emissions, making them an important C sink that is likely to increase with eutrophication and river damming.

### Cost and burden of gastroesophageal reflux disease among patients with persistent symptoms despite proton pump inhibitor therapy: an observational study in France [^114pVXHF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

GERD-related resource utilization

Use of prescribed GERD medication generally remained constant over the 12-month study period. Esomeprazole was the most commonly prescribed GERD medication, with use reported in 46% of patients between baseline and 12 months (Table 2). Between baseline and 6 months, the most common test or procedure was endoscopy, reported in 5% of patients, while the most common procedures between 6 and 12 months were blood sampling for laboratory tests (6% of patients) and endoscopy (4%). Over the 12-month study period, primary care physician visits were reported for 32% and 74% of patients on CRF forms and patient surveys, respectively, while gastroenterologist visits were reported for 19% and 35% of patients, respectively. A total of 6 patients (2%) were reported as being hospitalized during the study.

Table 2
Use of GERD medications between baseline and 12 months' follow-up (n = 258)

Symptom burden, HRQL and productivity impairment

At baseline, GERD symptoms (reported using the RESQ-7, Overall symptoms domain) were reported as moderate-to-severe in 98% of patients. Patients' most frequent symptom from the Heartburn and Regurgitation domains were frequently reported as moderate-to-severe in intensity (95% and 79%, respectively), while patients' most frequent symptoms from the Burping and Hoarseness, cough and difficulty swallowing domains were rated as moderate-to-severe in 53% and 35% of patients, respectively. A total of 48% of patients reported daily symptoms of GERD despite optimized PPI therapy. The frequency and severity of GERD symptoms appeared to decline over the 12-month course of the study (data not shown).

SF-36v2 and EQ-5D scores at baseline and at 6 and 12 months' follow-up are shown in Table 3. SF-36v2 Physical and Mental Component summary scores, EQ-5D index score and EQ-5D VAS score all showed a tendency towards lower scores (worse HRQL) with a higher frequency and intensity of GERD symptoms (Figures 2 and 3).

### Multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comparing 20 and 40 mg of pantoprazole for symptom relief in adolescents (12 to 16 years of age) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [^115RU3sh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

An age-appropriate questionnaire (GASP-Q) was used to assess the frequency and severity of the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms: abdominal/belly pain, chest pain/heartburn, pain after eating, nausea, burping/belching, vomiting/regurgitation, choking when eating, and difficulty swallowing, in adolescents age 12 to 16 years. The primary objective was to compare the mean composite symptom score (CSS) at week 8 with baseline after treatment with 20 or 40 mg of pantoprazole. Statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvement in CSS occurred in both groups. Safety was comparable between the 2 groups. Pantoprazole was safe, well tolerated, and effective in reducing symptoms of GERD in adolescents.

### Utility of wireless motility capsule and lactulose breath testing in the evaluation of patients with chronic functional bloating [^111LuK2j]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bloating is defined as a feeling of gaseousness or abdominal fullness, particularly after meals. The term abdominal distention is reserved for patients who exhibit a visible increase in abdominal girth. Eructation, burping or belching, imply the expulsion of excess gas from the stomach and they may or may not be related to bloating. Bloating is quite prevalent and compromises the quality of life. In a US population survey, 31% of respondents met Rome I criteria for functional bloating. Bloating is also a prevalent symptom of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In another population study, symptomatic respondents reported significantly more missed days from work, social or household activities.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is defined as the presence of excessive bacteria in the small intestine. Symptoms of SIBO are non-specific and include bloating, abdominal distension or discomfort, diarrhoea, and fatigue. These symptoms likely reflect not only the degree of bacterial overgrowth and related mucosal inflammation but also the underlying cause, such as small bowel dysmotility and delayed transit. Lactulose breath testing (LBT) is a widely used method for the diagnosis of SIBO and, if positive, allows for antimicrobial therapy aiming at bacterial eradication and symptom relief.

The wireless motility capsule (WMC; Smartpill, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, California, USA) is an ambulatory non-invasive and non-radioactive diagnostic sensor that continuously samples intraluminal pH, temperature and pressure as it moves through the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have shown that the estimated interparticipant coefficients of variation (COV) for gastric emptying time (GET) with WMC in health and gastroparesis are 28% and 34%, respectively (not different); the interindividual COV in small bowel transit time (SBTT) for health, gastroparesis and constipation are 33%, 33% and 37%, respectively; the COV in healthy, gastroparetic and constipated participants are 1, 0.93 and 0.99, respectively. This new technology has permitted routine quantification of transit in all gut regions in a single test and it has been increasingly used for the diagnosis of gastroparesis and slow-transit constipation (colonic inertia).

### Conceptualizing soil fauna effects on labile and stabilized soil organic matter [^115vAD7t]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Translocation

Bioturbation

Incorporation of organic matter from litter/organic horizons into the mineral soil, and its further relocation therein, is substantially affected by the bioturbation activity of soil fauna (broadly defined as "the enhanced dispersal of particles resulting from sediment [soil] reworking by burrowing animals"). Soil fauna has been estimated to remove up to 73 and 100% of the annual litterfall from the soil surface in tropical and temperate ecosystems, respectively, which highlights the high relevance of bioturbation across biomes. This transfer of organic matter to the mineral soil as plant fragments or feces (see "Transformation" section above) fuels soil food webs, biochemical processes, and likely plays an important role in the formation and dynamics of POM and MAOM (Fig. 2).

### Prevalence of overlap syndromes and symptoms in pediatric functional dyspepsia [^115VX5uB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms

All patients seen for initial evaluation in the abdominal pain clinic from which the sample was selected had completed a standardized medical history. This medical history included questions regarding the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort, as well as any relation to a change in stool frequency or consistency or a history of relief from stooling. In addition, specific locations of the pain were obtained by asking the patient to mark pain locations on a diagram of the abdomen. The nature of the pain (e.g. burning, crampy) was asked of each patient. Patients were specifically asked whether pain wakes them at night and whether pain increases after a meal. Patients also were asked about the presence of nausea and/or vomiting and whether nausea increases after a meal. Relevant to the issue of FD subtyping, patients were asked specifically about the presence of early satiety and postprandial bloating.

Patients also are asked about the presence of a number of other gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms that are assessed include the presence of stool symptoms such as loose stools, hard stools, mucus in stools, blood in stools, and waking at night to have a stool, as well as the presence of excessive gas. Systemic symptoms that are assessed include hayfever, fatigue, headache, fainting, dizziness, chest pain, muscle pain, joint pain, mouth sores, weight loss, and fever. In addition to the above, patients are asked about the presence of 4 symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux (bitter, salty, or sour taste in mouth; excessive belching or burping; regurgitation; heartburn) and 3 symptoms related to overactive bladder syndrome (increased frequency of urination; waking during the night to urinate; sudden urge to urinate).

Information from the medical history, once abstracted and entered into the research database, was used to evaluate dyspeptic symptoms and assign an FD subtype based on adult Rome III criteria. Patients were defined as having postprandial distress syndrome if they endorsed early satiety or postprandial bloating. Patients were defined as having epigastric pain syndrome if they endorsed burning or pain localized only to the epigastric region. Diagnoses of potentially overlapping symptoms and conditions (i.e. IBS, GERD, OBS) also were assigned based on symptom information abstracted from the patient's medical history.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^115ZnrTa]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #37 — Recommendations 6–11 for nighttime caregiving and sleep training in young infants include: Encourage the mother and infant to return to sleep without interruption after nighttime breastfeeding while bedsharing; avoid burping the infant after breastfeeding, and avoid unnecessary diaper changes during the night; a barrier cream applied to the diaper area can help prevent diaper dermatitis (Level of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendation: C.). Sleep training in approximately the first 6 months of life is contraindicated, and sleep training in the first year is not recommended; a cued care program for infant sleep may be a physiological-based alternative for parents who desire a sleep intervention (Level of evidence: 3. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the mother to sleep when the infant sleeps, when this is possible, and remind parents that not all sleep must occur during the nighttime hours (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the mother to get help with other household tasks so that she can focus on breastfeeding and caring for the infant (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the safe use of baby carriers during the day to promote physical contact with the infant; Baby-wearing can help mothers manage daytime tasks while keeping the infant calm (Level of evidence: 1. Strength of recommendation: A.). Including some supervised "tummy time" may be important to help achieve developmental motor goals (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.).

### Retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction: the jefferson experience [^112VmnwV]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe our center's experience with the identification and treatment of retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (R-CPD), a syndrome involving the inability to belch previously described by only one institution. Additionally, because all patients initially learned of their condition and sought treatment as a result of social media posts, we queried their source and comfort with this form of medical referral.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients who underwent botulism toxin injection into the cricopharyngeus muscle for treatment of R-CPD from 2019 to 2022. Demographic data, most common symptoms at presentation, and response to treatment and complications were documented. Post-treatment questionnaires were reviewed.

Results

A total of 85 patients were identified. Mean age at surgery was 27years. There were 54 (63.5%) females and 31 (36.5%) males. The inability to burp (98.8%), bloating (92.9%), gurgling noises (31.8%), and excessive flatulence (21.2%) were the most common symptoms. The minimum units of botox utilized were 25, whereas the maximum was 100. The majority of patients (88.2%) had a successful response at initial follow-up visit. The most common complication was mild dysphagia (30.6%), which was transient for all patients. Most patients learned of our practice through social media, with only one patient being referred by a medical provider.

Conclusions

The majority of patients in our cohort were young and female. The inability to burp and bloating were the most common presenting symptoms. Social media was the primary source of referral. Our institution favors 80–100units for an effective response. Laryngoscope, 133:1081–1085, 2023.

### Exploding head syndrome [^111q55kf]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Exploding head syndrome is characterized by the perception of abrupt, loud noises when going to sleep or waking up. They are usually painless, but associated with fear and distress. In spite of the fact that its characteristic symptomatology was first described approximately 150 y ago, exploding head syndrome has received relatively little empirical and clinical attention. Therefore, a comprehensive review of the scientific literature using Medline, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and PubMed was undertaken. After first discussing the history, prevalence, and associated features, the available polysomnography data and five main etiological theories for exploding head syndrome are summarized. None of these theories has yet reached dominance in the field. Next, the various methods used to assess and treat exploding head syndrome are discussed, as well as the limited outcome data. Finally, recommendations for future measure construction, treatment options, and differential diagnosis are provided.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^115PkPXd]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage — presentation and field management are summarized as follows: Bleeding between the conjunctiva and sclera causes a collection of blood that appears bright red, and subconjunctival hemorrhages are most often caused by straining (during sneezing, coughing, vomiting, or toileting), rubbing of the eye, or due to barotrauma if diving. Although impressive looking, this condition is typically benign and it will resolve in days to weeks without treatment, and unless there are signs of a ruptured globe or basilar skull fracture, no backcountry treatment or evacuation is required.

### Development of a symptom-focused patient-reported outcome measure for functional dyspepsia: the functional dyspepsia symptom diary (FDSD) [^115ZHoSq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Preliminary evaluation of measurement properties

There were no missing data recorded for the FDSD, with 100.0% (N = 57) of participants providing data for all items. Overall, the responses to items were well distributed among the response options for the FDSD, indicating that participants were using all levels of the ordinal response scale (see Supplementary Table 3 for item distribution table). A ceiling effect (≥ 25.0%) was observed for Item 8 (burping/belching bother) and no items demonstrated a floor effect (Table 2). Inter-item correlations indicated that no items were capturing redundant information (Pearson's correlation r < 0.80, in all instances) (Table 3). The FDSD TSS yielded Cronbach's α = 0.87, above the a priori -identified threshold (α ≥ 0.70) for acceptable internal consistency reliability (Table 2), and remained above threshold following removal of each of the items composing the TSS (Items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6). Item discrimination index analyses suggest that the FDSD items composing the TSS are able to discriminate among participants with mild/moderate FD and participants with severe FD to varying degrees (Table 2). As hypothesized, the FDSD TSS demonstrated an increasing monotonic trend across known severity groups for both participant-reported and clinician-reported FD severity (that is, TSS increased with increasing severity of FD). For participant-reported FD severity, Items 1 (stomach pain), 2 (burning in the stomach), 7 (burping/belching rating), and 8 (burping/belching bother) demonstrated an increasing monotonic trend. For clinician-reported FD severity, all items with the exception of Items 4 (bloating), 7 (burping/belching rating), and 8 (burping/belching bother) demonstrated an increasing monotonic trend across known severity groups (Table 2).

### Gastric microbiota in the functional dyspepsia patients treated with probiotic yogurt [^113WJDW2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

The questionnaire

The FSSG questionnaire was originally produced by Kusano et al as a method of evaluating the symptoms of GERD and FD because the overlap of both conditions is quite common in Asian populations, including Japanese. This questionnaire is composed of 12 questions. Seven questions are related to gastro-oesophageal reflux or epigastric pain-like symptoms, and these include, 'Do you get heartburn?', 'Do you sometimes subconsciously rub your chest with your hand?', 'Do you get heartburn after meals?', 'Do you have an unusual sensation in your throat?', 'Do some things get stuck when you swallow?', 'Do you get bitter liquid (acid) coming up into your throat?', and 'Do you get heartburn if you bend over?' Five questions are related to dysmotility-like dyspepsia or postprandial distress-like symptoms, and these include, 'Does your stomach get bloated?', 'Does your stomach ever feel heavy after a meal?', 'Do you ever feel sick after meals?', 'Do you feel full while eating meals?', and 'Do you burp a lot?'. Each of these questions was scored to indicate the frequency of symptoms as follows: never = 0, occasionally = 1, sometimes = 2, often = 3, and always = 4.

### Pediatric retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction diagnosed by high-resolution impedance manometry [^113EBvh7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The inability to burp, known as retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (R-CPD), was initially described in adults. The proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for R-CPD include belching inability, abdominal bloating and discomfort/nausea, postprandial chest pain, and involuntary noises. Botulinum toxin injection to the cricopharyngeal muscle has been reported to be beneficial. High-resolution esophageal impedance-manometry (HRIM) features in adolescent patients with R-CPD have not been described yet. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical and HRIM findings of pediatric patients with R-CPD.

Methods

Clinical and manometric features of five pediatric patients diagnosed with R-CPD were reviewed. HRIM study protocol was modified to include the consumption of carbonated drink to provoke symptoms and distinctive manometric features.

Results

We report five female patients aged 15–20 years who presented with an inability to burp and involuntary throat sounds. HRIM revealed normal upper esophageal sphincter (UES) relaxation during swallowing, but abnormal UES relaxation with concurrent high esophageal impedance reflecting air entrapment and secondary peristalsis following the carbonated drink challenge. Four patients exhibited esophageal motility disorder. All patients reported improvement or resolution of symptoms after botulinum toxin injection to the cricopharyngeus muscle.

Conclusions

Adolescents with an inability to burp, reflux-like symptoms, bloating, and involuntary throat noises should be assessed for R-CPD by pediatric gastroenterologists with HRIM. The relatively recent recognition of this novel condition is the likely reason for its under- and misdiagnosis in children.

### Development of a symptom-focused patient-reported outcome measure for functional dyspepsia: the functional dyspepsia symptom diary (FDSD) [^1163SsaZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Development of the preliminary FDSD

The preliminary FDSD was an eight-item measure, intended for daily administration on a handheld ePRO device, to assess symptoms of FD in the context of a clinical trial. Items 1 through 6 assessed the severity of stomach pain, upper abdominal burning, nausea, bloating, postprandial fullness, and early satiety, respectively. Items 7 and 8 assessed burping/belching in terms of the level of bother and severity, respectively. A diagram showing the location of the stomach was included at the beginning of the FDSD to instruct respondents to think only about symptoms in this area. In addition, respondents were asked to reflect over the past 24 h while responding to the FDSD and responses were scored on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 (no (concept)) to 10 (worst imaginable (concept)). A 24 h recall period was deemed appropriate, as the FDSD concepts of measurement can be variable both between days and within a day. The selection of an 11-point numeric rating scale is consistent with suggestions that the scale has relative advantages in minimizing missing data, patient preference, ease of recording, and ease of implementation in clinical trials.

FDSD item-level scores and a Total Symptom Score (TSS) were calculated. The TSS comprised Items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 of the FDSD; Items 3, 7, and 8 were considered supplementary items (symptoms relevant to 68.9–73.3% of participants but not considered cardinal symptoms of FD by the expert panel) and were not included in the TSS. The FDSD TSS ranged from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating greater symptom burden. Although some minor revisions were suggested to the FDSD following the translatability and electronic implementation assessments, it was decided that no revisions to the FDSD would be made before the cognitive interviews. Developer's definitions were agreed upon for each item to help ensure conceptual equivalence when translating the FDSD into other languages.

### The reflux symptom score has good screening value for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^1177FXWV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is defined as an inflammatory disease of the tissues of the upper aerodigestive tract caused by the direct or indirect effects associated with the reflux of gastroduodenal contents, which can cause morphological changes in the upper aerodigestive tract. Common symptoms of LPR are frequent throat clearing, globus sensation, regurgitations or burps, heartburn. Common laryngeal signs include subglottic edema, vocal fold edema, posterior commissure hypertrophy, and thick endolaryngeal mucus. LPR has a high incidence in otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery patients, it was reported that the prevalence of LPR in patients with benign vocal cord lesions, vocal cord precancerous lesions, and vocal cord cancer was 84.62%, 80.00%, and 82.09%, respectively.

### Do the 'brain dead' merely appear to be alive? [^116zpytL]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

The basic idea here is that parts of the organism may remain alive, but the organism as a whole is dead because a special, ontologically privileged organ, the master part, has (mostly) ceased to function. This idea is similar to the President's Council's attempt to distinguish the privileged biological functions that 'count', or perform 'vital work', while discounting the tremendous range of preserved functions that do not count.

Moschella writes, 'I am not convinced that the functions exhibited by a ["brain dead" body]… indicate that [the body] is itself an organism as a whole rather than an aggregation of organs and tissues inside a bag of skin, maintained in a coordinated relationship with one another through the action of external causes' (p284). As with the bioethics committee reports, this claim is based on mistaken assumptions about physiology and the causal role of the ventilator. First, the skin is not a 'bag'; it is a living organ that plays vital roles in maintaining homeostasis via (among other things) contributing to innate immunity and maintenance of body temperature — functions maintained by the 'brain dead' body. Like all other organs, the skin both requires and contributes to homeostasis of the extracellular fluid.

Furthermore, the coordinated relationship between the various organs and tissues is not due to the action of external causes. The ventilator provides positive pressure and hence airflow through the bronchial tree; the organism must do the rest. In another passage, Moschella writes, 'the fact that an external cause can, by replacing the capacity for spontaneous breathing, trigger the internal capacities of a multitude of living entities [viz. organs and tissues]… does not imply that genuine self- integration is present' (p288; emphases in the original). But the external cause cannot replace the capacity for spontaneous breathing (if 'breathing' is meant to include both airflow and gas exchange, as Moschella appears to be using the term). The ventilator can blow air in and out of the bronchial tree. But it alone cannot trigger gas exchange, as explained above, and therefore it cannot supply usable oxygen to any tissues of the body; and hence it cannot 'trigger' kidney function or adrenal function or immune function or liver function or skin function, and so forth. And it certainly cannot cause the functioning of all of these organs and tissues to operate in a coordinated fashion with one another.

### Laryngeal view during laryngoscopy: a randomized trial comparing cricoid pressure, backward-upward-rightward pressure, and bimanual laryngoscopy [^112daQDg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

External cricoid and thyroid cartilage manipulations are commonly taught to facilitate laryngeal view during intubation. We compare the laryngeal views during laryngoscopy with 4 manipulations (no manipulation, cricoid pressure, backward-upward-rightward pressure [BURP], and bimanual laryngoscopy) to determine the method that optimizes laryngeal view.

Methods

This was a randomized intervention study involving emergency physicians participating in airway training courses from December 2003 to November 2004. Direct laryngoscopies were performed with curved blades on fresh, non-fixed cadavers by using each of the 4 methods. The percentage of glottic opening (POGO), a validated scoring scale, was recorded for each laryngoscopy. Scores for bimanual laryngoscopy were recorded before the assistant applied external pressure.

Results

A total of 1,530 sets of comparative laryngoscopies were performed by 104 participants. One thousand one hundred eighteen of 1,530 sets (73%) had POGO scores less than 100 with no manipulation. Compared to no manipulation, mean POGO scores with bimanual laryngoscopy improved by 25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 23 to 27); mean POGO score improvement with cricoid pressure and BURP were 5 (95% CI 3 to 8) and 4 (95% CI 1 to 7), respectively. POGO scores with bimanual laryngoscopy were higher compared to cricoid pressure (mean difference 20, 95% CI 17 to 22) and BURP (mean difference 21, 95% CI 19 to 24). Among laryngoscopies with no manipulation in which the POGO score greater than 0 (n = 1,434), laryngeal view worsened in 60 cases (4%, 95% CI 3% to 5%) with bimanual laryngoscopy, in 409 cases (29%, 95% CI 26% to 31%) with cricoid pressure, and in 504 cases (35%, 95% CI 33% to 38%) with BURP.

Conclusion

Using a cadaver model, we found pressing on the neck during curved blade laryngoscopy greatly affects laryngeal view. Overall, bimanual laryngoscopy improved the view compared to cricoid pressure, BURP, and no manipulation. Cricoid pressure and BURP frequently worsen laryngoscopy. These data suggest bimanual laryngoscopy should be considered when teaching emergency airway management.

### Operating room or in-office injection for retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction botulinum toxin injection [^114WfmBF]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Retrograde Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction (RCPD), also known as "No Burp Syndrome", is a rare condition characterized by the inability to burp due to cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction. Patients experience bloating, chest and abdominal discomfort, gurgling sounds, and excessive flatulence, which significantly impact quality of life.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes and side effect profiles of botulinum toxin injection for RCPD when performed in‐office versus in the operating room.

Methods

A clinical review of patients with RCPD was conducted, focusing on diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Botulinum toxin was administered to the cricopharyngeus muscle either in‐office or in the operating room. Success rates, complications, and patient tolerance were analyzed and compared across both procedural settings.

Results

Botulinum toxin injection proved effective in both settings, with similar success rates in restoring the ability to burp and relieving associated symptoms. In‐office procedures offered advantages in convenience and recovery time, while operating room procedures allowed for greater procedural control under general anesthesia. Side effect profiles differed slightly, with transient throat discomfort more commonly reported in in‐office cases.

Conclusion

Both in‐office and operating room botulinum toxin injections are effective treatment options for RCPD. The choice of setting should be guided by patient preference, comorbidities, and resource availability, as each approach offers distinct advantages and risk considerations.

Level of Evidence

The retrospective case series by Bastian et al. Wajsberg et al. Hoesli et al. and Doruk and Pitman are level III evidence. The prospective cohort study of Doruk et al. is level II evidence.

### Viscoelastic tamponade applied to the ocular surface for enhanced control of gaseous egress from the anterior chamber during final bubble titration in DMEK surgery: the "Polite" burp [^114SKJFp]. Cornea (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present a novel technique for enhancing the surgeon's control over the volume of air or gas that is "burped" from the anterior chamber during final bubble and intraocular pressure (IOP) titration in Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty.

Methods

After ascertaining that the intracameral bubble is either too large and/or has rendered IOP too high, a bead of ophthalmic viscoelastic is applied to the ocular surface over a paracentesis incision, which is then depressed in the usual fashion to burp gas from the anterior chamber.

Results

The weight and viscosity of the viscoelastic create a tamponade that slows the egress of gas from the anterior chamber, thereby making it more controllable.

Conclusions

If the bubble size or IOP needs to be reduced at the conclusion of the Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty procedure, application of ophthalmic viscoelastic over the paracentesis can enhance the surgeon's control over the volume of gas burped from the anterior chamber, thereby reducing the tendency to swing between a bubble that is too large or too small.

### Operating room or in-office injection for retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction botulinum toxin injection [^117J7z7u]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Retrograde Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction (RCPD), also known as "No Burp Syndrome", is a rare condition characterized by the inability to burp due to cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction. Patients experience bloating, chest and abdominal discomfort, gurgling sounds, and excessive flatulence, which significantly impact quality of life.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes and side effect profiles of botulinum toxin injection for RCPD when performed in-office versus in the operating room.

Methods

A clinical review of patients with RCPD was conducted, focusing on diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Botulinum toxin was administered to the cricopharyngeus muscle either in-office or in the operating room. Success rates, complications, and patient tolerance were analyzed and compared across both procedural settings.

Results

Botulinum toxin injection proved effective in both settings, with similar success rates in restoring the ability to burp and relieving associated symptoms. In-office procedures offered advantages in convenience and recovery time, while operating room procedures allowed for greater procedural control under general anesthesia. Side effect profiles differed slightly, with transient throat discomfort more commonly reported in in-office cases.

Conclusion

Both in-office and operating room botulinum toxin injections are effective treatment options for RCPD. The choice of setting should be guided by patient preference, comorbidities, and resource availability, as each approach offers distinct advantages and risk considerations.

Level Of Evidence

The retrospective case series by Bastian et al. Wajsberg et al. Hoesli et al. and Doruk and Pitman are level III evidence. The prospective cohort study of Doruk et al. is level II evidence.

### Prospective evaluation of abelchia / RCPD patients: abnormalities in high-resolution esophageal manometry [^112JJTpu]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Self-diagnosis of retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (RCPD) or abelchia has been increasing over the past 5years with patients seeking treatment for lifelong symptoms of inability to burp, neck gurgling, bloating, and flatulence. There is a distinct paucity of objective data in diagnosis and underlying pathophysiology of this disorder.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate patients with abelchia using standardized investigations to explore possible underlying mechanisms.

Methods

Patients presenting with clinical scenario consistent with RCPD were recruited into the study after informed consent. All patients underwent standardized investigations: Self reporting questionnaires EAT-10, VHI-10, and RSI scores, as well as esophagogastroscopy, barium swallow, and high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM), were performed.

Results

RCPD patients demonstrated a minor increase in the mean EAT-10 (5.2 ± 1.2) and normal RSI/VHI-10 scores. Barium swallow revealed 53% (CI 38%-64%) were abnormal with reflux with hiatus hernia (37%) and dysmotility (16%) as most common findings. HRM showed that 67% (CI 54%-78%) were abnormal. Ineffective motility was found in 41%, a further 23% showed a complete absence of peristalsis, whereas 33% were normal.

Conclusions

RCPD is a clinical condition of lifelong inability to belch and associated symptoms. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. This study demonstrates that a significant number of RCPD patients have abnormal esophageal neural network with high proportion of abnormal or absent esophageal peristalsis.

### Efficient organic carbon burial in the bengal fan sustained by the himalayan erosional system [^11675Vtx]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Continental erosion controls atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on geological timescales through silicate weathering, riverine transport and subsequent burial of organic carbon in oceanic sediments. The efficiency of organic carbon deposition in sedimentary basins is however limited by the organic carbon load capacity of the sediments and organic carbon oxidation in continental margins. At the global scale, previous studies have suggested that about 70 per cent of riverine organic carbon is returned to the atmosphere, such as in the Amazon basin. Here we present a comprehensive organic carbon budget for the Himalayan erosional system, including source rocks, river sediments and marine sediments buried in the Bengal fan. We show that organic carbon export is controlled by sediment properties, and that oxidative loss is negligible during transport and deposition to the ocean. Our results indicate that 70 to 85 per cent of the organic carbon is recent organic matter captured during transport, which serves as a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The amount of organic carbon deposited in the Bengal basin represents about 10 to 20 per cent of the total terrestrial organic carbon buried in oceanic sediments. High erosion rates in the Himalayas generate high sedimentation rates and low oxygen availability in the Bay of Bengal that sustain the observed extreme organic carbon burial efficiency. Active orogenic systems generate enhanced physical erosion and the resulting organic carbon burial buffers atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thereby exerting a negative feedback on climate over geological timescales.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^115q57e6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent and persistent bouts of hiccups impact the quality of life by interfering with eating, social interaction and work. Popular home remedies, such as breath holding and drinking ice water, target activity in the vagal and phrenic nerves that are thought to trigger these repetitive, myoclonic contractions. However, the pathophysiology of hiccups and the mechanism by which any of these methods work are unclear. Indeed, so little is known that there is no agreement whether the 'Hic' sound is due to the abrupt closure of the epiglottis or the glottis, including the vocal cords. Investigations were performed in a 50-year-old, otherwise healthy male with recurrent hiccups, in whom contractions persisted for up to 4 hours. Hiccups were initiated by drinking carbonated soda. The aerodigestive tract was visualised by video fluoroscopy. Hiccups were terminated by drinking a non-viscous contrast agent through a forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool. This device requires significant suction pressure (-100 mm Hg) to draw fluid into the mouth and is effective in approximately 90% of cases. The images were analysed together with concurrent audio recordings to gain insight into 'what causes the 'hic' in hiccups' and how this commonplace but annoying problem can be treated.

### Conceptualizing soil fauna effects on labile and stabilized soil organic matter [^113sNXdo]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Other soil fauna

Other groups of soil fauna, apart from earthworms, ants/termites, and beetles, perform bioturbation as well. However, much less is known about the relevance of bioturbation by those groups. For example, woodlice, millipedes, and springtails can significantly increase litter decomposition across litter species –. Recent evidence also suggests that invertebrates (and vertebrates) contribute globally to deadwood decay. Since animals are able to use only a fraction of the ingested litter for their own nutrition, most of this litter is converted into feces. Additionally, woodlice and millipedes have been reported to feed preferentially on leaf lamina, leaving the leaf vein mostly untouched, which may increase the accumulation of recalcitrant compounds and POM at the soil surface. Animal species that actively move vertically may mix some of this litter and POM with the mineral soil (either as litter fragments or feces). Such vertical movement through the soil to forage, lay eggs, hibernate, or estivate has been reported for insect larvae and adults, millipedes, and centipedes –. The rate of this mixing, however, is yet to be quantified in controlled experiments, and in situ using various biochemical tools (Fig. 3), and linked to the formation MAOM and accumulation (or decomposition) of POM.

Dissolved compounds

Some faunal taxa can have substantial effects on fluxes of dissolved organic matter and thus affect the direct sorption pathway of MAOM formation. For example, potworms dwelling in organic horizons, such as the forest floor or peat deposits, have often been related to increased production and leaching of dissolved organic matter. likely via stimulation of microbial activity and thus decomposition of organic matter. Increased leaching of dissolved organic matter from litter and forest floors has also been reported in the presence of springtails, likely induced by feces production, and for dung pats reworked by beetles. Given that this dissolved organic matter encounters reactive mineral surfaces, such as when percolating through forest or rangeland soils, soil fauna may indirectly influence sorption (or desorption) of dissolved compounds to mineral surfaces and thus MAOM formation.

### Cosleeping and sudden unexpected death in infancy [^1134eot2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Context

The practice of infants cosleeping with adults has long been the subject of controversy. Autopsy findings in cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are usually indistinguishable from those found with unintentional or intentional suffocation, and the determination of the cause of death in cases of sudden unexpected death in infancy is often based on investigative findings and the exclusion of natural or traumatic causes.

Objective

To further elucidate the risk of cosleeping.

Methods

We reviewed 58 cases of sudden unexpected infant deaths. Cases were excluded if there was any significant medical history or evidence of trauma or abuse.

Results

Twenty-seven of the infants were cosleeping. Eleven of these cases had been previously diagnosed as SIDS, and in 7 cases parental intoxication was documented.

Conclusion

Our findings support recent studies that suggest that cosleeping or placing an infant in an adult bed is a potentially dangerous practice. The frequency of cosleeping among cases diagnosed as SIDS in our study suggests that some of these deaths may actually be caused by mechanical asphyxia due to unintentional suffocation by the cosleeping adult and/or compressible bedding materials.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^117FD4gs]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Initial resuscitation and airway prioritization in drowning — Because of the central role of hypoxemia in the pathophysiology of drowning, initial resuscitation should focus on establishing and maintaining a patent airway and providing oxygen at the highest concentration available, which may include positive pressure ventilations. Compression-only CPR is likely to be of little to no benefit in drowning resuscitation, and its use should be limited to bystanders not trained to provide full (rescue breath and compression) CPR; bystander CPR for infants and children includes compressions and ventilations, regardless of which is started first. Professional rescuer CPR should emphasize prioritization of airway and breathing with positive pressure ventilation before initiation of chest compressions, because if the airway is overlooked in initial resuscitation, ongoing hypoxemia leads to decreased survival and worse neurologic outcomes. Incorrect administration of rescue breaths can delay care and cause gastric insufflation and pulmonary aspiration. For persons who are not trained, able, and/or willing to give rescue breaths, compression-only CPR is still the recommended method of resuscitation, and all persons who might respond to a drowning person (eg, parents, trip leaders, lifeguards) should take CPR classes that include training on the proper use of chest compressions and rescue breathing.

### Who is blaming the baby? [^112rXNuq]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Sudden unexplained collapse within the first 12 h of life is a rare but recognised event. Over a 2-year period, five infants, previously assessed as healthy, were found collapsed in our maternity unit in the care of their primiparous mothers. Two were found prone on their mother's chest, and two were in their mother's bed. The outcomes were poor, with four neonatal deaths and one death at 18 months. The rate of sudden unexplained neonatal collapse was 0.4 per 1000 live births. No cause for collapse was identified despite extensive investigations, which included postmortem in all the neonatal deaths. One infant, however, showed widespread antenatal brain damage at postmortem. It is postulated that some infants with an underlying vulnerability may maladapt to extrauterine life following an hypoxic stressor possibly caused by positional airway obstruction.

Abdominal thrusts in drowning — airway clearance guidance: All of these investigations failed to identify quality data to support use of the Heimlich maneuver before providing ventilations, and in drowning resuscitation the upper airway is frequently occluded by water or vomit, which should be cleared by standard suction techniques, not abdominal thrusts. If the drowning was precipitated by choking on food or a solid object, or if the airway is occluded by a solid object that is preventing ventilation, then the standard guidance for clearing foreign body airway obstruction applies, which may include abdominal thrusts/back blows if they are conscious or chest compressions if unconscious.

### Spontaneous endogenous core temperature rewarming after cooling due to snow burial [^115hwVe1]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To measure afterdrop and rewarming in subjects placed in a hypothermia wrap immediately after extrication from 60 minutes of snow burial.

Methods

We measured esophageal core body temperature (Tes) in 6 subjects buried in compacted snow (mean density 39%) for up to 60 minutes at an altitude of 2450 m while breathing with an AvaLung (Black Diamond Equipment, Salt Lake City, UT). Mean snow temperature was -3.5 ± 1.0 °C and mean air temperature was 0 ± 2 °C. Subjects wore a 1-piece Gore-Tex suit over medium weight Capilene underwear with a hood, face mask, goggles, mittens, and boots. After extrication from snow burial subjects were immediately placed in a hypothermia wrap. Tes was measured for an additional 60 minutes as subjects rewarmed by shivering.

Results

Tes cooling rate during snow burial was 0.84 ± 0.3 °C/h during a mean burial time of 58 ± 4 minutes. Tes afterdrop (0.77 ± 0.4 °C) occurred 12 ± 8 minutes after extrication from snow burial at a cooling rate of 4.0 ± 0.8 °C/h (P < .001 Tes snow burial vs afterdrop cooling rate). Rewarming rate was 1.1 ± 0.3 °C/h over the subsequent 48 ± 8 minutes (P = 0.045 snow burial cooling vs rewarming rate).

Conclusion

Afterdrop rate increased about 4-fold as compared to snow burial cooling rate for a transient time period in subjects who were placed immediately into an insulating hypothermia wrap. Spontaneous endogenous rewarming increased core body temperature at a slightly higher rate than it decreased during snow burial. These findings suggest that field rewarming of mildly hypothermic and shivering avalanche burial victims is possible, but they should be insulated quickly to limit significant afterdrop.

Your doctor has prescribed this medicine to treat an infection caused by an intestinal worm. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. In addition to your doctor's treatment, you can help prevent reinfection and infection of other people by understanding a few simple facts about worms.

PINWORM: Pinworms look like tiny white threads and live in the bowel. Usually at night, they travel to the rectal opening and lay eggs on the outside skin. This sometimes causes itching which may be very annoying. That is why restless sleep is a frequent sign of pinworms, especially in children. Scratching will cause pinworm eggs to stick to the fingers. Reinfection will result if the fingers are placed in the mouth.

The eggs, which are too small to see, contaminate whatever they come in contact with: bedclothes, underwear, hands, and food touched by contaminated hands. Even eggs floating in the air can be swallowed and cause infection. Pinworms are highly contagious. Even the cleanest and most careful people can get them.

To help prevent reinfection follow these rules:

Wash hands and fingernails with soap often during the day, especially before eating and after using the toilet.
Wear tight underpants both day and night. Change them daily.
For several days after treatment, clean the bedroom floor by vacuuming or damp mopping. Avoid dry sweeping that may stir up dust.
After treatment, wash bed linens and night clothes (don't shake them).
Keep the toilet seats clean

### Management of belching, hiccups, and aerophagia [^116RfmGh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Although belching and hiccups are regarded as normal behaviors, they can occur at high frequency or become persistent, becoming bothersome and requiring medical care. Patients with excessive belching frequently have supragastric belches. Excessive belching should be treated as a behavioral disorder. Persistent hiccups, however, can be the first presentation of a serious disorder that requires extensive diagnostic testing. When no cause is found, only the symptoms can be treated. Aerophagia is an episodic or chronic disorder in which patients (children and adults) swallow large quantities of air, which accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract to cause abdominal distention and bloating. These patients should not undergo explorative laparotomy because they do not have ileus. New treatment approaches are needed for patients with aerophagia.

### Carbon sequestration by multiple biological pump pathways in a coastal upwelling biome [^115AgcPA]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We must also consider the interconnectedness of the BCP pathways. While our conceptual model differentiates three processes, it necessarily simplifies the complexity of the BCP. For instance, vertical migrators with long gut turnover times will defecate a portion of their ingested prey at depth (active transport), where it will be released as fecal pellets that contribute to further downward sinking flux. Conversely, sinking particles can be consumed by vertical migrators that transport the carbon deeper into the ocean. Organic molecules cleaved from sinking particles by microbial hydrolytic exoenzymesmay be subducted further into the ocean interior, while subducted particles can aggregate in the deep ocean to form sinking marine snow. Slowly sinking particles in regions of active subduction or mixed layer deepening contribute simultaneously to multiple BCP pathways. Distinctly different physical processes that we have lumped into the "subduction/vertical mixing" pathways (e.g. eddy pump, diapycnal diffusion, large-scale downwelling, mixed layer entrainment/detrainment,) may also respond differently to climate change while driving regionally variable remineralization length scales. By quantifying for the first time biogeochemical processes from production to sequestration across multiple BCP pathways, the present study provides an integrated framework to evaluate other biomes, approaches, and hypotheses.

### Validity and reliability of the burp score [^111YWFnD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the validity and the reliability of the Burp Score, a patient-reported outcome questionnaire documenting the retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (R-CPD) symptoms.

Study Design

Prospective controlled study.

Methods

R-CPD Patients were consecutively recruited from 2 hospitals between September 2024 and April 2025. Patients and healthy individuals completed the Burp score twice within a 7-day period to assess test-retest reliability. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's α for the Burp items in patients and controls. Validity was evaluated by comparing the Burp with the reflux symptom score-12 (RSS-12). The Burp score was completed 3 to 6 months after the EMG-guided botulinum toxin injection (BTI) to evaluate the responsiveness to change. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Results

Eighty R-CPD patients (46 females) completed the baseline evaluations. Of the 134 screened controls, 34 (22.4%) were excluded because unable to burp. Test-retest reliability (rₛ = 0.911) and internal consistency reliability (α = 0.870) were high. Burp Score reported a moderate but significant external validity indicated by a significant correlation with the RSS-12 (rₛ = 0.533). Internal validity was excellent regarding the significant differences between the Burp Score of R-CPD patients versus controls (P = 0.001). Burp score significantly decreased from pre- to posttreatment, indicating a high responsiveness to change. ROC analysis reported a MCID of 11.0 to consider the treatment partially or fully effective.

Conclusion

The Burp score is a valid and reliable patient-reported outcome questionnaire documenting R-CPD symptoms and assessing their related pretreatment to posttreatment severity and frequency.

1: Dumping syndrome is a frequent complication of oesophageal, gastric or bariatric surgery

Statement endorsed.
Overall agreement 80%: A+ 65%, A 15%, A− 10%, D− 5%, D 0%, D+ 5%.
Grade B.

2: Dumping syndrome consists of a constellation of symptoms that can be categorized as early dumping syndrome or late dumping syndrome

Statement endorsed.
Overall agreement 95%: A+ 90%, A 5%, A− 5%, D− 0%, D 0%, D+ 0%.
Grade B.

Dumping syndrome occurs in approximately 20% of patients who undergo vagotomy with pyloroplasty, in up to 40% of patients after gastrectomy and in up to 50% of patients who undergo oesophagectomy. Dumping syndrome has also been reported after Nissen fundoplication in both children and adults. Over the past decade, bariatric surgery has become the principal cause of postoperative dumping syndrome. Furthermore, dumping syndrome has mainly been reported after RYGB and partial gastrectomy. Moreover, among 450 patients who had undergone RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy, approximately one-third (34.2%) had postoperative symptoms consistent with postprandial hypoglycaemia, indicating the presence of late dumping syndrome.

Dumping syndrome consists of a constellation of symptoms that can be subdivided into early dumping syndrome or late dumping syndrome on the basis of the time at which the symptoms appear and the presumed underlying pathophysiology. Early dumping syndrome is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, borborygmi, nausea and diarrhoea, and vasomotor symptoms such as fatigue, desire to lie down after meals, flushing, palpitations, perspiration, tachycardia, hypotension and, rarely, syncope. Symptoms of late dumping syndrome are related to neuroglycopenia (indicated by fatigue, weakness, confusion, hunger and syncope) and autonomic and/or adrenergic reactivity (indicated by perspiration, palpitations, tremor and irritability).

3: Early dumping syndrome symptoms occur within the first hour after a meal

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^112Hgsxb]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Abdominal bloating and distention — Rome IV definitions and diagnostic scope indicate that abdominal bloating is a subjective sensation, whereas abdominal distention is a visible increase in abdominal girth; the Rome IV criteria define functional bloating and distention as DGBIs with recurrent symptoms of abdominal fullness or pressure or a visible increase in abdominal girth with symptoms at least 1 day per week and active for 3 months, with onset of 6 months, and without a predominance of pain and alteration in bowel habits. Rome IV has an abdominal bloating and distention category that is separate from other DGBIs. A large global population-based study found a prevalence as high as 3.5% (4.6% in women and 2.4% in men), and bloating and distention are much more prevalent (> 50%) when associated with other DGBIs such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation, and FD. When the Rome IV diagnostic criteria are met, the patient should not fulfill criteria for a diagnosis of IBS, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, or FD, and diagnostic testing will depend on an algorithmic approach based on presumptive causes.

### Functional fecal soiling without constipation, organic cause or neuropsychiatric disorders? [^116wBeu1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The aetiology of fecal incontinence in children has traditionally been attributed to idiopathic constipation, structural defects or neuropsychiatric disorders. We describe a new subgroup of otherwise healthy children who have fecal soiling without any underlying cause for the incontinence.

Methods

The hospital records of children with fecal incontinence were screened to detect patients without any history, signs or symptoms of constipation or an organic, neurological or psychiatric cause for the incontinence. Anorectal manometry findings were compared with those of age-matched children with idiopathic constipation and soiling.

Results

Eight boys and 5 girls were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 7.9 years. Soiling had lasted median of 4.1 years, occurred at least every other day in 9, at least once a week in 2 and occasionally in 2 and required change of underwear or use of protective pads. Abdominal x-ray and barium enema showed normal findings. Sacral x-ray and/or MRI of the spinal cord showed normal bony spine and spinal cord. Five children had coexisting night and/or daytime wetting. Impaired rectal sensation was the only identifiable abnormality that was detected. The median volume required for the first sensation was 45 mL (range, 15–100 mL; normal, < 15 mL). Anorectal manometry alone was unable to differentiate patients with functional fecal soiling from those with idiopathic constipation associated soiling. The median follow-up time after the diagnosis was 9.1 months. Treatment of fecal soiling consisted of education, dietary modification or stimulatory laxatives to establish regular toileting routines. Treatment improved fecal continence in 6 out of 8 cases with follow-up longer than 6 months.

Conclusions

There is a small subgroup of children with fecal soiling who are otherwise healthy without constipation or any other underlying cause for the incontinence. These children seem to have isolated impairment of rectal sensation. In most, the prognosis is good with conservative treatment.

### Sea-dumped chemical weapons: environmental risk, occupational hazard [^112yWbzn]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chemical weapons dumped into the ocean for disposal in the twentieth century pose a continuing environmental and human health risk.

Objective

In this review we discuss locations, quantity, and types of sea-dumped chemical weapons, related environmental concerns, and human encounters with sea-dumped chemical weapons.

Methods

We utilized the Ovid (http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) and PubMed (http://www.pubmed.org) search engines to perform MEDLINE searches for the terms 'sea-dumped chemical weapons', 'chemical warfare agents', and 'chemical munitions'. The searches returned 5863 articles. Irrelevant and non-English articles were excluded. A review of the references for these articles yielded additional relevant sources, with a total of 64 peer-reviewed articles cited in this paper. History and geography of chemical weapons dumping at sea: Hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical munitions were disposed off at sea following World War II. European, Russian, Japanese, and United States coasts are the areas most affected worldwide. Several areas in the Baltic and North Seas suffered concentrated large levels of dumping, and these appear to be the world's most studied chemical warfare agent marine dumping areas. Chemical warfare agents: Sulfur mustard, Lewisite, and the nerve agents appear to be the chemical warfare agents most frequently disposed off at sea. Multiple other type of agents including organoarsenicals, blood agents, choking agents, and lacrimators were dumped at sea, although in lesser volumes. Environmental concerns: Numerous geohydrologic variables contribute to the rate of release of chemical agents from their original casings, leading to difficult and inexact modeling of risk of release into seawater. Sulfur mustard and the organoarsenicals are the most environmentally persistent dumped chemical agents. Sulfur mustard in particular has a propensity to form a solid or semi-solid lump with a polymer coating of breakdown products, and can persist in this state on the ocean floor for decades. Rates of solubility and hydrolysis and levels of innate toxicity of a chemical agent are used to predict the risk to the marine environments. The organoarsenicals eventually breakdown into arsenic, and thus present an indefinite timeline for contamination. Generally, studies assaying sediment and water levels of parent chemical agents and breakdown products at dumpsites have found minimal amounts of relevant chemicals, although arsenic levels are typically higher in dumpsites than reference areas. Studies of marine organisms have not shown concerning amounts of chemical agents or breakdown products in tissue, but have shown evidence of chronic toxicity. There is believed to be minimal risk posed by seafood consumption. Microbiota assays of dumpsites are significantly altered in species composition compared to reference sites, which may imply unseen but significant changes to ecosystems of dumpsites. Human health concerns: The major human health risk at this time appears to arise from acute exposure to an agent by either accidental recovery of a chemical weapon on a fishing vessel, or by munitions washed ashore onto beaches.

Conclusions

Improving technology continues to make the deep sea more accessible, thus increasing the risk of disturbing munitions lying on or buried in the seabed. Pipe laying, cable burying, drilling, scuba diving, trawling, and undersea scientific research are the activities posing the most risk. The long-term threat to the benthic habitat via increased arsenic concentrations, shifts in microbiota speciation, and chronic toxicity to vertebrates and invertebrates is not currently understood. The risk to the environment of massive release via disturbance remains a distinct possibility. Terrorist recovery and re-weaponization of chemical agents is a remote possibility.

### Sudden infant death syndrome: an update [^113cG6Mp]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Based on strong research evidence: All infants should be placed in the supine position for every sleep. Tobacco exposure pre- and postnatally should be avoided. Room sharing without bed sharing is recommended. It is recommended that blankets, pillows, and other soft bedding be removed from the infant sleep area. Overheating should be avoided. Breastfeeding should be encouraged for SIDS risk reduction. Pacifier use should be encouraged for SIDS risk reduction. Immunizations should be encouraged for SIDS risk reduction. The evidence for fan use or swaddling as strategies to reduce the risk of SIDS is inconclusive.

### Usefulness and diagnostic value of the NEMA parameter combined with other selected bedside tests for prediction of difficult intubation [^111z3E5o]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To assess the usefulness of the new NEMA (Neck Circumference Minus Acromion-Acromion Distance) parameter, in preoperative identification of patients' difficult intubation and compare it with other commonly used scales and tests.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

District Specialist Hospital of Lublin, Poland.

Patients

Six hundreds twenty-nine patients underwent nonemergency surgical interventions.

Measurements

The NEMA parameter was confronted with: Modified Mallampati classification, TMD, RHTMD, NC, MPND, SMD, I-I D, A-AD, and medical history of difficult intubation and diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or snoring.

Main Results

Higher medians of NEMA and Mallampati parameters were reported in patients with difficult intubation. AUC for Mallampati parameter was 0.733 while the NEMA parameter's AUC was 0.625. Sensitivity and specificity for Mallampati and NEMA parameter were respectively 0.79; 0.55 and 0.42; 0.75. Significantly higher MPN, RHTMD, Mallampati, and NEMA parameter were observed in patients in whom the BURP was used. Easy intubation occurs more frequently in patients with a history of OSAS or snoring than in those with difficult intubation.

Conclusion

It seems that none of the known bedside tests for predicting difficult intubation have a discriminating power sufficient for clinicians. Our study draws attention to a novel parameter, called NEMA, which appears to be a strong predictor of DEI, especially in combination with the Mallampati scale.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^115N5S2a]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Common complex disorders risk alleles — Unlike Mendelian diseases, the identification of common, complex disease genes has largely relied on population-based approaches such as genome-wide association studies. Currently, numerous genome-wide association study reports have resulted in the cataloguing of over 1,200 risk alleles for common, complex diseases and traits, and most of these variants are in noncoding regions. Common, complex risk alleles typically confer low relative risk and are meager in their predictive power, and to date the utility of common, complex risk allele testing for patient care has been unclear, with models to combine multiple markers into a cumulative risk score often flawed and usually no better than traditional risk factors such as family.

Postprandial pain which starts soon after eating and lasts for an hour or so, often requiring people to take to their bed, may indicate that the person is trying to eat too much at one sitting. Rarely, it indicates mesenteric ischaemia. Postprandial dizziness, light-headedness, nausea, bloating, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea may suggest dumping syndrome or reactive hypoglycaemia but are also symptoms commonly caused by SIBO.

Significant weight loss is common after upper GI surgery. It may be a consequence of the catabolic state from surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapies or cancer recurrence or an imbalance between calorific requirements and dietary intake. Poorly controlled GI symptoms also contribute. Weight loss, although easy to record, may not be as important as changes to body composition or sarcopenia.

Non-specific symptoms are common in this patient group and inadequate investigation risks missing treatable causes. If IBS was not present before surgery, it is unreasonable to attribute them to IBS afterwards. Nocturnal waking to defaecate and steatorrhoea are never features of IBS. A systematic investigative approachcan be very effective to diagnose the potential multiple coexisting diagnoses including BAD, PEI, SIBO, overflow diarrhoea, jejunostomy feed related diarrhoea, malabsorption syndromes and late dumping syndrome. Further contributing factors may include alimentary and lifestyle issues, such as too much or too little fibre, excessive alcohol, excessive caffeine, excess consumption of drinks containing artificial sweeteners or side effects of prescribed medication. Lower GI symptoms are common after upper GI surgery and should be investigated systematically (table 6).

To identify patients who need appropriate assessment requires patients and clinicians to be vigilant and to understand that the development of chronic symptoms is not 'normal' and that dietetic support usually needs to be supplemented by an appropriate systematic investigation so that the underlying cause(s) can be correctly diagnosed and treated. It is of note that contrast studies and/or gastric emptying studies for the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying are compromised by a lack of standard normal range values in this specific patient group and if undertaken, should be interpreted with caution.

burpingListen to pronunciationThe release of air or gas from the stomach or esophagus through the mouth. Burping is usually caused by a buildup of air in the esophagus or upper part of the stomach when too much air is swallowed. This can occur when eating or drinking too fast, talking while eating, drinking carbonated drinks, chewing gum, smoking, or having an anxiety attack. Burping may also be a side effect of certain medicines or a symptom of some gastrointestinal conditions and digestive problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, and stomach ulcers or infections. Also called belching and eructation.
