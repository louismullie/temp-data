## Question

What does first degree AV block mean and how do you identify it

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block is and how to identify it on ECG. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and whether "block" is technically accurate. Then, I should verify the ECG criteria and measurement method. Next, I will review the pathophysiology and anatomic level of delay. After that, I need to check clinical significance, including when symptoms occur and what outcomes are associated. Finally, I will consider how to distinguish it from other AV blocks and outline practical identification steps with guideline context.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't mislabel it. First-degree AV block is a misnomer; there is no true block because every P wave is conducted to the ventricles, but the PR interval is abnormally prolonged beyond 200 ms, so it is more accurately termed first-degree AV delay rather than true block [^111aJn64] [^116d7xwm].

> I should double-check the ECG criteria next. On a 12-lead ECG, first-degree AV block is identified by 1:1 AV conduction with a PR interval greater than 200 ms in adults; the PR is measured from the onset of the P wave to the onset of the QRS complex, and the rhythm is otherwise regular with consistent PR intervals across the tracing [^117Gmb4B] [^111zc8U1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without anchoring to anatomy. The delay is most commonly at the AV node, though it can reflect atrial conduction delay or His-Purkinje system delay; severe first-degree AV block with PR greater than 300 ms and a narrow QRS typically indicates AV nodal delay, whereas a wide QRS may suggest infranodal involvement even when the surface ECG shows only PR prolongation [^111aJn64] [^112rBXX3].

> Next, I should review clinical significance and symptoms. Isolated first-degree AV block is often asymptomatic, but when the PR interval is markedly prolonged, typically beyond 300 ms, patients may develop exertional intolerance, fatigue, or symptoms akin to pacemaker syndrome due to atrioventricular dyssynchrony. In such cases, pacing can improve symptoms even without higher-grade block, though this is uncommon and symptom correlation is essential [^115EMG8W] [^112wshao].

> I need to ensure I contextualize prognosis. Observational cohort data show that a prolonged PR interval is associated with higher risks of incident atrial fibrillation, pacemaker implantation, and all-cause mortality; each 20 ms PR prolongation confers incremental risk, and individuals with PR greater than 200 ms have approximately a 2-fold higher AF risk and a 3-fold higher pacemaker risk over long-term follow-up, though causality is not established and these are population-level associations [^113mMX4f] [^114xuB7r].

> But wait, what if the ECG shows something that looks like AV block but isn't? I should confirm differentiation from higher-grade AV block. Unlike second-degree AV block, first-degree AV block has no dropped QRS complexes; unlike third-degree AV block, there is 1:1 AV conduction with a stable, albeit prolonged, PR interval, so careful measurement and rhythm strip review prevent misclassification [^117Gmb4B] [^111zc8U1].

> Let me think about practical identification steps so this is clinically actionable. First, obtain a standard 12-lead ECG and measure the PR interval from the earliest P-wave deflection to the earliest QRS deflection; if every P is followed by a QRS and the PR is consistently greater than 200 ms, first-degree AV block is present. Then, assess QRS width; a narrow QRS supports nodal delay, whereas a wide QRS raises concern for infranodal disease even with PR prolongation alone. Next, correlate with symptoms; marked PR prolongation with exertional intolerance may warrant further evaluation, whereas isolated, mild PR prolongation without symptoms generally requires no immediate intervention beyond addressing reversible causes and follow-up [^117Gmb4B] [^112rBXX3] [^112NvoNN].

> I should confirm guideline-based management implications to avoid overtreatment. In asymptomatic patients with first-degree AV block and no evidence of structural heart disease, routine cardiac imaging is not indicated, and permanent pacing is not recommended unless there are compelling, symptom-specific indications such as PR greater than 300 ms with clear pacemaker-like symptoms; otherwise, observation and treatment of reversible contributors are preferred [^113ibFfT] [^112NvoNN].

> In summary, first-degree AV block reflects 1:1 AV conduction with a PR interval greater than 200 ms. It is best viewed as a conduction delay rather than a true block, most often nodal, variably associated with symptoms when PR exceeds 300 ms, and linked in observational studies to modestly higher risks of AF, pacemaker implantation, and mortality. Accurate identification hinges on careful PR measurement and rhythm correlation, with management tailored to symptoms and underlying etiology rather than the PR prolongation alone [^111aJn64] [^113mMX4f] [^117Gmb4B].

First-degree AV block is defined by a **PR interval > 200 ms** [^117Gmb4B] with 1:1 AV conduction and no dropped beats [^111aJn64]. It is identified on ECG by a **uniformly prolonged PR** (> 200 ms) with normal P waves and QRS complexes, and no progression to higher-grade block [^11397g1r]. Most cases are benign and require no treatment, but **evaluate for reversible causes** (e.g. medications, electrolytes, ischemia) and consider pacing only if symptomatic or if PR > 300 ms with symptoms [^112wshao] [^112NvoNN].

---

## Definition and pathophysiology

- **Definition**: First-degree AV block is a conduction delay with PR > 200 ms and 1:1 AV conduction; no beats are dropped [^117Gmb4B] [^111aJn64].

- **Pathophysiology**: Delay most often at the AV node [^112QLGpZ], but can also involve atria or His-Purkinje system [^112QLGpZ]; typically slow progression and benign [^116uhdf3].

---

## ECG criteria for identification

On ECG, the **PR interval is > 200 ms** (0.20 s) in adults, with consistent 1:1 AV conduction and no dropped QRS complexes [^11397g1r]. P waves and QRS complexes are normal in morphology, and the rhythm is regular with a stable PR.

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

- **Benign course**: Usually benign and stable; rarely progresses to higher-grade block [^116uhdf3].

- **Adverse associations**: Linked to higher risks of AF, pacemaker implantation, and mortality in observational cohorts [^113mMX4f] [^114xuB7r].

- **Symptomatic cases**: PR > 300 ms can cause AV dyssynchrony and exertional intolerance; pacing may help if symptoms correlate [^112wshao] [^113YUPHH].

---

## Clinical evaluation and management

- **Evaluation**: Identify reversible causes (medications, electrolytes, ischemia, sleep apnea) and assess for structural heart disease [^113QqMBo].

- **Imaging**: Echocardiography is reasonable if structural disease is suspected; not routine for isolated, asymptomatic first-degree AV block [^113ibFfT] [^114A56rn].

- **Management**: No treatment if asymptomatic; treat reversible causes; consider pacing only if symptomatic or PR > 300 ms with symptoms [^112NvoNN] [^112wshao].

## Differentiation from other AV blocks

| **Attribute** | **First-degree av block** | **Second-degree av block** | **Third-degree av block** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PR interval | Prolonged (> 200 ms) | Progressive or fixed | Variable |
| AV conduction | 1:1 | Intermittent non-conducted P waves | Complete dissociation |
| Clinical course | Benign, stable | May progress | High risk, requires pacing |

---

First-degree AV block is a **prolonged PR interval** with 1:1 conduction; it is usually benign, but assess for reversible causes and consider pacing only if symptomatic or if PR is markedly prolonged with symptoms.

Cardiac sarcoidosis — diagnostic approach and electrocardiographic clues — "The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis can be challenging". Although "The noncaseating granuloma is the characteristic pathological lesion of sarcoidosis; however, these granulomas are not specific to sarcoidosis and can be the result of various infectious and noninfectious causes". Proposed criteria "rely on pathological demonstration of cardiac granulomas or noninvasive evidence of cardiac involvement in a patient with pathologically proven extracardiac sarcoidosis". Initial evaluation includes "a detailed history and physical examination, ECG, and chest radiograph". ECG abnormalities are described: "Abnormal electrocardiographic findings include bundle-branch block, new atrioventricular block, frequent premature ventricular complexes, ventricular tachycardia, pathologic Q waves, and ST-T changes". Conduction disturbances are emphasized: "First-degree heart block caused by disease of the conduction system is common and can progress to complete heart block", and "In patients with clinically evident cardiac sarcoidosis, complete heart block is a common finding". Moreover, "Complete heart block occurs at a younger age in patients with sarcoidosis than in patients with complete heart block attributable to other causes". Consequently, "Any of these electrocardiographic findings should prompt further investigation".

ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 — acquired atrioventricular (AV) block in adults defines and classifies AV block as follows: AV block is classified as first-, second-, or third-degree (complete) block; anatomically, it is defined as supra-, intra-, or infra-His. First-degree AV block is defined as abnormal prolongation of the PR interval (greater than 0.20 seconds). Second-degree AV block is subclassified as type I and type II. Type I second-degree AV block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a nonconducted beat and a shorter PR interval after the blocked beat. Type II second-degree AV block is characterized by fixed PR intervals before and after blocked beats and is usually associated with a wide QRS complex. When AV conduction occurs in a 2:1 pattern, block cannot be classified unequivocally as type I or type II, although the width of the QRS can be suggestive, as just described.

Atrioventricular (AV) block in ACHD — mortality and symptom risk: Atrioventricular block at any level is associated with a higher mortality in the ACHD patient, yet no randomized studies exist to compare treatment strategies for the asymptomatic patient, and the degree of atrioventricular block from first-degree to complete atrioventricular block is relevant as far as reliability of an escape rhythm or unexplained syncope is concerned, yet patients may develop symptoms, regardless of the level block. Patients with significant prolongation of atrioventricular conduction (without block) can develop atrioventricular dyssynchrony to such a degree that pacemaker syndrome can develop, and certain congenital anomalies (eg, ccTGA and the endocardial cushion defects) are inherently associated with a more fragile atrioventricular conduction system, and more rigorous scrutiny of these patient groups is necessary.

General principles — supportive considerations for nodal atrioventricular block: First‑ and second‑degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) AV blocks (or 2:1 AV block at the AV node) are typically benign in that they do not progress significantly to complete heart block, and treatment with a pacemaker is typically reserved for significant symptoms that affect quality of life (QOL); occasionally second‑degree Mobitz type I block is infranodal and in those instances a pacemaker may be considered even in the absence of symptoms. Although a narrow QRS suggests nodal block, infranodal disease can be revealed during an electrophysiology study (EPS), and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or a treadmill exercise test may be useful to correlate symptoms. If symptoms do not clearly correspond to episodes of AV block, the risks associated with a pacemaker in the absence of clear benefit make the overall risk‑benefit ratio unfavorable; in long‑standing persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) with a low heart rate and appropriate chronotropic response, pacing for rate support is unlikely to be beneficial, and although PPM implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and leads have long‑term management implications.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — supportive details for AV block testing: In patients with second-degree AV block, differentiation between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II is important, and severe first-degree AV block (PR > 0.30 s) with a narrow QRS usually indicates atrioventricular node delay. For intermittent symptoms, event monitors worn for 30 to 90 days and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators left in place for > 2 years tend to have greater diagnostic yield than 24- to 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and in 1 study atrioventricular block as a cause of syncope was more common with structural heart disease (34% versus 13%). An exercise treadmill stress test may help differentiate whether 2:1 AV block is Mobitz type I or II or identify infranodal disease. In second-degree AV block with concomitant bundle branch block, the block is likely but not necessarily infra-His (70% likelihood), and with 2:1 AV block plus bundle branch block, 15% to 20% can have block in the atrioventricular node.

Imaging in patients with documented or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders — With COR I (LOE B-NR), transthoracic echocardiography is recommended in patients with newly identified left bundle branch block (LBBB), second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block with or without apparent structural heart disease or coronary artery disease; with COR IIa (LOE B-NR), in selected patients presenting with bradycardia or conduction disorders other than LBBB, second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block, transthoracic echocardiography is reasonable if structural heart disease is suspected; with COR IIa (LOE C-LD), in selected patients with bradycardia or bundle branch block, disease-specific advanced imaging (e.g., transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or nuclear imaging) is reasonable if structural heart disease is suspected not confirmed by other diagnostic modalities; and with COR III: No Benefit (LOE B-NR), in patients with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia or first-degree atrioventricular block and no clinical evidence of structural heart disease, routine cardiac imaging is not indicated.

Permanent pacemaker implantation — AV block Class IIa indications: Permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for persistent third-degree AV block with an escape rate greater than 40 bpm in asymptomatic adult patients without cardiomegaly; for asymptomatic second-degree AV block at intra- or infra-His levels found at electrophysiological study; for first- or second-degree AV block with symptoms similar to pacemaker syndrome or hemodynamic compromise; and for asymptomatic type II second-degree AV block with a narrow QRS, noting that when type II second-degree AV block occurs with a wide QRS, including isolated right bundle-branch block, pacing becomes a Class I recommendation.

Atrioventricular block — permanent pacing recommendations for chronic therapy/management specify that in patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block not attributable to reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms. In patients with neuromuscular diseases associated with conduction disorders, including muscular dystrophy (eg, myotonic dystrophy type 1) or Kearns-Sayre syndrome, who have evidence of second-degree atrioventricular block, third-degree atrioventricular block, or an HV interval of 70 ms or greater, regardless of symptoms, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, is recommended. In patients with permanent AF and symptomatic bradycardia, permanent pacing is recommended. In patients who develop symptomatic atrioventricular block as a consequence of guideline-directed management and therapy for which there is no alternative treatment and continued treatment is clinically necessary, permanent pacing is recommended to increase heart rate and improve symptoms. In patients with an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, such as cardiac sarcoidosis or amyloidosis, and second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, is reasonable. In patients with lamin A/C gene mutations, including limb-girdle and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies, with a PR interval greater than 240 ms and LBBB, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, is reasonable. In patients with marked first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) atrioventricular block with symptoms that are clearly attributable to the atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is reasonable. In patients with neuromuscular diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy type 1, with a PR interval greater than 240 ms, a QRS duration greater than 120 ms, or fascicular block, permanent pacing, with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, may be considered.

### Bradydysrhythmias and atrioventricular conduction blocks [^115PA8dB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Bradydysrhythimas include sinus bradycardia, junctional brady-cardia, and idioventricular rhythm, which can be distinguished by examining the tracing for the presence or absence of P waves, noting the morphology of these P waves, and determining the width of the QRS complex. Sinoatrial blocks may occur in either first, second, or third degree varieties. Only second degree sinoatrial block can be detected on the 12-lead ECG. Sinus pause and sinus arrest may mimic second degree sinoatrial block, but their periodicity is irregular. The cyclic variability of sinus arrhythmia is unique; as with the other bradydysrhythmias, it may be innocent or pathologic depending upon clinical circumstances. Atrioventricular blocks may occur, and, similar to sinoatrial blocks, they are also categorized as first-, second-, or third degree. These are of greater clinical relevance than their sinoatrial counterparts.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — definitions of sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block specify key thresholds and patterns: Sinus bradycardia is defined as "Sinus rate < 50 bpm", and a sinus pause occurs when the "Sinus node depolarizes ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization", while sinus node arrest is "No evidence of sinus node depolarization". First-degree AV block has 1:1 conduction with "a PR interval > 200 ms", and second-degree AV block shows "P waves with a constant rate (< 100 bpm) where atrioventricular conduction is present but not 1:1". Mobitz type I features a constant P rate "(< 100 bpm)" with a periodic single nonconducted P wave and "nonconstant PR intervals", whereas Mobitz type II has a constant P rate "(< 100 bpm)" with a periodic single nonconducted P wave and "constant PR intervals (excluding 2:1 atrioventricular block)". In 2:1 AV block, P waves have a constant rate with "rate (< 100 bpm) where every other P wave conducts to the ventricles". Advanced or high-grade AV block is defined by " ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a constant physiologic rate that do not conduct to the ventricles with evidence for some atrioventricular conduction", and third-degree AV block has "No evidence of atrioventricular conduction"; related terms include "Vagally mediated atrioventricular block" and "Infranodal block".

### Long-term outcomes in individuals with prolonged PR interval or first-degree atrioventricular block [^113mMX4f]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Prolongation of the electrocardiographic PR interval, known as first-degree atrioventricular block when the PR interval exceeds 200 milliseconds, is frequently encountered in clinical practice.

Objective

To determine the clinical significance of PR prolongation in ambulatory individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective, community-based cohort including 7575 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (mean age, 47 years; 54% women) who underwent routine 12-lead electrocardiography. The study cohort underwent prospective follow-up through 2007 from baseline examinations in 1968–1974. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations of PR interval with the incidence of arrhythmic events and death.

Main Outcome Measures

Incident atrial fibrillation (AF), pacemaker implantation, and all-cause mortality.

Results

During follow-up, 481 participants developed AF, 124 required pacemaker implantation, and 1739 died. At the baseline examination, 124 individuals had PR intervals longer than 200 milliseconds. For those with PR intervals longer than 200 milliseconds compared with those with PR intervals of 200 milliseconds or shorter, incidence rates per 10 000 person-years were 140 (95% confidence interval [CI] 95–208) vs 36 (95% CI, 32–39) for AF, 59 (95% CI, 40–87) vs 6 (95% CI, 5–7) for pacemaker implantation, and 334 (95% CI, 260–428) vs 129 (95% CI, 123–135) for all-cause mortality. Corresponding absolute risk increases were 1.04% (AF), 0.53% (pacemaker implantation), and 2.05% (all-cause mortality) per year. In multivariable analyses, each 20-millisecond increment in PR was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02–1.22; p = 0.02) for AF, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.14–1.30; P < .001) for pacemaker implantation, and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02–1.13; p = 0.005) for all-cause mortality. Individuals with first-degree atrioventricular block had a 2-fold adjusted risk of AF (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.36–3.12; P < .001), 3-fold adjusted risk of pacemaker implantation (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.83–4.57; P < .001), and 1.4-fold adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.44, 95% CI, 1.09–1.91; p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Prolongation of the PR interval is associated with increased risks of AF, pacemaker implantation, and all-cause mortality.

Clinical presentation — atrioventricular (AV) block symptoms and related findings: Profound first-degree AV block may cause fatigue or exertional intolerance and may occur with PR interval > 300 ms. In syncope patients with a normal ECG and echocardiogram, 8% had paroxysmal idiopathic AV block with no identifiable underlying cause. Among syncope patients with underlying bundle branch block or bifascicular block, 61% had clinically relevant His Purkinje conduction abnormalities identified at EPS. Patients with AV block that conducts in a 2:1 pattern can have fatigue and dizziness, particularly if it persists during exertion.

### Familial risk of atrioventricular block in first-degree relatives [^112yDFnH]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrioventricular block (AVB) is the most common indication for pacemaker implantation, and the incidence of AVB increases with older age. Over the past decade, an average of 350 persons per million inhabitants have received a first-time pacemaker due to AVB in Denmark annually. In rare cases, AVB is found to be hereditary and may even be caused by a single genetic variant, for example, in genes coding for lamin A/C, titin, SCN5A or transthyretin amyloidosis. In most of these cases, AVB is only one component of several characteristics of the overall cardiac phenotype, whereas in other cases isolated genetically determined AVB is seen. However, in the majority of patients with AVB no aetiology of AVB is identified. One recent study examined the heredity of cardiac conduction defects including both sinus node dysfunction and AVB, and found an increased risk among first-degree family members. However, very little is known about the familial risk of AVB in the population. Therefore, we performed a nationwide study to assess the risk of AVB in first-degree relatives to patients with AVB.

### Vagally mediated atrioventricular block: pathophysiology and diagnosis [^1131hUAr]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Vagally mediated atrioventricular (AV) block is defined as a paroxysmal AV block, localised within the AV node, associated with slowing of the sinus rate. All types of second-degree AV block, including pseudo-Mobitz II block, and complete AV block, may be present. Most of the patients have normal AV conduction. Differential diagnosis with intrinsic AV block is based on the behaviour of the sinus rate. Vagally mediated AV block is benign; it can be recorded as an asymptomatic or symptomatic event (syncope/presyncope). Syncope due to this form of AV block should be diagnosed and managed as neurally mediated syncope. When this block is fortuitously recorded in asymptomatic patients, pacemaker implantation is not indicated.

### Frequency of electrocardiogram-defined cardiac conduction disorders in a multi-institutional primary care cohort [^111eDbHB]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the clinical implications of disorders affecting atrioventricular conduction may vary by physiologic mechanism and anatomic location, we grouped specific conditions by inferred anatomic region of abnormal conduction (based on information available on surface ECG) and the presence or absence of atrioventricular node conduction block (Figure 1). We therefore grouped first-degree atrioventricular block and second-degree atrioventricular block type 1 as nodal delay; right/left bundle branch block, incomplete right/left bundle branch block, interventricular conduction delay, left anterior/posterior fascicular block, bifascicular block, and so-called trifascicular block (ie, first-degree atrioventricular block with bifascicular block) as infranodal delay; and second-degree atrioventricular block type 2 or third-degree atrioventricular block as nodal/infranodal block. We also defined any conduction disorder as the composite of nodal delay, infranodal delay, and nodal/infranodal block. Conduction disorder diagnoses were not mutually exclusive.

To classify conduction disorders using cardiologist-entered ECG diagnostic statements, we developed sets of regular expressions corresponding to the specific conduction disorders outlined above and informed by recommended standards of ECG interpretation(Supplemental Table 3). Each search term was validated across a random sample of twenty diagnostic statements containing the term (or the total number of statements containing the term for those with fewer than twenty) by a study author (J.S.H.) blinded to the automated result. Each term had a positive predictive value ≥ 95% for representing the target abnormality, using the reviewer's clinical interpretation of the diagnostic statement as the reference standard.

For 486 individuals with an ECG diagnosis of second-degree atrioventricular block not further delineated as type 1 or type 2, 254 had a corresponding ECG tracing available for review by study authors (J.S.H. and V.N.) who further classified the type of atrioventricular block. The remaining 232 individuals without ECG tracings available for manual review, as well as an additional 233 individuals with an ECG diagnosis of second-degree atrioventricular block with 2:1 conduction, were grouped into the any conduction disorder category only.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG interpretation are described as follows: First-degree atrioventricular block is each P wave conducted with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II, where Mobitz I follows gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG will show group beating due to "dropped" QRS complexes. Atrioventricular block with only 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted without complete loss of atrioventricular conduction, and high-degree atrioventricular block is generally considered to be intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and may be paroxysmal or persistent with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism, and complete atrioventricular block may be imputed in atrial fibrillation (AF) when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the ECG is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present when atrial and ventricular rates are similar (isorhythmic dissociation) or when the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate from sinus bradycardia with an accelerated junctional rhythm; in atrial bigeminy premature atrial contractions can lead to an erroneous diagnosis, and in unusual circumstances a vagal etiology may be considered especially when the QRS in narrow.

Data Extraction of Outcome Variables

The following information was tabulated from each article: authors, publication year, journal reference details, number of participants, study sampling method, age range, population characteristics, details of screening evaluation for possible cardiac disease, estimate of study quality, and Holter monitor outcomes. The aggregate data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Reported prevalence or mean ± SD for the following parameters were tabulated: heart rate minimum, average, and maximum; first‐degree atrioventricular block; Wenckebach (Mobitz I) second‐degree atrioventricular block; maximal pause; and atrial and ventricular ectopy, including couplets. First‐degree atrioventricular block was defined as a prolonged PR interval > 0.20 seconds at any age. Data results were divided into the following age groupings: neonates (birth to 4 weeks), older infants (1–12 months), younger children (1–6 years), older children (7–12 years), and adolescents (13–18 years). For studies that did not divide into these age strata and covered < 3 of the above age ranges, the mean age and SD were used to place the data into the closest age range cohort.

Top 10 take-home messages — left bundle branch block and atrioventricular block evaluation state that the presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease and of diagnosing left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test for structural heart disease, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block not caused by reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms, whereas for all other types of atrioventricular block, in the absence of conditions associated with progressive atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, permanent pacing should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block.

Clinical presentation of atrioventricular block — Profound first-degree atrioventricular block may be symptomatic when the PR interval is very prolonged, as it "may occur with PR interval > 300 ms", and second-degree atrioventricular block type I is "often asymptomatic and seen in active, healthy patients with no history of heart disease". Intermittent complete atrioventricular block causing syncope or presyncope is more typical with underlying heart disease or bundle branch block but can occur without baseline disease. In syncope cohorts, "8% of syncope patients with a normal ECG and echocardiogram had paroxysmal idiopathic atrioventricular block", and in those with bundle branch or bifascicular block, "61% had significant, clinically relevant His Purkinje conduction abnormalities identified at EPS".

### Atrioventricular block can be used as a risk predictor of clinical atrial fibrillation [^112QLGpZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, and its incidence is increasing rapidly worldwide, accounting for nearly one‐third of all hospital admissions. 1 Meanwhile, it is also associated with increased risks of stroke, heart failure, cognitive dysfunction, impaired quality of life, and substantial healthcare costs. Furthermore, it eventually contributes to the increased risks of thromboembolic events, 2 cardiac, and overall mortalities. 3, 4, 5, 6 Atrioventricular block (AVB) is a conduction abnormality along the atrioventricular node or the His‐Purkinje system, and different etiology may result in diverse outcomes. According to the extent of its extension and the characteristics of electrocardiography (ECG), AVB can be categorized into three types: first‐degree AVB, second‐degree AVB, and third‐degree AVB. I AVB is often characterized by excessive prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. The PR interval is determined by the conduction time from the sinus node to the ventricles and thus integrates information about a number of sites in the conduction system of the heart. Prolongation of the electrocardiographic PR interval, conventionally known as first‐degree AVB when the PR interval exceeds 200 milliseconds, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. 7, 8, 9, 10 First‐degree AVB may result from conduction delay in the atrium, atrioventricular node, and/or His‐Purkinje system. The atrioventricular node is the most commonly involved site in adults. 11 Abnormalities in PR interval duration are associated with cardiac conduction defects and increased risk of AF, which carries a substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. However, the reported results of studies on the relationship between I AVB and AF are inconsistent. It is a controversial argument whether I AVB is a pathological state and related to AF. Some studies suggest that individuals with first‐degree AVB are at a substantially increased risk of future AF (~2‐fold) compared to individuals without first‐degree AVB. PR prolongation could be a marker of other changes in the cardiovascular system that contributes to a worse prognosis. Prior studies have raised the possibility that slowed intra‐atrial or interatrial conduction may directly increase the risk of AF. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 An association between PR interval and AF risk has been reported in a separate study that uses Framingham data to construct a clinical risk score for AF, 18 while others claim that first‐degree AVB has a benign prognosis. 7, 9, 10, 19, 20 First‐degree AVB typically occurs in the absence of acute cardiovascular disease. 7, 10 The relationship between AVB and AF has always been controversial.

### Pregnancy maternal fetal outcomes among pregnancies complicated with atrioventricular block [^116j9SVq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Atrioventricular block (AVB) is caused by the dysfunction of the cardiac electroconductive pathways and characterized by a prolongation of the PR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). According to the pattern and feature of the disruption of electrical activity, the blocks are classified in three categories: first degree, second degree (Mobitz type 1 or 2), and third-degree. The pathogenesis underlying the block could be an anatomical defect or functional impairment in the heart's conduction system.

The high-grade heart block can cause palpitations, fatigue, dyspnea, and/or syncope, and associated with significant mortality. Importantly, during the laboring process, bradycardia may get worse when uterine contractions displace blood into the central circulation. The serious cardiac and obstetric complications may occur and impact both mother and fetus. In the literature, only some case reports for pregnancy with AVB have been found, and there is no an established consensus guiding peripartum management for pregnant women with AVB. It will be beneficial to study and share our experiences with these pregnant women.

Additional testing for chronic therapy/management of atrioventricular block — In first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, the need for pacemaker implantation is symptom driven, and prolonged monitoring increases diagnostic yield: event monitors, worn for 30 to 90 days, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which can be left in place for > 2 years, tend to have greater diagnostic yield than 24- to 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. In 1 study, atrioventricular block as a cause for syncope was more commonly identified in structural heart disease versus without (34% versus 13%), and monitors can assess QRS morphology changes such as alternating bundle branch block, with the type of monitor depending on symptom frequency.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG characteristics include the following: First-degree atrioventricular block is a misnomer with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms and no true block, more accurately referred to as first-degree atrioventricular delay. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II; Mobitz I occurs after gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG shows group beating from "dropped" QRS complexes, while isolated 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted; high-degree block is generally intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing, and in unusual circumstances (at night with sinus slowing) a vagal etiology may be considered when the QRS is narrow. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and is usually associated with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism; in atrial fibrillation, complete block may be imputed when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is required, as a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may be absent with isorhythmic dissociation or when sinus bradycardia is coupled with an accelerated junctional rhythm, and atrial bigeminy with repetitive premature atrial contractions can mimic atrioventricular block. Additionally, atrioventricular block within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly, is associated with a slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism, and will not respond to atropine but may improve with catecholamines.

Atrioventricular block — site-specific features and first-degree definition delineate escape mechanisms, drug responsiveness, and PR criteria. "In general, atrioventricular block at the atrioventricular nodal level is associated with slower progression, a faster and more reliable atrioventricular junctional escape mechanism, and greater responsiveness to autonomic manipulation such as atropine, isoproterenol, and epinephrine administration". By contrast, block "within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly", has a "slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism", "may not respond to atropine but will sometimes improve with catecholamines". "First-degree atrioventricular block is a misnomer; true block is not present, as each P wave is conducted, but with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms", and is "more accurately referred to as first-degree atrioventricular delay".

Acquired atrioventricular (AV) block in adults — definitions and thresholds are outlined as follows: AV block is classified as first-, second-, or third-degree (complete) block. First-degree AV block is defined as abnormal prolongation of the PR interval (greater than 0.20 seconds). When AV conduction occurs in a 2:1 pattern, block cannot be classified unequivocally as type I or type II. Advanced second-degree AV block refers to the blocking of 2 or more consecutive P waves with some conducted beats; in atrial fibrillation, a prolonged pause (e.g., greater than 5 seconds) should be considered due to advanced second-degree AV block. Third-degree AV block (complete heart block) is defined as absence of AV conduction. Nonrandomized studies strongly suggest that permanent pacing improves survival in patients with third-degree AV block, especially if syncope has occurred.

### Electrocardiogram essentials: bradycardia [^116uzyy5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest.

Objective

This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases.

Discussion

Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, which will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

Conclusion

Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and a knowledge of the treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

### Familial risk of atrioventricular block in first-degree relatives [^1141qS31]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Rare cases of genetically inherited atrioventricular block (AVB) have been reported; however, the heredity of AVB remains unknown. We aimed to assess the heredity of AVB.

Design, Setting and Participants

Using data from the Danish Civil Registration Registry, we established a nationwide cohort of individuals with parental links. Data were merged with information from the Danish Pacemaker and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Registry, containing information on all pacemaker implantations performed in Denmark during the study period, to identify patients who received a first-time pacemaker because of AVB.

Results

A total of 4648204 individuals had parental links and a total of 26880 consecutive patients received a first-time pacemaker due to AVB. Overall, the adjusted rate ratio (RR) of pacemaker implantation due to AVB was 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) if a father, mother or sibling had AVB compared with the risk in the general population. The adjusted RR was 2.2 (1.7–2.9) for offspring of mothers with AVB, 1.9 (1.5–2.4) for offspring of fathers with AVB and 3.5 (2.3–5.4) for siblings to a patient with AVB. The risk increased inversely proportionally with the age of the index case at the time of pacemaker implantation. The corresponding adjusted RRs were 15.8 (4.8–52.3) and 10.0 (3.3–30.4) if a mother or father, respectively, had a pacemaker implantation before 50 years.

Conclusion and Relevance

First-degree relatives to a patient with AVB carry an increased risk of AVB with the risk being strongly inversely associated with the age of the index case at pacemaker implantation. These findings indicate a genetic component in the development of AVB in families with an early-onset disease.

Chronic bifascicular block — definitions and risk statements: Bifascicular block refers to ECG evidence of impaired conduction below the AV node in the right and left bundles, and alternating bundle-branch block (also known as bilateral bundle-branch block) refers to situations in which clear ECG evidence for block in all 3 fascicles is manifested on successive electrocardiograms (ECGs). Examples include right bundle-branch block and left bundle-branch block on successive ECGs or right bundle-branch block with associated left anterior fascicular block on 1 ECG and associated left posterior fascicular block on another ECG. Patients with first-degree AV block in association with bifascicular block and symptomatic, advanced AV block have a high mortality rate and a substantial incidence of sudden death, and although third-degree AV block is most often preceded by bifascicular block, there is evidence that the rate of progression of bifascicular block to third-degree AV block is slow.

Additional testing for chronic therapy/management of atrioventricular block — Treadmill exercise stress testing can be diagnostic for exertional symptoms and may help differentiate whether 2:1 atrioventricular block is Mobitz type I or II or identify infranodal disease; if baseline atrioventricular block is infranodal, the block will not resolve and will likely worsen as the sinus rate increases. The resting ECG may be helpful if it shows a bundle branch block or hemiblock that may raise suspicion for episodic high-grade or complete atrioventricular block, and exercise may also be useful in profound first-degree atrioventricular block with exertional symptoms to assess pseudopacemaker syndrome.

Mobitz a century ago indicated that his type II atrioventricular block was associated with Stock-Adams attacks and a prolonged duration of the QRS complex before the eventual description of bundle branch block.

### Diagnostic yield of genetic testing in young patients with atrioventricular block of unknown cause [^112DPSYm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the remaining 471 eligible patients, 226 (48%) signed an informed consent form and were included. The median age at time of pacemaker implantation was 39 years (interquartile range, 32–45 years), and 54% were men (Table 1). The vast majority of participants had second‐degree Mobitz type II or more advanced AVB (93%); however, the proportion was slightly higher in nonparticipants (99%, P = 0.03). Among the participants, 2 patients had symptomatic first‐degree AVB, and 17 patients had symptomatic second‐degree Mobitz type I AVB.

Table 1
Characteristics of Young Patients With Atrioventricular Block of Unknown Cause at Time of First Pacemaker Implantation

Comorbidity was infrequent, with hypertension (5% of participants) and atrial fibrillation/flutter (4% of participants) being the most prevalent. Nonparticipants were more likely to have ischemic heart disease (3% versus 0.4%, P = 0.05), but otherwise there were no differences in characteristics between participants and nonparticipants.

Among participants, 12 (5%) had a family history of AVB before 50 years of age in a first‐degree relative; 6 (3%) had a family history of SCD before 50 years of age in a first‐degree relative, and 14 (6%) had a family history of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in a first‐degree relative.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: from risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^112htbBs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background The 12-lead ECG plays a key role in the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS). Since the spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern was first described, several other ECG signs have been linked to arrhythmic risk, but results are conflicting. Methods and Results We performed a systematic review to clarify the associations of these specific ECG signs with the risk of syncope, sudden death, or equivalents in patients with BrS. The literature search identified 29 eligible articles comprising overall 5731 patients. The ECG findings associated with an incremental risk of syncope, sudden death, or equivalents (hazard ratio ranging from 1.1–39) were the following: localization of type 1 Brugada pattern (in V2 and peripheral leads), first-degree atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, fragmented QRS, QRS duration > 120 ms, R wave in lead aVR, S wave in L1 (≥ 40 ms, amplitude ≥ 0.1 mV, area ≥ 1 mm 2), early repolarization pattern in inferolateral leads, ST-segment depression, T-wave alternans, dispersion of repolarization, and Tzou criteria. Conclusions At least 12 features of standard ECG are associated with a higher risk of sudden death in BrS. A multiparametric risk assessment approach based on ECG parameters associated with clinical and genetic findings could help improve current risk stratification scores of patients with BrS and warrants further investigation.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — atrioventricular (AV) block in ACHD: Atrioventricular block at any level is associated with a higher mortality in the ACHD patient, yet no randomized studies exist to compare treatment strategies for the asymptomatic patient, and the degree of atrioventricular block from first-degree to complete atrioventricular block is relevant as far as reliability of an escape rhythm or unexplained syncope is concerned, yet patients may develop symptoms, regardless of the level block. Patients with significant prolongation of atrioventricular conduction (without block) can develop atrioventricular dyssynchrony to such a degree that pacemaker syndrome can develop, and certain congenital anomalies are inherently associated with a more fragile atrioventricular conduction system, and more rigorous scrutiny of these patient groups is necessary.

Acquired atrioventricular block in adults — classification and pacing evidence: First-degree AV block is defined as abnormal prolongation of the PR interval (greater than 0.20 seconds). When AV conduction occurs in a 2:1 pattern, block cannot be classified unequivocally as type I or type II. Advanced second-degree AV block refers to the blocking of 2 or more consecutive P waves with some conducted beats, and in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF) a prolonged pause (e.g., greater than 5 seconds) should be considered to be due to advanced second-degree AV block. Third-degree AV block (complete heart block) is defined as absence of AV conduction. Nonrandomized studies strongly suggest that permanent pacing improves survival in patients with third-degree AV block, whereas there is little evidence to suggest that pacemakers improve survival in patients with isolated first-degree AV block.

Conduction disorders with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction — scope, definitions, pathophysiology, and presentation — are described as QRS abnormalities due to fascicular blocks and bundle branch blocks caused by delayed or blocked conduction within ≥ 1 of the branches of the His-Purkinje system; the combination of delayed or blocked conduction of the right bundle branch and 1 of the left bundle's fascicles is denoted bifascicular block, and first-degree atrioventricular block is more accurately a conduction disorder rather than atrioventricular block though discussed elsewhere. The normal conduction axis comprises the sinus node, atrial muscle, atrioventricular node, His bundle, bundle branches, fascicles, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle, and pathophysiology may be developmental, hereditary/genetic, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, infiltrative, traumatic, ischemic, malignant, or degenerative; in general, it may be helpful to characterize the process as static or progressive. Isolated fascicular and bundle branch blocks are rarely associated with symptoms on their own, their presence may be a marker for underlying structural heart disease, and cardiac dyssynchrony from left bundle-branch block (LBBB) may cause symptoms.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia definitions — atrioventricular block: First-degree atrioventricular block is defined as P waves associated with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction and a PR interval > 200 ms. Second-degree atrioventricular block is P waves with a constant rate (< 100 bpm) where atrioventricular conduction is present but not 1:1, with Mobitz type I showing a periodic single nonconducted P wave with inconsistent PR intervals and Mobitz type II showing a periodic single nonconducted P wave with constant PR intervals (excluding 2:1 block). 2:1 atrioventricular block is a constant or near constant P-wave rate < 100 bpm where every other P wave conducts to the ventricles. Advanced, high-grade or high-degree atrioventricular block is ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a constant physiologic rate that do not conduct to the ventricles with evidence for some atrioventricular conduction, and third-degree atrioventricular block (complete heart block) has no evidence of atrioventricular conduction. Additional terms include vagally mediated atrioventricular block mediated by heightened parasympathetic tone and infranodal block where evidence suggests the block occurs distal to the atrioventricular node.

Chronic bifascicular block — definitions, risks, and pacing considerations: Bifascicular block refers to electrocardiogram (ECG) evidence of impaired conduction below the AV node in the right and left bundles, and alternating bundle-branch block refers to clear ECG evidence for block in all 3 fascicles manifested on successive ECGs with example patterns described. Patients with first-degree AV block in association with bifascicular block and symptomatic, advanced AV block have a high mortality rate and a substantial incidence of sudden death, and although third-degree AV block is most often preceded by bifascicular block, the rate of progression to third-degree AV block is slow, and no single clinical or laboratory variable identifies patients at high risk of death due to a future bradydysrhythmia caused by bundle-branch block. Syncope is common, may be recurrent, and is not associated with an increased incidence of sudden death; pacing relieves neurological symptoms but does not reduce the occurrence of sudden death. An electrophysiological study may be helpful to evaluate and direct treatment of inducible ventricular arrhythmias, and when the cause of syncope in the presence of bifascicular block cannot be determined with certainty or treatments may exacerbate AV block, prophylactic permanent pacing is indicated, especially if syncope may have been due to transient third-degree AV block.

### Is there a prognostic relevance of electrophysiological studies in bundle branch block patients? [^1139BHVA]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The present European guidelines suggest a diagnostic electrophysiological (EP) study to determine indication for cardiac pacing in patients with bundle branch block and unexplained syncope. We evaluated the prognostic relevance of an EP study for mortality and the development of permanent complete atrioventricular (AV) block in patients with symptomatic bifascicular block and first-degree AV block.

Hypothesis

The HV interval is a poor prognostic marker to predict the development of permanent AV block in patients with symptomatic bifascicular block (BFB) and AV block I°.

Methods

Thirty consecutive patients (mean age, 74.8 ± 8.6 years; 25 males) with symptomatic BFB and first-degree AV block underwent an EP study before device implantation, according to current guidelines. For 53 ± 31 months, patients underwent yearly follow-up screening for syncope or higher-degree AV block.

Results

Thirty patients presented with prolonged HV interval during the EP study (mean, 82.2 ± 20.1 ms; range, 57–142 ms), classified into 3 groups: group 1, < 70 ms (mean, 62 ± 4 ms; range, 57–67 ms; n = 7), group 2, > 70 to ≤ 100 ms (mean, 80 ± 8 ms; range, 70–97 ms; n = 18), and group 3, > 100 ms (mean, 119 ± 14 ms; range, 107–142 ms; n = 5). According to the guidelines, patients in groups 2 and 3 received a pacemaker. The length of the HV interval was not associated with the later development of third-degree AV block or with increased mortality.

Conclusions

Our present study suggests that an indication for pacemaker implantation based solely on a diagnostic EP study with prolongation of the HV interval is not justified.

Recommendation-specific supportive guidance — symptom correlation, monitoring, and site of block: In patients who have second-degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or 2:1 atrioventricular block but with symptoms that do not temporally correspond to the episode of atrioventricular block, it is unclear whether permanent pacing will improve symptoms or alleviate them, and if the symptoms do not correlate with the episodes of first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, a pacemaker would not be indicated; given the procedural and long-term risks of PPMs, for such patients further monitoring and follow up should be implemented. First- and second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular blocks (or 2:1 atrioventricular block, if the level of block is at the atrioventricular node) are typically benign, treatment with a pacemaker are typically reserved for significant symptoms that affect QOL, and occasionally second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block is infranodal, in which instances a pacemaker may be considered even in the absence of symptoms; ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or a treadmill exercise test may be useful, improvement in atrioventricular conduction suggests the site of block is at the atrioventricular node whereas worsening suggests infranodal block, and if symptoms do not clearly correspond the overall risk-benefit ratio is unfavorable; in patients with long-standing persistent or permanent AF who have a near and appropriate chronotropic response, in the absence of symptoms, pacing for rate support is unlikely to be beneficial, and although PPM implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and implanted leads have long-term management implications.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — table of definitions for atrioventricular block states: First-degree atrioventricular block requires P waves associated with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction and a PR interval > 200 ms.

Advanced, high-grade or high-degree atrioventricular block is defined by ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a constant physiologic rate that do not conduct to the ventricles. Third-degree atrioventricular block (complete heart block) has no evidence of atrioventricular conduction, while vagally mediated atrioventricular block is mediated by heightened parasympathetic tone, and infranodal block denotes conduction block distal to the atrioventricular node.

### Outcomes related to first-degree atrioventricular block and therapeutic implications in patients with heart failure [^116sw8o8]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of first-degree atrioventricular block in the general population is approximately 4%, and it is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Cardiac pacing for any indication in patients with first-degree heart block is associated with worse outcomes compared with patients with normal atrioventricular conduction. Among patients with heart failure, first-degree atrioventricular block is present in anywhere between 15% and 51%. Data from cardiac resynchronization therapy studies have shown that first-degree atrioventricular block is associated with an increased risk of mortality and heart failure hospitalization. Recent studies suggest that optimization of atrioventricular delay in patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy is an important target for therapy; however, the optimal method for atrioventricular resynchronization remains unknown. Understanding the role of first-degree atrioventricular block in the treatment of patients with heart failure will improve medical and device therapy.

Atrioventricular block — pacing considerations outside formal numeric criteria include the following guidance: Type I second-degree AV block is usually due to delay in the AV node irrespective of QRS width, and because progression to advanced AV block in this situation is uncommon, pacing is usually not indicated unless the patient is symptomatic. Type II second-degree AV block with a wide QRS typically indicates diffuse conduction system disease and constitutes an indication for pacing even in the absence of symptoms. If type I second-degree AV block with a narrow or wide QRS is found to be intra- or infra-Hisian at electrophysiological study, pacing should be considered. In a patient with third-degree AV block, permanent pacing should be strongly considered even when the ventricular rate is more than 40 bpm, because the choice of a 40 bpm cutoff in these guidelines was not determined from clinical trial data. AV block provoked by exercise that is not secondary to myocardial ischemia is associated with a poor prognosis due to His-Purkinje disease; thus, pacing is indicated, whereas during sleep apnea these abnormalities are reversible and do not require pacing unless symptoms are present, in which case pacing is indicated as in other conditions. In general, the decision regarding implantation of a pacemaker must be considered with respect to whether AV block will be permanent, and reversible causes of AV block, such as electrolyte abnormalities, should be corrected first.

ECG MODIFICATIONS REFLECTING PATHOLOGY IN ATHLETES

Regular participation in physical training demands substantial and sustained increases in cardiac output and afterload. The physiological cardiac adaptation to chronic increases in preload and afterload on the heart results in a form of reversible cardiac remodelling including left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, increases in cardiac chamber size and enhanced diastolic ventricular filling; so called 'athletes heart'. Not only does the heart remodel structurally with prolonged intensive exercise, but athletes also demonstrate a spectrum of electrical alterations in the 12-lead ECG. These frequently include sinus bradycardia, first-degree AV block, early repolarisation and voltage criteria suggestive of LVH. Despite these observations, data from a number of international preparticipation screening programmes–have identified a small but important number of athletes who demonstrate particularly abnormal ECG patterns, which are as yet unproven, but highly suggestive of an inherited cardiomyopathy.

Atrioventricular block — additional testing for chronic therapy/management includes the following recommendations: In patients with symptoms (eg, lightheadedness, dizziness) of unclear etiology who have first-degree atrioventricular block or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block on ECG, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is reasonable to establish correlation between symptoms and rhythm abnormalities (COR IIa, LOE B-R). In patients with exertional symptoms (eg, chest pain, shortness of breath) who have first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block at rest, an exercise treadmill test is reasonable to determine whether they may benefit from permanent pacing (COR IIa, LOE C-LD). In selected patients with second-degree atrioventricular block, an electrophysiology study (EPS) may be considered to determine the level of the block and to determine whether they may benefit from permanent pacing (COR IIb, LOE B-NR). In selected patients with second-degree atrioventricular block, carotid sinus massage and/or pharmacological challenge with atropine, isoproterenol, or procainamide may be considered to determine the level of the block and to determine whether they may benefit from permanent pacing (COR IIb, LOE C-LD).

Atrioventricular block — exercise stress testing and electrophysiology study describe that treadmill exercise stress testing can be diagnostic in the setting of exertional symptoms, and an exercise treadmill stress test may help differentiate whether 2:1 atrioventricular block is Mobitz type I or II or identify the presence of infranodal disease; if the baseline atrioventricular block is infranodal, the atrioventricular block will not resolve and will likely worsen as the sinus rate increases, and the resting ECG may be helpful if it shows a bundle branch block or hemiblock that may raise suspicion for episodic high-grade or complete atrioventricular block. Exercise may also be useful in patients with profound first-degree atrioventricular block and exertional symptoms to help determine if nonphysiologic timing of atrial and ventricular contraction (pseudopacemaker syndrome) is contributing to symptoms. If the type of second-degree atrioventricular block cannot be determined from electrocardiographic and telemetry recordings, the EPS can be informative to determine the anatomic site of atrioventricular block: atrioventricular node, intra-His, or infra-His; in second-degree atrioventricular block with concomitant bundle branch block, the block is likely not in the atrioventricular node (70% likelihood), and 2:1 atrioventricular block with bundle branch block is frequently assumed to be indicative of infranodal block; however, 15% to 20% of these patients can have block in the atrioventricular node.

### Prolonged PR interval, first-degree heart block and adverse cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114xuB7r]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

First-degree atrioventricular block is frequently encountered in clinical practice and is generally considered a benign process. However, there is emerging evidence that prolonged PR interval may be associated with adverse outcomes. This study aims to determine if prolonged PR interval is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies that evaluated clinical outcomes associated with prolonged and normal PR intervals. Relevant studies were pooled using random effects meta-analysis for risk of mortality, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation and stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Sensitivity analyses were performed considering the population type and the use of adjustments.

Results

Our search yielded 14 studies that were undertaken between 1972 and 2011 with 400,750 participants. Among the studies that adjusted for potential confounders, the pooled results suggest an increased risk of mortality with prolonged PR interval risk ratio (RR) 1.24 95% CI 1.02 to 1.51, five studies. Prolonged PR interval was associated with significant risk of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction (RR 1.39 95% CI 1.18 to 1.65, three studies) and atrial fibrillation (RR 1.45 95% CI 1.23 to 1.71, eight studies) but not cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction or stroke or TIA. Similar observations were recorded when limited to studies of first-degree heart block.

Conclusions

Data from observational studies suggests a possible association between prolonged PR interval and significant increases in atrial fibrillation, heart failure and mortality. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm the relationships reported, consider possible mechanisms and define the optimal monitoring strategy for such patients.

### Familial risk of atrioventricular block in first-degree relatives [^114WiF2o]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present nationwide study showed that the risk of AVB in first-degree relatives to patients with AVB was more than doubled compared with the background population. This risk was inversely related to the age of the index case at pacemaker implantation and was increased to more than 10-fold in offspring of parents with pacemaker implantation before the age of 50 years. This finding suggests that younger patients with AVB requiring pacemaker implantation may have a genetically mediated disease, whereas occurrence of AVB at an older age can be a manifestation of several non-inherited conditions highly associated with old age.

One prior study has investigated familial clustering of cardiac conduction defects including AVB. In the Framingham Study they found a 1.7-fold increase in odds of pacemaker implantation among individuals with one or more first-degree relatives with a pacemaker. The study examined both sinus node dysfunction and AVB, and the study was limited by a moderate population size and the use of ICD codes on pacemaker implantations to define the outcome. These limitations have been overcome in the present study by using nationwide and highly credible data from the Danish Pacemaker and ICD Registry. Furthermore, our study adds to prior findings by demonstrating that familial risk increases exponentially the lower the age of the AVB onset, suggesting a strong genetic background in patients with early-onset disease.

An electrocardiographic PR interval measures atrioventricular node depolarisation and conduction, and an abnormal PR interval is closely related to AVB. In the 1980s, studies suggested a 34%–60% heritability of the PR interval. Currently, around 20 genes are known to be associated with AVB, but several additional genes associated with AVB may exist. A recent genome-wide association study in 92 000 European-descent individuals has identified 44 loci associated with the PR interval of which 34 were novel. Examination of these loci revealed that known and previously not-yet-reported biological processes were involved in atrioventricular conduction. These findings implicated developmental pathways and identified transcription factors, ion-channel genes and cell-junction/cell-signalling proteins in atrioventricular conduction as important causes of AVB. It is possible that these loci may also turn out to be of significance in patients with AVB in the presence of genetic variants with large effects on protein expression or function.

Clinical presentation of atrioventricular block — Symptoms vary with block degree, ventricular rate, and occurrence frequency. Profound first-degree atrioventricular block can cause fatigue or exertional intolerance and may occur with PR interval > 300 ms; second-degree atrioventricular block type I (Wenckebach) is often asymptomatic but, if frequent or during exercise, can cause exertional intolerance or dizziness. In syncope with a negative initial evaluation, intermittent atrioventricular block may be detected on long-term monitoring, including intermittent complete block that is more typical with underlying heart disease or baseline bundle branch block but can also occur without baseline conduction disease. One study found that 8% of syncope patients with a normal ECG and echocardiogram had paroxysmal idiopathic atrioventricular block, and other studies in syncope with bundle branch or bifascicular block found that 61% had significant His Purkinje abnormalities identified at EPS. Atrioventricular block that occurs in a 2:1 pattern can also cause fatigue and dizziness particularly if it persists during exertion.

### Prognostic implication of first-degree atrioventricular block in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^117YAXoz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background The association between first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) and life-threatening cardiac events in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains unclear. This study sought to investigate whether presence of first-degree AVB was associated with HCM-related death in patients with HCM. Methods and Results We included 414 patients with HCM (mean age, 51 ± 16 years; 64.5% men). The P-R interval was measured at the time of the initial evaluation and patients were classified into those with and without first-degree AVB, which was defined as a P-R interval ≥ 200 ms. HCM-related death was defined as a combined end point of sudden death or potentially lethal arrhythmic events, heart failure-related death, and stroke-related death. First-degree AVB was noted in 96 patients (23.2%) at time of enrollment. Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 8.8 (4.9–12.9) years, a total of 56 patients (13.5%) experienced HCM-related deaths, including 47 (11.4%) with a combined end point of sudden death or potentially lethal arrhythmic events. In a multivariable analysis that included first-degree AVB and risk factors for life-threatening events, first-degree AVB was independently associated with an HCM-related death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.27–4.58; P = 0.007), and this trend also persisted for the combined end point of sudden death or potentially lethal arrhythmic events (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.28–5.27; P = 0.008). Conclusions In this cohort of patients with HCM, first-degree AVB may be associated with HCM-related death, including the combined end point of sudden death or potentially lethal arrhythmic events.

Atrioventricular block — Class IIb recommendations state that permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered for neuromuscular diseases such as myotonic muscular dystrophy, Erb dystrophy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy), and peroneal muscular atrophy with any degree of AV block (including first-degree AV block), with or without symptoms, because there may be unpredictable progression of AV conduction disease. Permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered for AV block in the setting of drug use and/or drug toxicity when the block is expected to recur even after the drug is withdrawn.

Imaging in patients with documented or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders — In patients with newly identified left bundle branch block (LBBB), second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block with or without apparent structural heart disease or coronary artery disease, transthoracic echocardiography is recommended. In selected patients presenting with bradycardia or conduction disorders other than LBBB, second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block, transthoracic echocardiography is reasonable if structural heart disease is suspected. In selected patients with bradycardia or bundle branch block, disease-specific advanced imaging (eg, transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or nuclear imaging) is reasonable if structural heart disease is suspected but not confirmed by other diagnostic modalities. In the evaluation of patients with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia or first-degree atrioventricular block and no clinical evidence of structural heart disease, routine cardiac imaging is not indicated.

General principles of chronic therapy/management of atrioventricular block — permanent pacing not indicated for nodal first‑degree, Mobitz I, or 2:1 block without symptom correlation or when asymptomatic: In patients with first‑degree atrioventricular (AV) block or second‑degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or 2:1 AV block believed at the AV node with symptoms that do not temporally correspond to the AV block, permanent pacing should not be performed (Class III: Harm, Level C‑LD), and in asymptomatic patients with these nodal blocks, permanent pacing should not be performed (Class III: Harm, Level C‑LD); given procedural and long‑term risks of a permanent pacemaker (PPM), when first‑degree or Mobitz I AV block does not clearly correspond to symptoms, further monitoring and follow up should be implemented.

Atrioventricular block — ambulatory monitoring and symptom correlation highlight that in patients with first-degree atrioventricular block or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, the need for pacemaker implantation is symptom driven, and event monitors, worn for 30 to 90 days, and ICDs, which can be left in place for > 2 years, tend to have greater diagnostic yield than 24- to 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. In 1 study, atrioventricular block was more commonly identified as a cause for syncope in those patients with structural heart disease compared with patients without structural heart disease (34% versus 13%). The type of monitor chosen will depend on the frequency of symptoms, and monitors can be used to look for changes in QRS morphology such as alternating bundle branch block; although Mobitz type I atrioventricular block is usually associated with a narrow QRS and Mobitz type II atrioventricular block most often has a wide QRS, in some cases Mobitz type I atrioventricular block and an associated narrow QRS can be attributable to infranodal block.

### First-degree atrioventricular block is associated with heart failure and death in persons with stable coronary artery disease: data from the heart and soul study [^115pmub3]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

First-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) has traditionally been considered a benign electrocardiographic finding in healthy individuals. However, the clinical significance of first-degree AVB has not been evaluated in patients with stable coronary heart disease. We investigated whether first-degree AVB is associated with heart failure (HF) and mortality in a prospective cohort study of outpatients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods and Results

We measured the P-R interval in 938 patients with stable CAD and classified them into those with (P-R interval ≥ 220 ms) and without (P-R interval < 220 ms) first-degree AVB. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality. During 5 years of follow-up, there were 123 hospitalizations for HF and 285 deaths. Compared with patients who had normal atrioventricular conduction, those with first-degree AVB were at increased risk for HF hospitalization (age-adjusted HR 2.33: 95% CI 1.49–3.65; P = 0.0002), mortality [age-adjusted HR 1.58; 95% CI (1.13–2.20); P = 0.008], cardiovascular (CV) mortality [age-adjusted HR 2.33; 95% CI (1.28–4.22); P = 0.005], and the combined endpoint of HF hospitalization or CV mortality (age-adjusted HR 2.43: 95% CI 1.64–3.61; P ≤ 0.0001). These associations persisted after multivariable adjustment for heart rate, medication use, ischaemic burden, and QRS duration. Adjustment for left ventricular systolic and diastolic function partially attenuated the effect, but first-degree AVB remained associated with the combined endpoint of HF or CV death (HR 1.61, CI 1.02–2.54; P = 0.04).

Conclusion

In a large cohort of patients with stable coronary artery disease, first-degree AVB is associated with HF and death.
