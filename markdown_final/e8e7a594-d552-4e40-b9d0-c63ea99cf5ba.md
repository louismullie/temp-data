## Question

Etiology of condyloma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the etiology of condyloma acuminata. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary causative agent and its taxonomy. Then, I should verify the specific HPV types responsible and how often they are implicated. Next, I will examine transmission routes, including sexual and non-sexual pathways. After that, I need to assess host immune factors that modulate risk and persistence. I will then consider the pathogenesis at the tissue level, including histopathology and local immunosuppression. Finally, I should review special contexts such as immunocompromise, pregnancy, and pediatric disease, and close with the differential diagnosis and a concise synthesis of the etiologic model.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental etiologic agent. Condyloma acuminatum is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), a double-stranded DNA virus with more than 200 genotypes, of which roughly 40 infect anogenital mucosa. Alpha-HPVs predominate in mucosal disease, whereas beta-HPVs target cutaneous epithelia, which aligns with the anogenital distribution of condyloma [^113ogCSY] [^115BPUv6].

> I should confirm the specific HPV types most commonly implicated. Wait, let me verify the proportion attributed to low-risk types 6 and 11. Multiple high-quality sources indicate that approximately 90% of condyloma are due to HPV 6 and 11, with occasional detection of other low-risk types and, importantly, co-detection of high-risk types such as 16 and 18 in a minority of lesions; this mixed detection complicates causal attribution but does not negate the primacy of 6/11 in pathogenesis [^113nE15E] [^1134VdfQ] [^114FFvKn].

> Next, I should review transmission. Sexual skin-to-skin contact is the dominant route, including penile–vaginal, anal, and oral–genital exposures. Risk correlates with number of partners and recent sexual behavior, and HPV 6/11 incident infection carries a markedly elevated hazard for incident condyloma in men, underscoring the causal link and sexual transmission dynamics [^1175qcgR] [^116ksY2S]. Hold on, I should verify non-sexual pathways too: perinatal transmission can occur, though the risk of infant condyloma after maternal disease is low, and autoinoculation to extragenital sites such as the axilla or oral mucosa is reported, albeit infrequently [^114UxyQf] [^1142VxfA].

> I need to ensure I address host immune determinants. Immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV, have higher prevalence, larger and more numerous warts, higher recurrence after therapy, and a greater likelihood of high-risk HPV co-infection within lesions; low CD4 counts correlate with recurrence risk after surgery, and condylomas themselves exhibit local immunosuppressive features that may facilitate persistence and recurrence [^1169UeC4] [^115fVt3A] [^1176UwuR]. But wait, what if I overgeneralize? Even in immunocompetent hosts, most HPV infections are transient and clear spontaneously, yet a subset persists, which is where malignant transformation risk emerges with high-risk types, especially in the anogenital tract [^112Cnokv].

> Let me consider pathogenesis at the tissue level. HPV infects basal keratinocytes via microtrauma, with low-risk types driving papillomatous acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and the pathognomonic koilocytes reflecting viral cytopathic effect. Condyloma is classified as a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in standardized lower anogenital terminology, consistent with its virology and benign biology in most cases [^111ReB4X] [^111uAo6g]. Hold on, I should verify the local milieu: lesions show increased IL-10, decreased antigen presentation capacity, and T-regulatory cell infiltration, supporting a locally immunosuppressed niche that impedes viral clearance and contributes to recurrence after treatment [^1176UwuR].

> I will now examine special contexts. In people with HIV, anal condylomas harbor high-risk HPV more frequently, and exophytic morphology associates with higher-grade dysplasia. Importantly, a history of anal condyloma confers an elevated standardized incidence ratio for anal squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in men, reinforcing the need for vigilant screening and management in this population [^114GLMo8] [^115nBcsC]. In pregnancy, hormonal changes can accelerate growth of existing warts and precipitate airway compromise in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, reflecting HPV 6/11 biology and mucosal tropism [^114qLSnx]. In children, while sexual abuse must be considered, perinatal and horizontal non-sexual transmission occur, and longitudinal follow-up is prudent given uncertainties about long-term oncogenic risk in persistent infections [^11793WCF] [^114UxyQf].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis to avoid anchoring bias. Condyloma lata of secondary syphilis, verrucous herpes, molluscum contagiosum, and neoplastic mimics such as verrucous carcinoma or high-grade squamous lesions can resemble condyloma; biopsy is indicated for atypical, pigmented, indurated, fixed, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions, or when there is treatment failure or diagnostic uncertainty, and routine HPV testing of warts is not recommended for diagnosis or management [^1114efCB] [^113MYwMn]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated giant condyloma with verrucous carcinoma; contemporary pathology guidance emphasizes that giant condyloma and verrucous carcinoma are distinct entities with different pathogenetic pathways, so I should avoid overcalling malignancy in large warty lesions without supportive histology [^111bRn6K].

> Let me synthesize the etiologic model succinctly. Condyloma acuminatum is a sexually transmitted, HPV-driven epithelial proliferation caused predominantly by low-risk HPV types 6 and 11, with transmission via intimate skin-to-skin contact and risk amplified by sexual behavior and immunosuppression. Infection of basal keratinocytes leads to papillomatous hyperplasia with koilocytosis, and local immunosuppression within lesions fosters persistence and recurrence, while co-detection of high-risk HPV in a minority of cases signals potential for dysplasia, particularly in the anus and in immunocompromised hosts [^113nE15E] [^1175qcgR] [^1176UwuR] [^114GLMo8].

---

Condyloma acuminatum is caused by **low-risk HPV types 6 and 11** [^111ReB4X], which drive benign epithelial proliferation with characteristic koilocytes [^111uAo6g]. Transmission is primarily via **sexual contact** [^112Cnokv], with risk increased by multiple partners, immunosuppression [^1161EFWo], and microtrauma [^116ksY2S]. Rare non-sexual routes include autoinoculation [^1142VxfA] and perinatal transmission [^114UxyQf]. High-risk HPV (16/18) may coexist but are not the primary cause of condyloma [^1134VdfQ]; their presence increases dysplasia risk, especially in immunocompromised patients [^114GLMo8] [^1132g9Bh]. Diagnosis is clinical [^1114efCB]; biopsy is reserved for atypical or refractory lesions [^113XPQw8], and HPV testing is not routinely used for wart management [^113MYwMn].

---

## Human papillomavirus (HPV) as the primary etiologic agent

- **HPV types**: Condyloma acuminatum is most commonly caused by low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 [^111ReB4X], accounting for approximately 90% of cases [^113nE15E].

- **HPV types**: High-risk HPV types, such as 16 and 18, are occasionally detected in condyloma lesions but are not the primary causative agents [^1134VdfQ].

- **Pathogenesis**: HPV infects basal epithelial cells, inducing hyperplasia and forming warty lesions with koilocytes — vacuolated cells with pyknotic nuclei that are pathognomonic for HPV infection [^notfound].

---

## Transmission routes

- **Sexual transmission**: The predominant route is sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex [^112Cnokv].

- **Non-sexual transmission**: Rarely, autoinoculation from existing lesions or perinatal transmission from mother to child during childbirth can occur [^114UxyQf].

---

## Risk factors associated with condyloma acuminatum

Several factors **increase susceptibility** to HPV infection and condyloma development:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Sexual behavior | Multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse, and early sexual debut significantly increase risk [^1175qcgR] [^1161EFWo] [^117UcK3j] |
| Immunosuppression | Immunocompromised individuals, including HIV-positive patients and transplant recipients, have higher incidence and recurrence rates [^1169UeC4] [^115fVt3A] [^1124Arj7] |
| Microtrauma | Minor abrasions or microtrauma to the genital skin or mucosa facilitate HPV entry [^116ksY2S] |
| Smoking | Tobacco use is associated with increased risk and persistence of HPV infection [^notfound] |

---

## Role of high-risk HPV types

Although condyloma acuminatum is primarily caused by low-risk HPV types, **high-risk HPV types** (e.g. 16, 18) can occasionally be detected within lesions [^1134VdfQ]. Their presence increases the risk of dysplasia and malignant transformation, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^114GLMo8] [^1111bZPo].

---

## Clinical implications of HPV infection

- **Benign lesions**: Condyloma acuminatum presents as flesh-colored, cauliflower-like growths on the genital, perianal, or oral mucosa [^116ggnf4].

- **Malignant potential**: Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types can lead to malignant transformation, including cervical, anal, penile, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers [^116ggnf4].

- **Recurrence**: High recurrence rates are common due to persistent HPV infection and local immunosuppression within lesions [^1176UwuR].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on visual inspection of characteristic lesions [^1114efCB]. Biopsy is indicated for atypical lesions, those unresponsive to therapy, or when malignancy is suspected [^113XPQw8]. HPV testing is not routinely recommended for the diagnosis or management of visible warts [^1114efCB].

---

Condyloma acuminatum is a sexually transmitted infection caused primarily by **low-risk HPV types 6 and 11** [^113nE15E], with transmission occurring mainly through sexual contact. High-risk HPV types may coexist, increasing the risk of dysplasia, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^114GLMo8].

### Condyloma acuminatum of the buccal mucosa [^116bhujb]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Condyloma acuminatum is a human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced disease. It is usually transmitted sexually, and it frequently occurs in the anogenital area. A finding of condyloma acuminatum in the oral cavity is rare. Besides HPV, other risk factors for oral condyloma include chewing betel quid and smoking. We report the case of a 52-year-old man who presented with a 2 × 2-cm verrucous white patch on his buccal mucosa. He was habituated to both betel quid and cigarette smoking. A biopsy of the lesion identified it as a verrucous hyperplasia of the squamous epithelium with HPV-related koilocytic changes. The lesion was excised, and further histopathology identified it as condyloma acuminatum. The patient was disease-free 9 months postoperatively. The possibility of condyloma acuminatum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an oral white lesion. The most common treatments are surgical excision, cryosurgery, electrocautery, and laser excision. There is no known role for antiviral therapy.

### Human papillomaviruses and genital disease [^114dHfuX]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is causally related to several benign and malignant diseases of the anogenital tract. In this article the authors detail the epidemiology, methods of transmission and risk factors, pathogenesis, and oncogenesis of HPV, and describe clinical manifestations and current treatments. Special attention is given to condyloma acuminatum and non-cervical anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia. The authors conclude with the latest information on prophylactic vaccine development and prospects for future control of HPV-related disease.

### HPV-associated diseases [^115BPUv6]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Nearly 200 distinct human papilloma viruses (HPVs) have now been recognized, and each is associated with a specific set of clinical lesions. They are associated with a spectrum of diseases, from benign verrucae vulgares and condylomata acuminata to the malignancies of the cervix, vulva, anus, and penis. Disease associated with HPV can be divided into skin and mucosal lesion of the genital and extragenital regions. The relationship between HPV and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is important clinically, because NMSC is the most common form of malignancy among fair-skinned populations. HPVs have also been detected in skin tags, lichen sclerosus, seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses, epidermal cysts, psoriatic plaques, and plucked hairs, but cutaneous HPV can be found on healthy skin.

Perinatal transmission and infant detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) — Detection of HPV DNA in normal infant tissue has been documented, suggesting that perinatal transmission can occur, with newborn detection rates varying 0%–70% and mother–infant concordance when infant is positive ranging < 1%–100%; more recent studies find low rates of HPV DNA detected in infants (< 5%). A systematic quantitative review concluded pooled mother-to-child HPV transmission was around 6.5%. In a recent study, 19.7% of infants born to HPV-infected mothers and 16.9% of infants born to mothers who were HPV-negative at delivery were found to be HPV-positive in their orogenital area at some time during a 14-month follow-up period. Although maternal condyloma at delivery is a risk factor for infant genital condyloma, the risk remains quite low, with estimates of 7 per 1,000 births; in a parent-child study in Finland, cumulative detection rates for high-risk HPV from the child's genital and oral samples were 36% and 42%, respectively. Recent studies have concluded that pregnancy itself, even in HIV-infected women, is not associated with increased vulnerability to HPV.

Condyloma acuminatum (genital warts) in HIV — provider-applied therapy when lesions are complex, multicentric, inaccessible to patient-applied treatments, or by patient/provider preference: "Cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen spray or cryoprobe): Apply until each lesion is thoroughly frozen; repeat every 1 to 2 weeks for up to 4 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Some specialists allow the lesion to thaw, and then freeze a second time in each session (BIII)". "TCA or BCA cauterization: 80% to 90% aqueous solution, apply to warts only and allow the area to dry until a white frost develops… Repeat treatment weekly for up to 6 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII)".

### Immunosuppression may be present within condyloma acuminata [^1176UwuR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Condyloma acuminatum are common lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is associated with many human cancers, and a vaccine now prevents infection with high-risk HPV. However, eradication of established disease is difficult, indicating that these lesions are capable of local immunosuppression.

Objective

This study examines the immunohistochemical staining characteristics of condyloma acuminatum lesions for markers of cellular immunity, including T-lymphocyte subsets, dendritic cells, and infected keratinocytes and markers of antigen presentation in condyloma tissue.

Methods

Five snap-frozen, optimal cutting temperature-embedded condyloma lesions were immunostained for T-lymphocyte markers Fox P3, CD8, CD25 and molecules involved in antigen presentation.

Results

Condylomas demonstrated hallmarks of immunosuppression, such as increased cellular interleukin-10 production, decreased expression of transporter associated with antigen presentation, CD40, and carbonic anhydrase IX, decreased dendritic cell counts, and increased T-regulatory cell infiltration.

Limitations

This study was performed with lesions from a single center, and control tissue from the same patients was not available because of lack of patient consent.

Conclusion

These results demonstrate that condylomas induce a local immunosuppressive environment, with deficits in antigen presentation and enhancement of immunosuppressive T-regulatory cell populations. Strategies to block this immunosuppression are required to elicit effective immune responses to HPV infection.

### Skin as an indicator for sexually transmitted infections [^114mRySv]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Cutaneous signs and skin conditions associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are discussed. Syphilis, condyloma acuminata, and scabies are well-known STIs with cutaneous manifestations. Chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause specific muco-cutaneous signs and symptoms. HIV often manifests itself through skin conditions. Dermatologists are pivotal in the timely diagnosis of HIV infection and play an important role in the disease prognosis and ongoing transmission. Anal intra-epithelial neoplasia (AIN), an HPV related precursor of anal carcinoma affecting HIV positive men, is a relatively new condition that many dermatologists will face in the future. STIs should be involved in the differential diagnosis when dermatologists are confronted with anogenital dermatoses, especially in patients with an increased risk for STIs.

### Pigmented condyloma acuminatum [^116WXUgu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

We herein report a case of pigmented condyloma acuminatum in the genital region. A histopathological examination revealed keratinocyte proliferation, papillomatosis and basal pigmentation. Cellular atypia was rarely observed. The patient also had ordinary skin-colored nodules on the coronal sulcus. Polymerase chain reaction amplification with consensus primers for human papillomavirus (HPV) and subsequent sequencing confirmed an infection of HPV type 6. Pigmented condyloma acuminatum is not rare; however, making the differential diagnosis between bowenoid papulosis and seborrheic keratosis is sometimes difficult. The mechanism of pigmentation in such cases remains unknown and requires further investigation. HPV typing is a useful method for diagnosing the disease.

### Human papillomavirus-related genital disease in the immunocompromised host: part I [^115Ag9Xa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for common condyloma acuminata and a number of premalignant and malignant anogenital lesions. These conditions are of particular concern in immunocompromised individuals who have higher risk of malignant transformation and are more difficult to treat. This is part I of a two-part review that will highlight the cutaneous features of condyloma acuminata and vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal intraepithelial neoplasias, with an emphasis on presentation of these HPV-mediated diseases in the immunocompromised host. Counseling patients about these conditions requires a thorough understanding of the epidemiology, natural history of HPV, transmission and infectivity, risk of malignancy, and the role of the host immune response in clearing HPV lesions. Part II will provide an updated review of available treatments, with a focus on recent advances and the challenges faced in successfully treating HPV lesions in immunocompromised patients.

### Extragenital condyloma acuminatum in the left axillary vault [^1142VxfA]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Condyloma acuminatum is a benign epithelial proliferation attributed to the epidermotropic human papillomavirus (HPV) and generally associated with sexual transmission. More than 100 types of HPV have been discovered, but strains 6 and 11 are found to cause approximately 90% of condyloma acuminatum. Lesions occur most frequently on the mucous membranes of the anogenital region, but also may occur in the conjunctiva and oral mucosa. Extragenital condyloma acuminatum not associated with sexual activity is rare, having previously only been described in the groin and inframammary fold. We report a patient with condyloma acuminatum occurring on the skin of the axilla.

### The burden of HPV infections and HPV-related diseases among people with HIV: a systematic literature review [^116YYgbH]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Genotype distribution data for PWH with HPV‐related disease were limited, indicating a significant gap in the evidence. It has been noted that high‐risk, vaccine‐preventable genotypes (HPV16, 18, and 45) and infection with multiple genotypes (HPV56/59/66) were the most prevalent among African and Mexican WWH with cervical disease. Interestingly, among Asian MSM with anal condylomas, hrHPV genotypes were found at significantly higher frequencies in MSM with HIV than counterparts without HIV, despite the fact that anal condylomas are typically caused by low‐risk HPV types.

PWH with HPV‐related anal diseases were concurrently infected with a wider diversity of genotypes compared to PWoH. This is may be due to a multitude of reasons, such as immunosuppression resulting from low CD4 cell counts, increased high‐risk sexual behavior, or an immune response to anal lesions that may in turn mediate infection with rare HPV types. Further research into the associated genotypes with HPV‐related diseases can provide key evidence to support vaccination programs aimed at alleviating the disease burden.

### Genital warts [^114oVPNC]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Genital warts are an epidermal manifestation attributed to the epidermotropic human papillomavirus (HPV). Over 100 types of double-stranded HPV have been isolated and completely sequenced thus far. HPV are grouped into low-risk (non-oncogenic) types such as type 6 and type 11, which cause benign anogenital warts (condyloma accuminata), and high-risk (oncogenic) types, such as types 16, 18, 31, and 45, which occasionally lead to cancer.

### Screening methods for high-grade dysplasia in patients with anal condyloma [^1132g9Bh]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. HPV infection can cause anal condylomas and is a risk factor for dysplasia. High-grade dysplasia may progress to squamous cell carcinoma. Currently, biopsy and histological examination are required to grade dysplasia. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anal cytology, morphological characteristics, and/or the presence of high-risk oncogenic HPV-types are effective noninvasive methods to detect high-risk anal condylomas.

Patients and Methods

From November 2003 to June 2004, all patients with anal condyloma were prospectively evaluated for anal cytology, high-risk oncogenic HPV-types, and tissue biopsies. The Bethesda classification system was used to classify cytologic findings and histological examination, which were grouped as high-risk (HRL) and low-risk (LRL) lesions. Histology results served as true disease for all comparisons.

Results

Forty-seven patients with anal condyloma were studied; 43 (91.5%) were men, and the mean age was 39 ± 11 years. Histology showed 19 (40.5%) patients with HRL, and 28 (59.5%) patients with LRL. Cytology correctly identified 8 patients with HRL and 27 patients with LRL (sensitivity 42% and specificity 96%). High-risk oncogenic HPV-types were found in 84.2% of HRL and 39.3% of LRL (P = 0.0029). Combining cytology with oncogenic HPV-testing, the sensitivity of detecting HRL increased to 89%, and specificity decreased to 42%.

Conclusion

Anal cytology alone is not accurate for detecting HRL in patients with anal condylomas. Combining oncogenic HPV-testing with cytology is more sensitive in detecting HRL in patients with anal condyloma, and therefore, a more effective screening tool.

### Four year efficacy of prophylactic human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine against low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital warts: randomised controlled trial [^116i7Unz]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found that vaccination with quadrivalent HPV vaccine had a high prophylactic efficacy against low grade cervical and vulvovaginal neoplasias and condyloma attributed to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 through 42 months of follow-up. This report confirms the results of previous studies with shorter follow-up times and increases the statistical power of the efficacy estimates (via longer follow-up) and provides evidence of longer duration of protection. There were no signs of waning protection.

Putting these data in context

The reported efficacy against low grade HPV related lesions is important for several reasons. Firstly, these lesions occur shortly after infection, and a reduction in these lesions will be the earliest clinically noticeable health gain to be realised by HPV vaccination. The incubation time for condyloma is on average about three months, and a decline in these readily apparent lesions is an early monitoring end point for confirming that HPV vaccination programmes have had an important effect at the population level. Monitoring for outbreaks with re-emergence of condylomas has been proposed as an integral part of HPV surveillance programmes after vaccination.

Secondly, condyloma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I occur at substantially higher rates than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II/III, and the absolute number of these cases prevented by vaccination is expected to be large when vaccine coverage is high. Thus, short term benefits of HPV vaccination in sexually active populations lie in the reduction of condylomas and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I.

### Four year efficacy of prophylactic human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine against low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital warts: randomised controlled trial [^111938YV]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

The contribution of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 to low grade neoplasias has not been well elucidated. The HPV types have been found in 25–50% of low grade cervical and vulvovaginal neoplasias, but assigning causality is difficult because most of these lesions contain multiple HPV types. Whether elimination of some of the HPV types in a multiple infection will prevent disease can be proved only through vaccination. This report represents a combined analysis of quadrivalent HPV vaccine protocols 013 (FUTURE I trial) and 015 (FUTURE II trial), focusing on the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing low grade cervical and vulvovaginal lesions (grade I neoplasias and condyloma) after an average of 42 months of follow-up. We also sought to describe the proportion of the low grade disease burden that can be prevented by vaccination against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.

### Human papillomavirus-related condyloma on keratinized skin [^111uAo6g]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Histologic diagnosis

Papillary acanthosis with hyperkeratosis (Fig 3, A), parakeratosis, hypergranulosis, and a few koilocytes (Fig 3, B, arrows) were observed. Human papillomavirus (HPV)–6 was detected by polymerase chain reaction.

Key message

Condyloma acuminatum, a common sexually transmitted disease caused by low-risk HPVs (HPV-6 or 11), usually occurs on the anogenital mucosa but may also occur on keratinized skin, especially in immunocompromised hosts. On keratinized skin, HPV-6/11 form flat brownish plaques, which sometimes mimic SK; however, they are distinguishable by dermoscopy. Comedo-like openings and milia-like cysts found in 71% and 66% of SK, respectively, are absent in condyloma. While vascular structures are rarely observed in SK, dilated blood vessels are observed in most cases of condyloma. The characteristic dermoscopic findings of condyloma are still observed even on keratinized skin, although the clinical picture differs from condyloma acuminatum on the mucosa. Dermatologists should be familiar with these clinical and dermoscopic pictures of condyloma on keratinized skin because of the need for appropriate treatment, such as topical imiquimod and cryotherapy, and patient education to prevent HPV infection.

Papillary acanthosis with hyperkeratosis (A), parakeratosis, hypergranulosis, and a small number of koilocytes were observed (B, arrows). Scale bars are 1 mm in (A) and 100 μm in (B).

### Verruciform and condyloma-like squamous proliferations in the anogenital region [^111bRn6K]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Histologic distinction between condyloma acuminatum and various benign and malignant condyloma-like lesions in the anogenital area poses a common diagnostic challenge to pathologists across subspecialties.

Objective —

To review the overlapping and distinguishing features of condyloma acuminatum and its mimics, and to clarify confusing terminology and diagnostic criteria for problematic entities.

Data Sources —

A review of the literature on condyloma acuminatum (ordinary and giant types), verrucous carcinoma, warty/warty-basaloid high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and squamous cell carcinoma, papillary squamous cell carcinoma, bowenoid papulosis, verruca vulgaris, epidermolytic acanthoma, and verruciform xanthoma was performed.

Conclusions —

Correct diagnosis of condyloma acuminatum and condyloma-like lesions has important clinical implication and entails familiarization with their clinical presentations and histopathologic features. Contrary to historical belief, giant condyloma acuminatum and verrucous carcinoma should be considered distinct entities based on different pathogenetic pathways. Ancillary tools available for identifying and genotyping human papillomavirus can aid in diagnosis when histopathologic findings are inconclusive. Recognition of relatively rare entities such as bowenoid papulosis, epidermolytic acanthoma, and verruciform xanthoma would avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary, overaggressive treatment.

### Genital human papillomavirus infection progression to external genital lesions: the HIM study [^1162mK5e]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes two types of external genital lesions (EGLs) in men: genital warts (condyloma) and penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe genital HPV progression to a histopathologically confirmed HPV-related EGL.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective analysis nested within the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) study was conducted among 3033 men. At each visit, visually distinct EGLs were biopsied; the biopsy specimens were subjected to pathologic evaluation and categorized by pathologic diagnoses. Genital swabs and biopsies were used to identify HPV types using the Linear Array genotyping method for swabs and INNO-LiPA for biopsy specimens.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

EGL incidence was determined among 1788 HPV-positive men, and cumulative incidence rates at 6, 12, and 24 mo were estimated. The proportion of HPV infections that progressed to EGL was also calculated, along with median time to EGL development.

Results and Limitations

Among 1788 HPV-positive men, 92 developed an incident EGL during follow-up (9 PeIN and 86 condyloma). During the first 12 mo of follow-up, 16% of men with a genital HPV 6 infection developed an HPV 6-positive condyloma, and 22% of genital HPV 11 infections progressed to an HPV 11-positive condyloma. During the first 12 mo of follow-up, 0.5% of men with a genital HPV 16 infection developed an HPV 16-positive PeIN. Although we expected PeIN to be a rare event, the sample size for PeIN (n = 10) limited the types of analyses that could be performed.

Conclusions

Most EGLs develop following infection with HPV 6, 11, or 16, all of which could be prevented with the 4-valent HPV vaccine.

Patient Summary

In this study, we looked at genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections that can cause lesions in men. The HPV that we detected within the lesions could be prevented by a vaccine.

Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Vulvar preinvasive lesions — management and terminology are specified as follows: In the 2011 ACOG-ASCCP Committee Opinion, VIN 1 lesions are considered condyloma and should be managed accordingly; for high-grade VIN lesions, the preferred treatment recommendation is local excision with 0.5- to 1.0-cm margins, modified to avoid injury to the clitoris, urethra, anus, or other critical structures, and when invasion is suspected, wide local excision is recommended; laser ablation is considered acceptable if cancer is not suspected, and topical imiquimod 5% is also an acceptable nonsurgical treatment of HPV-associated VIN; ISSVD proposals classify VIN into a "usual type" caused by HPV (VIN 2 and 3) versus a "differentiated type" not caused by HPV without grading, designate lesions formerly interpreted as VIN 1 as a nonneoplastic disorder or condyloma acuminatum, and resurrect VIN 1 and VIN 2/3 with subclassifications including warty, basaloid, mixed warty-basaloid, pagetoid, and differentiated (simplex).

Human papillomavirus is responsible for common condyloma acuminata and a number of premalignant and malignant anogenital lesions. The immunocompromised population is at particular risk because of a higher incidence of malignant transformation. Lesions in this population may prove refractory to standard treatment. This is part II of a two-part review that will discuss the treatment of condyloma acuminata and vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal intraepithelial neoplasias. This article will provide an updated review of available treatments, with a focus on recent advances and the challenges faced in successfully treating human papillomavirus lesions in the immunocompromised host.

### HPV and HPV-associated diseases [^117UcK3j]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anogenital warts:

- Definition: Anogenital warts, also known as condylomata acuminata, are an STI caused by certain strains of the HPV, primarily HPV genotypes 6 and 11.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of anogenital warts involves the transmission of HPV through sexual contact, leading to the infection of squamous epithelial cells in the anogenital region. The virus causes these cells to proliferate excessively, resulting in the formation of warts.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of anogenital warts is estimated at 160–289 per 100,000 person-years worldwide.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for anogenital warts include engaging in sexual activity, especially with multiple partners, and having unprotected intercourse. Additional risk factors include immunosuppression and concurrent infection with other STDs. Transmission of HPV, although less frequent, can also occur through non-sexual routes.
- Disease course: Anogenital warts present as fleshy growths on the skin or mucous membranes of the anogenital area, often in the perianal region, and can be painless or tender. They can vary in size and shape, ranging from flat to raised, small to large, and singular to multiple. Anogenital warts are usually asymptomatic, but some can cause itching, discomfort, tenderness, or bleeding.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of anogenital warts is generally good as they are usually benign. However, they can recur after treatment, and certain high-risk HPV strains can lead to malignancies, such as SCC.

Question 2: What is the etiological agent commonly associated with this disease?
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18
D. Herpes simplex virus 1
E. Epstein-Barr virus

Answers:
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32 — Incorrect. The HPVs 13 and 32 are low-risk oncogenic subtypes and related to Heck disease.
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4 — Incorrect. HPVs 2 and 4 are more associated to common warts present in the oral cavity.
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18 — Correct. HPV 6 and 11 are associated with a low oncogenic risk, while HPV 16 and 18 are related to a high oncogenic risk. These four HPV subtypes are commonly detected in oral condyloma accuminatum. The molecular analysis was positive for high-risk oncogenic deoxyribonucleic acid-human papillomavirus in the presented case.
D. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) — Incorrect. HSV-1 is an alphaherpesvirus, which causes an infection that is usually asymptomatic, affecting skin and mucosa. Gingivostomatitis is the most common manifestation of primary HSV (HSV-1) infection, mainly manifesting as multiple painful oral lesions, swollen gums, blisters, and sores. The lesions described are incompatible with those reported in this case, which were painless.
E. Epstein-Barr virus — Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus is a herpesvirus, which is widespread throughout the world. A typical clinical manifestation is infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis, an increase of cervical lymph nodes sensitivity and size, and moderate-to-high fever. The clinical findings are not compatible with those observed in the present case.

### Four year efficacy of prophylactic human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine against low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital warts: randomised controlled trial [^113nE15E]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are responsible for about 500 000 cases of cervical cancer a year globallyand 10 million further cases of high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (grades II or III), immediate precursors to malignancy. It is estimated that 30 million women and men acquire anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata) or low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia each year, which may be an underestimation given the inadequacy of reporting in many countries and evidence of a rising incidence over time. Although many low grade lesions of the lower genital tract resolve spontaneously in immunocompetent subjects, this type of lesion contributes greatly to the clinical and economic burden of HPV disease in women. The psychosocialand economicimplications of condyloma are substantial and reflect, in part, the high transmission rates and inadequacy of available treatment options in achieving prolonged response rates. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I can contain a variety of low or high risk HPV types, whereas anogenital warts are (in up to 90% of cases) caused by either of two low risk HPV types — namely, 6 and 11.

The quadrivalent HPV vaccine (for types 6, 11, 16, and 18) has the potential to prevent about 70% of cervical cancersand 90% of condylomaby targeting HPV types 16 and 18 and types 6 and 11, respectively. Clinical trials have shown that in the per protocol population (that is, subjects naive to a given HPV type(s) at baseline and throughout the three dose vaccination) vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II-III or adenocarcinoma in situ was 99% (95% confidence interval 93% to 100%). Efficacy against vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade II-III was 100% (72% to 100%). High efficacy against condyloma has also been demonstrated (100% (92% to 100%)). These data have led to regulatory approval of the vaccine in roughly 100 countries for the prevention of cervical cancer, cervical cancer precursor lesions, and condyloma in girls and women aged 9–26 years. In some countries, the approved indication also includes vulvar and vaginal cancers.

### Treatment of genital warts: facts and controversies [^115BMvdb]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

There are two opposing approaches in the treatment of genital warts: (1) the traditional approach advocates complete elimination of all lesions, and (2) a second approach regards condyloma as merely a cosmetic nuisance. After a long journey through many arguments and scientific papers, we have concluded that many unknowns, uncertainties, and controversies concerning the value of treatment of genital warts in terms of clearing and curing the disease (ie, eradicating the viruses, preventing cancer, and reducing infectivity). There is no consensus at present of whether treatment of men with evidence of genital human papillomavirus infection influences the natural history of their female sex partner's cervical disease.

### Implications of HPV infectivity in early diagnosis and treatment of advanced / recurrent malignancies [^116ksY2S]. BJC Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes sexually transmitted diseases and skin disorders. Its main route of transmission is sexual intercourse (penovaginal sex, oral sex, and anal sex). Latent HPV infection develops when the virus enters basal cells from a small genital wound. Sexually transmitted HPV infection is associated with development of benign condyloma acuminata, as well as pharyngeal, cervical (including vaginal), anal, and penile cancers. In most people with HPV infection, the virus is eliminated by the immune system. However, in rare cases, HPV infections have been observed to persist for long periods. Clinical and basic medical studies to date have revealed that normal cells gradually become cancerous due to persistent HPV infection.

HPV vaccines prevent persistent infection by certain HPV types. Three HPV vaccines are prescribed in clinical practice: bivalent "Cervarix" (GlaxoSmithKline K.K. London, UK), tetravalent "Gardasil" (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and nonavalent "Sylgard 9" (Merck KGaA). Clinical trials conducted in various countries have revealed that development of pharyngeal, cervical (including vaginal), anal, and penile cancers, as well as the benign disease condyloma acuminata, can be prevented by inoculation with a tetravalent or nonavalent HPV vaccine. Globally, infections by HPV16 and HPV18 account for approximately 70% of all cervical cancers.

### Risk of developing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or anal cancer after anal condylomata treatment in people living with HIV [^117LknhP]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the risk and natural history of developing advanced anal disease after diagnosis of anal condyloma in people living with HIV (PLWH).

Methods

This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of PLWH and anal condyloma from 2001 to 2021. Patients who developed advanced anal disease (AAD; anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and/or anal cancer) were compared to those who did not progress (non-AAD). We assessed the potential association between AAD and condyloma location, recurrence, and treatment modality. AAD-free survival was calculated utilizing Kaplan-Meier methods.

Results

A total of 118 PLWH and anal condyloma were included. Mean overall follow-up time was 9.3years. A total of 31% of patients developed AAD (n = 37). Average time to AAD from condyloma diagnosis was 5.6years. On multivariate analysis, risk for AAD development was associated with perianal location of condyloma (OR 4.39, p = 0.038) and increased time from initial condyloma diagnosis (OR 1.12, p = 0.008). Higher CD4/CD8 ratios were associated with lower risk of AAD (OR 0.15, p = 0.029). Condyloma recurrence and treatment type were not associated with development of AAD. AAD-free survival was longer in those with intra-anal only condyloma versus those with either perianal disease alone or combined intra-anal/perianal disease (mean survival times: 22.8 vs. 8.7 vs. 10.7years, p = 0.017).

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates the need for careful, long-term follow-up of PLWH and condyloma, particularly in the setting of perianal disease and low CD4/CD8 ratio. Risk of anal disease progression is present even in the setting of condyloma regression following treatment.

### An overview of human papillomavirus infection for the dermatologist: disease, diagnosis, management, and prevention [^116RkmHd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common, usually transient, dermatologic infection transmitted by genital contact that can cause a variety of anogenital diseases, including warts (condyloma), dysplasia (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal), and squamous cell carcinoma. A number of treatment modalities are available to treat anogenital warts, both patient- and provider-applied. Treatment is efficacious, but lesions can recur. Bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are approved to prevent HPV infection. Both are indicated to prevent cervical cancer, while the quadrivalent vaccine is also approved to prevent vaginal/vulvar cancers as well as genital warts in males and females. Providers should clearly explain the natural history and potential sequelae of HPV disease, counsel patients on prevention strategies, and recommend vaccination as an effective method of prevention to their patients.

### Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine effectiveness: a Swedish national cohort study [^1147nTg2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs have been launched around the world with the aim of preventing cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers. Vaccinated cohorts in Sweden are still too young to assess effectiveness against precancerous lesions or invasive HPV-related cancers. Condyloma acuminata, also referred to as genital warts (GWs), has a shorter incubation time after incident HPV infection and as such is ideal to measure in early evaluations of HPV vaccine effectiveness.

The HPV types 6 and 11 cause about 90% of GW. Although GW is often a transient disease, the treatment, psychosocial, and symptom burdens vary considerably between individuals. In the Nordic countries, 10% of women in the population will have had GW by age 45 years, with similar numbers indicated among men. Two vaccines offer protection against high oncogenic–risk types HPV16 and HPV18, but only the quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccine also offers protection against HPV6 and HPV11. The qHPV vaccine was approved and became commercially available in 2006. In Sweden, opportunistic vaccination began in October 2006 and has been partially subsidized for girls aged 13 to 17 years since May 2007. As of mid-2011, approximately 130 000 Swedish girls and women were vaccinated with at least one dose, 99% of whom were vaccinated with the qHPV vaccine.

### Nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccination as alternative treatment for genital warts [^11322cVF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Genital warts caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) are the most common sexually transmitted disease and have a negative impact on quality of life. Of the more than 200 different types of HPV, low-risk types 6 and 11 are mainly responsible for the development of condyloma acuminata. Despite a large arsenal of local therapies such as numerous topical agents, CO 2 laser ablation, and surgical removal, genital warts tend to be recalcitrant. HPV vaccination is mainly used as a preventive strategy to prevent genital warts, cervical cancer, and other anogenital cancers. However, in a few cases, HPV vaccination has been shown to be a good treatment alternative for patients with recalcitrant skin warts. Here we report five cases of recalcitrant genital warts that responded well to treatment with the nonavalent HPV vaccine. HPV vaccines could be beneficial as a noninvasive treatment alternative for recalcitrant genital warts.

### Risk factors for incident condyloma in a multinational cohort of men: the HIM study [^1175qcgR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Identifying factors associated with condyloma are necessary for prevention efforts. Risk factors for incident condyloma were examined in a cohort of 2487 men from the United States, Brazil, and Mexico and were followed up every 6 months (median, 17.9 months). Factors strongly associated with condyloma were incident infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 (hazard ratio [HR], 12.42 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.78–40.77]), age (HR, 0.43 [95% CI, .26-.77]; 45–70 vs 18–30 years), high lifetime number of female partners (HR, 5.69 [95% CI, 1.80–17.97]; ≥ 21 vs 0 partners), and number of male partners (HR, 4.53 [95% CI, 1.68–12.20]; ≥ 3 vs 0 partners). The results suggest that HPV types 6 and 11 and recent sexual behavior are strongly associated with incident condyloma.

### Topical tirbanibulin resolves recalcitrant condyloma acuminata: retrospective case series [^114ADKvQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Condyloma acuminata (CA) are anogenital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Currently, available treatments for CA include cryotherapy, imiquimod, sinecatechins, and podophyllotoxin. These topicals are limited by marked local skin reactions (LSRs), high recurrence rates, or limited accessibility. Clinical response of anogenital warts and HPV-16 (+) vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions with topical tirbanibulin has been published recently. Tirbanibulin 1% ointment is a synthetic antiproliferative agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2020 for the treatment of actinic keratoses as a once-daily topical treatment for 5 days. Tirbanibulin exhibits a dual mechanism of action, inhibiting microtubule polymerization by binding tubulin and disrupting Src kinase signaling in actively dividing cells. Here, we report real-world experience with topical tirbanibulin on CA in 5 patients.

### Four year efficacy of prophylactic human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine against low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital warts: randomised controlled trial [^116NcoDw]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Thirdly, the fact that infection with multiple HPV types is common in low grade disease, particularly in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia but also in condyloma, has made it difficult to unequivocally assign which of the HPV types present in a lesion are the causal infections. Our data therefore provide important confirmatory evidence of the proportion of low grade disease positive for HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 (37% (366/984) of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, 87% (305/351) of condyloma (tables 3and 5, intention to treat placebo groups)). As expected, the proportion of disease prevented in generally naive subjects was similar but slightly lower than the proportion of cases found to contain the DNA of these viruses (30% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, 83% of condyloma). Co-infection with a non-vaccine HPV type can result in uncertainty in assigning causality, as shown by the substantial proportion of the cases of disease in the vaccine group that were also positive for a non-vaccine HPV type (3/7 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I and 1/2 cases of condyloma in the per protocol population). In several cases the additional HPV type had been detected at the baseline visit and persisted through the study.

Low grade cervical and vulvovaginal lesions are important from a public health perspective, as the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of these common lesions are associated with substantial patient anxiety, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The lifetime risk of a clinically diagnosed condyloma has in Scandinavia been estimated to be > 10%. Management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I and condyloma therefore contributes to a large proportion of the overall financial burden of HPV related disease.

### Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in pregnancy: a case of emergent airway management [^114qLSnx]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a benign neoplastic process involving squamous epithelium of the respiratory tract, typically the vocal folds. In cases of aggressive growth, or uncontrolled disease, airway compromise and respiratory distress can occur. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to be the etiologic agent in this disease process, as well as in condyloma acuminata, or genital warts. Studies have shown that HPV-induced condyloma acuminata can worsen during pregnancy. We present a case of airway obstruction requiring emergent tracheostomy in a pregnant patient with known laryngeal recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. The management of this condition and some theories regarding its response to certain hormonal states are discussed.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111T7j1U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A physical examination should include an inspection of the vulvovaginal area to identify any visible signs such as lesions, excoriations, skin or tissue changes, or abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, or consistency. Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch. If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary. Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vulvovaginal pruritus, it is essential to consider a broad differential diagnosis, encompassing infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic causes. Given the overlapping presentations of these conditions, a systematic approach is necessary to narrow down the most likely etiology. Of note, if hormonal causes are suspected, referral to a gynecologist is warranted for further workup. If a psychogenic cause is suspected or a psychiatric condition is suspected to be an aggravating factor, psychiatric evaluation is warranted. A detailed discussion on these topics is beyond the scope of this review.

Formation of a differential is led by the timing, absence or presence of lesions, location, absence or presence of abnormal discharge, age, and other risk factors. Medical history, contacts, and other elements of history may increase clinical suspicion for causes of vaginal itch originating from certain domains.

### Verrucous herpes treated as condyloma acuminata: a case of cognitive bias [^116uyvWF]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

This patient's rash was incorrectly labeled as CA, and this diagnosis carried forward through his subsequent visits. His clinical history of immunocompromised state and atypical presentation were not considered, while they should have warranted a thorough workup. Although alternative diagnoses were documented during the initial consult, no further evaluation was done, and they were not reconsidered until 2 years later. Verrucous lesions having similar clinical features may have different etiologies, highlighting the importance of a broad differential and a high level of clinical suspicion.

Availability bias, which relies on the mental shortcut of immediate examples that come to mind, can lead physicians to consider prevalent diseases more frequently and forgo the less common. Anchoring is the tendency to stick with the initial impression, even when new information becomes available. These biases are a trap into which even the most experienced physicians can fall victim and studies have found that anchoring and availability are some of the most common biases associated with diagnostic inaccuracies. We believe both contributed to our patient's delay in diagnosis. Anchoring is often accompanied by confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret new data as confirmation of the preliminary diagnosis. Serious problems can arise when initial impressions are incorrect, as these biases together can cause physicians to confirm their initial impressions, become "anchored" in their diagnosis, and unconsciously ignore contradictory evidence and lead to further management errors. Busy clinics with multiple providers, who have inadequate time to review previous notes are not uncommon, and in most electronic medical records, finding inpatient and ER notes requires extra steps and a more thorough search. Though it takes extra time, a careful review of a patient's records and a comprehensive differential can improve patient outcomes. After years of ineffective treatment, our patient was eventually diagnosed with a verrucous herpetic dermatitis and started on appropriate therapy.

This case is a reminder that different dermatologic conditions may present similarly, and our initial impressions and past experiences can influence our diagnosis. Biases have the potential to seriously impact the quality, consistency, and accuracy of diagnoses and therapeutic management. This case highlights the importance of being aware of these biases, and importantly, sharing difficult cases, even when they include errors, so that we all can learn.

### The lower anogenital squamous terminology standardization project for HPV-associated lesions: background and consensus recommendations from the college of American pathologists and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology [^115UeMR9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

HPV-associated lower anogenital tract lesion biology and rationale for unified terminology — two interaction patterns and precedent from cytopathology. Human papillomavirus (HPV) interacts with squamous epithelium in 2 basic ways: first, the epithelium supports virion production and lesions are transient, historically termed low-grade lesions, grade 1 intraepithelial neoplasia, mild dysplasia, and condyloma; second, lesions are broadly classified as precancerous with viral oncogene–driven clonal proliferation characterized clinically by persistent viral detection, persistent and growing colposcopic abnormalities, and a substantial risk of malignant transformation. Despite these 2 patterns, terminology remains disparate and complex. Cytopathology faced a similar problem before the Bethesda conferences of 1988, 1991, and 2001; The Bethesda System created standard reporting terms and criteria, has been widely implemented in the United States and internationally, and has led to improved and more reliable communication between pathologists and clinicians.

### Immunostaining for high-risk human papillomavirus in condyloma lesions in immunocompromised patients [^1111bZPo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the underlying infectious cause of condyloma acuminata (CA) and high-risk types of HPV can cause cancer. Condyloma may undergo malignant degeneration, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. The presence of high-risk HPV in CA is a risk factor for developing malignancy; however, determining which patients with condyloma are clinically at risk can be difficult. High-risk HPV can now be localized within CA using routine immunohistochemical stains.

Methods

We examined HPV (cocktail, 16, 18) immunohistochemical staining of CA and the relevant clinical history from immunocompromised patients and compared them with age- and sex- matched immunocompetent patients with biopsied CA.

Results

HPV was detected in 9 of the 12 specimens from immunocompromised patients (75%), and 6 of the 12 specimens from the age- and sex-matched comparison patients (50%). HPV-16 was detected in 7 of the 12 specimens from immunocompromised patients (58%), and 4 of the 12 specimens from comparison patients (33%). HPV-18 was not detected in any of the 21 specimens from immunocompromised or comparison patients for which the stain was available.

Conclusion

High-risk HPV is found within CA lesions, more often in immunocompromised patients, and confirming the presence of these HPV types with stains in high-risk patient populations may help guide the clinician in treatment and surveillance in certain cases.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1162a246]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) clinical manifestations — genital HPV types cause hyperplastic, papillomatous, and verrucous squamous epithelial lesions on skin and mucous membranes at sites including anal, genital, oral, nasal, conjunctiva, gastrointestinal, bladder, and respiratory tract mucosa. Lesions in the genital area are often referred to as condyloma acuminata. Warts can be single or multiple and often appear as papules, flat, smooth or pedunculated lesions, with common skin sites including the hand, elbows, knees, and feet. JORRP can present with hoarseness and difficulty breathing.

### Giant condyloma acuminatum [^113i1YzG]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Giant condyloma acuminatum is a warty lesion that is characterized by its large size and propensity to infiltrate into deeper tissues contrasting with its microscopically benign pattern. It is proposed that giant condyloma represents an intermediate lesion between condyloma acuminatum and verrucous carcinoma.

Objective

A primary therapeutic option of giant condyloma is radical surgery with or without adjunctive chemotherapy. Because of the tumor's large extent in this case, curative therapy would have been achieved by wide surgical excision.

Method

We present a morphologically and histologically classic example of giant condyloma with respect to origin from common genital warts. The reason for extensive exophytic growth was due to delay in therapy because of the patient's self neglect but not due to immune deficiency. The patient was treated with wide surgical excision.

Results

The postoperative period was uneventful, allowing satisfactory functional and cosmetic results.

Conclusion

This case is an interesting case because of its exceptionally huge size without any deep tissue involvement and tissue atypia. This suggests that giant condyloma is an intermediate condition that exhibits a continuous tendency for growth.

Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is an immunodeficiency disorder with low absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte count with no evidence of human immunodeficiency virus or other known cause.

Case

A 22-year-old woman presented with a high-grade Pap test result. Work-up demonstrated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 3 with extensive condyloma. She presented 6 months after her initial treatment with recurrent disease and was referred to the immunology department, where she was found to have profound lymphopenia. After further evaluation, idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia was diagnosed.

Conclusion

Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare acquired immunodeficiency. Although genital dysplasia is common in young women, this case demonstrates the importance of determining other etiologies of recurrent human papillomavirus infections and possible immunodeficiencies that may affect management and outcomes.

### Condyloma of the neovaginal vault successfully treated with topical cidofovir therapy [^111LjigV]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is no consensus for treating condyloma arising in the neovaginal vault in transgender women following gender-affirming vaginoplasty. Prior reports have documented successful treatment of neovaginal condyloma with carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, topical imiquimod, and topical trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Additionally, topical cidofovir has been cited in the literature as efficacious for the treatment of external genital warts in cisgender patients. Here, we discuss a case of condyloma of the neovaginal vault arising de novo in a transgender woman who was successfully treated with 1% topical cidofovir with sustained clearance.

### Linear white lesion in the oral mucosa [^111YwkiT]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the etiology of this condition?
A. Tobacco smoking
B. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection
C. Dental amalgam
D. Chronic irritation caused by friction
E. Genetic transmission

Answers:
A. Tobacco smoking – Incorrect. Oral white lesions that are associated with tobacco smoking include, in addition to leukoplakia and squamous cell carcinoma, nicotinic stomatitis that appears as a diffusely gray-white slightly elevated plaque on the palate with small raised punctate red centers corresponding to irritated minor salivary glands. Linear alba has not been related to tobacco smoking.
B. HPV infection – Incorrect. The classical oral lesions associated with HPV are squamous cell papilloma, condyloma acuminatum, verruca vulgaris, and focal epithelial hyperplasia. Focal epithelial hyperplasia, caused by HPV 13 and 32, is characterized by multiple circumscribed, sessile, elevated white-to-pinkish papules that occur diffusely in the oral cavity in young patients.
C. Dental amalgama – Incorrect. Amalgam can cause an oral lichenoid reaction clinically and histologically indistinguishable from oral lichen planus. The clinical clue is a whitish, localized asymmetrical lesion near a dental amalgam filling.
D. Chronic irritation caused by friction – Correct. Linea alba is caused by chronic irritation of the teeth against the buccal mucosa along the plane of occlusion and is considered as a frictional keratosis. Additional causes include orthodontic appliances, frictions of the dentures, uneven teeth, and aggressive oral hygiene.
E. Genetic transmission – Incorrect. Linea alba is an acquired condition without any proven genetic background. Among white oral lesions, white sponge nevus is an autosomal-dominant condition that does not exhibit a linear pattern.

The clinical manifestation of infection with HPV is determined by multi-ple factors which include the type of HPV, the type of skin infected, the status of host immunity and smoking. The incubation period for HPV is 3 weeks to 8 months. While there is no specific anti-HPV therapy, local topical therapy, excision, cautery and laser vaporization have all been used with a range of success rates.

### Giant condyloma acuminatum of the vulva: successful management with imiquimod [^115wJrLm]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Giant condyloma acuminata (GCA) is a large condyloma of the anogenital region with a cauliflowerlike appearance. The tumor is extremely rare and is related to human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (HPV type 6 and 11 in 90% of cases). The definitive treatment is wide surgical excision, but topical medical treatment can be effective in selected cases. Here we report the first case, to our knowledge, of complete regression of vulvar GCA after treatment with topical imiquimod (5% cream) therapy, with no recurrence reported over a 3-year follow-up period. Signed informed consent was obtained from the patient.

### Preoperative immune status determines anal condyloma recurrence after surgical excision [^115fVt3A]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Immunosuppression is an important risk factor for anal condyloma progression; however, its effects on postoperative outcomes remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated risk factors and recurrence rates in immunocompromised patients requiring surgery for medically intractable anal condyloma.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed on 63 consecutive patients who underwent surgical intervention for medically intractable anal condyloma at a single institution. Patient cohorts included immunosuppressed patients (e.g. HIV-seropositive, leukemia, idiopathic lymphopenic syndrome, or transplant patients; n = 45) and immunocompetent patients (n = 18). Recurrence rates and time to recurrence after surgery were determined for both groups. Preoperative CD4 count and viral load within the HIV subpopulation were also determined. The majority of the patients were male (90 percent), with a median age of 36 years.

Results

Anal condyloma recurred in 66 percent of the immunosuppressed patients compared with 27 percent of the immunocompetent group. Recurrence time expressed in months was shorter in immunosuppressed patients than in immunocompetent patients (6.8 ± 1.5 vs. 15 ± 5.7 months; P < 0.05). In the subpopulation of HIV-seropositive patients, no association was found between recurrence rates and viral loads; however, CD4 counts were significantly lower in those who had recurrence than in those who did not (226 ± 31.7 vs. 401 ± 51.2 cells/microl; P < 0.05).

Conclusions

After surgery, anal condyloma in immunosuppressed patients recurs significantly more often and within a shorter period of time than in patients with a competent immune system. Additionally, in HIV-seropositive patients, CD4 counts should be maximized to prevent early recurrence of anal condyloma.

### Four year efficacy of prophylactic human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine against low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital warts: randomised controlled trial [^1134VdfQ]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

In accordance with previous reports, we found oncogenic HPV types such as HPV 16 and 18 in a proportion of condylomas, but usually in conjunction with the major HPV types associated with condyloma (types 6 and 11). Of the 190 cases of condyloma in the per protocol placebo group, 23 were associated with HPV type 16, and 11 associated with HPV type 18. However, HPV types 6 or 11, or both, were also present in all but four of these. Therefore, it seems likely that the quadrivalent vaccine's efficacy against condyloma is primarily attributable to the HPV types 6 and 11 components of the vaccine.

For cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, HPV type 16 was found in about twice as many cases (97/6257) as HPV type 18 (47/7092) and types 6 or 11 (45/6619). As multiple infection with several vaccine types was not common, it seems reasonable to assume that the vaccine's HPV types 6 and 11 component contributed to about a quarter of the protective effect — that is, about 7%-8% of all cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I. Thus, the proportion of disease preventable by vaccination against HPV types 6 and 11 was slightly lower than the prevalence of types 6 or 11 in low grade cervical and vulvovaginal disease (estimated at about 10% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, 42% for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, and 90% for condyloma). This observation may possibly be related to the occasional cases that may be caused by co-infection with non-vaccine HPV types.

For vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, our data support the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease recommendation to rename this as a "flat wart", as all cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade I were found to harbour HPV types 6 or 11 and thus had similar aetiology as other condylomas. For vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, about equal numbers of cases were infected with HPV types 6 or 11 as with HPV 16, but small numbers preclude more exact estimation of the proportion of the protective effect against vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia that was attributable to the HPV 6 and 11 component of the vaccine. Regardless of whether vulvar or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I are classified as precancerous or as benign warts, patients presenting with low grade vulvar or vaginal lesions still require clinical follow-up and, in some cases, medical or surgical intervention.

### Condyloma of the neovaginal vault successfully treated with topical cidofovir therapy [^1134ndwz]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Transgender individuals experience disparities in care that can be detrimental to their overall physical and psychosocial health. Higher rates of STIs, violence, and mental health conditions have been reported in this population. Dermatologists can play an important role in the screening, prevention, and treatment of STIs in transgender individuals. In transgender women, diagnosis of condyloma can be challenging and requires an understanding of gender-affirming vaginoplasty and the sexual behaviors of these individuals. Additionally, there is a paucity of information on how to treat condyloma in transgender individuals which requires consideration of the delicate nature of the skin used to create the neovagina.

Prior studies have documented the new onset of condyloma in the transplanted neovaginal skin of transgender women. Both Yang et al and Liguori et al commented on the rarity of literature on condyloma in transgender women and a lack of consensus on treatment. Matsuki et al reported successful clearance of condyloma in the neovagina of a transgender woman with CO2 laser followed by topical imiquimod for residual warts; this was the first report to document the successful clearance of condyloma with imiquimod. Fein et al subsequently reported successful treatment of biopsy-proven neovaginal condyloma in a transgender woman with TCA. Individuals in both reports had sustained clearance.

Condyloma and HPV vaccination

The incidence of condyloma and the potential for health gains by HPV vaccination has hitherto not been well described. Although condyloma reporting systems are used in a few countries, these systems have not been sufficiently well controlled to allow reliable estimates of incidence. In this study we measured vaccine efficacy against disease related to specific HPV type and against disease regardless of HPV type, enabling an estimate of the total gains in reduced disease burden after vaccination of generally HPV naive women. In addition, our report provides an estimate of the incidence of these lesions in a carefully monitored cohort of women. We found a high incidence of condyloma in the placebo group (169 cases), which translates into a yearly incidence of 1.0%. The vaccine efficacy against condyloma in generally HPV naive women of 83% thus corresponds to a potential reduction in absolute yearly incidence of condyloma of 0.83%.

Box 1

KEY FACTS — Mucosal Papillomavirus Infections in Humans
Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most common manifestations of HPV in the genital area 43. They present as papules, nodules or soft, filiform, pinkish, sessile or pedunculated growths. In men, genital condylomas more commonly involve the coronal sulcus, the glands penis, and the penile shaft. In women, lesions commonly affect the external genitalia and the cervix 44. The disease is usually sexually transmitted and is most frequently caused by low‐risk HPVs, such as HPV 6 and 11, although many other genotypes can also be found, including HPV 2, 16, 18, 30–33, 35, 39, 41–45, 51–56, and 59 45, 46, 47. As described in the text, the HPV types that cause benign genital warts can also cause problematic papillomas at oral sites, which can be difficult to treat because of their location.
Focal epithelial hyperplasia is a rare HPV‐related disease of the oral mucosa that is more common in children and women. Lesions are mainly located in the lower lip, but less frequently may affect the upper lip, tongue, oral mucosa, oropharynx, palate, and floor of mouth. HPV 13 and 32 are the most common cause 48.
Cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer. Precancerous cervical lesions are classified as c ervical CIN of different grades (1, 2, or 3). CIN1 pathology is broadly equivalent to the LSIL designation used in the Bethesda classification system, with CIN2 and 3 being equivalent to high‐grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. The severity of neoplasia reflects the extent to which basal‐like cells (i.e. poorly differentiated cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio) extend toward the epithelial surface and the extent of suprabasal cell division. Low‐grade lesions typically show evidence of productive viral infection with the presence of koilocytes in the suprabasal cell layers being regarded as a key manifestation of CIN1/LSIL. HPV is detectable in 90–100% of cervical abnormalities, ranging from incipient cytological abnormalities and dysplasia 49 to cervical cancer 50, 51, 52.
Other anogenital cancers including those of the vulva, vagina, penis, and anus. Most vulvar cancers (92%) are solitary, keratinizing SCC. HPV prevalence is 90% in vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and basaloid or warty cancers, but is found in only 6% of keratinizing SCC 53, 54. HPV 16 is the most prominent type in vulvar cancer, with HPV 18, 21, 31, 33, and 34 detected at lower frequencies. In addition, HPV is responsible for 85% of vaginal cancer, with HPV 16 being detected in 60% of invasive tumors. HPV is also detected in basaloid and warty cancers of the penis, but only rarely in keratinizing SCC and verrucous cancers of the penis. In invasive penile cancer, HPV 16 is the most prevalent type (40–70%), followed by HPV 6 (22%), 52 (15%), and 11 (4%) 55. HPV is present in 80–96% of anal cancer with HPV 16 being the most prevalent type 56. Anal cancer is more common in men who have sex with men, individuals with a history of anal warts, and in immunosuppressed populations.
Head and neck cancer HPV is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of HNSCC. A recent meta‐analysis showed that HPV prevalence in HNSCC increased significantly from 41% in 2000 to 72% in 2004 57. HPV prevalence is significantly higher in oropharynx SCC than in the oral cavity with the tonsil having higher prevalence than other anatomic sites 58. These HPV‐associated cancers display clinical and molecular features distinct from other HNSCCs. The patients with HPV‐positive cancer have at least a 50% improvement in overall survival at 5 years, which is equivalent to an approximate 30% difference in absolute survival. HPV association is now part of routine diagnostic procedure when assessing the prognosis of HNSCC. HPV 16 is the most common type found in HNSCC, but other HPV types such as 18, 31, 33, and 35 can also be detected 57.

### Pigmented acuminated condylomas seborrhoeic keratosis-like: a new entity? [^116Twij6]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Condyloma acuminatum is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which typically presents as excrescent, pedunculated, papillomatous lesions which may be of a pale colour. On rare occasions, we have observed pigmented genital lesions that are similar to seborrhoeic keratoses, but with histological findings of condyloma acuminatum and positive genotyping for HPV. We have termed these 'seborrhoeic keratosis-like' type condylomas.

Methods

This is an observational retrospective study. The following clinical data were collected: age, sex, time of evolution, location, isolated or multiple lesions, monomorphous or polymorphous/mixed lesions. HPV genotyping was performed in all cases, and excision for histological study in eight cases.

Results

A total of 31 patients were diagnosed with this type of pigmented condylomata acuminata. Of these, 16 had isolated lesions (less than five lesions) and 15 had multiple lesions. 67% of the lesions exhibited slow growth, with an evolution period of greater than 1 year. The most frequent location was the base of the penis and pubis. HPV genotyping of the lesions was positive in all cases, with the HPV-6 genotype predominating (28 cases, 90.3%). The lesions exhibited dermoscopic differences from other pigmented lesions and histological findings attributable to HPV infection (pseudoparakeratosis, koilocytosis, etc) and others similar to those observed in seborrhoeic keratoses.

Conclusions

A total of 31 patients were diagnosed with pigmented verrucous lesions, excrescents, isolated or multiple, in the genital region. These lesions exhibited clinical characteristics similar to seborrhoeic keratoses, with positive genotyping for HPV. In the majority of cases, the genotype was HPV-6. These lesions have been named 'pigmented condylomata acuminata seborrhoeic keratosis-like'. Only 10 cases of these lesions have been described in the literature.

Diagnostic Considerations

Diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual inspection but can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated if lesions are atypical (e.g. pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might also be indicated in the following circumstances, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised (including those with HIV infection): the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or the disease worsens during therapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart diagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not guide genital wart management. Some anogenital lesions can resemble anogenital warts (condyloma accuminata), but do not respond to anogenital wart treatment. Condyloma lata, a manifestation of secondary syphilis, can be diagnosed by serologic tests or through direct detection from serous fluid from the lesions (see Syphilis, Diagnostic Considerations).

GCA features tendency toward local recurrence and conversion into squamous cell carcinoma (Chao & Gibbs, 2005; Papapanagiotou et al. 2017). The risk of recurrence in the anorectal and perianal regions after excision is 60–66%, with an overall mortality of 20–30%. The development of malignancy has been reported in 30–56% of cases (Akdag & Yildiran, 2018; Indinnimeo et al. 2013). In this case, squamous mucosa with dysplasia and the viral cytopathic effect were noticed, signs of expectable spontaneous regression. Recurrence after an incomplete excision or reinfection to the surrounding tissue remained can be frequent and follow‐up visits for signs of recurrence would be warranted.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) epidemiology in sexually active youth and adults is characterized by sexual transmission, early acquisition, and high prevalence, including in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected females; genital HPV is most commonly a result of sexual transmission, and young age at first sexual intercourse and higher number of recent sex partners are strong risk factors for HPV in both women and men; in sexually active adolescent girls, prevalence is 12% to 64%, compared with 2% to 7% in women aged > 35 years, and cervical HPV is acquired shortly after onset of sexual activity, with 50% cumulative exposure within 3 years; rates of HPV are higher in HIV-infected adolescents and adult women than in HIV-uninfected women, and CIN and condyloma also are more common in HIV-infected women; although incidence is high, longitudinal studies show that 80% to 90% of infections in HIV-uninfected youth are transient and spontaneously regress; in men, overall prevalence remains above 50% across all age groups; anal HPV risk in women is associated with anal intercourse, and one study also showed anal HPV acquisition associated with cervical HPV infection and occurring even without reported anal intercourse, suggesting other sexual and non-sexual routes.

Visible condyloma growth began when this immunocompromised patient started highly active antiretroviral therapy, and it grew rapidly as his viral load plummeted. The patient underwent resection and reconstruction with skin grafting. Pathology findings revealed benign condyloma acuminatum.

Condyloma acumianata is one of the most common virally transmitted diseases. Its prevalence has increased many fold throughout the world. Because all the currently available treatments yield low cure rates with side effects, the search for a new alternative continues. Topically, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been in used for many years to treat various skin diseases. When applied topically in condyloma acuminata, 5-FU results in low cure rates with high recurrences. Therefore, intralesional 5% 5-FU is being evaluated to determine its therapeutic efficacy in condyloma acuminata.

### Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer [^112Cnokv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

HPV and Cervical Cancer

HPV is not a single virus but a family of closely related viruses, each designated as a type, numbered in order of discovery. Typing is based on nucleic acid sequencing. More than 100 HPV types are known to exist, and at least 30 can be detected in the anogenital tract. No simple in vitro culture methods are available for identifying it, and serologic testing is insensitive. Techniques for identifying the virus are based on nucleic acid detection, either direct hybridization or after amplification. HPV types associated with malignancies are referred to as high-risk types, and those associated with warts (condylomas) are rarely found in cancers and are called low-risk types.

Sexual transmission is the dominant mechanism for acquiring genital HPV. Infection is usually transient and not associated with symptoms. An estimated 80% of sexually active women have been exposed. Studies have detected HPV in > 90% of cancers worldwide, and plausible biologic mechanisms can explain oncogenesis. The magnitude of the risk association between HPV and cervical cancer is greater than that for smoking and lung cancer. However, infection alone is insufficient to cause cancer, and additional factors are required for neoplasia.

### Extragenital condyloma acuminatum in the left axillary vault [^116tVQfA]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of axillary condyloma acuminatum without a history of genital warts. The lesion is defined both by its exophytic, verrucous appearance of condyloma acuminatum and its findings on pathology, including koilocytotic change, hypergranulosis, and papillated epidermal hyperplasia. The differential diagnosis includes fibroepithelial polyp, verruca vulgaris, and squamous papilloma. Fibroepithelial polyps usually lack the complex exophytic features of condyloma acuminatum. Squamous papillomas do not have koilocytic changes or acanthosis. Condyloma acuminatum has been reported intraorally and within intertriginous areas, such as the groin and the inframammary fold, but it is rare to see lesions in other areas of the body without their presence in the anogenital area.

The patient could have acquired condyloma acuminatum through several mechanisms. He may have been immunocompromised, which would have produced a favorable environment for infection by HPV with subsequent epidermal transformation. Testing for HIV was not performed in this patient, given the lack of follow-up, but would be a reasonable next step in evaluating a patient with extragenital condyloma acuminatum. Another possibility is viral transmission from the genital region to the axilla by a contaminated object, such as a razor used for shaving both areas. Although unusual, maschalagnia, or armpit fetishism, may sometimes lead to armpit intercourse, which could provide a means of transmission of the HPV virus. No specific antiviral treatment is currently recommended for condyloma acuminatum, but some successful treatments include intralesional interferon, topical imiquimod, and electrocoagulation.

Giant condyloma acuminatum is a large, slow-growing, exophytic, cauliflower-like tumor of the external genitalia. It is a histologically benign lesion, largely associated with human papillomavirus infection but with a high recurrence rate. The main differential diagnosis includes verrucous carcinoma. Differentiation between these 2 types of tumors is important with respect to treatment and prognosis. We present a case report of a 26-year-old woman with giant condyloma acuminata of the vulva and discuss the histological features and treatment modalities of this condition.

Clinical manifestations — genital, anal, oral and skin warts present as hyperplastic, papillomatous, and verrucous squamous epithelial lesions on skin and mucus membranes, including anal, genital, oral, nasal, conjunctiva, gastrointestinal, bladder, and respiratory tract mucosa; genital lesions are often referred to as condyloma acuminata, warts may be single or multiple and appear as papules, flat, smooth or pedunculated lesions, with common skin sites on the hand, elbows, knees, and feet, and JORRP may present with hoarseness and difficulty breathing. Precancerous and cancerous lesions associated with HPV include high grade CIN, VIN, VaIN, and AIN; cancers linked to high-risk HPV include cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal sites at the base of the tongue and tonsils; most intraepithelial neoplasias are asymptomatic, and cancers are often asymptomatic but can be associated with bleeding, pain or a palpable mass.

### The clinicopathologic challenge of nonneoplastic vulvar acanthosis [^113tDXQp]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

A particular diagnostic problem of vulvar psoriasis is overlap with mycosis. The 2 conditions have similar histopathologic findings of PK, neutrophils in the stratum corneum, acanthosis, and a dermal lymphocytic infiltrate. Presence of hyphae on PAS signals mycosis, but organisms are often lacking in cases with positive microbiology and rapid response to antifungals. Interleukin 17, a family of cytokines produced mostly by T cells, plays a role in pathogenesis of psoriasis and mycosis through keratinocyte hyperproliferation and neutrophil recruitment. Several biologic medications targeting interleukin 17 are effective as psoriasis treatment but increase susceptibility to mucocutaneous candidiasis. Overlapping features may arise from this common pathophysiologic pathway.

Condyloma and SK often present as nodules rather than plaques, but these fall within the differential diagnosis of acanthotic reactions because textural differences are less apparent to pathologists if biopsies are sited within a lesion. Similarities between SK and condyloma include acanthosis, proliferation of basaloid cells, pigmentation, squamous whorls, horn cysts, and papillomatosis. Features favoring condyloma include PK and dermal lymphocytic infiltrate. Genotyping for HPV is positive in up to 70% of genital SK and more than 95% of condyloma, with nononcogenic types comprising nearly all SK and over 65% of condyloma. – Both condyloma and SK display patchy nonblock-positive p16 expression. The negative HPV results of 16 of 17 cases (94%) argue against condyloma or SK as a cause of histologic findings in this series. The single positive case likely represents HPV latency or genital cross-contamination as clinical findings were inconsistent with HPV-related disease. Acanthotic tissue reactions that demonstrate nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, or atypical mitoses require consideration of a neoplastic process and further assessment with p16 and p53. In this setting of benign clinical appearance and bland nuclei, p16, p53, and HPV genotyping did not aid in distinguishing between competing diagnoses.

### Giant condyloma with demise secondary to meningococcemia in an infant boy [^111UNY4o]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease among adults in the USA; however, the presence of HPV in infants is rare. Condyloma acuminata, a cutaneous, fungating lesion caused by HPV, has a generally mild course that often resolves spontaneously or can be managed both medically and surgically. Typical treatments for condyloma include imiquimoid cream, podofilox gel, podophyllin resin, cryotherapy, laser surgery, tangential shave excision, and electrocautery. Rapidly progressing condyloma acuminata followed by a fatal course of Neisseria meningitis in an infant is an extremely rare presentation that merits further investigation into possible immunologic etiology. A 7-month-old circumcised Caucasian boy presented with a rapidly progressing giant penile condyloma acuminatum. This is the youngest documented case of this type. Refractory to medical and surgical treatments, this otherwise apparently healthy child was referred to pediatric immunology. Normal complete blood count led to deferment, suggesting further medical and surgical treatment. Five days after such treatment, the baby presented with progressive systemic rash, fever and tachycardia. The patient died from meningococcemia. This case serves as a warning concerning the course of condyloma in infants. Immunologic investigation may be critically important in young patients refractory to designated treatments for condyloma.

### Four year efficacy of prophylactic human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine against low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and anogenital warts: randomised controlled trial [^115zXkJw]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Study limitations

Limitations of the current analyses include the fact that the generally HPV naive population was tested only for the presence of the four vaccine HPV types and 10 other HPV types prevalent in cervical cancer. However, other HPV types may contribute to condylomas, and there are several uncommon HPV types that we did not test for (such as HPV 68 and 73) that are classified as oncogenic. Failure to identify infections with these types at baseline would have resulted in an underestimation of the protective effect against any disease in the generally naive population. As these types are not common, this conservative bias is not likely to be substantial. Another limitation concerns the fact that rate estimates of disease are dependent on the intensity of assessment. There were some differences in assessment between studies, notably the fact that protocol 015 required cervical smear screening every 12 months, whereas protocol 013 required smear testing every six months. Although the studies eligibility criteria included a limit on the lifetime number of sexual partners, the generalisability of the results is probably high as the population studied was enrolled globally.

Conclusions and policy implications

Quadrivalent HPV vaccination provided strong and sustained protection for up to four years against condyloma and low grade cervical and vulvovaginal neoplasia related to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The high incidence of low grade disease seen in the placebo group and the estimated benefits of vaccination on total disease burden regardless of HPV type suggest that an important portion of the clinical benefit seen in the early years after deployment of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine will be through reductions of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I and condyloma.

### Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection of anal condyloma [^115Td98w]. VideoGIE (2018). Low credibility.

Condyloma acuminatum (CA) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It requires resection or careful follow-up, especially in patients with moderate to severe dysplasia, to prevent progression to malignancy. Treatment is also important to prevent the spread of infection to uninfected sexual partners, which is not possible with a surveillance-only strategy. Surgical management is commonly relied upon. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been described in a few case reports as a safe and effective technique, with low recurrence rates, in trained and expert hands. However, there is a dearth of literature on other endoscopic techniques in the management of CA.

We describe here our experience with endoscopic management of CA, wherein underwater EMR is used to successfully resect anal condyloma, with varying degrees of dysplasia (Video 1, available online at).

The technique uses careful examination of the distal rectum and anal canal, under both forward view and retroflexed views, with white light and also narrow-band imaging (NBI) (Fig. 1). Topical lidocaine gel is applied to the anal region to reduce discomfort and facilitate a thorough examination. A transparent cap is placed on the tip of the endoscope to improve visualization. A high-definition, magnified view with NBI helps determine the precise number of lesions and their margins, and may reduce postresection recurrence rates. The underwater EMR technique uses water immersion of the lesion, which makes the projections more prominent and achieves high-resolution images, thus enabling precise determination of lesion margins. Moreover, water immersion eliminates the need for submucosal injection and facilitates snare capture of lesions.

### Genital warts in children: what do they mean? [^11793WCF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a diverse family of viruses, of which 30–40 genotypes specifically infect the genital tract. Genital HPVs are largely transmitted sexually, with most infections being asymptomatic and transient. In contrast, persistent infection with oncogenic genotypes in a minority is a strong risk factor, for subsequent development of high grade dysplasia, the precursor lesion to cervical neoplasia, which generally occurs after a long latency period. It is unknown whether there is a disease correlate in children chronically infected with oncogenic HPVs. Low risk HPV genotypes 6 and 11 are the primary cause of condylomata acuminata, although in children non-genital genotypes are also found in a proportion, with the mode of transmission being either perinatal, horizontal, or sexual. The finding of asymptomatic HPV DNA in children, and correlation with live virus, infectivity, or disease is unclear. Long term follow up for children with anogenital warts is recommended, although there are no longitudinal studies available to clarify whether they are at risk of developing carcinoma in young adulthood.

### Control of human papillomavirus gene expression by alternative splicing [^113ogCSY]. Virus Research (2017). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Papillomaviruses comprise an ancient and ubiquitous virus family that infects humans and other animals. Human papillomaviruses comprise the largest group of papillomaviruses. There are over 200 different HPV genotypes identified to date based on full genome sequencing (2012). The majority of HPV subtypes are classified under the alpha- and beta-HPV groups while a few other HPV subtypes have been classified under the gamma, mu and nu genera. In general, alpha HPVs infect mucosal epithelia while beta HPVs infect external cutaneous epithelia. HPV infection causes a range of benign conditions such as condyloma acuminata (genital warts), focal epithelial hyperplasia, common warts, plantar warts and pigmented warts. Infection with HPV is usually transient and the majority of infections are cleared by the immune system. However, in the case of some HPVs, if infection becomes persistent this may lead to tumour progression. Around forty alpha HPVs infect the anogenital epithelium. Of these, up to fifteen genotypes are so-called "high-risk" HPVs (HR-HPVs) because they are associated with a range of cancers including cervical and other anogenital cancers and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV type 16 is the most prevalent HR-HPV responsible for 55% of cervical cancers. After chlamydia, it is the second most prevalent sexually transmitted infectious agent worldwide. In the developed world the incidence of certain anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers has increased significantly over the last decade. Thus, the medical importance of HPV is clear. Vaccines against HPV16 and HPV18, the next most prevalent HR-HPV and the genital wart-causing, non-oncogenic HPVs 6 and 11, have been available for eight years. However, these are prophylactic and cannot protect the very large numbers of people worldwide who are already infected and at risk of serious disease. Understanding viral gene regulation and its relationship to the infected epithelium is a key goal to allow development of novel antiviral strategies in future.

### Association of varying number of doses of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine with incidence of condyloma [^116sQXKD]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determining vaccine dose-level protection is essential to minimize program costs and increase mass vaccination program feasibility. Currently, a 3-dose vaccination schedule is recommended for both the quadrivalent and bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. Although the primary goal of HPV vaccination programs is to prevent cervical cancer, condyloma related to HPV types 6 and 11 is also prevented with the quadrivalent vaccine and represents the earliest measurable preventable disease outcome for the HPV vaccine.

Objective

To examine the association between quadrivalent HPV vaccination and first occurrence of condyloma in relation to vaccine dose in a population-based setting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An open cohort of all females aged 10 to 24 years living in Sweden (n = 1,045,165) was followed up between 2006 and 2010 for HPV vaccination and first occurrence of condyloma using the Swedish nationwide population-based health data registers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) of condyloma were estimated using Poisson regression with vaccine dose as a time-dependent exposure, adjusting for attained age and parental education, and stratified on age at first vaccination. To account for prevalent infections, models included a buffer period of delayed case counting.

Results

A total of 20,383 incident cases of condyloma were identified during follow-up, including 322 cases after receipt of at least 1 dose of the vaccine. For individuals aged 10 to 16 years at first vaccination, receipt of 3 doses was associated with an IRR of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.15–0.22) for condyloma, whereas receipt of 2 doses was associated with an IRR of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.21–0.40). One dose was associated with an IRR of 0.31 (95% CI, 0.20–0.49), which corresponds to an IRD of 384 cases (95% CI, 305–464) per 100,000 person-years, compared with no vaccination. The corresponding IRDs for 2 doses were 400 cases (95% CI, 346–454) and for 3 doses, 459 cases (95% CI, 437–482). The number of prevented cases between 3 and 2 doses was 59 (95% CI, 2–117) per 100,000 person-years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although maximum reduction in condyloma risk was seen after receipt of 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine, receipt of 2 vaccine doses was also associated with a considerable reduction in condyloma risk. The implications of these findings for the relationship between number of vaccine doses and cervical cancer risk require further investigation.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^112kkpgj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The main types of lesions associated with anogenital HPV infection are anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata) and intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN), vulva, vagina, anal canal/perianal area, and penis. Intraepithelial neoplasia is a precursor of some of these cancers, although it can regress at earlier stages and does not progress to invasive cancer in most affected people. A study that followed up women with inadequately treated CIN3 found that 31.3% (95% CI 22.7 to 42.3) developed invasive cancer after 30 years (McCredie 2008). HPV is also associated with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (HNSCC). Of all head and neck cancers globally in 2012 (534,000), about 7% (37,000) were attributable to HPV, including 29,000 of 96,000 (31%) cases of oropharyngeal cancer (de Martel 2017). The incidence of cancers of the oropharynx has increased over time, more amongst men than women (Gillison 2015). It is likely that HPV is a main contributor to the increase in men, whilst smoking dominates the rise in women (Gillison 2015).

### Condyloma of the neovaginal vault successfully treated with topical cidofovir therapy [^111KMmG2]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published a case series of 3 cisgender male and female patients with condyloma who were successfully treated with topical 1% cidofovir. All patients were noted to have significant improvement after a single week of therapy and remained free of recurrence at 6–12 month follow up. Subsequently, a systematic review by Jung et al demonstrated that efficacy of topical cidofovir as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of external genital warts was comparable to that of conventional therapies such as imiquimod with no differences in recurrence of warts or in severe adverse events. Therefore, these studies suggested topical cidofovir could serve as a treatment option for condyloma arising in the neovaginal vault.

Herein, we described a case of condyloma in a transgender woman with no history of condyloma prior to vaginoplasty. To the best of our knowledge, this individual represents the first case of successful treatment with topical cidofovir of condyloma presenting de novo in the neovagina of a transgender woman. This case again underscores the important role dermatologists play in screening, prevention, and treatment of STIs in transgender individuals. Transgender women who present with new onset condyloma should also be screened for other STIs. Treatment of neovaginal condyloma should consider the anatomy and delicate skin of the neovagina. Our case also highlights the unique nature of the neovaginal microbiome and the importance of successfully managing vaginitis to optimize dilation exercises that are vital in maintaining the neovagina's postoperative patency. In summary, topical 1% cidofovir cream can be considered as a viable, alternative treatment to CO2 laser, imiquimod, and TCA.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) clinical manifestations in HIV include genital, anal, and oral warts; CIN; VIN; VAIN; AIN; anogenital squamous cell cancers; and cervical adenocarcinomas, and a subset of oropharyngeal cancers are also caused by HPV. Oral, genital (condyloma acuminata), and anal warts are usually flat, papular, or pedunculated growths, and lesions may measure a few millimeters to 1 to 2 cm in diameter; most warts are asymptomatic but can be associated with itching or discomfort, and in more severe immunosuppression, enlargement may cause dyspareunia or dyschezia. Intraepithelial neoplasias are often asymptomatic but may manifest with bleeding or itching, and related cancers may be asymptomatic or present with bleeding, pain, odor, or a visible/palpable mass.

Evaluation of STD-Related Conditions

Genital ulcer disease can be caused by syphilis, HSV, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). The more common sexually transmitted causes of male urethritis syndrome can include gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma, trichomoniasis, and HSV. Diseases characterized by vaginal discharge as a result of vaginitis can include bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and candidiasis. The causes of epididymitis, pharyngitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can include gonorrhea and chlamydia. Most genital warts are caused by nononcogenic HPV types. However, on occasion, oncogenic types can be found in genital warts. Proctitis can be caused by gonorrhea, LGV serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, syphilis, and HSV. Ectoparasitic infections typically include pediculosis pubis and scabies. Systemic or dermatologic conditions compatible with or suggestive of an STD can include disseminated gonorrhea, neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, condylomata lata, or palmar plantar syphilitic rash. STD-related conditions warrant prompt evaluation of signs and symptoms to make an accurate diagnosis and provide timely empiric treatment to prevent complications and onward transmission. Patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of an STD etiology (genital ulcer disease, urethritis, vaginal discharge, PID, epididymitis, pharyngitis, genital warts, proctitis, ectoparasitic infections, or certain systemic or dermatologic conditions) should be evaluated.

Recommendations for the STD-related conditions that should be evaluated are summarized (Box 5). Additional information on these recommendations is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Human papillomavirus virus (HPV) genotype-and age-specific analyses of external genital lesions among men in the HPV infection in men (HIM) study [^117FVj7Z]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes external genital lesions (EGLs) in men, including condyloma and penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN). We sought to determine the incidence of pathologically confirmed EGLs, by lesion type, among men in different age groups and to evaluate the HPV types that were associated with EGL development.

Methods

HPV Infection in Men (HIM) study participants who contributed ≥ 2 visits from 2009–2013 were included in the biopsy cohort. Genotyping by an HPV line-probe assay was performed on all pathologically confirmed EGLs. Age-specific analyses were conducted for incident EGLs, with Kaplan-Meier estimation of cumulative incidence.

Results

This biopsy cohort included 2754 men (median follow-up duration, 12.4 months [interquartile range, 6.9–19.2 months]). EGLs (n = 377) were pathologically confirmed in 228 men, 198 of whom had incident EGLs. The cumulative incidence of any EGL was highest among men < 45 years old and, for condyloma, decreased significantly over time with age. The genotype-specific incidence of EGL varied by pathological diagnoses, with high- and low-risk genotypes found in 15.6% and 73.2% of EGLs, respectively. Condyloma primarily contained HPV 6 or 11. While PeIN lesions primarily contained HPV 16, 1 PeIN III lesion was positive for HPV 6 only.

Conclusion

Low- and high-risk HPV genotypes contribute to the EGL burden. Men remain susceptible to HPV-related EGLs throughout the life span, making it necessary to ensure the longevity of immune protection against the most common causative HPV genotypes.

### Comparing bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccines: economic evaluation based on transmission model [^111kYvpY]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Anogenital warts

Recently, the annual number of unique warts episodes leading to patient attendances at either sexual health or general practitioner clinics in England was estimated at about 156 000. Older studies based in specialist dermatology or gynaecology clinics that tested HPV DNA in condylomas of anogenital warts patients have found that HPV 6 or 11 is present in well over 90% of them. However, it is not certain whether HPV 6 or 11 caused the warts since other HPV types were often also detected. A more recent study based in a Swedish sexual health clinic found that HPV 6 and 11 were present only in 60% of warts cases. Trials of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, which arguably provide the largest and best characterised cohorts, found that the vaccine has an efficacy of 99% against condylomas with vaccine HPV types present but only 82.8% against all condylomas regardless of HPV type.

We estimated the median number of wart episodes attributable to HPV 6 and 11 each year to be 117 000 (range 105 000–135 000). This estimate was made using a previously described model of warts associated with HPV 6 and 11that we refitted to include recent data on the age distribution of these wart episodes. Using this refitted model, we selected the 330 best fitting scenarios using the same definition of a good fitting scenario as in our previous model (that is, a sum of squared residual cut-off of 4). The resulting range of values that these scenarios produce for the fraction of warts episodes attributable to HPV 6 and 11 (67–86% of episodes) lies within the range of uncertainty in the published literature (cited above).

Low grade screens

Based on a recent model, we estimated that infection with HPV 6 or 11 increases the risk per cervical screen of an abnormal (mild) smear by 0.054 (95% confidence interval 0.048 to 0.060) compared with not being infected with HPV. Furthermore, data from the National Cervical Cancer Screening Programme allowed us to estimate that each such smear has a 2.3% (2.1% to 2.5%) risk of resulting in a colposcopy. These estimates were incorporated into the model as an incremental benefit of quadrivalent vaccination.

### Exophytic condyloma: are they as benign as we think? [^115nBcsC]. Colorectal Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

As the understanding of anal dysplasia continues to develop, controversy remains regarding treatment of these lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate lesion type (flat vs exophytic) and the association between morphology and dysplasia.

Methods

This was a single-centre retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected pathological database of patients > 17 years old who underwent operative excision/biopsies for presumed anal condyloma or dysplasia from 2009 to 2018. The analysis includes comparisons between patient factors, phenotype and grade of dysplasia.

Results

Sixty-nine patients had 423 lesions. The mean age of the study population was 48.2 years. 62.3% were men and 46.4% of patients were black. 47.8% of patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and 39.1% were men who have sex with men (MSM). There were 176 (41.6%) flat lesions and 234 (55.3%) exophytic lesions. Exophytic lesions were 2.5-fold more likely to be associated with a higher grade of dysplasia than flat lesions (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.09–6.32). Neither lesion type nor dysplasia severity was associated with human papillomavirus, lesion location or patient characteristics, including race, MSM or HIV status.

Discussion

Exophytic lesions were more than twice as likely to have advanced dysplasia compared with flat lesions. A clearer understanding of the association between gross lesion appearance and dysplasia will allow more appropriate counselling of patients and the development of better screening and treatment guidelines for anal condylomata and dysplasia.

### Topical tirbanibulin resolves recalcitrant condyloma acuminata: retrospective case series [^113a55gP]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HPV is associated with a wide variety of clinical conditions, including warts and cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx. In fact, meta-analysis found that cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas were more likely to carry HPV than normal-appearing skin. Transmission primarily occurs through skin-to-skin contact. Over 180 subtypes of HPV have been identified. Anogenital warts have been historically associated with subtypes 6 and 11. A systematic review revealed that the prevalence of anogenital warts ranged from 0.13% to 0.56% based on a retrospective or prospective chart review, whereas it ranged from 0.2% to 5.1% based on genital examinations. Disparities in documentation likely exist because it is not required to report CA, unlike other sexually transmitted diseases.

### High-risk human papilloma virus, precancerous lesions and cancer in anal condylomas [^114GLMo8]. AIDS (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anal condylomas are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and are a risk factor for anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis evaluating the prevalence of anal high-risk HPV, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and SCC in patients with condylomas. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and the incidence rate of anal SCC were also calculated.

Methods

Three electronic databases were searched until April 2020. Meta-analyses were performed using random effects models.

Results

Pooled prevalence estimate of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) in anal condylomas was 40.2% (21.0–63.1) in immunocompromised and 16.4% (10.7–24.3) in nonimmunocompromised patients, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.79 (1.51–9.52, P = 0.005) for immunocompromised patients. HR-HPV in condylomas with HSIL was 73.8% (39.1–92.5) and in non-HSIL cases was 17.7% (9.6–30.2), corresponding to an OR of 12.33 (2.97–51.21, P = 0.001) for those with HSIL. The prevalence of HSIL in condylomas was 24.0% (16.4–33.7) in immunocompromised and 11.8% (7.2–18.8) in nonimmunocompromised patients, with an OR of 2.51 (1.72–3.65, P < 0.001) for immunocompromised patients. The overall prevalence of anal SCC in anal condylomas was 0.3% (0.0–1.7). The SIR of anal SCC was 10.7 (8.5–13.5), 20.1 (14.4–28.2) in men and 7.7 (5.6–10.5) in women. The overall incidence rate of anal SCC was 6.5 per 100000 person-years (3.6–11.7), 12.7 (9.1–17.8) in men and 4.7 (1.7–13) in women.

Conclusion

Patients with a history of anal condylomas have a high risk of anal SCC, especially men. The prevalence of HR-HPV and HSIL in condylomas from immunocompromised patients is high. This information can change patient follow-up and treatment.

### Persistent perianal "warts" [^116QAvrH]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Condyloma acuminata
B. Darier disease (DD)
C. Hypertrophic herpes simplex virus infection
D. Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD)
E. Giant condyloma of Buschke-Löwenstein

Answers:
A. Condyloma acuminata – Incorrect. Condyloma acuminata is caused by the human papillomavirus and appears as papular, verrucous lesions. This is less likely in the absence of a positive contact/sexual history. The presence of erosions in her axillae and positive family history suggests HHD.
B. DD – Incorrect. DD presents as hyperkeratotic papules to plaques that favor a seborrheic distribution. Nail involvement is common. While limited perianal disease may appear similar to condylomata and HHD, the positive family history of erosions in intertriginous areas is more suggestive of HHD.
C. Hypertrophic herpes simplex virus infection – Incorrect. Hypertrophic herpes simplex virus presents as ulcerated nodules in the anogenital region and are episodic. HIV coinfection is a strong predisposing factor and is absent here.
D. HHD – Correct. HHD presents as inconspicuous, fragile vesicles that progress to macerated erosions and crusting, mainly in intertriginous areas. Limited disease in the perianal region frequently presents in the papular form, as in this patient. Her father also had HHD.
E. Giant condyloma of Buschke-Löwenstein – Incorrect. This condition is a low-grade, well-differentiated, verrucous variant of squamous cell carcinoma and may present in the anogenital region as a slow-growing, warty tumor. These squamous cell carcinoma variants tend to appear larger and more protuberant.

We are writing to comment on the article by Uribe et al., "Management on giant anal condyloma by wide local excision and anoplasty". [1] Anogenital warts are among the most common sexually transmitted diseases seen in surgical practice, they are found in up to 1.7% of the general population, but in HIV population, they range from 3 to 24.9%. It is important to realise that 78% of patients with external anogenital warts have internal lesions as well although they are unlikely to be proximal to the dentate line.

### Risk of vulvar HSIL and penile neoplasias in anogenital lichen planus: a case-control study [^114BhGV3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

All except 1 of our 5 patients with LP and neoplasia (2 female and both male patients) had also a biopsy-proven condyloma, usually diagnosed after the diagnosis of neoplasia. The male patient with 3 PeINs (patient 5) first had a histological diagnosis of in situ carcinoma, suggestive of bowenoid papulosis, and later PeIN inside a large condyloma. Condylomas are usually caused by low-risk HPV and do not contribute to cancer risk. However, in penile cancer, low-risk viruses usually causing condylomas are more common, as reviewed by Silva et al. There are no such connections in vulvar, vaginal, or oral cancers. On the other hand, oncogenic HPV genotypes including HPV 16 and 18 have been found in condylomas. It is possible and not even rare to have different types of HPV simultaneously. These results suggest that LP and even a low-risk HPV together may increase the risk of malignant transformation.

It is not known how LP and HPV might be connected. It has been suggested that epithelial ulcers make HPV infection more likely. In support of this, a meta-analysis has shown that the risk of oral HPV infection is increased in patients with oral LP, especially in those with erosive lesions. However, results related to the possible association between HPV and LP in malignant transformation have been conflicting and mainly focused on hrHPV types. Human papillomavirus has also been shown to be common in patients with LS, even though LS is usually not an erosive disease. In a study of 345 male patients with PeIN, clinical or histological evidence of both HPV and lichen sclerosus was present in 29.4% of cases. In a study of 89 male patients with genital LP, bowenoid HPV-dependent intraepithelial neoplasia was absent at diagnosis but developed during follow-up in 2 patients. The treatment of LP with immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids leading to upregulation of HPV replication might explain the connection between LP and HPV. It is possible that in patients 2–4 the development of condylomas was provoked by topical corticosteroid treatment and had no connection with the HSIL or cancer, as they appeared only after the diagnosis of neoplasia in these patients. Patient 5 had a clinical suspicion of condyloma and a biopsy-proven bowenoid papulosis before later treatments with corticosteroid creams. In patients with VLS, treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids does not seem to increase the risk of HSIL recurrence after the first HSIL.

### Major depressive episode secondary to condylomata acuminata [^117URrWv]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Psychiatric and psychological morbidity is often associated with skin diseases. Recent research has focused on the epidemiological and clinical aspects of human papillomavirus infection, whereas the psychosocial and emotional factors related to the disease have not been well established. We describe the experience of a 22-year-old male who, after being diagnosed of condyloma acuminata, developed a major depressive disorder.

### The lower anogenital squamous terminology standardization project for HPV-associated lesions: background and consensus recommendations from the college of American pathologists and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology [^114nVVx8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Squamous intraepithelial lesions — WG2 — scope and evidence base: Work group 2 evaluated whether HPV-associated biology could be harmonized with histopathologic terminology across lower anogenital sites and developed terminology based on a comprehensive review. Work group 2 reviewed 1,909 articles, with 186 included for data extraction and analysis, and noted that current cervical management uses a 2-tiered terminology except in adolescents and young women where a 3-tiered scheme is used, vulvar guidelines use ISSVD 2 tiers — condyloma and VIN, and at present there are no formal guidelines for vaginal, anal, perianal, or penile noninvasive disease. The group highlighted considerable overlap and ad hoc usage of terms across body sites that creates confusion, and based recommendations on the common biology of HPV-associated squamous disease at these sites.

### Genital warts and other HPV infections: established and novel therapies [^111Tkdjz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Wart therapies involve methods of targeted lesion destruction, as well as selective immunologic modification. While there are several therapeutic options, no treatment has been proven to be superior in terms of clinical clearance or recurrence. Controlled trials comparing treatments are currently lacking. Many factors are used in the selection of treatment. Variables that should be taken into account include but are not limited to the morphology of the lesions such as thickness and size, quantity, anatomic location, human papilloma virus (HPV) classification, immunocompromized or immune competent status, as well as the preferences of the patient and the provider, cost and availability. No current treatment completely eradicates the human papillomavirus virus. The availability of vaccinations against HPV infection is contributing to the decreasing incidence of this disease. This contribution highlights conventional therapies, off-label treatment strategies including combination therapies, and prophylaxis for condylomata acuminata.

### Vulvar and vaginal HPV disease [^115sfias]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Human papilloma virus is associated with a multitude of lower genital tract diseases in women in addition to cervical cancer, including genital warts, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, and some vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers that are associated with oncogenic subtypes. The degree to which HPV manifests pathology depends on viral type, host immune response, and local environmental factors. This article reviews the evaluation and management of the following vulvar and vaginal human papilloma virus diseases: condyloma, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Included is a brief discussion of the association with vulvar and vaginal cancer.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111ebdQy]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infant infection observations — In one study, 19.7% of infants born to HPV-infected mothers and 16.9% of infants of HPV-negative mothers were HPV-positive in the orogenital area during a 14-month follow-up, indicating sources beyond vertical transmission; the risk of infant genital condyloma after maternal condyloma at delivery is low with estimates of 7 per 1,000 births; in a Finland parent–child study, cumulative high-risk HPV detection from the child's genital and oral samples was 36% and 42%, respectively.
