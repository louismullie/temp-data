## Question

Post partum plan for chronic hypertension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step postpartum plan for chronic hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate inpatient stabilization and discharge readiness. Then, I should verify the outpatient monitoring cadence and modality. Next, I will examine medication management and titration targets, including breastfeeding compatibility. After that, I need to consider lifestyle and risk factor modification. Then, I should review long-term cardiovascular risk stratification and prevention. Finally, I will address special populations, equity, and quality metrics, and close with a concise summary algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the inpatient stabilization and discharge criteria. I need to ensure blood pressure is controlled to less than 140/90 mmHg for at least 12 hours before discharge, with a documented plan for outpatient monitoring and medication titration, because standardized protocols that include pre-discharge BP control and remote monitoring enrollment reduce readmissions and ED visits substantially, by about 76% in prospective cohort data, and ACOG emphasizes early postpartum BP checks within 3–10 days for those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which supports a structured transition plan rather than ad hoc discharge [^1151BiuC] [^115CKtNm] [^113ZLjLC].

> Wait, let me verify the outpatient monitoring cadence and modality. The highest-yield approach is remote blood pressure monitoring with validated cuffs and a defined escalation protocol, given its feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and association with improved BP control and reduced readmissions; patients should transmit readings frequently in the first 2 weeks and then taper as stable, with a hard stop for urgent evaluation if BP reaches 160/110 mmHg or if symptomatic, and I should double-check that ACOG's 3–10 day check can be operationalized via telehealth when appropriate to reduce missed visits [^113GKj8X] [^111hEkkf] [^115CKtNm].

> Hold on, I should verify medication management and titration thresholds. For chronic hypertension postpartum, I will treat to a target of less than 140/90 mmHg initially, using labetalol or extended-release nifedipine as first-line agents if continuing from pregnancy, and consider adding an ACE inhibitor such as enalapril after stabilization if breastfeeding because ACE inhibitors are generally compatible with lactation; I need to ensure I titrate promptly for persistent readings at or above 140/90 mmHg on two occasions, and I should remember that while some programs pilot tighter targets like less than 130/80 mmHg, the randomized data comparing 140/90 versus 150/95 initiation thresholds did not show a morbidity difference, so I should individualize tighter targets within a monitored program rather than apply them universally [^111rgRUN] [^113XbxJY] [^113Tr98A] [^112HsDmU].

> I will now examine lifestyle and risk factor modification, because these materially influence long-term cardiovascular outcomes. I need to ensure counseling on the DASH dietary pattern, sodium restriction, weight loss toward BMI less than 25 kg/m² when feasible, and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity after clearance; I should also screen for postpartum depression, reinforce smoking cessation, and discuss safe contraception, especially avoiding teratogenic antihypertensives like ACE inhibitors if pregnancy is planned, and I should confirm that breastfeeding confers cardiometabolic benefits and is encouraged when compatible with the medication regimen [^113Cu1BL] [^115CKtNm] [^111tjLFL].

> Next, I should review long-term cardiovascular risk stratification and prevention. I need to ensure a handoff to primary care or cardiology within 6–12 weeks, with a plan for annual BP checks thereafter, lipid assessment within 2–3 years, and diabetes screening given elevated risk; I should also consider HDP as a sex-specific risk enhancer in ASCVD discussions and, when appropriate, initiate statin therapy for primary prevention in higher-risk individuals, and I must not forget to counsel on low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention in future pregnancies starting at 12 weeks' gestation [^112saov1] [^115CKtNm] [^111rgRUN].

> But wait, what about special populations and equity considerations. I should double-check that Black patients and those with public insurance have higher risks of persistent postpartum hypertension and lower adherence to early follow-up, so I need to proactively mitigate barriers with transportation support, multilingual education, and community health worker engagement; for those with limited resources, I should consider extending remote monitoring beyond 6 weeks because many have persistent hypertension and benefit from structured titration, and I should remember that de novo postpartum hypertension can present after 6 weeks, so vigilance for new symptoms remains important [^117KoCoc] [^112Kc5bB] [^1157gzvj].

> I need to ensure the quality metrics and safety net are explicit. Let me verify that the program tracks readmission rates, time to BP control, medication adherence, and patient-reported outcomes, and that there is a rapid-response pathway for severe-range BP or red-flag symptoms; I should confirm that standardized protocols and EMR-embedded algorithms improve time-to-treatment for severe hypertension and that default scheduling with tailored messaging improves primary care engagement after the postpartum cliff [^117PvhTd] [^1123do9v].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence synthesis and reconcile any conflicting guidance. The strongest short-term evidence supports structured remote monitoring with timely titration to less than 140/90 mmHg, which reduces readmissions and improves early BP control; randomized data have not shown a morbidity benefit to initiating therapy at 140/90 versus 150/95, but observational and pilot programs suggest potential advantages to tighter targets when embedded in supervised self-management, so I will individualize tighter goals within a monitored framework rather than changing the universal initiation threshold today [^1151BiuC] [^113Tr98A] [^112HsDmU].

> Finally, let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Discharge when BP is less than 140/90 mmHg for 12 hours with a home BP cuff, written action plan, and scheduled remote monitoring; in week 1, transmit BP daily with a low threshold to uptitrate labetalol or nifedipine for persistent readings at or above 140/90 mmHg; in weeks 2–6, continue remote monitoring with weekly clinician review and add an ACE inhibitor if needed and breastfeeding-compatible; by 6–12 weeks, transition to primary care with a summary of antepartum and postpartum course, medication list, and risk profile; and long term, ensure annual BP checks, lipid and diabetes screening, lifestyle reinforcement, and preconception counseling including low-dose aspirin for future pregnancies, adjusting the plan if new risk factors emerge [^1151BiuC] [^111rgRUN] [^112saov1].

---

The postpartum plan for chronic hypertension should prioritize **early follow-up within 3–10 days** [^115CKtNm] with **home blood pressure monitoring** [^113GKj8X] to detect and manage postpartum spikes. Continue or initiate **labetalol or nifedipine** [^115JrfNH] as first-line agents; add an ACE inhibitor after delivery if needed, as these are compatible with breastfeeding [^113XbxJY]. Titrate to a target of **< 140/90 mm Hg** [^113Q5o1H], and treat severe hypertension (≥ 160/110 mm Hg) urgently to prevent stroke [^113Q5o1H]. Provide education on warning signs, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes; ensure a structured handoff to primary care for ongoing cardiovascular risk management [^115fStTS] and annual blood pressure monitoring [^115CKtNm].

---

## Immediate postpartum management (0–6 weeks)

### Blood pressure monitoring

- **Frequency**: Monitor blood pressure at least once daily during the immediate postpartum period (first 6 weeks) [^notfound].

- **Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)**: Encourage HBPM with validated devices [^113GKj8X] to improve detection of postpartum hypertension spikes [^111vmc3X].

- **Early follow-up**: Schedule a follow-up visit within 3–10 days postpartum [^111vmc3X] to assess blood pressure control and adjust medications as needed [^111vmc3X].

---

### Pharmacological management

- **First-line antihypertensive agents**: Continue or initiate labetalol or extended-release nifedipine [^112HsDmU] as preferred agents postpartum due to safety and efficacy [^notfound].

- **ACE inhibitors**: Initiate ACE inhibitors (e.g. enalapril) postpartum if additional blood pressure control is needed, as they are compatible with breastfeeding [^113XbxJY].

- **Medication adjustment**: Titrate antihypertensive medications to achieve a target blood pressure of < 140/90 mm Hg [^115JrfNH].

---

### Management of severe hypertension

Acute management entails treating **severe hypertension (≥ 160/110 mm Hg)** [^113Q5o1H] urgently with intravenous labetalol, hydralazine, or oral nifedipine to reduce the risk of stroke and other maternal complications [^115JrM47]. Magnesium sulfate is **not routinely indicated** unless there is concern for postpartum preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia [^113bjDv5].

---

### Patient education

Warning signs should be emphasized, including **severe headache, visual changes, upper abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and swelling**, which require immediate medical attention [^notfound]. Medication adherence should be reinforced to maintain blood pressure control and prevent complications [^111vmc3X]. Lifestyle modifications — such as dietary changes (DASH diet), weight management, and physical activity — should be encouraged [^113Cu1BL].

---

## Long-term postpartum management (beyond 6 weeks)

### Transition to primary care

Structured handoff entails ensuring a **structured transition to primary care** [^115fStTS] for ongoing hypertension management and cardiovascular risk assessment [^115CKtNm]. Annual monitoring should include **annual blood pressure checks** [^115CKtNm] and cardiovascular risk assessments, given the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women with chronic hypertension [^1146TEPN].

---

### Cardiovascular risk management

Lifestyle modifications should continue to address **weight management, dietary changes, and physical activity** to reduce cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. Risk stratification should use **standardized cardiovascular risk calculators** to guide the intensity of treatment and monitoring [^112saov1].

---

### Contraception and future pregnancy planning

Contraception counseling should provide **effective contraception** [^115CKtNm] to prevent unplanned pregnancies until blood pressure is optimally controlled. Preconception planning should include **preconception counseling** for women planning future pregnancies, including optimization of blood pressure control and medication adjustments [^111njJXw].

---

## Special considerations

### Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding compatibility means **most antihypertensive medications, including ACE inhibitors, are compatible with breastfeeding** [^113XbxJY]. Infant monitoring should include **monitoring for potential side effects**, such as sedation or poor feeding, particularly with beta-blockers [^notfound].

---

### Postpartum preeclampsia

Vigilance should include monitoring for **postpartum preeclampsia**, which can occur up to six weeks postpartum and requires prompt medical attention [^116UnXVs]. Magnesium sulfate is indicated for **postpartum preeclampsia with severe features** to prevent seizures [^1145iFzc].

## Postpartum management plan for chronic hypertension

| **Phase** | **Interventions** |
|-|-|
| Immediate postpartum (0–6 weeks) | - Daily BP monitoring <br/> - HBPM <br/> - Early follow-up <br/> - Labetalol/nifedipine <br/> - ACE inhibitors <br/> - Severe HTN management <br/> - Patient education |
| Long-term (beyond 6 weeks) | - Transition to primary care <br/> - Annual monitoring <br/> - Lifestyle modifications <br/> - Risk stratification <br/> - Contraception counseling <br/> - Preconception planning |

---

The postpartum plan for chronic hypertension emphasizes **early follow-up**, **home blood pressure monitoring**, and **appropriate pharmacological management** to prevent complications. Long-term management focuses on cardiovascular risk reduction, lifestyle modifications, and structured transition to primary care [^115CKtNm].

### Standardized clinical assessment and management plan to reduce readmissions for postpartum hypertension [^1151BiuC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of a postpartum hypertension standardized clinical assessment and management plan on postpartum readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients with postpartum hypertension (either chronic hypertension or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy) who delivered at a single tertiary care center for 6 months after enacting an institution-wide standardized clinical assessment and management plan (postintervention group). Patients in the postintervention group were compared with patients in a historical control group. The standardized clinical assessment and management plan included 1) initiation or uptitration of medication for any blood pressure (BP) higher than 150/100 mm Hg or any two BPs higher than 140/90 mm Hg within a 24-hour period, with the goal of achieving normotension (BP lower than 140/90 mm Hg) in the 12 hours before discharge; and 2) enrollment in a remote BP monitoring system on discharge. The primary outcome was postpartum readmission or ED visit for hypertension. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between standardized clinical assessment and management plan and the selected outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was performed with propensity score weighting. A planned subanalysis in the postintervention cohort identified risk factors associated with requiring antihypertensive uptitration after discharge. For all analyses, the level of statistical significance was set at P < .05.

Results

Overall, 390 patients in the postintervention cohort were compared with 390 patients in a historical control group. Baseline demographics were similar between groups with the exception of lower prevalence of chronic hypertension in the postintervention cohort (23.1% vs 32.1%, P = .005). The primary outcome occurred in 2.8% of patients in the postintervention group and in 11.0% of patients in the historical control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.24, 95% CI 0.12–0.49, P < .001). A matched propensity score analysis controlling for chronic hypertension similarly demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of the primary outcome. Of the 255 patients (65.4%) who were compliant with outpatient remote BP monitoring, 53 (20.8%) had medication adjustments made per protocol at a median of 6 days (interquartile range 5–8 days) from delivery. Non-Hispanic Black race (aOR 3.42, 95% CI 1.68–6.97), chronic hypertension (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.13–3.89), having private insurance (aOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.06–8.72), and discharge on antihypertensive medications (aOR 2.39, 95% CI 1.33–4.30) were associated with requiring outpatient adjustments.

Conclusion

A standardized clinical assessment and management plan significantly reduced postpartum readmissions and ED visits for patients with hypertension. Close outpatient follow-up to ensure appropriate medication titration after discharge may be especially important in groups at high risk for readmission.

### Quality improvement opportunities for better blood pressure management in pregnancy and the postpartum period: the hypertension in pregnancy change package [^114A4hBH]. Journal of Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy, which includes both chronic hypertension and pregnancy-associated hypertension, is on the rise in the United States and is associated with an increased incidence of maternal and neonatal complications and future cardiovascular disease. Recent clinical recommendations suggest a lower blood pressure threshold for initiating treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Here we present a new quality improvement resource for outpatient clinicians to support changes to care processes for managing chronic hypertension in pregnancy and the postpartum period.

### Toward personalized management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^113XbxJY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension complicates 1% to 2% of pregnancies, and it is increasingly common. Women with chronic hypertension are an easily recognized group who are in touch with a wide variety of healthcare providers before, during, and after pregnancy, mandating that chronic hypertension in pregnancy be within the scope of many practitioners. We reviewed recent data on management to inform current care and future research. This study is a narrative review of published literature. Compared with normotensive women, women with chronic hypertension are at an increased risk of maternal and perinatal complications. Women with chronic hypertension who wish to be involved in their care can do by measuring blood pressure at home. Accurate devices for home blood pressure monitoring are now readily available. The diagnostic criteria for superimposed preeclampsia remain problematic because most guidelines continue to include deteriorating blood pressure control in the definition. It has not been established how angiogenic markers may aid in confirmation of the diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia when suspected, over and above information provided by routinely available clinical data and laboratory results. Although chronic hypertension is a strong risk factor for preeclampsia, and aspirin decreases preeclampsia risk, the effectiveness specifically among women with chronic hypertension has been questioned. It is unclear whether calcium has an independent effect in preeclampsia prevention in such women. Treating hypertension with antihypertensive therapy halves the risk of progression to severe hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, but a reduction in preeclampsia or serious maternal complications has not been observed; however, the lack of evidence for the latter is possibly owing to few events. In addition, treating chronic hypertension neither reduces nor increases fetal or newborn death or morbidity, regardless of the gestational age at which the antihypertensive treatment is started. Antihypertensive agents are not teratogenic, but there may be an increase in malformations associated with chronic hypertension itself. At present, blood pressure treatment targets used in clinics are the same as those used at home, although blood pressure values tend to be inconsistently lower at home among women with hypertension. Although starting all women on the same antihypertensive medication is usually effective in reducing blood pressure, it remains unclear whether there is an optimal agent for such an approach or how best to use combinations of antihypertensive medications. An alternative approach is to individualize care, using maternal characteristics and blood pressure features beyond blood pressure level (eg, variability) that are of prognostic value. Outcomes may be improved by timed birth between 38 0/7 and 39 6/7 weeks' gestation based on observational literature; of note, confirmatory trial evidence is pending. Postnatal care is facilitated by the acceptability of most antihypertensives (including angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors) for use in breastfeeding. The evidence base to guide the care of pregnant women with chronic hypertension is growing and aligning with international guidelines. Addressing outstanding research questions would inform personalized care of chronic hypertension in pregnancy.

### Management of postpartum preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders (MOPP): postpartum tight vs standard blood pressure control [^1146TEPN]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 3% to 6% of all pregnancies are complicated by preeclampsia, and 5% to 12% of those patients return to the hospital with hypertensive disorders when they are postpartum. Black pregnant persons are especially vulnerable to antepartum and postpartum preeclampsia and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to their White counterparts. The prevalence of hypertension is increasing, and it is one of the most substantial modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Tight blood pressure control in the postpartum period may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease later in life.

The current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for managing postpartum hypertension are based on a 1987 case series of 67 patients and recommend a cutoff of 150/100 mm Hg to start antihypertensive medications in the postpartum period. Outside of pregnancy, new guidelines and recommendations for blood pressure control have shown that a reduction in blood pressure decreases cardiovascular events. As a result of these findings, the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (AHA) Blood Pressure Guidelines recommend systolic and diastolic blood pressure treatment goals of less than 130 mm Hg and less than 80 mm Hg, respectively, for nonpregnant adults on antihypertensive medication.

Tita et alreported that tight blood pressure control to < 140/90 mm Hg during the antepartum period for patients with chronic hypertension improved maternal and neonatal outcomes. Limited studies have evaluated the effects of a lower blood pressure target and stricter blood pressure control during the postpartum period to reduce complications of preeclampsia and its severe sequelae. However, without the safety concerns for the fetus, the postpartum period presents an optimal opportunity to assess if tighter blood pressure control may be beneficial.

More than 60% of maternal deaths occur during the postpartum period, of which hypertension is a major contributor to these deaths. Postpartum blood pressure most typically reaches a maximum at 4 to 6 days postpartumand returns to the prepregnancy state around 4 to 6 weeks postpartum. Patient self-monitoring of blood pressure has revealed that more than 80% of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have persistently elevated blood pressure. Remote patient monitoring offers an innovative approach to blood pressure assessment and titration of medication for patients who do not have the resources to make frequent in-person visits. However, in one study, the increased surveillance led to increased emergency department visits, which may have been because no adjustments in therapy were accompanied by a change in monitoring. Additional emergency department visits or postpartum admissions can impact mother-infant bonding, breastfeeding, and mental health, in addition to driving up the cost of health care.

### Cardiovascular risk factor management after hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^112saov1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are associated with significantly increased risk of developing future cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obstetricians play a crucial role in CVD prevention for postpartum women and birthing people with HDP because they are primarily responsible for immediate postpartum management and can assist with care transitions to other health care practitioners for long-term management of CVD risk factors. Standardized calculators can be used to evaluate long-term CVD risk, which can help guide intensity of treatment. Emerging technologies such as remote blood pressure monitoring demonstrate promise for improving outcomes among patients with HDP. After HDP, all patients should be advised of their increased CVD risk. A plan should be made to initiate lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive therapy to achieve optimal blood pressure control with a target of lower than 130/80 mm Hg, assess lipids within 2–3 years of delivery, and evaluate for development of type 2 diabetes. Other CVD risk factors such as nicotine use should similarly be identified and addressed. In this review, we summarize the essential components of managing CVD risk after a pregnancy complicated by HDP, including blood pressure monitoring, risk stratification tools, and evidence-based lifestyle recommendations.

### Short-term postpartum blood pressure self-management and long-term blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial [^113RicbT]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including both gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, affect 10% of pregnanciesand have significant impacts on maternal and fetal health during the peripartum period. Additionally, one-third of women develop chronic hypertension within 10 yearsand, over their lifetime, have a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and renal dysfunction. As a result, the US and European guidelines, advise that women should be informed of this higher incidence of disease after pregnancy and advise annual blood pressure (BP) monitoring, but, beyond routine risk factor management, no specific additional interventions are currently available to reduce long-term risk.

Prior research shows that persistently high BP 6 weeks after a hypertensive pregnancy is associated with a greater increase in BP over the next 5 to 10 years. This is independent of BP levels during early pregnancy, or at time of delivery, and is evident both in those with more severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, such as early-onset preeclampsia and later onset, milder disease. A plausible explanation might be that BP at 6 weeks postpartum is merely a marker of BP trajectory over the life course for that individual. However, without intervention, BP remains unstable for up to 50% of women for several months after a hypertensive pregnancy. An alternative explanation is that uncontrolled BP in the puerperium directly affects the cardiac and vascular remodeling, known to occur in the weeks after a hypertensive pregnancy in both mother and child. – In turn, this may lead to a long-term persistence of elevated BP, accelerating a lifelong trajectory of increased vascular risk.

To test this hypothesis required a randomized controlled trial of BP optimization after a hypertensive pregnancy. Trials of self-management, outside of pregnancy, have repeatedly demonstrated improved BP control. – In the SNAP-HT trial (Self-Management of Postnatal Hypertension), our group confirmed that postpartum self-management was feasible and that it improved BP control, with a more rapid return to normal BP ranges within 6 weeks of delivery, when compared with usual care. In addition, 6 months later, those randomized to postpartum self-management had a persistent 4.5-mm Hg reduction in diastolic BP. We have now performed a long-term follow-up of this cohort (SNAP-HT Extension Study), to formally test the hypothesis that interventions to improve BP over the first few months following a hypertensive pregnancy result in long-term reprogramming of BP in the mother.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203 summary: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^112gkfqE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension is present in 0.9–1.5% of pregnant women (1) and may result in significant maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The rate of maternal chronic hypertension increased by 67% from 2000 to 2009, with the largest increase (87%) among African American women. This increase is largely secondary to the obesity epidemic and increasing maternal age (1, 2). The trend is expected to continue. The purpose of this document is to clarify the criteria used to define and diagnose chronic hypertension before or during pregnancy, to review the effects of chronic hypertension on pregnancy and vice versa, and to appraise the available evidence for management options. The purpose of these revised best practice recommendations is to provide a rational approach to chronic hypertension in pregnancy based on new research data and relevant pathophysiologic and pharmacologic considerations.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension and pregnancy — chronic hypertension management and target: COR 1 states that pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension (defined as prepregnancy hypertension or SBP 140–159 mm Hg and/or DBP 90–109 mm Hg prior to 20 weeks gestation) should receive antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP < 140/90 mm Hg to prevent maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy-associated hypertension — postpartum follow-up and prevention: BP measurement and medication titration in the early postpartum period should be individualized and patient centered. ACOG recommends a BP check for individuals with an HDP within 3 to 10 days of discharge, and HBPM has been shown to improve BP ascertainment. When combined in a team-based approach, including medication self-management and telehealth, HBPM for postpartum individuals with a history of HDP has been associated with lower BP and improved measures of cardiac structure and function at 6 and 9 months' postpartum compared with usual care. Postpartum individuals with a history of pregnancy-associated hypertension in whom BP elevations resolve and antihypertensive medications are discontinued are encouraged to have their BP measured at least annually. HDP are also recognized as sex-specific risk enhancers that should be taken into consideration when stratifying individuals and discussing the initiation of a statin for primary prevention of CVD, and a discussion of effective contraception in pregnancy-capable individuals with chronic hypertension being treated with potentially teratogenic medications is essential. Barring no medical contraindications, individuals with a history of HDP should be educated about the benefits of low-dose aspirin and prescribed low-dose aspirin to be taken starting at 12 weeks of gestation during subsequent pregnancies to reduce the risk of preeclampsia.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^111njJXw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Interpregnancy care aims to maximize a woman's level of wellness not just in between pregnancies and during subsequent pregnancies, but also along her life course. Because the interpregnancy period is a continuum for overall health and wellness, all women of reproductive age who have been pregnant regardless of the outcome of their pregnancies (ie, miscarriage, abortion, preterm, full-term delivery), should receive interpregnancy care as a continuum from postpartum care. The initial components of interpregnancy care should include the components of postpartum care, such as reproductive life planning, screening for depression, vaccination, managing diabetes or hypertension if needed, education about future health, assisting the patient to develop a postpartum care team, and making plans for long-term medical care. In women with chronic medical conditions, interpregnancy care provides an opportunity to optimize health before a subsequent pregnancy. For women who will not have any future pregnancies, the period after pregnancy also affords an opportunity for secondary prevention and improvement of future health.

### Tight vs liberal control of mild postpartum hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^113Tr98A]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

High-quality evidence to inform the management of postpartum hypertension, including the optimal blood pressure threshold to initiate therapy, is lacking. Randomized trials have been conducted in pregnancy, but there are no published trials to guide management in the postpartum period.

Objective

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that initiating antihypertensive therapy in the postpartum period at a threshold of 140/90 mm Hg would result in less maternal morbidity than initiating therapy at a threshold of 150/95 mm Hg.

Study Design

We performed a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients aged 18 to 55 years with postpartum hypertension. Patients with chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia without severe features were randomized to 1 of 2 blood pressure thresholds to initiate treatment: persistent blood pressure of ≥ 150/95 mm Hg (institutional standard or "liberal control" group) or ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (intervention or "tight control" group). Our primary outcome was composite maternal morbidity defined as: severe hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 160/110 mm Hg) or preeclampsia with severe features, the need for a second antihypertensive agent, postpartum hospitalization > 4 days, and maternal adverse outcome secondary to hypertension as evidenced by pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury (creatinine level ≥ 1.1 mg/dL), cardiac dysfunction (eg, elevated brain natriuretic peptide level) or cardiomyopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, or admission to an intensive care unit. Secondary outcomes included hospital readmission for hypertension, persistence of hypertension beyond 14 days, medication side effects, and time to blood pressure control. We calculated that 256 women would provide 90% power to detect a relative 50% reduction in the primary outcome from 36% in the standard blood pressure threshold group to 18%, with a 2-sided alpha set at 0.05 for significance. Data were analyzed using R statistical software.

Results

A total of 256 patients were randomized, including 128 to the "tight control" group (140/90 mm Hg) and 128 to the "liberal control" group (150/95 mm Hg). Patients in the "tight control" group had a higher body mass index at delivery (37.1 ± 9.4 vs 34.9 ± 8.1; p = 0.04); other demographic and obstetrical characteristics were similar between groups. The rate of the primary outcome was similar between groups (8.6% vs 11.7%; p = 0.41; relative risk, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.35–1.53). The rates of all secondary outcomes and the individual components of the primary and secondary outcome measures were also similar between groups.

Conclusion

In the postpartum period, initiation of antihypertensive therapy at a lower blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg did not decrease maternal morbidity or improve outcomes compared with a threshold of 150/95 mm Hg.

### Redesigning care for the management of postpartum hypertension: how can Ob-gyns and primary care physicians partner in caring for patients after a hypertensive pregnancy? [^116T7tJw]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The standard care model in the postpartum period is ripe for disruption and attention. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) can continue to be a challenge for the postpartum person in the immediate postpartum period and is a harbinger of future health risks. The current care approach is inadequate to address the needs of these women. We propose a model for a multidisciplinary clinic and collaboration between internal medicine specialists and obstetric specialists to shepherd patients through this high-risk time and provide a bridge for lifelong care to mitigate the risks of a HDP. KEY POINTS: · HDPs are increasing in prevalence. · The postpartum period can be more complex for women with HDPs. · A multidisciplinary clinic could fill the postpartum care gap for women with HDP.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1149EvpL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy-associated hypertension — postpartum follow-up and long-term care: BP measurement and medication titration in the early postpartum period should be individualized and patient centered. ACOG recommends a BP check for individuals with an HDP within 3 to 10 days of discharge, and HBPM has been shown to improve BP ascertainment; when combined in a team-based approach including medication self-management and telehealth, HBPM for postpartum individuals with a history of HDP has been associated with lower BP and improved measures of cardiac structure and function at 6 and 9 months' postpartum compared with usual care. These remote strategies may also help compensate for racial disparities in office-centric follow-up strategies, although there is insufficient evidence to definitively confirm reduction of maternal morbidity or mortality or racial disparity outcomes. Individuals with a history of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are at increased risk for the development of CKM risk factors, including chronic hypertension and overt cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality that often occurs prematurely; postpartum individuals with a history of pregnancy-associated hypertension in whom BP elevations resolve and antihypertensive medications are discontinued are encouraged to have their BP measured at least annually. HDP are also recognized as sex-specific risk enhancers that should be taken into consideration when stratifying individuals and discussing the initiation of a statin for primary prevention of CVD. A discussion of effective contraception in pregnancy-capable individuals with chronic hypertension being treated with potentially teratogenic medications is essential. Barring no medical contraindications, individuals with a history of HDP should be educated about the benefits of low-dose aspirin and prescribed low-dose aspirin to be taken starting at 12 weeks of gestation during subsequent pregnancies to reduce the risk of preeclampsia.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^111Wsjx2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension is present in 0.9–1.5% of pregnant women () and may result in significant maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The rate of maternal chronic hypertension increased by 67% from 2000 to 2009, with the largest increase (87%) among African American women. This increase is largely secondary to the obesity epidemic and increasing maternal age (). The trend is expected to continue. The purpose of this document is to clarify the criteria used to define and diagnose chronic hypertension before or during pregnancy, to review the effects of chronic hypertension on pregnancy and vice versa, and to appraise the available evidence for management options. The purpose of these revised best practice recommendations is to provide a rational approach to chronic hypertension in pregnancy based on new research data and relevant pathophysiologic and pharmacologic considerations.

### Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: US preventive services task force final recommendation statement [^112B6BFP]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — Screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy recommends that pregnant persons be screened with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy (Grade: B). This applies to all pregnant women and pregnant persons of all genders without a known diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy or chronic hypertension. Implementation specifies that blood pressure measurements should be obtained during each prenatal care visit throughout pregnancy, that an elevated reading should be confirmed with repeated measurements, and that to achieve the benefit of screening, it is important that persons who screen positive receive evidence-based management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. While risk continues into the immediate postpartum period and there is little evidence regarding screening during this period, a pragmatic approach would be counseling at hospital discharge regarding signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and for patients with hypertensive disorders to have subsequent blood pressure checks.

### Hypertension in pregnancy and postpartum: current standards and opportunities to improve care [^111i3kFW]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy contributes substantially to maternal morbidity and mortality, persistent hypertension, and rehospitalization. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are also associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, and timely recognition and modification of associated risk factors is crucial in optimizing long-term maternal health. During pregnancy, there are expected physiologic alterations in blood pressure (BP); however, pathophysiologic alterations may also occur, leading to preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. The diagnosis and effective management of hypertension during pregnancy is essential to mitigate maternal risks, such as acute kidney injury, stroke, and heart failure, while balancing potential fetal risks, such as growth restriction and preterm birth due to altered uteroplacental perfusion. In the postpartum period, innovative and multidisciplinary care solutions that include postpartum maternal health clinics can help optimize short- and long-term care through enhanced BP management, screening of cardiovascular risk factors, and discussion of lifestyle modifications for cardiovascular disease prevention. As an adjunct to or distinct from postpartum clinics, home BP monitoring programs have been shown to improve BP ascertainment across diverse populations and to lower BP in the months after delivery. Because of concerns about pregnant patients being a vulnerable population for research, there is little evidence from trials examining the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum individuals. As a result, national and international guidelines differ in their recommendations, and more studies are needed to bolster future guidelines and establish best practices to achieve optimal cardiovascular health during and after pregnancy. Future research should focus on refining treatment thresholds and optimal BP range peripartum and postpartum and evaluating interventions to improve postpartum and long-term maternal cardiovascular outcomes that would advance evidence-based care and improve outcomes worldwide for people with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

3.2 Antepartum blood pressure management

HDPs of pregnancy are the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, contributing to 14% of maternal deaths world‐wide. 24 The ACOG 25 identifies the importance of identification and treatment of acute onset, severe hypertension in pregnant or postpartum women, emphasizing, "the goal is not to normalize blood pressure, but to achieve a range of SBP 140–150/ DBP 90–100 mm Hg in order to prevent repeated, prolonged exposure to severe systolic hypertension". 25 More commonly seen is gestational hypertension defined as onset of hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg) after 20 weeks of gestation without proteinuria or absence of new signs of end‐organ dysfunction. The diagnosis evolves into preeclampsia if new‐onset proteinuria or end‐organ dysfunction accompany elevated blood pressure.

The ACOG Practice Bulletin on Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy 26 acknowledged its conflict with the 2017 ACC/AHA Blood Pressure Guideline recommendations, as the hypertension diagnosis threshold for nonpregnant women is lower compared with ACOG's criteria. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that nonpregnant patients with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130‐139 mm Hg and/or DBP 80‐89 mm Hg) with CVD risk factors should begin treatment. While ACOG states that it is reasonable to continue to manage a chronic hypertensive patient in pregnancy similarly to the ACC/AHA guidelines for chronic hypertension, there is no recommendation for management of a gestational hypertensive woman within the stage 1 range. A secondary analysis of a low‐dose aspirin trial for preeclampsia prevention found that aspirin did not appear to lower the risk of preeclampsia in the group redefined as stage 1 hypertensive. 27 Application of the ACC/AHA blood pressure guidelines to pregnant women thus needs to be an active area of research. Without contemporary data and randomized controlled trials demonstrating improved outcomes with lower hypertension thresholds, it is difficult to translate current CVD guidelines to an antepartum population. For example, the Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) randomized trial of "less‐tight" control (target DBP 100 mm Hg) or "tight" control (target DBP 85 mm Hg) demonstrated no significant differences in the risk of pregnancy loss, high‐level neonatal care, or overall maternal complications, although less‐tight control was associated with higher frequency of severe maternal hypertension. 28 Research is needed to determine whether lower blood pressure thresholds and treatment targets in pregnancy improve long‐term CVD outcomes.

Interpregnancy care "aims to maximize a woman's level of wellness not just in between pregnancies and during subsequent pregnancies, but also along her life course", and "in women with chronic medical conditions, interpregnancy care provides an opportunity to optimize health before a subsequent pregnancy", while "for women who will not have any future pregnancies, the period after pregnancy also affords an opportunity for secondary prevention and improvement of future health".

Blood pressure treatment targets during pregnancy

A wealth of epidemiologic evidence supports higher risk for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in the setting of chronic hypertension. However, a key challenge in managing pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension has been the uncertainty in BP treatment targets, which vary across society guidelines. This is particularly true given that there has not been good evidence to this point that treatment of mild chronic hypertension improves health outcomes and some evidence that it reduces birth weight. Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines had recommended treatment when systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mmHg. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines had stricter thresholds and recommended treatment when SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. In nonpregnant individuals, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines cutoffs for the management of hypertension have an entirely different strategy, recommending not only reclassification but also management of stage 1 hypertension from 140/90 mmHg to < 130/80 mmHg with antihypertensives. While treatment of BP does provide therapeutic control, the lack of data on preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes and the potential for harm related to reduced uteroplacental blood flow and fetal growth restriction has led to hesitation to lower BP treatment targets in pregnancy. Thus, the treatment thresholds of chronic hypertension in pregnancy vary from what the cardiovascular community uses in the rest of the adult population.

Annual screening for hypertension in adults at increased risk for hypertension is recommended, while less frequent screening, every three to five years, is appropriate for adults ages 18 to 39 who are not at increased risk for hypertension and with a prior normal blood pressure reading, and providers should inform patients that hypertension in pregnancy can impact pregnancy outcomes, and close monitoring is critical.

### Etiology and management of postpartum hypertension-preeclampsia [^116UnXVs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Postpartum hypertension can be related to persistence of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or preexisting chronic hypertension, or it could develop de novo postpartum secondary to other causes. There are limited data describing the etiology, differential diagnosis, and management of postpartum hypertension-preeclampsia. The differential diagnosis is extensive, and varies from benign (mild gestational or essential hypertension) to life-threatening such as severe preeclampsia-eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, and cerebrovascular accidents. Therefore, medical providers caring for postpartum women should be educated about continued monitoring of signs and symptoms and prompt management of these women in a timely fashion. Evaluation and management should be performed in a stepwise fashion and may require a multidisciplinary approach that considers predelivery risk factors, time of onset, associated signs/symptoms, and results of selective laboratory and imaging findings. The objective of this review is to increase awareness and to provide a stepwise approach toward the diagnosis and management of women with persistent and/or new-onset hypertension-preeclampsia postpartum period.

Acute-onset, severe systolic hypertension; severe diastolic hypertension; or both can occur in pregnant women or women in the postpartum period. Introducing standardized, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of adverse maternal outcomes. Individuals and institutions should have mechanisms in place to initiate the prompt administration of medication when a patient presents with a hypertensive emergency. Once the hypertensive emergency is treated, a complete and detailed evaluation of maternal and fetal well-being is needed with consideration of, among many issues, the need for subsequent pharmacotherapy and the appropriate timing of delivery.

### Is magnesium sulfate therapy warranted in all cases of late postpartum severe hypertension? A suggested approach to a clinical conundrum [^113bjDv5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Magnesium sulfate reduces the risk for eclamptic seizures antepartum, intrapartum, and in the immediate postpartum period, however, there are no studies that have evaluated the benefits and risks of magnesium sulfate among women with late postpartum severe hypertension only. Juxtaposed on this clinical uncertainty is the increased incidence of severe hypertension owing to a rise in pregnancies complicated by advanced maternal age, obesity, chronic hypertension, diabetes, and recent protocols for intensive monitoring of blood pressure in the postpartum period. These factors have led to a significant increase in postpartum presentations for the evaluation and management of severe hypertension, in some cases leading to postpartum readmissions for administration of antihypertensive therapy and magnesium sulfate without data demonstrating clear clinical benefit. Postpartum readmissions can have several negative consequences, including interfering with early bonding with a newborn, breastfeeding, and use of scarce healthcare resources. In addition, magnesium sulfate is associated with risks for serious cardiorespiratory depression and bothersome side effects and can delay determining the optimal antihypertensive regimen, which is typically the most pressing clinical need during postpartum presentations of late-postpartum severe hypertension. Eclampsia that occurs more than 48 hours after delivery is rare (constitutes 16% of all cases of eclampsia) and is most commonly preceded by headaches or other cerebral symptoms. In this commentary, we propose an approach to evaluating and managing patients with late postpartum severe hypertension aimed at identifying those women at highest risk for end-organ injury. We recommend that the short- and long-term focus for all patients with severe hypertension should be the optimal management of blood pressures with a goal of close outpatient monitoring when logistically feasible and clinically appropriate. We suggest reserving magnesium sulfate therapy for the subset of patients with neurologic symptoms who may be at highest risk for an eclamptic seizure.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: innovative management strategies [^112t3qZC]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Innovating multilevel and multidisciplinary management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

A combination of strategies prepregnancy, antepartum, and postpartum can identify high-risk groups and patients at risk for developing HDP (Figure 1). Phone-based applications, blue-tooth or cellular upload of BP measurements to the EMR from BP self-monitoring, video-based EMR-integrated telemedicine, and CHWs could be integrated more fully to manage peripartum HDP (Central Illustration). Technology advances person-centered clinical care to increase health care access and empowers patients to engage in self-management for improved health outcomes. A model of prioritized health care access that meets each patient where they are as opposed to relying on the patient coming to the health system may be more useful to identify acutely uncontrolled BP both ante and postpartum. CHWs can provide enhanced health education and coaching, peer support, and streamline patient-provider communication, aiding therapeutic optimization. CHWs could be incorporated into the cardio-obstetrics team, as consensus guidelines encourage early involvement of the cardio-obstetrics team to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, an equity-focused approach is crucial, with dedicated CHWs responsible for overseeing and encouraging retention in routine care, completion of referrals to primary and specialty care postpartum, screening for social needs, and introducing community resources. Assessment of clinical and social needs and coordination of real-time care plan management will allow for earlier identification, timely intervention, and prevention of unnecessary readmission and use of emergent/hospital-based care, as well as morbidity from uncontrolled BP.

### The patient experience of a postpartum readmission for hypertension: a qualitative study [^117VrqDZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The fourth trimester, or the first three months postpartum, is a time fraught with challenges for the birthing person and has the potential for medical morbidity and mortality. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), defined as either chronic or pregnancy-associated hypertension, complicate between 5 and 13% of pregnancies, and are the most common cause of postpartum readmissions. Further, they can cause up to 7% of maternal mortality, 70% of which occurs in the postpartum period. At our facility, we have begun a follow-up program for postpartum people with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In this cohort of 164 postpartum people with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy who (1) delivered from 2/2023 to 6/2023 and (2) received care in our faculty MFM and Ob-Gyn practice there were 19 readmissions (11.6%). Readmission due to postpartum hypertension within 6 weeks of delivery can cost the healthcare system up to $700 million. It also can cause strain for the mother-child dyad as there may be separation and interruption of bonding in the early postpartum period. Given the high prevalence of HDP among readmitted patients and burden that readmissions place on patients, families, and the health care system, it is important to understand what factors can be modified to reduce these rates. Prior research led to the creation of clinical guidelines for postpartum management; however, the patient experience is often missing from this work.

Pregnancy-associated stroke — blood pressure management recommendations: In pregnant or early postpartum (within 6 weeks of delivery) patients with severe hypertension, defined as 2 measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg 15 minutes apart, BP-lowering treatment to a target < 160/110 mm Hg as soon as possible is recommended to reduce the risk of maternal ICH. In patients with HDP, including chronic hypertension in pregnancy, treatment with antihypertensive medication to a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg is reasonable to reduce the risk of pregnancy-associated stroke. Supporting text notes that acute, severely elevated BP in pregnancy or the puerperium constitutes a neurological emergency because of its high risk of hemorrhagic stroke; observational data support prompt BP-lowering to prevent fatal maternal stroke; a 30-year retrospective study reported 347 fatal maternal strokes with delayed control of systolic hypertension as a major factor; four other case series including 157 maternal strokes found delayed or ineffective treatment contributed to morbidity and mortality; and a 2013 Cochrane review found no significant difference in efficacy among fast-acting oral nifedipine, intravenous labetalol, or intravenous hydralazine, all considered reasonable options.

### Postpartum blood pressure screening in the United States primary care settings: a systematic review [^117QEvvg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We synthesized 32 articles to identify primary care strategies for hypertension screening in the postpartum period. There were three key findings: First, studies recruiting high-risk patients more often involved earlier postpartum BP screenings than those recruiting low-risk patients. Second, patients who identified as Asian or American Indian/Alaskan Natives, were least represented in the postpartum BP management interventions. Third, interventions utilized in in-home settings were generally associated with earlier postpartum BP screenings than in-clinic settings alone.

Screening in high-risk vs. lower-risk patients

Studies focusing on high-risk patients — defined as those with an existing diagnosis of HDP — reported earlier postpartum BP evaluation than those that included low-risk patients. This is not surprising given that patients with preexisting HDP are generally at higher risk of postpartum complications, requiring more comprehensive and stringent BP evaluation protocols. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends BP screening within 72-hours postpartum for patients with severe hypertension.

These findings highlight a critical gap that early BP screening guidelines are less clearly defined for postpartum patients without additional health comorbidities. Existing recommendations continue to be tailored to and prioritize high-risk populations, even in primary care settings. This is particularly concerning in light of research reporting that at least one in 10 women with normotensive pregnancies will develop hypertension within 12-months postpartum. We advise the need for universal postpartum BP evaluation guidelines tailored for normotensive patients, including low-risk primiparous and multiparous patients. We also recommend continuous BP monitoring for these patients prior to hospital discharge, as well as, early scheduling of postpartum BP screening appointments.

### Management of acutely decompensated chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in late pregnancy: a case report [^1173PpVV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension diagnosed during pregnancy carries considerable risk and requires adequate peripartum planning. Most common symptoms include dyspnea, hemoptysis, exercise intolerance and careful workup can identify hypoxia and hypotension. If suspected early, BNP levels higher than 300 pg/mL can identify patients at risk for heart failure, while echocardiography can verify the existence of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular involvement.

In some rare cases though, the condition remains unnoticed until sudden and progressive worsening of cardiorespiratory parameters. Understandably, the diagnosis and treatment of previously unknown pulmonary hypertension presenting as acute right heart failure and respiratory failure in the late stage of pregnancy poses a difficult multidisciplinary management problem. Increased maternal mortality, risk of fetal growth and developmental delay, high-risk delivery and potential worsening of circulatory parameters in the postpartum period, all need to be considered when treating the patient. Several issues need to be addressed when establishing a peripartum management plan for a patient newly diagnosed with acute decompensation of previously undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension (Table 1).

Table 1
Bullet points for peripartum management of acute decompensation of previously undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension

As there are no current clear recommendations regarding these issues, the ideal management needs to be established on a case by case basis, which is highlighted by our experience. Perioperative invasive cardiovascular monitoring is critical, but pulmonary arterial catheter use is discouraged in acute right heart failure due to high complication rates. Because of this, we opted to use PiCCO monitoring and regular echocardiography assessments. We hypothesized that regular measurement of cardiac index would be informative during the postpartum period when we expected hemodynamic instability. There are several factors that aid cardiovascular stability, crucial for both maternal and fetal outcome in the peripartum period. Improving oxygenation is important in reversing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and normal oxygen saturation can ideally be achieved with high flow oxygen or low-pressure noninvasive ventilation. In our case we used BIPAP noninvasive ventilation with high FiO 2: careful titration of pressures resulted in improved oxygenation while not compromising cardiovascular parameters.

### Establishing a remote blood pressure monitoring program through the first year postpartum after pregnancy-induced hypertension [^112Kc5bB]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

What is the feasibility of a remote BP management program extending through the first year postpartum for individuals with persistent hypertension?

What is the main finding?

BP monitoring beyond 6 weeks postpartum is feasible for optimization of BP in a socioeconomically diverse cohort with persistent hypertension.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are associated with high rates of ongoing postpartum hypertension. Significant gaps in care can lead to suboptimally treated hypertension in the year after delivery. Remote blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a feasible method to manage HDP in the immediate 6-week postpartum period and may provide a unique opportunity for early cardiovascular risk factor management beyond the immediate postpartum period.

Our institution has an established remote BP management program in the first 6 weeks postpartum. We have found that 50% of individuals with HDP have persistent hypertension at the end of the 6-week program and gaps in follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP) for longitudinal BP management, leading to a high burden of suboptimally treated hypertension. The objective of this study is to establish feasibility of a remote BP management program extending through the first year postpartum.

Eligible individuals have a HDP (chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension). Maternal, obstetric, and sociodemographic data are obtained from the electronic medical record at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Patients are initially enrolled into the immediate postpartum (6-week) remote BP monitoring program at the time of discharge from delivery hospitalization, emergency room visit, or postpartum readmission. A description of the immediate postpartum remote monitoring program has been previously published.

We developed an extension of this remote monitoring program beginning at 6 weeks postpartum and continuing up to 1-year postpartum, for individuals with persistent hypertension. Persistent hypertension is defined as: continuing to require antihypertensive medications and/or BPs ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. Individuals with persistent hypertension are given the option to continue home monitoring through our extension program (opt-in) on day 21 of the program and again at the conclusion of the 6-week program. The extension program prompts BP reporting twice per week through the first year postpartum. Once goal BP (< 140/90 mm Hg) is achieved with 8 consecutive BP measurements and participants are no longer on antihypertensive medications, patients can be "graduated" from the monitoring program. Otherwise, patients participate for 365 days, and PCP follow-up is ensured at graduation.

In recent years, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have reduced the thresholds for a hypertension diagnosis among nonpregnant adults. This change has led to more individuals with reproductive potential to be labeled as being chronically hypertensive, and some were started on antihypertensive medications. When these individuals become pregnant, the obstetrical care provider will have to decide whether to manage them as individuals with chronic hypertensive when only a few years ago they would have been managed as normotensive individuals and when the evidence regarding treatment of these patients during pregnancy is limited. If implemented widely, the management of patients with stage 1 hypertension similar to the traditional chronic hypertension will likely lead to additional maternal and fetal testing, to an increase in hospital admissions, and potentially to unnecessary interventions, such as preterm birth. Our goal was to compile the existing evidence regarding the pregnancy outcomes among patients with stage 1 hypertension to assist providers in their diagnosis and management of this patient group.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: innovative management strategies [^1134RoPq]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Current management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

Preventing HDP altogether is most optimal to avoid adverse outcomes. There appears to be an inverse relationship between physical activity, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia. Preventative medical management with aspirin is recommended per American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) guidelines for those at increased risk for preeclampsia, including those with previous preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic hypertension. For these individuals, there is a Level of Evidence: A recommendation to start low-dose aspirin (81 mg) before 16 weeks of gestation for prevention of preeclampsia. Individuals who develop preeclampsia after 37 weeks of gestation are recommended to undergo immediate delivery.

Severe hypertension and preeclampsia must be treated early on to prevent adverse outcomes. The BP target for acute severe hypertension and preeclampsia ante or postpartum is a BP of 140–150/90–100 mm Hg. The optimal BP target for the treatment of mild chronic hypertension is an area of active investigation. In an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) assigning pregnant women with mild chronic hypertension (BP < 160/100 mm Hg) to antihypertensive medication, a BP target of 140/90 mm Hg in patients with chronic hypertension was associated with lower risk of developing preeclampsia with severe features, medically indicated preterm birth (< 35 weeks of gestation), placental abruption, or fetal or neonatal death, and there was no increase in the risk for small-for-gestational-age birth weight. Medical therapies for HDP antepartum include hydralazine, labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa. Postpartum, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, may be useful and is compatible with breastfeeding in normal-term neonates. Magnesium is used for seizure prophylaxis and diuretics for edema or volume overload postpartum.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 736: optimizing postpartum care [^115K7v6F]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

The weeks following birth are a critical period for a woman and her infant, setting the stage for long-term health and well-being. To optimize the health of women and infants, postpartum care should become an ongoing process, rather than a single encounter, with services and support tailored to each woman's individual needs. It is recommended that all women have contact with their obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric care providers within the first 3 weeks postpartum. This initial assessment should be followed up with ongoing care as needed, concluding with a comprehensive postpartum visit no later than 12 weeks after birth. The comprehensive postpartum visit should include a full assessment of physical, social, and psychological well-being, including the following domains: mood and emotional well-being; infant care and feeding; sexuality, contraception, and birth spacing; sleep and fatigue; physical recovery from birth; chronic disease management; and health maintenance. Women with chronic medical conditions such as hypertensive disorders, obesity, diabetes, thyroid disorders, renal disease, and mood disorders should be counseled regarding the importance of timely follow-up with their obstetrician-gynecologists or primary care providers for ongoing coordination of care. During the postpartum period, the woman and her obstetrician-gynecologist or other obstetric care provider should identify the health care provider who will assume primary responsibility for her ongoing care in her primary medical home. Optimizing care and support for postpartum families will require policy changes. Changes in the scope of postpartum care should be facilitated by reimbursement policies that support postpartum care as an ongoing process, rather than an isolated visit. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should be in the forefront of policy efforts to enable all women to recover from birth and nurture their infants. This Committee Opinion has been revised to reinforce the importance of the "fourth trimester" and to propose a new paradigm for postpartum care.

### Chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^115hYALz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is associated with increased rates of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes both acute and long term. These adverse outcomes are particularly seen in women with uncontrolled severe hypertension, in those with target organ damage, and in those who are noncompliant with prenatal visits. In addition, adverse outcomes are substantially increased in women who develop superimposed preeclampsia or abruptio placentae. Women with chronic hypertension should be evaluated either before conception or at time of first prenatal visit. Depending on this evaluation, they can be divided into categories of either "high risk" or "low risk" chronic hypertension. High-risk women should receive aggressive antihypertensive therapy and frequent evaluations of maternal and fetal well-being, and doctors should recommend lifestyle changes. In addition, these women are at increased risk for postpartum complications such as pulmonary edema, renal failure, and hypertensive encephalopathy for which they should receive aggressive control of blood pressure as well as close monitoring. In women with low-risk (essential uncomplicated) chronic hypertension, there is uncertainty regarding the benefits or risks of antihypertensive therapy. In my experience, the majority of these women will have good pregnancy outcomes without the use of antihypertensive medications. Antihypertensive agents are recommended and are widely used in these women despite absent evidence of either benefits or harm from this therapy. These recommendations are based on dogma and consensus rather than on scientific evidence. There is an urgent need to conduct randomized trials in women with mild chronic hypertension in pregnancy.

### Prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care: a systematic scoping review of clinical practice guidelines since 2011 [^113KrQjv]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Clinical practice guidelines for high priority conditions

Four guidelines published between 2015 and 2019 provide recommendations for the management of pre-existing diabetes (Table 2). All guidelines were published in high-income countries by governmental or medical associations, including two issued in the UK (NICE and Joint British Diabetes Societies), one from USA (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, ACOG), and one from Australia. A total of 283 recommendations were identified across all guidelines. Just under half of these related to interventions during the antenatal period (45%), followed by intrapartum (34%), and the postnatal (19%) period. Only three recommendations for health system interventions were identified, covering aspects of policy and the health workforce. The scope of recommendations for screening and clinical interventions were comprehensive, including types of tests and use of repeat tests, lifestyle advice/education, pharmacological therapy, glucose monitoring and glycemic targets, birth planning, referrals, and newborn care (Additional file 6: Table 2).

Chronic hypertension

We identified 10 guidelines published between 2014 and 2021 which provide recommendations for the management of chronic hypertension (Table 2). Only one guideline published by ACOG was specifically developed on chronic hypertension management in pregnancy, while remaining guidelines focused more broadly on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. All guidelines were issued by medical associations, predominantly from international (International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy) or high-income countries such as Australia/New Zealand [50 France, Canada, Poland, USA, Ireland, and Sweden. Two guidelines identified were from middle-income countries — China and Thailand. Across the 10 guidelines, we extracted 143 recommendations, which mostly related to antenatal (70%) and postnatal care (15%), and the remaining recommendations were for the intrapartum period and health systems interventions. The scope of recommendations provided guidance for definitions and threshold values for diagnosis, appropriate use of antihypertensive therapy, and blood pressure targets (Additional file 6: Table 3). Most recommendations, particularly during intrapartum and postnatal period, were sparse and not supported by more than two guidelines. Guidelines from middle-income countries (China and Thailand) were broadly similar in scope and interventions covered compared to HICs.

### Management of postpartum preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders (MOPP): postpartum tight vs standard blood pressure control [^116kcnpQ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This is one of the first studies to evaluate targeting a blood pressure of < 130/80 mm Hg during the postpartum period for patients diagnosed with chronic hypertension and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The patient population in this study was diverse in ethnic and racial makeup, primarily publicly insured, were, on average, obese, and were in their early thirties, which is reflective of the patients delivering nationwide. This large, multicenter study implemented a novel approach to treating blood pressure postpartum and showed a reduction in the primary outcome of postpartum emergency department visits for hypertension.

Although a propensity score analysis has methodologic rigor, several limitations are inherent to trials conducted in a nonrandomized fashion. In the retrospective cohort, the mean highest blood pressure during pregnancy was higher than in the prospective cohort, and there were fewer patients with superimposed preeclampsia. This may have been partially driven by the changes in prescribing antihypertensive medications during the antenatal period after the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy trial. During the retrospective cohort, the hospital systems transitioned to a new electronic medical record; thus, some data could not be ascertained. Since most of the retrospective cohort had scanned documents, the authors had to depend on billing codes to identify patients. Coders may have been less likely to code for gestational hypertension since there were many fewer patients identified with gestational hypertension in the retrospective cohort. While this study supports tight blood pressure control in the postpartum period, it is also unknown whether it is safe to implement a target of < 130/80 mm Hg without remote patient monitoring managed by a physician at all hours of the day. Emergency department visits were chosen as the primary outcome as a surrogate marker for maternal morbidity and mortality. Still, it is unknown if the intervention will decrease the burden of maternal morbidity and mortality.

### SMFM statement: benefit of antihypertensive therapy for mild-to-moderate chronic hypertension during pregnancy remains uncertain [^1174T5Bn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic hypertension is present in up to 5% of pregnant women and constitutes a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this document is to summarize the current recommendations regarding use of antihypertensive medications during pregnancy for women with mild-to-moderate chronic hypertension in the setting of the recently published Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS). The recently published CHIPS trial was a multicenter international randomized controlled trial comparing "less tight control" to "tight control" of blood pressure for pregnant women with hypertension. The most updated recommendations regarding management of pregnant women with hypertension are found from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy, which are endorsed by the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). SMFM recommends that clinicians continue to follow existing guidelines for management of pregnant women with mild-to-moderate chronic hypertension due to the fact that the benefits and risks of pharmacologic treatment for these women remain uncertain, and adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to address the less common but clinically significant nonsurrogate perinatal outcomes.

### Remote blood pressure management for postpartum hypertension: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^111hEkkf]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recognizing the importance of close follow-up after hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, many centers have initiated programs to support postpartum remote blood pressure management.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of remote blood pressure management to determine the scalability of these programmatic interventions.

Study Design

This was a cost-effectiveness analysis of using remote blood pressure management vs usual care to manage postpartum hypertension. The modeled remote blood pressure management included provision of a home blood pressure monitor, guidance on warning symptoms, instructions on blood pressure self-monitoring twice daily, and clinical staff to manage population-level blood pressures as appropriate. Usual care was defined as guidance on warning symptoms and recommendations for 1 outpatient visit for blood pressure monitoring within a week after discharge. This study designed a Markov model that ran over fourteen 1-day cycles to reflect the initial 2 weeks after delivery when most emergency department visits and readmissions occur and remote blood pressure management is clinically anticipated to be most impactful. Parameter values for the base-case scenario were derived from both internal data and literature review. Quality-adjusted life-years were calculated over the first year after delivery and reflected the short-term morbidities associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy that, for most birthing people, resolve by 2 weeks after delivery. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the strength and validity of the model. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which was defined as the cost needed to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year. The secondary outcome was incremental cost per readmission averted. Analyses were performed from a societal perspective.

Results

In the base-case scenario, remote blood pressure management was the dominant strategy (ie, cost less, higher quality-adjusted life-years). In univariate sensitivity analyses, the most cost-effective strategy shifted to usual care when the cost of readmission fell below $2987.92 and the rate of reported severe range blood pressure with a response in remote blood pressure management was < 1%. Assuming a willingness to pay of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, using remote blood pressure management was cost-effective in 99.28% of simulations in a Monte Carlo analysis. Using readmissions averted as a secondary effectiveness outcome, the incremental cost per readmission averted was $145.00.

Conclusion

Remote blood pressure management for postpartum hypertension is cost saving and has better outcomes than usual care. Our data can be used to inform future dissemination of and support funding for remote blood pressure management programs.

### Predictive modeling of postpartum blood pressure spikes [^116wL7Vw]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Management of these conditions can pose many clinical dilemmas and can be particularly challenging during the immediate postpartum period. Models for predicting and managing postpartum hypertension are necessary to help address this clinical challenge.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate predictive models of blood pressure spikes in the postpartum period and to investigate clinical management strategies to optimize care.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of postpartum women who participated in remote blood pressure monitoring. A postpartum blood pressure spike was defined as a blood pressure measurement of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg while on an antihypertensive medication and a blood pressure measurement of ≥ 150/100 mm Hg if not on an antihypertensive medication. We identified 3 risk level patient clusters (low, medium, and high) when predicting patient risk for a blood pressure spike on postpartum days 3 to 7. The variables used in defining these clusters were peak systolic blood pressure before discharge, body mass index, patient systolic blood pressure per trimester, heart rate, gestational age, maternal age, chronic hypertension, and gestational hypertension. For each risk cluster, we focused on 2 treatments, namely (1) postpartum length of stay (< 3 days or ≥ 3 days) and (2) discharge with or without blood pressure medications. We evaluated the effectiveness of the treatments in different subgroups of patients by estimating the conditional average treatment effect values in each cluster using a causal forest. Moreover, for all patients, we considered discharge with medication policies depending on different discharge blood pressure thresholds. We used a doubly robust policy evaluation method to compare the effectiveness of the policies.

Results

A total of 413 patients were included, and among those, 267 (64.6%) had a postpartum blood pressure spike. The treatments for patients at medium and high risk were considered beneficial. The 95% confidence intervals for constant marginal average treatment effect for antihypertensive use at discharge were -3.482 to 4.840 and - 5.539 to 4.315, respectively; and for a longer stay they were -5.544 to 3.866 and -7.200 to 4.302, respectively. For patients at low risk, the treatments were not critical in preventing a blood pressure spike with 95% confidence intervals for constant marginal average treatment effect of 1.074 to 15.784 and -2.913 to 9.021 for the different treatments. We considered the option to discharge patients with antihypertensive use at different blood pressure thresholds, namely (1) ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg, (2) ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or ≥ 90 mm Hg, (3) ≥ 150 mm Hg and/or ≥ 100 mm Hg, or (4) ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or ≥ 110 mm Hg. We found that policy (2) was the best option with P < .05.

Conclusion

We identified 3 possible strategies to prevent outpatient blood pressure spikes during the postpartum period, namely (1) medium- and high-risk patients should be considered for a longer postpartum hospital stay or should participate in daily home monitoring, (2) medium- and high-risk patients should be prescribed antihypertensives at discharge, and (3) antihypertensive treatment should be prescribed if patients are discharged with a blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg.

### Racial differences in postpartum blood pressure trajectories among women after a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy [^117KoCoc]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Within the context of small randomized clinical trials or research studies, text message–based postpartum hypertension monitoring programs have been shown to increase patient engagement and improve adherence with blood pressure follow-up. A previous study has demonstrated the feasibility of, high engagement with, retention in, and patient satisfaction with our remote monitoring program as well as improved adherence with postpartum visits. Given poor adherence to recommended follow-up in the postpartum period, the trajectory of a decrease in blood pressure post partum has not been well studied previously. This trajectory may be particularly important in consideration of rising maternal morbidity and mortality in the postpartum period. Furthermore, prior studies have shown lower adherence to recommended follow-up among Black women and women of lower socioeconomic status.

The American Heart Association and ACOG have identified hypertensive disorders of pregnancy as risk factors for later-life cardiovascular disease; however, effective evidence-based interventions have not yet been adequately studied or implemented, to our knowledge. Prior studies have shown that postpartum care after a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is often fragmented, without a systematic transition from the obstetrician to an internist or cardiologist. Given the fragmented care and poor attendance rates, our findings raise the question of whether universal home blood pressure monitoring and management with antihypertensive therapy for women with persistent hypertension beyond the first 6 weeks post partum may be warranted. This is particularly important given the proportion of women in our cohort with ongoing hypertension at 6 weeks post partum and our finding that Black women with a hypertensive disorder ended the program with systolic blood pressures 9 mm Hg higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures 5 mm Hg higher than White women. More important, there were no differences by race in prenatal blood pressure and our findings suggest that a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy may have an adverse association with blood pressure. We cannot assess from our findings whether this persistent postpartum hypertension represents new-onset chronic hypertension or the ongoing resolution of the hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. For women with public health insurance, in many states within the United States, Medicaid coverage lasts only through 60 days post partum. Most maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period, with approximately one-third occurring after 6 weeks post partum.

### Impact of antihypertensive treatment on maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancy complicated by chronic hypertension: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pSdE7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

The study protocol for this systematic review was developed in line with the PRISMA‐P statement 25 and registered on the PROSPERO database (reference number CRD42015020733). No ethical approval was required.

Literature Search

A comprehensive literature review using Medline (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), and the Cochrane Trials Register from their earliest entries until the November 30, 2016 was performed. Search strategies were adapted to each database. Searches of exploded MeSH terms "pregnancy", "hypertension", and "antihypertensive" (Embase) or "cardiovascular agent" (Medline) were performed individually and then combined in each database. For Medline and Embase searches, a search filter for randomized controlled trials was then applied as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 26 Relevant unpublished data were sought by searching for trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov and ISRCTN and reviewing thesis titles from the World Cat dissertations and theses database. References of retrieved studies and relevant review articles were also searched using the snowballing approach. No language restrictions were applied. The study protocol (including the literature search strategy) is detailed in Data S1.

Study Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials of pregnant women with chronic hypertension comparing an antihypertensive agent with another treatment arm as long‐term antepartum management were included. No blood pressure cutoffs were utilized in the eligibility criteria for inclusion, but studies examining acute treatment of severe hypertension via intravenous/fast‐acting routes were excluded. Comparisons with other antihypertensive drug(s), placebo, no treatment, or an alternative such as bed rest were eligible for inclusion. Studies that included participants with gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension were only eligible for inclusion if the data for the women with chronic hypertension were reported separately to allow fair comparison. Studies that compared management strategies only but did not include a randomized comparison of drug treatments were not eligible for inclusion. Trials that did not report any of the predefined outcomes were excluded. Trials that did not include sufficient information on the outcomes (eg, standard deviations) could not be included in the meta‐analysis. No other restrictions were applied to the study search.

Conclusions

Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of severe hypertension in pregnant women with chronic hypertension. A considerable paucity of data exists from randomized controlled trials to guide choice of antihypertensive agent for chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Adequately powered head‐to‐head randomized controlled trials of the commonly used antihypertensive agents are required to inform prescribing.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension and pregnancy — management directives with classes of recommendation (COR) and levels of evidence (LOE) are as follows: For individuals with hypertension who are planning a pregnancy or who become pregnant, labetalol and extended-release nifedipine are preferred agents to treat hypertension and minimize fetal risk (COR 1, LOE A). Individuals with hypertension who are planning a pregnancy or who become pregnant should be counseled about the benefits of low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin to reduce the risk of preeclampsia (COR 1, LOE B-R). Pregnant individuals with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg, confirmed on repeat measurement within 15 minutes, should receive antihypertensive medication to lower blood pressure to < 160/ < 110 mm Hg within 30 to 60 minutes to prevent adverse events (COR 1, LOE B-R). Pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension should receive antihypertensive therapy to achieve blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg to prevent maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality (COR 1, LOE B-R). For context, chronic hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a preexisting diagnosis of hypertension or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart before 20 weeks' gestation.

### Feasibility of virtual blood pressure monitoring titrated to ACC / AHA thresholds among outpatients with postpartum hypertension [^112HsDmU]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of postpartum readmission, morbidity, and mortality. There is significant interest in blood pressure (BP) home monitoring for outpatient postpartum hypertension management, but optimal frequency, duration, and BP targets have not been established. In this pilot study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of postpartum BP titration to a target systolic BP (SBP) < 130 mm Hg based on the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for nonpregnant patients.

Sixty-two postpartum English and Spanish-speaking patients who delivered at Massachusetts General Hospital between February and May of 2021 with a diagnosis of chronic hypertension (cHTN), gestational hypertension (gHTN), or preeclampsia according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) criteria were recruited at labor hospitalization. Participants who did not own BP cuffs were provided with an automatic cuff and were educated on BP self-measurement at the time of study enrollment. Patients were also provided educational videos on how to measure BP in addition to education on hypertension and HDP that could be accessed at any time. After discharge, they reported self-measured BPs and received daily feedback, including medication initiation/titration according to a study algorithm that targeted a BP < 130/80 mm Hg by 6 weeks postpartum. If diastolic BP remained > 80 mm Hg after SBP control, patients were monitored more closely, and a single medication dose increase was made for isolated diastolic hypertension if it persisted after a week of SBP control. When pharmacotherapy was indicated, nifedipine XL was used first-line, followed by labetalol and enalapril. After 5 consecutive days of BP stability, monitoring frequency was reduced to weekly. BP ≥ 160/ ≥ 100 mm Hg or symptomatic hypotension triggered urgent clinical evaluation. Patients enrolled in the study continued to receive standard of care from their obstetrician as per ACOG guidelines. The primary outcome was postpartum hospital readmission within 6 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcomes were 6-week postpartum BP and frequency of medication titration. Feasibility was assessed through study retention and participant surveys. Where referenced, historical data were obtained from an observational cohort of 79 HDP patients (January-February 2020).

### Hypertensive pregnancy disorder, an under-recognized women specific risk factor for heart failure? [^111tjLFL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Early postpartum management

Patients with preeclampsia should not be candidates for discharge until BP has stabilized. Subsequent follow‐up should occur no later than 7–10 days post‐delivery. ACOG recommends frequent monitoring of BP postpartum. Treatment with furosemide for 5 days has been shown to speed resolution of postpartum hypertension. ACOG suggests initiation of antihypertension therapy for BP ≥ 150/100 mmHg on two occasions at least 4–6 h apart. However, in a retrospective analysis, therapy initiation at lower threshold of ≥ 140/90 mmHg would reduce postpartum admissions. A significant proportion of patients develop preeclampsia postpartum. Many will not have a history of antepartum preeclampsia and may not demonstrate classic features such as oedema, proteinuria or hyperreflexia underlining the importance of a high index of suspicion.

Lactation has favourable effects on cardiometabolic profiles resulting in lower fasting blood glucose, improved lipid profiles, insulin resistance and BP. In the CARDIA study, longer duration of breastfeeding in women 18–30 years old was associated with higher high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower rates of type 2 diabetes and lower risk of hypertension or early atherosclerosis. In the Black Women's Health Study longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with less hypertension in middle age (40–49 years), but not at older age.

### Patterns of postpartum ambulatory care follow-up care among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^114JxtcV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a common medical complication of pregnancy that affects > 10% of all pregnancies. 1 Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, are important contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality. In the immediate postpartum period, hypertensive disorders confer a greater risk of hypertensive crisis and stroke. 2, 3, 4 In the year after delivery, women with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are at 12‐ to 25‐fold greater risk of developing chronic hypertension and remain at greater risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure later in life, especially among women with severe preterm preeclampsia. 5, 6, 7, 8

The American Heart Association (AHA) recognizes HDP as a major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in women, and the 2019 AHA and American College of Cardiology Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease identifies preeclampsia as a risk‐enhancing factor. 9, 10, 11 Pregnancy serves as a natural "stress test" to identify at‐risk women who may benefit from risk‐factor screening and lifestyle counseling earlier in life. 10, 11 Nevertheless, most women are unaware of the association between HDP and future cardiovascular risk, which represents an unmet need for education and primary prevention. 12, 13 Increasing attention has been given to the "fourth trimester", the 3 months after delivery, during which time there is a high need for coordinated health care, including cardiovascular prevention efforts, to prevent future maternal complications and to improve long‐term cardiovascular health. 14, 15

The postpartum obstetric care visit, historically scheduled within 6 weeks of delivery, is currently recommended to occur within 3 weeks of delivery for all women with the transition to well‐woman care occurring within 12 weeks postpartum. 14 This visit represents an opportunity to provide cardiovascular preventive care and to transition to a primary care provider for ongoing follow‐up. Despite this, ≈40% of women do not attend the recommended postpartum visit. 1, 14 The transition to primary care has been shown to be suboptimal in selected populations, ranging from 13% among a nationwide sample of women with gestational diabetes mellitus to 50% among women with commercial insurance living in Maryland. 16, 17 Rates of primary care follow‐up among women with hypertensive disorders, who may particularly benefit from cardiovascular preventive care, have not been well studied in a nationally representative population.

### Hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and postpartum period [^115JrM47]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects 10% of pregnancies, many with underlying chronic hypertension, and approximately 1–2% will undergo a hypertensive crisis at some point during their lives. Hypertensive crisis includes hypertensive urgency and emergency; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes a hypertensive emergency in pregnancy as persistent (lasting 15 min or more), acute-onset, severe hypertension, defined as systolic BP greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Pregnancy may be complicated by hypertensive crisis, with lower blood pressure threshold for end-organ damage than non-pregnant patients. Maternal assessment should include a thorough history. Fetal assessment should include heart rate tracing, ultrasound for growth and amniotic assessment, and Doppler evaluation if growth restriction is suspected. Initial management of hypertensive emergency (systolic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) generally includes the rapid reduction of blood pressure through the use of intravenous antihypertensive medications, with goal systolic blood pressure between 140 mmHg and 150 mmHg and diastolic pressure between 90 mmHg and 100 mmHg. First-line intravenous drugs include labetalol and hydralazine, but other agents may be used, including esmolol, nicardipine, nifedipine, and, as a last resort, sodium nitroprusside. Among patients with hypertensive urgency, slower blood pressure reduction can be provided with oral agents. The objective of this article is to review the current understanding, diagnosis, and management of hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

### Remote monitoring compared with in-office surveillance of blood pressure in patients with pregnancy-related hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^113GKj8X]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is increasing, and they complicate up to 8% of pregnancies. These disorders are associated with long-term cardiovascular disease and are the leading cause of postpartum readmission. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy contribute to 7.1% of all maternal deaths in the United States. Postpartum stroke is the leading cause of mortality related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is at its maximum risk within 10 days of discharge after delivery. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), therefore, recommends that patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy present for a blood pressure check within 7–10 days postpartum, which is traditionally performed in-person at the office where patients received obstetric care. Despite this recommendation, it has been estimated that up to 70% of patients do not present for follow-up.

Telehealth is a promising intervention that has been shown to improve patient satisfaction without compromising the patient–physician relationship. Evidence suggests remote blood pressure monitoring may be a feasible, cost-effective strategy for managing postpartum hypertension. We tested the hypothesis that remote blood pressure monitoring would increase the rates at which postpartum patients would record their blood pressure shortly after hospital discharge.

### Management of postpartum preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders (MOPP): postpartum tight vs standard blood pressure control [^115YnBnS]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a growing body of evidence that lower blood pressure improves cardiovascular health. A meta-analysis of nearly one million patients showed that reducing systolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 5 mm Hg reduced coronary heart disease by 22% and 41%, respectively. In addition to lowering blood pressure, the study intervention also lowered mean arterial blood pressure, which, in some studies, is an even stronger predictor of cardiovascular health. AHA guidelines currently recommend treating blood pressure to a target of < 130/80 mm Hg since numerous studies have shown that this target lowers the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular-related death. Outside of pregnancy, even a modest decrease in blood pressure can substantially reduce cardiovascular disease. In one of the most extensive studies of postpartum remote patient monitoring, Kitt et alshowed a 6.5 mm Hg systolic and 5.8 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure at 9 months postpartum with self-titration of antihypertensive medication to a blood pressure goal of < 150/100 mm Hg. In addition, there was a decrease in left ventricular mass index in those who had self-titrated medication. A follow-up of this study also showed a reduction in cardiac remodeling, which is thought to be associated with better cardiovascular outcomes. On average, these patients only took antihypertensive medications for 40 days, so even a short course of antihypertensive medication in the immediate postpartum period has longstanding cardioprotective effects. There could be additional benefits if this trial were repeated with a lower blood pressure target, such as with the Management of Postpartum Preeclampsia and Hypertensive Disorders protocol.

### Management of postpartum preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders (MOPP): postpartum tight vs standard blood pressure control [^112kHjKb]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia, are strong risk factors for cardiovascular disease along the life course. It is plausible that reducing blood pressure through titrated medication and dosage would mitigate these cardiovascular disease risks. We hypothesized that persons with high blood pressure with an activated medication titration regimen would have reduced emergency department visits. We tested this hypothesis in a large cohort of postpartum persons using a tight blood pressure control algorithm (goal blood pressure < 130/80 mm Hg) and remote blood pressure to reduce postpartum emergency department visits for hypertensive disorders.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^11658U3z]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.10.2

We recommend women with CKD have a planned early postpartum renal review (1D).

Rationale

There are no published data to guide post-partum surveillance on women with CKD. Whilst guidelines for the management of CKD do not require follow up secondary care for all patients, every woman with suspected kidney disease (acute or chronic) newly identified in pregnancy and all those with known CKD should have a clear plan in place for appropriate postpartum follow up. Timing of postpartum follow-up should be determined by the MDT, guided by the level of and change in renal function, the aetiology of CKD, blood pressure, and the need for post-partum therapeutic drug monitoring. For women who are thought to have previously undiagnosed CKD in pregnancy, post-partum renal review should be arranged in order to facilitate diagnosis. This may not have been possible in pregnancy if a biopsy was not done, or due to difficulties interpreting renal function in the context of gestational change or in the face of superimposed preeclampsia. Appropriate treatment should be advised and a pathway for long-term care made clear both to the patient and her primary care physician. The key is to avoid women being lost to follow-up and presenting years later with what might have been avoidable, progressive kidney disease.

Guideline 4.10.3

We recommend that women with CKD are prescribed medications that are compatible with breastfeeding whenever possible (1D).

Rationale

Women with CKD should be supported in their wish to breastfeed and be prescribed medications which are considered safe in lactation (see section 2). Currently, breastfeeding is not advised for infants of mothers taking mycophenolate mofetil as there are no data to confirm safety. If mycophenolate mofetil is deemed to be the only therapeutic option, then breastfeeding should be avoided.

Guideline 4.10.4

We recommend that women with CKD are offered safe and effective contraception post-partum and receive updated pre-pregnancy counselling before future pregnancies (1D).

Rationale

The provision of information and a choice regarding contraceptive method within seven days of delivery has been set as a quality standard in the UK, addressing a priority area for quality improvement in health and social care. Safe and effective methods of contraception in women with CKD are detailed in section 3.1.3.

Events during pregnancy including obstetric complications, the development of superimposed pre-eclampsia, and a decline in maternal renal function will inform future obstetric risk, necessitating the need for new pre-pregnancy counselling to ensure informed decision-making regarding future pregnancy.

### Patterns of antihypertensive medication use in the first 2 years post partum [^112WyTk4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Tight blood pressure control in the immediate postpartum period produces lasting reductions in blood pressure, potentially reducing the risk of long-term cardiovascular disease among women who had HDPs by more than 30%. However, among women with HDPs in our cohort who initiated use of antihypertensive medication post partum, up to one-fourth did so more than 3 months after delivery, suggesting that a considerable proportion of these women may have unrecognized or untreated hypertension in the immediate postpartum period. A delay in recognition and effective management might explain why women who had HDPs exhibited marked increases in initiation of antihypertensive therapies more than 18 months post partum, compared with women without HDPs.

The problem of unrecognized and undertreated hypertension among postpartum women is unlikely to be specific to Denmark and may be even more pronounced in settings without free universal health care. Moreover, women with GH typically receive less postpartum attention than women with preeclampsia, although our results suggest that the former were more likely to require additional antihypertensive medication after an initial postpartum prescription. The natural history of postpartum blood pressure after HDPs is poorly studied, but 1 small study showed that 50% of women who had preeclampsia still had hypertension 6 to 12 weeks post partum, both overall and among women still receiving treatment. The lack of robust data does not detract from the importance of early diagnosis and effective management of persistent postpartum hypertension as a strategy to reduce long-term cardiovascular disease among these women. In fact, the benefits of postpartum clinics offering standardized care to women at greatest risk of long-term adverse outcomes after pregnancies complicated by HDPs are currently being evaluated. Future research should evaluate the clinical efficacy of systematic postpartum blood pressure monitoring and early management of postpartum hypertension in preventing diagnostic delays, decreasing the burden of chronic hypertension, and improving cardiovascular disease prevention among women after HDPs.

Choice of Antihypertensive Medication

Overall, women who had HDPs were most frequently first prescribed β-blocking agents post partum, possibly because they simply continued with the medication they used antenatally, when β-blockers are often used. However, consistent with recent recommendations that renin-angiotensin system blockers be the first-line postpartum antihypertensive treatment in women who had HDPs (except in women of African or Caribbean origin, among whom calcium channel blockers are the preferred first-line agents), we observed a shift toward renin-angiotensin system blocker use later in the study period among these women. In contrast, women with neither an HDP diagnosis nor antenatal antihypertensive medication use were primarily prescribed diuretics post partum.

### Feasibility of postpartum blood pressure monitoring for hypertensive disorders in a low-resource setting [^115shEY4]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality globally, and Nigeria has the highest burden of maternal deaths worldwide. Approximately 10% of all pregnancies are affected by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) which include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet levels (HELLP) syndrome, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. Approximately 32% of maternal deaths in Nigeria are due to HDP. Most deaths are preventable with timely implementation of evidence-based strategies.

Most maternal deaths also occur postpartum, a crucial transition phase for maternal care as it shifts from obstetricians to primary care providers and other specialists. This postpartum period, often referred to as the 4th trimester, is a critical time for monitoring and treating women at the highest risk of CV complications including cardiomyopathy, stroke, and eclampsia. Enhanced risk stratification, early detection, and comprehensive CV treatment during this postpartum period could reduce these complications. Postpartum women have significant fluctuations in blood pressure (BP) in the weeks following delivery, with peak systolic BP occurring at a median of 8 (IQR: 5–15) days postpartum, when patients are home and often unmonitored. These BP spikes are associated with hypertensive crises and increased risk of stroke and heart failure.

In 2018, the American College of Obstetricians' Presidential Taskforce on Redefining Postpartum Care released recommendations for postpartum care, including the management of HDP. These recommendations emphasized the importance of evaluating BP within specific timeframes after childbirth. Patients with severe hypertension should have their BP evaluated within 72 hours, while those with nonsevere hypertension should have it assessed no later than 7 to 10 days postpartum. Postpartum home BP-monitoring program is an effective strategy to adhere to this recommendation and have been increasingly implemented in high-income countries. However, in low- and middle-income countries like Nigeria, home BP monitoring among patients with HDP is limited. A 2021 nationwide study examining adherence to postpartum recommendations in 366 women with HDP in tertiary hospitals in Nigeria showed that only 37% of women had a BP check within 3 to 5 days, highlighting a significant gap in utilizing postpartum BP monitoring and treatment.

### Self-measured blood pressure telemonitoring programs: a pragmatic how-to guide [^111RTP7p]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

PLANNING AN SMBP TELEMONITORING PROGRAM

When starting an SMBP telemonitoring program, it is helpful to define program scope and desired reach, how eligible patients will be identified, staffing requirements and roles, and training needs. This informs development of protocols that integrate program-generated clinical decisions into care processes and workflows, which subsequently optimizes ability to improve BP control. The National Association of Community Health Centers, through their work with Million Hearts, has developed the Self-Measured BP Monitoring (SMBP) Implementation Toolkit that provides a template for identifying resources required for an SMBP telemonitoring protocol (Tables 2 and 3).

Program scope

Program scope may vary according to resource availability, but a comprehensive program that includes hypertension diagnosis and management is ideal. Examples of program scope objectives include:

Improving timely and accurate hypertension diagnosis, including ruling out white coat and masked hypertension.
Titrating medications in diagnosed patients.
Managing chronic or gestational hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women.
Focusing on high-risk patients (e.g. BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg, existing cardiovascular disease, or multiple cardiovascular risk factors).
Engaging patients who have medication adherence barriers.
Enhancing services for existing chronic disease programs/populations.
Engaging patients who are better served out of the clinic.
Improving engagement of patients with chronic conditions.

Identifying eligible patients

Once the SMBP telemonitoring program scope has been identified, it is helpful to characterize the eligible patient population because this provides insights into patient profiles/volumes and facilitates proper program resourcing and staffing. Prioritizing high-risk or underserviced subgroups may be desirable to maximize impact. For example, a program may focus on patients with a systolic BP of ≥ 160 mm Hg, those with no recorded BP in the last year, or those who are untreated or under-treated. A report can be created to monitor progress using electronic health record (EHR) registry functionality or population health management software (Table 4).

### Short-term postpartum blood pressure self-management and long-term blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial [^117DUTJP]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Up to 10% of pregnancies are affected by new-onset hypertension, and women who have had a hypertensive pregnancy are at substantially increased risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease in later life. This study shows short-term self-management of BP, designed to optimize BP control immediately after hypertensive pregnancies, appears to reset BP levels over longer time periods. High BP is the leading risk factor for loss of disability-adjusted life-years in high- and low- to middle-income countries and short, targeted postpartum interventions could offer a clinically translatable approach to improve BP outcomes for women within this population. Self-management of BP has been shown to be cost-effective in other clinical scenariosand due to its patient acceptability and ease of use in remote health care, has been proposed in recent national guidancefor provision of postpartum care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our research provides a supportive evidence base that this step change in postpartum practice might also have longer term benefits for reducing cardiovascular disease burden within the population.

Conclusions

This study has shown in a randomized trial that it is possible to lower BP for at least 3 to 4 years postpartum by ensuring tighter BP control during the postpartum period while women require treatment. The findings support the hypothesis developed from prior observational work by our group that a failure to control BP postpartum leads to an accelerated trajectory toward hypertension over subsequent years, possibly due to failure to reverse the adaptive cardiovascular remodeling induced by a hypertensive pregnancy. Critically, this study highlights that there may be a window postpartum where a relatively affordable and clinically translatable process of home BP self-management can impact long-term BP trajectory for women after a hypertensive pregnancy and reduce the later burden of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.

Central Illustration
Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: Innovative Management Strategies

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may be best addressed with a tripartite strategy using self-monitoring, technology-driven personalized medicine, and community health worker outreach to decrease adverse effects of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) in the antepartum and postpartum periods.

Combined interdisciplinary approach for patients with HDP has been found effective. Interventions might include education for both providers discharging patients with HDP and patients with a diagnosis of HDP (by nurse educators or CHWs), the provision of free BP monitors to all patients with HDP, scheduling of postpartum appointments prior to discharge, creation of a dedicated postpartum hypertension clinic, development of workflows and algorithms for those with HDP who present to the emergency department for evaluation, and potential readmission and development of workflows and algorithms for management of medication during the postpartum period. Implementation of this workflow and interventions can be associated with an increase in adherence to postpartum visit for follow-up for HDP.

### Postpartum primary care engagement using default scheduling and tailored messaging: a randomized clinical trial [^1123do9v]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Although the chronic disease burden in pregnancy is high and increasing in the US, most people with chronic conditions do not successfully transition to primary care management following delivery. More than 30% of pregnant people have diabetes, hypertension, or obesity, and 11% to 22% have anxiety or depression. Furthermore, common pregnancy-related conditions (eg, gestational diabetes and pregnancy-related hypertension), which combined affect nearly 20% of pregnancies, confer an increased risk of developing chronic disease. Strong evidence underpins the benefits of managing chronic conditions through primary care and of managing these conditions earlier in life. However, while pregnant people with these conditions are often carefully monitored during pregnancy, many receive no routine care after their pregnancy, and nearly half of those with chronic conditions do not see their primary care practitioner (PCP) at all in the postpartum year. The abrupt drop off from high health system engagement and motivation during pregnancy to limited or no health care encounters post partum has been termed a postpartum cliff. Low rates of postpartum primary care engagement reflect a missed opportunity to improve the prevention and management of chronic disease.

Postpartum transitions from obstetric to primary care are encouraged by guidelines yet stymied by numerous barriers. Specifically, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologyrecommends that all individuals have a comprehensive postpartum visit within 12 weeks of their delivery; at that time, obstetric care clinicians typically counsel patients on the importance of ongoing primary care follow-up. Yet, a range of systemic, financial, and behavioral barriers often prevents postpartum people from successfully transitioning to primary care. Patient administrative burden (eg, appointment scheduling, information seeking, and insurance/billing issues) is increasingly recognized as a barrier to accessing care. In a 2021 survey, 33% of patients reported that they delayed or did not seek health care because of the administrative burden. The results of this burden may be amplified in the postpartum period when new parents are sleep deprived and face many competing demands, including caring for their newborn and family. This study aimed to increase patient engagement in primary care after the immediate postpartum period for pregnant individuals with conditions that convey a long-term health risk by reducing administrative burden and motivating continued health activation through an intervention based on insights from behavioral economics.

### Cardio-obstetrics: moving beyond programming to action [^111sxNPE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS IN CLINICAL CARE

The window of patient care should be extended from preconception through at least 1 year postpartum. Preconception care should include an assessment of maternal mortality and morbidity risk. Given the current environment, it is important to assist patients with cardiovascular disease in preventing pregnancy through shared decision making, as many do not understand the risk to their cardiovascular health. The patient should be aware that prolonged hospitalization may be necessary for closer monitoring during pregnancy. A discussion of how to reduce maternal and fetal risk must include a comprehensive medication review as most medications are safe in pregnancy and lactation. Appropriate patient education can reduce the risk that the patient will stop medications that are vital to their care at the beginning of pregnancy. Identification of medications that may cause fetal harm allows for acceptable substitutions before pregnancy. A discussion of the risk of inheritance and other forms of cardiac disease is critical. Screening for cardiovascular disease in pregnancy is essential as many patients with cardiovascular disease in pregnancy may not be diagnosed. A quality screening algorithm has been proposed by the California Maternal Care Quality Collaborative. It has been endorsed by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynocologists (ACOG). Members of the cardio‐obstetric team should be aware of obstetric levels of care to ensure delivery at an appropriate center. Improvements in postpartum management and follow‐up should be achieved. Because many patients with cardiovascular risk factors are not identified until after delivery, the development of mechanisms for postpartum follow‐up with the cardio‐obstetrics team is important. It is recommended that all birthing people have contact with a provider within the first 3 weeks postpartum and patients at risk follow up within the first week. Patients with a history of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension often need blood pressure medication adjustments for several weeks after delivery. Many will need continued medical management as their hypertension will not resolve after delivery. Lack of attention to these issues will subsequently increase cardiovascular complications.

### Implementation of a cell-enabled remote blood pressure monitoring program during the postpartum period at a safety-net hospital [^112pFgQr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The potential benefits of RBPM programs may be amplified in a safety‐net hospital population that historically has fewer health care contacts after delivery, and where postpartum patients would benefit from alternative layers of surveillance. Data show that the proportion of cardiovascular‐related maternal morbidity and mortality increases in the postpartum period. Although there are currently no data on the impact of RBPM on severe maternal morbidity and mortality, with hypertension serving as an indicator of cardiovascular morbidity, potentially earlier intervention based on data obtained through BP monitoring could mitigate future cardiovascular events. One trial reported reductions in diastolic BP up to 4 years after postpartum RBPM. Furthermore, longer durations of postpartum RBPM, such as the 6‐week program, provide detailed BP surveillance beyond the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendation, allowing for the identification of chronic disease in many of our patients. Indeed, our data showed that 32.6% of patients in the RBPM program recorded at least BP measurements of ≥ 140/or > 90 mm Hg after 2‐weeks postpartum. These data are similar to estimates published by Palatnik et al, suggesting there is a large proportion of the birthing population that deserves medication management more urgently outside the cadence of recommendations for a cardiovascular assessment at 3 months postpartum. Of note, when the updated recommendations from American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology were published in 2022, we modified our postpartum protocols to start or titrate antihypertensive medication for 2 or more BP measures over 140/90 mm Hg. This analysis does not reflect that adjustment. Additionally, our data set lacked information on medication prescribed to manage postpartum hypertension, which should be integrated into future analyses.

### Chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^115QFfcs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease are among the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death in the United States. Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is associated with a host of adverse outcomes that include preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, cerebrovascular accidents, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and maternal and perinatal death. There are several key issues related to the diagnosis and management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy where data are limited and further research is needed. These challenges and recent guidelines for the management of chronic hypertension are reviewed. Well-timed pregnancies are of utmost importance to reduce the risks of chronic hypertension; long-acting reversible contraceptive options are preferred. Research to determine optimal blood pressure thresholds for diagnosis and treatment to optimize short- and long-term maternal and perinatal outcomes should be prioritized along with interventions to reduce extant racial and ethnic disparities.

### Patterns of postpartum ambulatory care follow-up care among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^111ijq5Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Among postpartum women with commercial insurance, only 58% of women with HDP followed up with a continuity care provider within 6 months of delivery. Up to 350 000 women in the United States are diagnosed with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension every year. 21 If our results are generalized to the broader US population, an estimated 147 000 women will lack postpartum follow‐up in the 6 months after delivery. By 12 months postpartum, 1 in 4 affected women will still not have followed up with a continuity care provider, including primary care, obstetrics, or family medicine. These low follow‐up rates highlight a substantial missed opportunity to provide counseling, screening, and treatment to women who are at increased risk of developing short‐ and long‐term cardiovascular sequelae.

Women with HDP have 12‐ to 25‐fold higher risk of being diagnosed with chronic hypertension in the year after delivery and 2‐fold increased lifetime risk of heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular death compared with women with normotensive pregnancies. 5, 7, 8, 22 Up to 77% of the excess cardiovascular risk associated with HDP may be explained by modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity, that are amenable to early treatment. 23 The potential benefit of postpartum primary care follow‐up is multifactorial and includes the opportunity to provide blood pressure, lipid, and diabetes mellitus screening; to manage hypertension; and to reinforce the importance of healthy lifestyle changes to improve interconception and future cardiovascular health, as recommended by the AHA and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 15 In addition to longer term cardiovascular health benefits, postpartum blood pressure control and weight loss can reduce the risk of developing recurrent preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies. 9, 24, 25

### Characterizing longitudinal blood pressure trajectories in patients at high risk for de novo postpartum hypertension: a randomized controlled trial secondary analysis [^1157gzvj]. Pregnancy (2025). Medium credibility.

5 | CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into postpartum blood pressure trends, revealing prolonged elevation patterns among patients at risk for dnPPHTN. In contrast to historical data in low-risk normotensive individuals, which suggests a peak around 4–6 days postpartum, our findings indicate that BP may continue to rise well into the second week after delivery. Thus, extending blood pressure surveillance in the immediate postpartum period beyond existing guidelines and the current standard of care may be important for a risk-selected cohort of previously normotensive patients. Our findings also suggest greater variability in postpartum BP trajectories than previously recognized, highlighting the need to better characterize diverse postpartum BP phenotypes — beyond those with antenatal hypertension — to optimize risk stratification and intervention timing. Furthermore, we defined distinct trends that may distinguish physiologic from pathophysiologic blood pressure changes in patients at risk for dnPPHTN prior to the occurrence of disease. Real-time monitoring could be used to identify these early 'signals' that foreshadow dnPPHTN, providing opportunities for more personalized postpartum care, timely identification of hypertension, and interventions to prevent severe morbidity.

### Report from a text-based blood pressure monitoring prospective cohort trial among postpartum women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^116SQzpU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pregnancy-related mortality rates in the United States (US) have increased each year since the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System was implemented in 1987. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) complicate 5–10% of pregnancies and are a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. It is crucial to recognize that approximately 60% of maternal deaths in the US occur in the postpartum period, with up to 65.8%of these deaths believed to be preventable. In this report, a maternal death was considered to be preventable if there was at least some chance of avoiding such outcome by a change to patient, community, provider, facility, and/or system factors. These studies and others have led to an increased awareness of the importance of the postpartum period.

Recognizing the significant risk of morbidity in the early postpartum period especially among pregnancies complicated by HDP, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends early postpartum blood pressure evaluation. This further complicates management of women diagnosed with a HDP as they need more frequent visits and heightened surveillance in the postpartum period. A secondary analysis of 115,502 women in 25 US hospitals over 3 years attributed hypertensive complications to 20.5% of cases of severe maternal morbidity. Despite the efforts to mitigate the rising rates of maternal mortality in the US, there are still no standardized guidelines specifically addressing the optimal management of pregnancies complicated by HDP in the postpartum period. This leaves a large percentage of women vulnerable at a critical time, while also leaving healthcare providers with no clear guidance regarding their medical management.

### Impact of the new American hypertension guidelines on the prevalence of postpartum hypertension [^1111cLKD]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability among women, with more than half occurring in individuals with hypertension. New blood pressure criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recognize that there is no specific blood pressure threshold that is associated with vascular disease. We performed a secondary analysis of two published postpartum databases (the Pre-Eclampsia New Emerging Team [PE-NET] cohort and the Maternal Health Clinic [MHC] cohort) to determine the impact of the change in blood pressure criteria on the diagnosis of hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension in women with uncomplicated pregnancies (PE-NET control) was 22% compared with 56.4% in those who have had a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia (PE, PE-NET patient) and 67.2% in those referred to the MHC due to a pregnancy complicated by any of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. It is well established that certain complications in pregnancy can reliably identify women with risk factors for future CVD. Thus, pregnancy and the postpartum afford a new opportunity for cardiovascular risk screening that could lead to lifestyle modification and therapeutic intervention. Applying the new guideline criteria at least doubles the prevalence of women with hypertension postpartum.

### Racial differences in postpartum blood pressure trajectories among women after a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy [^1152UTCK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent evidence suggests that maternal morbidity and mortality are increasing in the United States, most of which occur in the 6 weeks after delivery, referred to as the "fourth trimester". The cause of this increase is likely multifactorial, associated with advancing maternal age and medical comorbidities as well as the concomitant limitations of the health care system. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondemonstrate that Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die in childbirth compared with women of other races/ethnicities, a finding that persists across socioeconomic strata and is thought to be associated with social determinants of health as well as implicit and explicit biases within the health care system, resulting in inequitable treatment.

Hypertension complicates 10% to 20% of pregnancies in the United States and is significantly associated with maternal morbidity and mortality in the postpartum period. Black women are at increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are more frequently associated with morbidity and mortality among Black women compared with White women. These differences are particularly notable in the postpartum period. Despite this finding, prior studies and clinical management guidelines focus overwhelmingly on antepartum and intrapartum management, with relatively little emphasis placed on postpartum management. One reason for the lack of management guidelines is our limited understanding of the postpartum blood pressure trajectory after delivery and hospital discharge. At present in the United States, women are typically discharged from the hospital on postpartum days 2 to 4 and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a single blood pressure check between 3 and 10 days post partum for women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Women with persistent hypertension or the need for titration of antihypertensive medications are typically seen more frequently in the postpartum period for medication management; however, as there are no clear guidelines on optimal blood pressure management in this period, this varies by clinician and institution. Subsequently, women are typically seen at 4 to 6 weeks post partum for a comprehensive postpartum visit and referred to their primary care physician if there are additional needs for antihypertensive medication management. This strategy is limited by poor adherence to follow-up, with prior studies showing visit attendance rates of 45% to 60% in this period.

Meanings of study and implications for physicians and health providers

The most recent UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health identified chronic disease as an underlying factor in preventable maternal deaths. Consequently, the first recommendation stated that "Pre-pregnancy counselling services. for women with pre-existing medical illnesses. are a key part of maternity services", supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's guidelines for the management of hypertension in pregnancy. Furthermore, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recent practice bulletin recommends that women with chronic hypertension "should be evaluated before conception to ascertain possible end-organ involvement". Systematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide data more readily inferable to the individual, but no large aggregate analysis of pregnancy outcome in women with chronic hypertension has previously been reported. This meta-analysis of outcomes can be used before pregnancy and antenatally by healthcare professionals (including those not providing direct maternity care) advising women with chronic hypertension regarding possible adverse pregnancy events.

Postpartum transition to primary care and care coordination — Individuals with uncomplicated medical histories, deliveries, and postpartum courses will generally transition to ongoing routine care with their primary care provider following the comprehensive postpartum visit with their obstetric provider, and this transition is especially important for those who experienced complications during pregnancy and in the postpartum period; conditions warranting communication to primary care to coordinate ongoing and long-term follow-up care include hypertensive disorders, DM, thyroid disorders, renal disease, mood disorders, obesity, substance use disorders, and complex social determinants of health needs. Within the VA system, MCCs — patient navigators specifically designated to work with pregnant patients and coordinate their care — contact patients postpartum and assess for medical complications and ongoing needs, and based on this assessment the MCC makes appropriate referrals including mental health, social work, and primary care follow-up.

Postpartum care — postpartum care should be treated as an ongoing process tailored to the patient's needs; all patients should ideally have initial contact with their obstetric provider within 3 weeks of birth, which can be in-person or via telehealth, and by the end of this visit a plan for individualized postpartum follow-up care should be determined; prioritizing early in-person follow-up rather than telehealth alone should be considered for those at high risk for postpartum depression, wound infection, lactation difficulties, or chronic conditions requiring medication titration.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^1145iFzc]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic and gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. For patients with chronic hypertension, oral antihypertensive therapy should be initiated or titrated at a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg or greater. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features can be managed with blood pressure monitoring, laboratory testing for disease progression, antenatal testing for fetal well-being, and delivery at 37 weeks' gestation. The use of antihypertensive drugs to control nonsevere hypertension in the setting of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia does not improve outcomes and is not recommended. Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated expeditiously for acute-onset severe hypertension to prevent hemorrhagic stroke. Preeclampsia with severe features requires immediate stabilization and inpatient treatment with magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and antenatal corticosteroids (if preterm). Patients in the preterm period should receive antenatal corticosteroids without delaying delivery to complete courses. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can worsen or initially present after delivery and account for up to 44% of pregnancy-related deaths in the first six days postpartum. Patients should be monitored closely in the early postpartum period. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are linked to poor long-term maternal and fetal outcomes, including increased maternal lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Daily low-dose aspirin therapy starting at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation is safe and effective for reducing the risk of preeclampsia for patients with risk factors.

Hypertension and pregnancy — For individuals with hypertension who are planning a pregnancy or who become pregnant, labetalol and extended-release nifedipine are preferred agents to treat hypertension and minimize fetal risk, and individuals with hypertension who are planning a pregnancy or who become pregnant should be counseled about the benefits of low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae. Pregnant individuals with SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg confirmed on repeat measurement within 15 minutes should receive antihypertensive medication to lower BP to < 160/ < 110 mm Hg within 30 to 60 minutes to prevent adverse events. Pregnant individuals with chronic hypertension should receive antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP < 140/90 mm Hg to prevent maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, with chronic hypertension in pregnancy defined as a preexisting diagnosis of hypertension or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg on 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart before 20 weeks' gestation.

### Characterizing longitudinal blood pressure trajectories in patients at high risk for de novo postpartum hypertension: a randomized controlled trial secondary analysis [^1169dakD]. Pregnancy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, contributing to over 50,000 annual deaths worldwide. Studies suggest that more than 80% of pregnancy-related deaths are likely to be preventable. Postpartum hypertension accounts for 70% of hypertension-related fatalities, underscoring the critical need for better understanding and management of postpartum hypertension risk factors. Of these postpartum hypertension cases, de novo postpartum hypertension (dnPPHTN), defined as new-onset high blood pressure after delivery in birthing people who were normotensive through pregnancy and delivery, represents up to two-thirds. dnPPHTN is particularly challenging because monitoring for individuals who would develop this condition often stops after delivery, making it difficult to determine who needs further monitoring or when new hypertension will develop. Despite this significant impact, the underlying factors contributing to dnPPHTN remain poorly understood.

In the antenatal period, significant progress has been made in reducing hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. This progress is partly due to a well-defined understanding of normal versus pathophysiologic blood pressure changes, which facilitates the implementation of timely and appropriate treatment. In contrast, the blood pressure trends in the postpartum period are less understood. Current data on postpartum cardiovascular changes are limited, primarily focusing on patients with antenatal hypertension and scarce data only up to two weeks postpartum on low-risk normotensive patients. The cessation of routine monitoring for normotensive patients and inconsistent follow-up practices likely contributed to increased risks of undiagnosed hypertension and related fatalities.

Recent studies in the antenatal period have demonstrated the prognostic value of early pregnancy blood pressure trajectories in identifying individuals at higher risk for HDP before delivery. However, the use of real-time, prospective longitudinal blood pressure data for risk prediction in the postpartum period has not been explored extensively. This novel, pragmatic approach could offer important insights, particularly for risk-stratification of patients without a hypertensive diagnosis at delivery. In light of these gaps, our objective was to define longitudinal blood pressure patterns in patients with clinical risk factors for dnPPHTN, addressing an important gap in postpartum care that has implications for timely identification and intervention. By improving our understanding of postpartum blood pressure trends, this work aims to support early identification of patients at risk for developing new-onset hypertension after delivery.

Self-monitoring blood pressure (SMBP) during pregnancy and postpartum — There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against self-monitoring for blood pressure during pregnancy and the postpartum period. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence suggests that there might be no benefit to SMBP at home as a supplement to routine clinic blood pressure assessments, and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing SMBP with TAU versus TAU alone in pregnancies at risk for preeclampsia found no statistically significant difference in the timing of clinic-based blood pressure detection of hypertension (HTN) and no difference in the incidence of preeclampsia, eclampsia, transient ischemic attack, or stroke; a similar RCT in pregnancies with diagnosed HTN found no statistically significant difference in clinic-based blood pressure control and no difference in the incidence of preeclampsia, severe HTN, or maternal death. Two SRs echoed these findings, with one finding no statistically significant difference in preeclampsia, eclampsia, or maternal death and another finding no difference in the incidence of preeclampsia and no difference in prenatal or postpartum readmissions. Patient preferences vary; some patients, particularly those with a history of preeclampsia, might wish to learn and perform SMBP between clinic-based visits, while other patients might prefer traditional clinic-based care only.

### Risk factors for chronic hypertension 5 years after a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Jjfys]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

To reduce the impact of preeclampsia on cardiovascular health later in life, organizations such as the American Heart Association and the Lancet Women and Cardiovascular Disease Commission have stressed the significance of enhancing postpregnancy surveillance to prevent cardiovascular events. However, standardization of surveillance programs, follow-up frequency and topics covered during visits, remains a subject of debate. A tailored approach to postpregnancy care, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, may be preferable, especially in the context of healthcare costs and the burden on patients from unnecessary follow-up visits. Ideally, early postpartum risk assessment can offer insights into chronic hypertension risk, educate patients on health and lifestyle, and help tailor follow-up care for those at higher risk. To achieve this goal, it is essential to acquire knowledge of all (non)modifiable risk factors that contribute to chronic hypertension after pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. Previous systematic reviews have largely focused on determining the short-term incidence of chronic hypertension following preeclampsia. Additionally, two reviews reported one risk factor for the development of chronic hypertension, namely, experiencing preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy compared to only in the first pregnancy. However, to the best of our knowledge, no reviews are currently available on risk factors for chronic hypertension as primary outcome. Several studies have demonstrated that the cumulative incidence and hazard ratios for chronic hypertension increase over the first decade following preeclampsia. Consequently, to capture this prolonged period of increased risk, we extended our follow-up period to at least 5 years after birth for a more comprehensive assessment. Hence, this systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of factors associated with chronic hypertension at least 5 years after pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, with the aim of guiding decisions on which women require postpregnancy surveillance.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: innovative management strategies [^115JrfNH]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Given that preeclampsia can develop de novo after delivery, women in the postpartum period should be given discharge instructions that include information about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia as well as the importance of presenting for medical evaluation in the event that they occur. As delineated by the ACOG guidelines, treatment with first-line agents in patients with acute severe hypertension, identified as systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg, should be initiated within 30 to 60 minutes to reduce risk of maternal stroke. First-line agents for treatment in both pregnancy and postpartum include IV labetalol and hydralazine, or more recently, the use of oral nifedipine if IV access is not established. BP targets in cases of severe hypertension should not aim for normalization of BP but rather target a range of 140 to 150/90 to 100 mm Hg. In severe cases, such as when medication fails to reduce BP to the target range, consultation with anesthesiologist, maternal fetal medicine subspecialist, or critical care subspecialist is recommended.

ACOG and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend achieving a BP of 140/90 mm Hg in the immediate postpartum period. However, there are no standardized management guidelines for specific antihypertensive agents or parameters for medication uptitration in the postpartum period. Thus, physician preference and experience, as well as safety of medical therapy during breastfeeding often affect the approach.

### A 30-year-old woman with chronic hypertension trying to conceive [^111PnKvi]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Mrs F is a 30-year-old woman with a history of chronic hypertension and possible preeclampsia during her first pregnancy. She is currently trying to conceive and wants to know how her hypertension will affect a future pregnancy and how it should best be managed, both now and during a pregnancy. The management of chronic hypertension before, during, and after a pregnancy is discussed with an emphasis on the goals of treatment and safety of medications during pregnancy and with breastfeeding. Preeclampsia is the most common complication of chronic hypertension in pregnancy and is a particular worry for Mrs F because she may have had it with her prior pregnancy. The current understanding of the pathogenesis of this enigmatic illness is therefore also reviewed, along with its implications for long-term maternal health.

The hypertensive diseases of pregnancy commonly refer to a group of disorders whose definitions have changed over time within and among professional organizations. Pre-eclampsia, either mild or severe, is managed best with a policy of delivery at or beyond 37 and 34 weeks' gestation, respectively. Similarly, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia are conditions wherein it is difficult to justify expectant management beyond 37 weeks' gestation. The approach to management before these gestational ages is subject to interpretation of a limited body of literature.

### Management of postpartum hypertensive disorders… [^117MBHEY]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Clinical Issue What are the effectiveness, benefits, and harms of management strategies for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy during the postpartum period. Evidence-Based Answer Home blood pressure monitoring likely doubles the number of people who have their BP checked at recommended intervals. Patient satisfaction is high with home BP monitoring. Home BP monitoring likely reduces hypertension-related readmissions. Home BP monitoring likely reduces the disparity in recommended BP monitoring by one-half between non-Black and Black patients. Oral furosemide may shorten the duration of postpartum hypertension.

There is insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of other antihypertensive medications in the postpartum period. Shorter duration magnesium sulfate leads to a shorter time from delivery to contact with the infant. Loading dose–only MgSO 4 increases the risk of recurrent seizures in patients with eclampsia. Lower doses of MgSO 4 decrease the risk of reduced deep tendon reflexes.

### Comprehensive postpartum management for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy… [^1177Mz6G]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently redefined postpartum care to encompass 12 months after birth and stressed the importance of connecting postpartum patients to primary care clinicians to manage chronic conditions. This handoff is critical as 50% of patients with HDP develop chronic hypertension, and patients affected by HDP have twice the risk of later cardiovascular-related death. This trial has been practice-changing, lowering the historic antepartum blood pressure target from 160/110mmHg to less than 140/90mmHg. However, this trial did not contemplate the management of maternal blood pressure in the postpartum period. ACOG presently endorses a postpartum goal of less than 150/100mmHg which, notably, is higher than the newly established antepartum goal.

Furthermore, the blood pressure target set for non-pregnant adults by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association is even lower, at less than 120/80mmHg to minimize the cardiovascular disease risk associated with chronic hypertension. Investigators propose a comprehensive management program for postpartum patients with HDP who are at risk for severe maternal morbidity and mortality. Our program will emphasize three key components: 1) self-monitoring of blood pressures with app-based reporting connected to our electronic health record, 2) blood pressure management directed by a program navigator with guideline and physician support and 3) facilitated transitions of care to primary care clinicians for hypertension management. Investigators will randomize 300 patents with HDP on postpartum day one with follow up through 3 months postpartum. Primary outcome will be blood pressure reporting at 7–10 postpartum.

Secondary outcomes include blood pressure control at 7–10 days postpartum, identification and treatment of severe blood pressures, severe maternal morbidity, hospital readmission, triage visits for hypertension, postpartum and primary care visit attendance, and multiple patient-reported outcome measures. All outcomes will be stratified by race to evaluate disparities and by tight versus usual blood pressure control to evaluate the impact of strict postpartum blood pressure control on outcomes. Investigators hypothesize that a comprehensive postpartum HDP management program will improve hypertension control for all patients and reduce disparities that affect Black patients, and that stricter blood pressure control will be associated with fewer adverse outcomes.

### Long-term blood pressure control after hypertensive pregnancy… [^111MDVcu]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective To evaluate whether an intervention designed to achieve better blood pressure control in the postnatal period is associated with lower blood pressure than usual outpatient care during the first 9 months postpartum. Design, Setting, and Participants. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned 1: 1 to self-monitoring along with physician-optimized antihypertensive titration or usual postnatal care. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was 24-hour mean diastolic blood pressure at 9 months postpartum, adjusted for baseline postnatal blood pressure. Conclusions and Relevance In this single-center trial, self-monitoring and physician-guided titration of antihypertensive medications was associated with lower blood pressure during the first 9 months postpartum than usual postnatal outpatient care in the UK. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04273854.

23, 24 Reported herein are the results of the Physician Optimized Postpartum Hypertension Treatment Trial, designed to test whether physician-guided self-management of antihypertensive medication results in persistently lower blood pressure after a hypertensive pregnancy compared with usual National Health Service care. Secondary imaging outcomes included transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and visit 4 and cardiovascular magnetic resonance assessment of cardiac structure at visit 4. The imaging results will be reported separately. However, prior work has demonstrated that individuals whose blood pressure remains high at 6 weeks after delivery are more likely to have elevated blood pressures 5 to 10 years later. 7 Blood pressure increases with age and a rise of 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure occurs in the 10 years during early to midadulthood.

37 Therefore an intervention that lowers blood pressure by 5 mm Hg would be expected to delay progression to hypertension by many years and, over a lifetime, reduce risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events by up to 20% and 40%, respectively.
38. A randomized clinical trial involving women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy who had undergone a 5-day course of 20 mg of oral furosemide vs placebo demonstrated a 60% reduction in the prevalence of persistently elevated blood pressure at 7 days in the furosemide group, but there was no longer-term follow-up. 40 Further work is required to understand whether other interventions lowering blood pressure postnatally, including lifestyle and/or specific pharmacological therapies, could have similar effects to those found in the POP-HT and PICK-UP trials.

### Well-child visits for detection and management of postpartum hypertensive disorders… [^115WDkM9]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Recognizing the underutilization of postpartum care and the high morbidity and mortality during the postpartum period, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recently updated their fourth trimester guidelines. 8 With recommendations for earlier and more frequent visits in the new paradigm shift, ACOG recommends that those with a. high risk hypertensive status be evaluated 3 to 10 days after delivery for a BP check. 8 However, this recommendation has been challenging to adopt in clinical practice. 8 A recent randomized clinical trial from our institution10 demonstrated that only 50% of patients at high risk attended their 7- to 10- day postpartum visit. Furthermore, even if these new fourth trimester guidelines were adhered to, it would not allow for timely detection of de novo postpartum preeclampsia, which have a reported prevalence of 0. 3% to
27. 5%.
3.

The postintervention cohort was prospectively enrolled and consisted of biological mothers accompanying their newborns to the same clinic for the next 10 consecutive months. These individuals were approached by the pediatrics clinician about enrollment in our QI program at the time of routine well-child visits. Both cohorts still adhered to our standard obstetric postpartum follow-up visit schedule, which includes a 7- to 10-day postpartum follow-up BP evaluation for patients with HDP as recommended by ACOG guidelines, 2-week follow-up for cesarean delivery, and 4 to 6 weeks for all mothers at our obstetric clinic. The evaluation at the well-child visits was in addition to our routine obstetric postpartum follow-up recommendations.

Second, the improved screening for HDP in the postintervention group compared with the preintervention group resulted in diagnosing HDP in cases where it would have potentially been missed if screening was left to postnatal maternal clinic visits. This was evident by the significantly higher number of mothers being referred to the OB-ED and being admitted due to postpartum preeclampsia. Third, the improvement in diagnosis also resulted in better clinical outcomes with respect to improved recognition and diagnosis of de novo HDP and an earlier readmission for HDP in the postintervention group compared with the preintervention group.

20, 21 Women with gestational diabetes should be screened for impaired glucose tolerance with a 75-g two-hour fasting oral glucose tolerance test at four to 12 weeks postpartum, and should be evaluated for development of hypertension with blood pressure monitoring. 20, 53 They should continue to be screened for diabetes every one to three years because the risk of type 2 diabetes is elevated.
21. THYROID DISORDERS Postpartum thyroiditis can affect up to 10% of women during the first year postpartum, with similar rates of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. 23 Postpartum hyperthyroidism is usually transient and does not need to be treated. Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone therapy. The risk of Graves disease is also increased postpartum, and women with a history of this disease are more likely to relapse. Positive thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies can distinguish Graves disease from postpartum thyroiditis.

Infants of women who are breastfeeding and being treated for thyroid disorders should be monitored for growth and development; however, laboratory monitoring of infants' thyroid function is not necessary. 23, 24 The American Thyroid Association recommends annual thyroid function screening in women with a history of postpartum thyroiditis.
23. 30 Interventions such as counseling and home visits can reduce intimate partner violence for women postpartum. URINARY INCONTINENCE In one large cohort study, 28. 5% of women reported moderate or severe urinary incontinence in the first year postpartum. 32 Bladder training, fluid management, body weight loss, and pelvic floor muscle exercises improve symptoms for all types of urinary incontinence, but studies have included women who are perimenopausal and not postpartum.

34 It is uncertain whether pelvic floor muscle training during the postpartum period has an effect on urinary incontinence; however, it does reduce postpartum urinary incontinence by about one-third when initiated prenatally.
33. HEMORRHOIDS AND CONSTIPATION Hemorrhoids may be caused by constipation or by pushing during the second stage of labor. Initial therapy involves treatment for constipation. 35 Up to 17% of women report constipation in the first six weeks postpartum. Iron supplements taken orally during pregnancy can be a contributing factor. First-line treatments include increased intake of water and fiber, and osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol or lactulose. Patients with hemorrhoids should also be treated with stool softeners.
