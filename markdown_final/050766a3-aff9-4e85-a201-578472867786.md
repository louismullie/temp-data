## Question

How is orthostatic blood pressure dysfunction treated when supine hypertension is present?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat orthostatic blood pressure dysfunction when supine hypertension coexists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the competing risks and core goals in SH-OH. Then, I should confirm diagnostic definitions and thresholds, including any adjustments when supine BP is high. Next, I will outline a hierarchical treatment algorithm, starting with medication review and nonpharmacologic measures before carefully adding pharmacologic agents. After that, I must specify how and when to treat supine hypertension without worsening daytime OH. Finally, I will detail monitoring, follow-up, and individualization by risk, while double-checking the evidence base and citing key consensus statements and trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical dilemma so I don't jump to conclusions: orthostatic hypotension poses immediate risks of falls, syncope, and cerebral hypoperfusion, whereas supine hypertension confers long-term risks including stroke and target-organ damage; balancing short-term safety against long-term cardiovascular protection is essential, and the plan must be individualized based on comorbidities, frailty, and disease stage [^112vR4vZ] [^113ZBMJK] [^1139QtjG].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic anchors before I operationalize treatment: classic OH is a sustained fall in SBP of at least 20 mmHg or DBP of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or tilt; the ESC syncope guideline aligns with this and also highlights symptomatic reproduction, while in patients with supine hypertension a larger threshold (30/15) better reflects the proportional drop from a higher baseline; for supine hypertension in autonomic failure, pragmatic thresholds of SBP ≥ 150 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg supine are commonly used in the nOH literature [^113XSwHB] [^112X4rJU] [^111jn2Ym] [^116SXSde].

> Hold on, I should confirm the overarching algorithm so I escalate care safely: the American Autonomic Society–National Parkinson Foundation consensus recommends a four-step, hierarchical approach with approximately two-week reassessments at each stage — first, adjust aggravating medications; second, implement nonpharmacologic measures; third, add single-agent pharmacologic therapy; fourth, combine agents with great caution if needed; clinical success is judged primarily by symptom relief, standing time, and function rather than normalizing standing BP [^112vR4vZ] [^111S3hrU].

> I will now examine medication simplification because drug effects are a frequent modifiable driver; I need to check for daytime or long-acting antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, diuretics, nitrates, and certain calcium-channel blockers that worsen OH, and if BP control is still needed for supine hypertension, switch to short-acting agents confined to bedtime; ESC 2024 reinforces switching offending BP-lowering drugs to alternatives rather than indiscriminate de-intensification in patients with orthostatic symptoms and coexistent hypertension; I should also consider dopaminergic agents, tricyclics, bladder antimuscarinics, and polypharmacy that lower BP, adjusting timing or dose where possible [^112vR4vZ] [^116iWimA] [^1114M3Mu].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic treatment for daytime OH because these improve orthostatic tolerance with minimal SH trade-off: teach counterpressure maneuvers such as leg crossing, squatting, and lower-body muscle tensing; prescribe abdominal binders or high-waist compression stockings to reduce venous pooling; liberalize water intake to about 2–2.5 liters per day and salt to roughly 8–10 g daily when not contraindicated by heart or renal failure; adopt slow postural transitions, avoid daytime recumbency, and use small frequent meals to mitigate postprandial hypotension; let me double-check the safety of salt expansion in frail patients with cardiorenal comorbidity before implementation [^117BWmPw] [^113oZczM] [^113XSwHB].

> For nocturnal supine hypertension, I need to ensure nonpharmacologic strategies are optimized first: elevate the head of the bed 30–45 degrees to lower nocturnal BP and reduce pressure natriuresis, counsel avoidance of evening fluid loading, and consider investigational approaches such as local passive heat or overnight CPAP, both of which reduced nocturnal SBP and natriuresis and improved morning orthostatic tolerance in crossover studies; I should confirm candidacy and safety for CPAP or heat, and emphasize that evidence is still limited though promising [^1114M3Mu] [^116SXSde] [^117JGL62] [^11493BTz].

> If symptoms persist, I will add pharmacologic therapy for OH one agent at a time and carefully monitor supine BP; midodrine 2.5–10 mg three times daily improves standing BP but must be avoided within roughly 4–5 hours of bedtime to limit SH, and patients should be counseled to monitor for headache, pounding in the ears, and visual changes as SH warnings; fludrocortisone 0.1–0.2 mg daily can augment volume but risks edema, hypokalemia, and SH; alternatives such as pyridostigmine or droxidopa may be considered in neurogenic OH depending on access and phenotype; I should double-check for bradycardia risk and drug interactions when using midodrine and for fluid sensitivity with fludrocortisone before initiating therapy [^113sJq7p] [^112dR4Gt] [^115UjaoT] [^111S3hrU].

> But wait, what if nocturnal supine pressures are very high or symptomatic; I should treat severe SH in parallel, not at the expense of next-day standing safety: for SBP greater than 180 mmHg or DBP greater than 110 mmHg, or if the patient has SH symptoms or end-organ strain, use short-acting antihypertensives at bedtime only, such as captopril, losartan, or a nitroglycerin patch, with careful morning reassessment; clonidine 0.1 mg in the evening reduced nocturnal BP and natriuresis in autonomous failure but can leave a residual hypotensive effect into the morning; I almost recommended a long-acting ARB for convenience, but hold on, that would risk worsening daytime OH — long-acting agents and diuretics should generally be avoided in this context [^1114M3Mu] [^117TN4xi] [^112QoStC] [^114gtu7H].

> Let me reconsider the notion of "permissive" supine hypertension because overzealous nighttime BP lowering can precipitate morning syncope; for many with severe OH, permissive SH around 150–160 mmHg is acceptable to ensure adequate standing perfusion, and those with very large orthostatic drops may require even higher nocturnal set points to achieve safe ambulation; this is a nuanced trade-off that must be individualized and revisited frequently as the disease evolves [^116SXSde] [^112vR4vZ].

> I need to ensure monitoring is structured and actionable: patients should keep a home BP diary with head-up supine measurements at bedtime, pre-upright measurements on awakening, and standing BP after 3 minutes; those on pressors such as midodrine or droxidopa should avoid lying flat for 4–5 hours post-dose and record standing BP; clinicians should review symptoms, falls, and headaches alongside BP logs about two weeks after any treatment change and consider 24-hour ambulatory BP to profile day–night patterns and guide timing and doses; I should double-check that patients understand to stop midodrine and call if sustained SH symptoms occur [^111S3hrU] [^112dR4Gt] [^112QoStC].

> Next, I should review how to combine therapies if monotherapy is insufficient, but with great caution because lability increases; combinations such as midodrine plus fludrocortisone may help upright tolerance but heighten SH risk, so adding a strictly bedtime, short-acting antihypertensive is reasonable if SH crosses safe thresholds; frequent home BP checks and symptom diaries become mandatory in this phase, and I should confirm that caregivers are engaged if the patient is frail or cognitively impaired [^112vR4vZ] [^111S3hrU] [^1114M3Mu].

> I will now examine individual risk–benefit adjustments: in frail older adults, I should prioritize fall prevention and accept higher supine pressures to preserve cerebral perfusion, while in patients with high atherosclerotic risk or target-organ damage, I should be more proactive against SH but still rely on short-acting nocturnal agents; integrating falls prevention principles and orthostatic management into multidomain care plans improves safety and outcomes in older adults [^1139QtjG] [^116i4f1V].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic link between SH and OH to justify these trade-offs: autonomic failure and baroreflex-cardiovagal impairment produce both supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension, with low baroreflex gain and blunted norepinephrine increments upon standing explaining the coexistence and severity; recognizing this shared pathophysiology helps avoid overtreatment of one state that unravels the other [^117AhFhe].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan adheres to core principles: start with medication review and nonpharmacologic strategies, deploy short-acting pressors timed away from bedtime for OH, allow moderate permissive supine hypertension unless severe or symptomatic, treat severe SH with short-acting bedtime antihypertensives only while avoiding diuretics and long-acting agents, and monitor both postures systematically with two-week reassessments; if my initial choices inadvertently worsen SH or morning OH, I should promptly retime, retitrate, or switch agents and re-evaluate with ambulatory monitoring as needed [^112vR4vZ] [^1114M3Mu] [^112QoStC].

Management of orthostatic hypotension with supine hypertension requires a **stepwise, individualized approach** [^112vR4vZ] that prioritizes **symptom control and fall prevention** [^116i4f1V] while minimizing cardiovascular risk [^113ZBMJK] [^1139QtjG]. Begin with **non-pharmacologic measures** — elevating the head of the bed 30–45°, avoiding daytime supine rest, using compression garments, and increasing salt and fluid intake [^112vR4vZ] [^113XSwHB] [^113oZczM]. If supine BP remains ≥ 160/90 mmHg [^112QoStC], add **short-acting bedtime antihypertensives** (e.g. clonidine 0.1 mg, nitroglycerin patch 0.1 mg, or hydralazine 10–25 mg) [^112vR4vZ] while avoiding long-acting agents or diuretics [^1114M3Mu]. Regularly monitor supine and standing BP [^112vR4vZ], adjust therapy to balance risks [^111S3hrU], and educate patients on posture, hydration, and medication timing [^113ZBMJK].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical significance

Pathophysiology: In autonomic failure, supine hypertension reflects **impaired baroreflex buffering** [^117AhFhe], leading to **unopposed vasoconstriction** and elevated supine BP [^112vR4vZ]; this increases nocturnal **pressure diuresis**, worsening daytime OH [^112QoStC]. Clinical significance: Supine hypertension is linked to **end-organ damage** (heart failure, stroke, CKD) [^1139QtjG] and increased mortality, while OH causes **falls**, **syncope**, and **cognitive impairment** [^112QoStC] [^113jNhog].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and assessment

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: A sustained drop in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt [^112X4rJU] [^112vR4vZ].

- **Supine hypertension**: Supine BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg after 3 minutes supine [^112vR4vZ]; in autonomic failure, ≥ 150/90 mmHg is often used [^113jNhog] [^116SXSde].

- **Assessment**: Measure supine BP after 5 minutes rest, then at 1 and 3 minutes after standing [^112vR4vZ]; use 24-hour ABPM to capture nocturnal hypertension and daytime OH [^113QETnv].

## Non-pharmacological management strategies

Non-pharmacologic measures are the **first-line** approach to reducing supine hypertension and improving orthostatic tolerance [^112vR4vZ] [^1139QtjG]:

| **Intervention** | **Rationale** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Head-of-bed elevation (30–45°) | Reduces nocturnal BP and pressure diuresis | Strong [^112vR4vZ] [^112QoStC] |
| Avoid supine posture during day | Prevents daytime supine hypertension | Strong [^112vR4vZ] |
| Compression garments (waist-high stockings, abdominal binders) | Reduces venous pooling, improves upright BP | Moderate [^113oZczM] [^117BWmPw] |
| Increased salt (8–10 g/day) and fluid intake (2–2.5 L/day) | Expands volume, improves OH | Moderate [^113oZczM] [^11261E6M] |
| Evening snack (postprandial hypotension) | Lowers nocturnal BP | Moderate [^113QETnv] |
| Local passive heat therapy | Lowers nocturnal BP, reduces diuresis | Emerging [^115mfoEZ] |
| CPAP (if OSA) | Lowers nocturnal BP, improves morning OH | Emerging [^11493BTz] |

---

## Pharmacological management strategies

Pharmacologic therapy is reserved for persistent supine hypertension despite non-pharmacologic measures. Use **short-acting agents at bedtime** [^112vR4vZ] to limit morning OH, and avoid long-acting antihypertensives and diuretics, which can worsen daytime OH [^112QoStC]:

| **Medication** | **Dose** | **Mechanism** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clonidine | 0.1–0.2 mg PO at bedtime | Central α2-agonist; reduces sympathetic tone | Moderate [^112vR4vZ] [^117TN4xi] |
| Nitroglycerin patch | 0.1 mg transdermal at bedtime | Vasodilator; reduces preload/afterload | Moderate [^112vR4vZ] [^117TN4xi] |
| Hydralazine | 10–25 mg PO at bedtime | Direct vasodilator | Moderate [^112vR4vZ] |
| Losartan | 25–50 mg PO at bedtime | ARB; reduces vascular resistance | Moderate [^112vR4vZ] [^112QoStC] |
| Eplerenone | 25–50 mg PO at bedtime | Aldosterone antagonist | Moderate [^112vR4vZ] [^112QoStC] |

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

- **Regular monitoring**: Track supine and standing BP [^112vR4vZ], especially after medication changes [^111S3hrU].

- **Patient education**: Teach posture, hydration, and medication timing [^112vR4vZ] to minimize risks [^116i4f1V].

- **Individualized adjustment**: Titrate therapy to balance OH symptoms and supine hypertension [^113ZBMJK], prioritizing symptom control and fall prevention [^1139QtjG].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks

- **Supine hypertension**: Increases risk of heart failure, stroke, CKD [^112QoStC], and mortality [^113QETnv].

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Increases risk of falls, syncope, cognitive impairment [^113jNhog], and mortality [^1139QtjG].

- **Balance of risks**: Management must weigh immediate OH risks against long-term supine hypertension risks [^112QoStC], with individualized plans [^113ZBMJK].

---

## Gaps in current guidelines and research

Evidence remains limited [^113ZBMJK], with **few high-quality trials** to guide management of coexisting orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^114gtu7H]. Optimal blood pressure targets and the long-term outcomes of treating supine hypertension in autonomic failure are uncertain [^113ZBMJK] [^1139QtjG]. Further trials of nocturnal antihypertensive therapy and individualized strategies are needed [^113ZBMJK] [^112QoStC].

---

Management of orthostatic hypotension with supine hypertension should follow a **stepwise, individualized approach**: emphasize non-pharmacologic measures first, add short-acting bedtime antihypertensives when needed [^112QoStC], and use regular monitoring to balance symptom control with cardiovascular risk [^113QETnv] [^112vR4vZ].

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112vR4vZ]. Journal of Neurology (2017). High credibility.

Once a patient is diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), the goal of treatment should not be to normalize standing blood pressure. Instead, the principal treatment goals should be to reduce the burden of symptoms (especially falls), prolong standing time, and improve the physical capabilities of the patient to restore independence in activities of daily living.

- **Treatment algorithm**: A treatment algorithm for nOH encompasses a four-step hierarchical process:
	1. Assessing and adjusting pre-existing medications.
	2. Utilizing non-pharmacologic approaches.
	3. Implementing single-agent pharmacologic treatment.
	4. Combining pharmacologic treatments with great caution.

At each step, it is recommended that the patient undergo a two-week assessment to determine whether sufficient symptomatic benefit has been achieved before moving onto successive steps. Each facet of the algorithm is described in detail below.

- **Review and adjust medications**: After establishing a diagnosis of symptomatic nOH, it is imperative first to consider pharmacologic simplification by reducing or discontinuing medications that exacerbate nOH. One key to initial success is completing a comprehensive medication review so that adjustments in regimens can be made as needed. Many medications, including those commonly used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), hypertension, or bladder symptoms, can lower blood pressure and exacerbate the symptoms of nOH.

### Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies: Prioritisation of treatment targets [^113ZBMJK]. The Lancet Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension are common manifestations of cardiovascular dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. Because these disorders are haemodynamic opposites, improvement in one might be achieved at the expense of worsening the other. Thus, management decisions necessitate assessment of the individual risks for patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension. Whereas neurogenic orthostatic hypotension poses risks for falls and can be associated with cognitive impairment in the short term, chronic supine hypertension can be associated with stroke and myocardial infarction in the long term.

Because few clinical trial data exist for outcomes in patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension, clinicians need to balance, on the basis of comorbidities and disease staging, the potential immediate benefits of treatment for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and the long-term risks of supine hypertension treatment in each patient. Future research needs to focus on ascertaining a safe degree of supine hypertension when treating neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; the effectiveness of nocturnal antihypertensive therapy in patients with coexistent neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension; and the prevalence, scope, and therapeutic requirements for managing neurogenic orthostatic hypotension that manifests with falls or cognitive impairment, but without postural lightheadedness or near syncope.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113XSwHB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common, yet underdiagnosed disorder contributing to disability and even death. It can be the initial sign, leading to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders, ranging from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) following a postural change. Evidence-based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and therapeutic management (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature search was conducted in March 2005.

For the diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in both supine and upright positions are necessary. OH is defined as a fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg from baseline within three minutes of standing upright. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history suggests OH or in patients with motor impairment.

The management initially consists of education, advice, and training on various factors that influence blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improve OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable first-line drug. Second-line drugs include sympathomimetics such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Supine hypertension also has to be considered.

### Management of supine hypertension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension: Scientific statement of the American Autonomic Society, European Federation of Autonomic Societies, and the European Society of Hypertension [^112QoStC]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension commonly occurs in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure. It promotes nocturnal sodium excretion and orthostatic hypotension, thus interfering with quality of life. Perusal of the literature on essential hypertension and smaller scale investigations in autonomic failure patients also suggests that supine hypertension may predispose individuals to cardiovascular and renal disease. These reasons provide a rationale for treating supine hypertension. Yet, treatment of supine hypertension, whether through nonpharmacological or pharmacological approaches, may exacerbate orthostatic hypotension when patients get up during the night, leading to fall-related complications.

More research is needed to define the magnitude of the deleterious effects of supine hypertension on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal morbidity and mortality. Integration of more precise cardiovascular risk assessment, efficacy, and safety data, along with the prognosis of the underlying condition causing autonomic failure, is required for individualized management recommendations.

### Local passive heat for the treatment of hypertension in autonomic failure [^117JGL62]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension affects a majority of patients with autonomic failure; it is associated with end-organ damage and can worsen daytime orthostatic hypotension by inducing pressure diuresis and volume loss during the night. Because sympathetic activation prevents blood pressure (BP) from falling in healthy subjects exposed to heat, we hypothesized that passive heat had a BP-lowering effect in patients with autonomic failure and could be used to treat their supine hypertension.

- **Methods and results**: In Protocol 1 (n = 22), the acute effects of local heat (40–42°C applied with a heating pad placed over the abdomen for 2 hours) versus sham control were assessed in a randomized crossover fashion. Heat acutely decreased systolic BP by -19 ± 4 mm Hg (versus 3 ± 4 with sham, P < 0.001) owing to decreases in stroke volume (-18 ± 5% versus -4 ± 4%, P = 0.013) and cardiac output (-15 ± 5% versus -2 ± 4%, P = 0.013).

- **Protocol 2 (proof-of-concept overnight study; n = 12)**: We compared the effects of local heat (38°C applied with a water-perfused heating pad placed under the torso from 10 pm to 6 am) versus a placebo pill. Heat decreased nighttime systolic BP (maximal change -28 ± 6 versus -2 ± 6 mm Hg, P < 0.001). BP returned to baseline by 8 am. The nocturnal systolic BP decrease correlated with a decrease in urinary volume (r = 0.57, P = 0.072) and an improvement in the morning upright systolic BP (r = -0.76, P = 0.007).

- **Conclusions**: Local heat therapy effectively lowered overnight BP in patients with autonomic failure and supine hypertension and offers a novel approach to treat this condition.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^112X4rJU]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syncope, particularly in the context of the orthostatic challenge (active standing), the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend confirming syncope due to orthostatic hypotension. This confirmation is appropriate when there is a fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from the baseline value of ≥ 20 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg, or a decrease in SBP to < 90 mmHg, which reproduces spontaneous symptoms.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113VYy4o]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To address this issue, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation jointly held an initial consensus panel meeting to formulate essential recommendations into a working guideline for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of nOH and associated supine hypertension. Results of the discussions held during the meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel participants, are presented here, along with recommendations in each of the topic areas. Whereas most patients with disorders typically associated with nOH are seen by cardiologists or neurologists, particularly movement disorder specialists, the first point of contact and potential for identification of nOH is with the primary care clinicians. Hence, the following consensus commentary is meant to provide guidance for all clinicians who might encounter and/or ultimately manage nOH.

### Orthostatic hypotension in genetically related hypertensive and normotensive individuals [^1131cN1q]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study focus on the prevalence and determinants of orthostatic hypotension, which remain largely unexplored in younger individuals without significant chronic disease burden.

The methods involved investigating the frequency and main associations of impaired orthostatic response in a cohort of 469 middle-aged hypertensive patients and 453 of their normotensive first-degree relatives.

Results indicated that 13.4% of hypertensive and 5.5% of normotensive study participants were found to have orthostatic hypotension. In a backward logistic regression, the following determinants of orthostatic hypotension were identified:

- **Sex**: Female, odds ratio (OR) 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–5.25, P = 0.022.
- **Reduced glomerular filtration rate**: OR (per ml/min/1.73 m²) 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99, P = 0.002.
- **Systolic blood pressure**: OR (per mmHg) 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.05, P = 0.047.
- **Diastolic blood pressure**: OR (per mmHg) 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09, P = 0.033.
- **Antihypertensive treatment**: OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18–0.93, P = 0.034.

In hypertensive patients, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was related to a lower frequency of orthostatic hypotension. The percentage of orthostatic hypotension-positive patients in the highest blood pressure stratum (≥ 160 mmHg) decreased from 20.2% to 7.6%, when diagnostic criteria were adjusted for a mean systolic orthostatic reaction (2 SD value: 30 mmHg). During a follow-up period (t = 6.6 years), individuals with impaired orthostatic response showed a trend towards increased total mortality (OR 2.16, 95% CI 0.97–4.80, P = 0.06) in a crude model.

### Association between supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension in autonomic failure [^117AhFhe]. Hypertension (2003). High credibility.

Supine hypertension occurs commonly in primary chronic autonomic failure. This study explored whether supine hypertension in this setting is associated with orthostatic hypotension (OH) and, if so, what mechanisms might underlie this association. Supine and upright blood pressures, hemodynamic responses to the Valsalva maneuver, baroreflex-cardiovagal gain, and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were measured in pure autonomic failure (PAF), multiple-system atrophy (MSA) with or without OH, and Parkinson's disease (PD) with or without OH. Controls included age-matched, healthy volunteers and patients with essential hypertension or those referred for dysautonomia. Baroreflex-cardiovagal gain was calculated from the relation between the interbeat interval and systolic pressure during the Valsalva maneuver.

PAF, MSA with OH, and PD with OH all featured supine hypertension, which was equivalent in severity to that in essential hypertension, regardless of fludrocortisone treatment. Among patients with PD or MSA, those with OH had higher mean arterial pressure during supine rest (109 ± 3 mm Hg) than those lacking OH (96 ± 3 mm Hg). Baroreflex-cardiovagal gain and orthostatic increments in plasma NE levels were markedly decreased in all three groups with OH. Among patients with PD or MSA, those with OH had much lower mean baroreflex-cardiovagal gain (0.74 ± 0.10 ms/mm Hg) than those lacking OH (3.13 ± 0.72 ms/mm Hg). In chronic autonomic failure, supine hypertension is linked to both OH and low baroreflex-cardiovagal gain.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^115UjaoT]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding medical management of orthostatic hypotension, particularly with respect to fludrocortisone, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend administering fludrocortisone as the first-line drug monotherapy for orthostatic hypotension.

### Evaluation and management of orthostatic hypotension [^117KaY6h]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing when compared with blood pressure from the sitting or supine position. It results from an inadequate physiological response to postural changes in blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension may be acute or chronic, as well as symptomatic or asymptomatic.

Common symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, and headache. Less common symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, and neck and shoulder pain. Causes include dehydration or blood loss, neurological disorders, cardiovascular conditions, endocrine system issues, and several classes of medications.

- **Evaluation and diagnosis**: Evaluation of suspected orthostatic hypotension begins by identifying reversible causes and underlying associated medical conditions. Head-up tilt-table testing can aid in confirming a diagnosis of suspected orthostatic hypotension when standard orthostatic vital signs are nondiagnostic. It also assists in assessing treatment response in patients with an autonomic disorder.

- **Goals of treatment**: Goals of treatment involve improving hypotension without excessive supine hypertension, relieving orthostatic symptoms, and improving standing time. Treatment involves correcting reversible causes and discontinuing responsible medications when possible. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be offered to all patients. For patients who do not respond adequately to nonpharmacologic treatment, fludrocortisone, midodrine, and pyridostigmine are potential options.

### Assessment and management of exaggerated blood pressure response to standing and orthostatic hypertension: Consensus statement by the European Society of Hypertension Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring and Cardiovascular Variability [^114JVtqG]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that an exaggerated blood pressure (BP) response to standing (ERTS) is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, both in young and old individuals. Additionally, ERTS has been shown to be an independent predictor of masked hypertension. In the vast majority of studies reporting on the prognostic value of orthostatic hypertension (OHT), the definition was based only on systolic office BP measurements.

This consensus statement provides recommendations on the assessment and management of individuals with ERTS and/or OHT. ERTS is defined as an orthostatic increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 20 mmHg, and OHT as an ERTS with standing SBP of at least 140 mmHg. This statement recommends a standardized methodology to assess ERTS by considering body and arm position, as well as the number and timing of BP measurements.

ERTS/OHT should be confirmed on a second visit to account for its limited reproducibility. The second assessment should evaluate BP changes from the supine to the standing posture. Ambulatory BP monitoring is recommended for most individuals with ERTS/OHT, especially if they have high-normal seated office BP. Implementation of lifestyle changes and close follow-up are recommended in individuals with ERTS/OHT and normotensive seated office BP. Whether antihypertensive treatment should be administered in these individuals remains unknown.

Hypertensive patients with ERTS/OHT should be managed as any other hypertensive patient. Standardized standing BP measurement should be implemented in future epidemiological and interventional studies.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: Orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^1139QtjG]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

Impaired blood regulation is common in older people, whether due to physiological changes in the baroreflex, age-related diseases or states, or autonomic neuropathies. The consequences — orthostatic hypotension (OH) and associated hypertension — are debilitating conditions and herald poor prognosis. Identifying the underlying cause, understanding the associated pathophysiology, and mitigating exacerbating factors through predominantly lifestyle measures are essential. Future work should focus on identifying optimal blood pressure (BP) targets for these individuals, particularly the frailest patients at the highest risk of falls and injury.

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^112dR4Gt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The potential for supine and sitting hypertension should be evaluated at the beginning of midodrine hydrochloride therapy. Supine hypertension can often be controlled by preventing the patient from becoming fully supine, such as by sleeping with the head of the bed elevated. The patient should be cautioned to report symptoms of supine hypertension immediately. Symptoms may include cardiac awareness, pounding in the ears, headache, and blurred vision. The patient should be advised to discontinue the medication immediately if supine hypertension persists.

Blood pressure should be monitored carefully when midodrine hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other agents that cause vasoconstriction, such as phenylephrine, ephedrine, dihydroergotamine, phenylpropanolamine, or pseudoephedrine.

A slight slowing of the heart rate may occur after administration of midodrine hydrochloride, primarily due to vagal reflex. Caution should be exercised when midodrine hydrochloride is used concomitantly with cardiac glycosides (such as digitalis), psychopharmacologic agents, beta blockers, or other agents that directly or indirectly reduce heart rate. Patients who experience any signs or symptoms suggesting bradycardia (pulse slowing, increased dizziness, syncope, cardiac awareness) should be advised to discontinue midodrine hydrochloride and should be re-evaluated.

Midodrine hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients with urinary retention problems, as desglymidodrine acts on the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the bladder neck.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: Orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^117N9dCY]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

**Key points**: The healthy baroreflex is responsible for the moment-by-moment buffering of blood pressure by responding to physiological changes. With ageing, multiple physiological and pathophysiological changes occur that impair the sensitivity of the baroreflex. An impaired baroreflex results in compromised blood pressure regulation, often leading to orthostatic hypotension and hypertension. Orthostatic hypotension is consistently linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Additionally, the co-occurrence of orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension is common and requires careful management.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: Orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^112sTF7T]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Impaired blood pressure (BP) regulation and its consequences are common in older patients. Orthostatic hypotension (OH), in particular, is responsible for almost a quarter of Emergency Department attendances with syncope. Defined as a fall in 20 mmHg or more of systolic BP or 10 mmHg or more of diastolic BP within 3 minutes of standing or head-up tilt, it is consistently associated with falls, injury, an increased risk of adverse cardiac events, and all-cause mortality.

A major association is hypertension and its therapy. There are few evidence-based guidelines for managing these conflicting conditions, leading to treatment uncertainty and heterogeneity in clinical practice. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of impaired BP regulation is essential for managing it. In this article, we describe healthy BP regulation, ageing-related physiological and pathological changes, and the principles behind diagnosis and management.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^1114M3Mu]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

As stated above, if patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) are experiencing supine hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 160–180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 90–100 mmHg), the decision to treat should be individualized. However, if patients with nOH are experiencing severe supine hypertension (systolic blood pressure of > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 110 mmHg), they could be treated in the evening using short-acting antihypertensive agents. Individuals with the most severe supine hypertension often have the most severe nOH, and therefore these patients should be educated on the risks of worsening nOH with treatment. In particular, nocturnal visits to the bathroom may become dangerous if supine hypertension is treated too aggressively.

It is also important for these patients to avoid the use of diuretics and long-acting antihypertensive agents because the blood volume depletion attendant to diuretics and hypotensive effects of long-acting antihypertensives may markedly worsen nOH, even though they might have been intended to mitigate supine hypertension. Additionally, patients with nOH must avoid the supine posture during the day. A head-up reclining posture is recommended for repose.

- **Proposed treatments for supine hypertension related to nOH**: Short-acting antihypertensive medications for the treatment of supine hypertension should only be administered at bedtime, not during daytime hours. Many medications have BID or TID as the recommended dosing regimen, and patients may inadvertently start taking these medications during daytime hours and worsen symptoms.

### Insights into the clinical management of the syndrome of supine hypertension — orthostatic hypotension (SH-OH): the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) [^115cfMdc]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Our previously proposed morphological classification of orthostatic hypotension (MOH) is an approach to defining three typical orthostatic hemodynamic patterns using non-invasive beat-to-beat monitoring. In particular, the MOH pattern of large drop/non-recovery (MOH-3) resembles the syndrome of supine hypertension–orthostatic hypotension (SH-OH), which presents a treatment challenge for clinicians. The aim of this study was to characterize MOH-3 in the first wave of the Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA), with particular attention to symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (OI), prescribed medications, and association with history of faints and blackouts.

- **Methods**: The study included all TILDA wave 1 participants who had a Finometer® active stand. Automatic data signal checks were conducted to ensure that active stand data were of sufficient quality. Characterization variables included demographics, cardiovascular and neurological medications (WHO-ATC), and self-reported information on comorbidities and disability. Multivariable statistics consisted of logistic regression models.

- **Results**: Of the 4,467 cases, 1,456 (33%) were assigned to MOH-1 (small drop, overshoot), 2,230 (50%) to MOH-2 (medium drop, slower but full recovery), and 781 (18%) to MOH-3 (large drop, non-recovery). In the logistic regression model to predict MOH-3, statistically significant factors included being on antidepressants (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.50–2.64, P < 0.001) and beta blockers (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.26–2.04, P < 0.001). MOH-3 was an independent predictor of OI.

Assessing nOH treatment success

Assessment of treatment success needs to be a multifaceted approach involving predominantly the measurement of symptomatic improvements as well as ongoing blood pressure measurements. It is critical that patients are educated on the various symptoms and about how to keep a diary of symptoms. Similarly, it is necessary for the patient to conduct a period of home monitoring of blood pressure after implementing new or additional non-pharmacologic measures or following a change in treatment or dose.

Patients are recommended to check their blood pressures at home in the supine head-up position (at bedtime, prior to arising in the morning, and while in their normal head-up sleeping position). Patients taking pressor medications such as midodrine or droxidopa should avoid the supine position during the 4–5 hours after taking medication and should check blood pressure after 3 minutes of standing. We recommend checking blood pressures first thing in the morning before taking any morning medications, when symptomatic, and at bedtime for several days.

The blood pressure diary should be evaluated by the healthcare provider two weeks after any therapeutic change to determine the need for further adjustments. If blood pressure measurements have been stable, a reduction in monitoring frequency can be considered, but should be reinstituted if symptoms worsen or if medications are changed. Lastly, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can be considered so that there is a comprehensive assessment.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117EdaHs]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, little published literature is available on a "standardized approach" to the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension. As such, the recommendations of this panel, which were based on the discussions and experiences of the panel along with evidence in the literature, should provide clinicians with a useful working approach to dealing with this complex condition. The panel recommended that additional study in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with OH/nOH and associated supine hypertension is necessary. In particular, additional studies of the treatment of nOH should be conducted to refine the diagnosis and treatment algorithms and to provide definitive evidence of the efficacy and safety of medications that are currently used, but not approved, for the treatment of patients with nOH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension [^114nQSqq]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is an unusually large decrease in blood pressure on standing that increases the risk of adverse outcomes even when asymptomatic. Improvements in hemodynamic profiling with continuous blood pressure measurements have uncovered four major subtypes: initial orthostatic hypotension, delayed blood pressure recovery, classic orthostatic hypotension, and delayed orthostatic hypotension. Clinical presentations are varied and range from cognitive slowing with hypotensive unawareness or unexplained falls to classic presyncope and syncope. Establishing whether symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension requires careful history taking, a thorough physical examination, and supine and upright blood pressure measurements. Management and prognosis vary according to the underlying cause, with the main distinction being whether orthostatic hypotension is neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension might be the earliest clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies and often coincides with supine hypertension. The emerging variety of clinical presentations advocates a stepwise, individualized, and primarily non-pharmacological approach to the management of orthostatic hypotension. Such an approach could include the cessation of blood pressure-lowering drugs, adoption of lifestyle measures (e.g. counterpressure maneuvers), and treatment with pharmacological agents in selected cases.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133rvMG]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Guidelines, such as the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines, recommend blood pressure management with a target systolic blood pressure range of 130–139 mm Hg in older adults (≥ 65 years). The decision to initiate antihypertensive therapy in older adults and the choice of blood pressure target in this cohort require a trade-off between efficacy and safety, considering adverse events such as falls. A particularly challenging cohort of hypertensive patients to manage are those with concomitant orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension affects approximately 20% of adults, with prevalence increasing with age, and is an independent risk factor for injurious falls, as well as cardiovascular disease and mortality. Given the prevalence of both conditions and the aging population, the overlap of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension is likely to become an increasingly common dilemma for clinicians.

In some randomised controlled trials, individuals with orthostatic hypotension were excluded, either based on clinical history or objective measurement of orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Generalising findings from clinical trials to patients in routine clinical practice requires an understanding of whether such exclusion criteria alter treatment estimates of safety, especially among potentially vulnerable patients.

We sought to determine whether the association of antihypertensive therapy with adverse events, such as falls, fractures, or syncope, differs when patients with orthostatic hypotension are included.

### Predicting outcomes on head-up tilt based on orthostatic hypotension patterns [^111Mn8TE]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

To assess the frequency of different orthostatic hypotension (OH) patterns in patients having supine hypertension with OH ('SHOH') versus patients with OH and normal supine blood pressure ('OH alone'), and to relate OH patterns with outcomes on head-up tilt, consecutive patients with nonspecific dizziness were studied with a 10-minute supine, 30-minute head-up tilt test.

Supine hypertension was diagnosed when supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) was at least 140 mmHg and/or supine diastolic blood pressure was at least 90 mmHg. OH was defined as a SBP reduction of at least 20 mmHg within 3 minutes of tilt. OH patterns were identified corresponding to SBP time-curves during the initial 5 minutes of tilt: progressive, sustained, and transient patterns.

Among 400 patients tested, 31 had 'SHOH' and 39 had 'OH alone'. Frequencies of OH patterns were similar in both groups. The progressive OH pattern predicted symptomatic hypotension, leading to early tilt termination in all 'SHOH' and 88% of 'OH alone' patients. In comparison, tilt was early terminated in 33–48% of patients with sustained OH, transient OH, and without OH. Early tilt termination was unrelated to age, gender, magnitude of supine SBP, pulse pressure, and nadir SBP within 5 minutes of tilt.

Five minutes of postural challenge permitted assessing OH patterns. The outcome on protracted tilt was related to OH patterns, with the worse outcome being likened to progressive OH, both in patients with 'SHOH' and in patients with 'OH alone'. Future studies will show whether OH patterns may serve as guidance for blood.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^11547idc]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and peripheral neuropathies, including amyloid or diabetic neuropathy. Due to the frequency of nOH in the aging population, clinicians need to be well informed about its diagnosis and management. At the time of writing, studies of nOH have used different outcome measures and various methods of diagnosis, thereby preventing the generation of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practices' when treating patients with nOH and associated supine hypertension.

To address these issues, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation initiated a project to develop a statement of recommendations. This began with a consensus panel meeting in Boston on November 7, 2015, with continued communications and contributions to the recommendations through October of 2016. This paper summarizes the panel members' discussions held during the initial meeting, along with continued deliberations among the panel members. It provides essential recommendations based upon the best available evidence, as well as expert opinion, for the (1) screening, (2) diagnosis, and (3) treatment of nOH, and (4) diagnosis and treatment of associated supine hypertension.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypertension: Individual level meta-analysis [^117Uc8MW]. BMJ (2025). Low credibility.

Our study has limitations. Firstly, we identified only nine trials, which differed with respect to their interventions, frequency of follow-up, duration, blood pressure measurement procedures, and study populations. These differences might have influenced our results. Despite these differences, our findings were relatively consistent, and our sample was sufficiently large that additional trials are not likely to alter our pooled observation.

Secondly, generalizability to clinical practice may be limited owing to the strict entry criteria used by these trials, differences in prescribing regimens that might not reflect real-world drug choices, and careful monitoring and drug titration protocols that may affect titration patterns.

Thirdly, subgroup analyses relied on covariate definitions that were based on self-report and at times differed in definition across studies. Any resulting misclassification could weaken contrasts across subgroups, reducing our ability to detect differences. Moreover, we pre-specified our subgroups. Whether associations might differ across different categories (for example, younger age) should be examined in dedicated studies.

Fourthly, we did not examine antihypertensive drug class in this study, which should be a focus of subsequent work.

Fifthly, assessments of orthostatic hypertension were based on seated-to-standing protocols, which may not be interchangeable with supine-to-standing maneuvers. In the case of orthostatic hypotension, some authors have proposed modified thresholds for identifying adults with orthostatic conditions.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms associated with orthostatic intolerance [^112qcyg6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

The term orthostatic intolerance is used to describe symptoms of hemodynamic instability such as lightheadedness, fatigue, impaired cognition, and syncope that develop on assuming an upright posture. Common forms of orthostatic intolerance in childhood include postural tachycardia syndrome and neurally mediated hypotension.

- **Objective**: A descriptive report of the clinical characteristics of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms who are ultimately found to have orthostatic intolerance.

- **Methods**: A medical record review of all patients referred to the pediatric gastroenterology service at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center who had an abnormal tilt table test between June 1996 and December 2000.

- **Results**: Of 24 eligible subjects aged 9–17 years (mean, 14.3 years), four had postural tachycardia syndrome, eight had both postural tachycardia and neurally mediated hypotension, and 12 had neurally mediated hypotension alone. The most common presenting gastrointestinal symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The median number of gastrointestinal symptoms per patient was 3 (range, 1–7). A total of 87% of the patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms for more than 1 year, and 48% experienced them for more than 3 years. Follow-up information was available on 18 patients, with 78% of them (14 of 18) having complete resolution of symptoms with treatment of orthostatic intolerance.

- **Conclusion**: Pediatric patients with chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms may have underlying orthostatic intolerance.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on orthostatic hypotension: Data from the vitamin D in isolated systolic hypertension randomized controlled trial [^113B4aum]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension commonly accompanies supine hypertension and is associated with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. We tested whether high-dose intermittent oral vitamin D therapy could ameliorate orthostatic hypotension in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

- **Methods**: We conducted a subgroup analysis of data from a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients aged over 70 years with supine office SBP above 140mmHg and DBP below 90mmHg received 100,000 units of oral vitamin D3 or matching placebo every 3 months for 1 year. Office supine and standing blood pressure were measured at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, along with arterial stiffness and flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery.

- **Results**: Of 159 patients randomized to the main trial, 75 patients with orthostatic hypotension at baseline were included in this analysis. The mean age was 78 (SD 5) years, baseline blood pressure was 162/76mmHg, and the mean baseline orthostatic fall in blood pressure on standing was 32/5mmHg. After adjustment for baseline age, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, SBP, and orthostatic fall, the fall in SBP was less in the vitamin D group at 3 months (treatment effect 6mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 12), but repeated-measures analysis showed no significant treatment effect (3mmHg for systolic fall, 95% CI -1 to 8; 1mmHg for diastolic fall, 95% CI -1 to 3).

- **Conclusion**: Twelve months of intermittent, high-dose oral vitamin D3 did not significantly improve orthostatic hypotension in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

### Orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic disorders in the hypertension clinic [^1151Afwy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertension specialists are frequently consulted regarding orthostatic hypotension (OH) or the combination of OH with supine hypertension. These clinical presentations are often associated with a variety of underlying autonomic disorders. A comprehensive medical history and clinical examination, with particular attention to autonomic signs and the neurological system, may suggest a possible etiology or a differential diagnosis.

At times, drug therapy for hypertension or other diseases, such as Parkinson's, is temporally associated with the onset of OH. In other cases, no definitive association can be made. Most hypertension specialists are capable of initiating basic evaluation and treatment.

- **Treatment approaches**: Treatment for OH must primarily aim to alleviate symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion while also being cognizant of supine hypertension. Several lifestyle changes and drug therapies can ameliorate symptoms of OH. Short-acting antihypertensive therapy may be useful in controlling nocturnal supine hypertension.

### Management of hypertension in the setting of autonomic failure: A pathophysiological approach [^115dZAAz]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

We discuss two cases presenting clinically with disabling orthostatic hypotension and severe supine hypertension. This is a common presentation of autonomic failure, and one that challenges conventional treatment. Clinical findings of isolated autonomic failure were the most prominent manifestation in case 1, whereas a movement disorder was the key finding in case 2. The differential diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic hypotension is discussed from a pathophysiological approach. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of disorders of the autonomic nervous system is fundamental for effective management of these patients and provides insight into more common disorders such as essential hypertension.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A practical approach [^113612CJ]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more systolic or 10 mm Hg or more diastolic within three minutes of standing from the supine position or on assuming a head-up position of at least 60 degrees during tilt table testing. Symptoms arise from inadequate physiological compensation and organ hypoperfusion, including headache, lightheadedness, shoulder and neck pain (coat hanger syndrome), visual disturbances, dyspnea, and chest pain. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the community is 20% in older adults and 5% in middle-aged adults. Risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, increase its prevalence across all age groups.

Orthostatic hypotension is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk and falls, contributing to up to a 50% increase in the relative risk of all-cause mortality. Diagnosis is confirmed by performing a bedside simplified Schellong test, which involves blood pressure and heart rate measurements after five minutes in the supine position and three minutes after moving to a standing position. If the patient is unable to stand safely or if clinical suspicion for orthostatic hypotension is high despite normal findings on the bedside test, head-up tilt table testing is recommended.

Orthostatic hypotension is classified as neurogenic or nonneurogenic, depending on etiology and heart rate response. Treatment goals include reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Initial treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause and adjusting potentially causative medications.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^116i4f1V]. Age and Ageing (2022). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular interventions**:
	- Strong recommendation: Management of orthostatic hypotension should be included as a component of a multidomain intervention. GRADE: 1A. Interventions for cardiovascular disorders identified during assessment for risk of falls should be the same as those for similar conditions associated with syncope, in addition to other interventions based on the multifactorial falls risk assessment. GRADE: 1B.

- **Recommendation details and justification**:
	- Many multidomain fall prevention programs have included strategies to treat orthostatic hypotension, such as modification of possible culprit medications, rehydration, compression garments, and medications (e.g. fludrocortisone and midodrine). However, there are no single intervention studies for orthostatic hypotension in falls prevention. In older adults with hypertension, symptoms may be ameliorated by the judicious use of antihypertensive medications, titrated very slowly and with careful monitoring after changing the dose. For the management of syncope, it is advised to follow local syncope guidelines (e.g. European Cardiac Society Task Force on Syncope). Many multifactorial fall prevention programs that have shown benefit for fall prevention have included strategies to modify orthostatic blood pressure. The presence of more than one cardiovascular risk factor for falls is not uncommon. Clear causality for a single risk factor may be difficult to establish; therefore, all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors should be treated.

### Diagnostic and therapeutical management of supine hypertension in autonomic failure: A review of the literature [^114gtu7H]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension is defined as a blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg systolic or at least 90 mmHg diastolic in the supine position. It is present in over 50% of patients with autonomic failure and orthostatic hypotension but is often overlooked. While it may be related to antihypotensive drugs, its presence in untreated patients suggests a neurogenic origin. Although supine hypertension is often asymptomatic, it is associated with multiple organ damage.

There are no official guidelines on its treatment, and long-term benefits have never been proved. This review focuses on the management of supine hypertension, including nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches.

- **Drug evaluation**: All tested drugs have been individually revised, focusing on their hypotensive effect and their ability to act on ancillary targets, such as morning orthostatic tolerance or sodium urine excretion.

Moreover, the main pathogenic mechanisms and correct approach to the diagnosis of supine hypertension have been resumed.

### Clonidine for the treatment of supine hypertension and pressure natriuresis in autonomic failure [^117TN4xi]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with autonomic failure are disabled by orthostatic hypotension, which can be worsened by the nighttime pressure natriuresis induced by associated supine hypertension. Several pharmacological agents are available that effectively reduce nighttime hypertension, but none prevent pressure natriuresis. Due to the fact that hypertension in autonomic failure can be driven by residual sympathetic tone, we hypothesized that clonidine would be effective in reducing blood pressure (BP) and nocturnal natriuresis.

We investigated the effects of placebo, 0.1 mg clonidine, and a 0.1-mg/h nitroglycerin transdermal patch on supine BP, orthostatic hypotension, and pressure natriuresis in 23 patients with primary autonomic failure and supine hypertension. Medications were administered at 8:00 PM, and BP was recorded every 2 hours for 12 hours. The maximal decrease in BP was observed 6 to 8 hours after drug administration and was similar for both clonidine and nitroglycerin (-29 ± 9 and -30 ± 10 mm Hg, respectively), as was the average fall in BP throughout the night. However, only clonidine effectively reduced nocturnal natriuresis (-0.09 mmol/mg Cr; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04; P = 0.004). This reduction was not associated with an improvement in morning orthostatic hypotension due to a residual hypotensive effect.

Furthermore, the decrease in BP induced by clonidine was modestly but significantly correlated with the magnitude of residual sympathetic tone, as determined in 10 subjects by the fall in BP induced by ganglionic blockade (r = 0.66; P = 0.043). These results are consistent with residual sympathetic tone contributing to the observed effects.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: A hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common, heterogeneous, and multifactorial disorder. It is traditionally classified as either neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical, and delayed OH, as well as postural tachycardia syndrome.

Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. The majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms.

Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but these are not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods, and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Efficacy of treatments for orthostatic hypotension: A systematic review [^1128JS1i]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) affects up to 30% of adults over 65 and frequently contributes to falls and syncopal episodes. Guidelines suggest a wide range of treatments, but systematic reviews of the evidence base for such recommendations are lacking.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review to assess the evidence for all non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for OH. Our search included the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We also searched grey literature and references from included studies and other reviews. We included randomized, placebo-controlled trials that measured postural drop as an outcome. Study quality was assessed using pre-specified measures of bias.

- **Results**: Overall, 36 trials (21 interventions) were included. We identified a heterogeneous population and a wide variety of study methods, precluding meta-analysis. Most trials were of poor quality with a high risk of bias. Changes in postural drop and symptoms were frequently inconsistent. Compression bandages, indomethacin, oxilofrine, potassium chloride, and yohimbine improved the postural drop. Several vasoactive drugs, including midodrine and pyridostigmine, improved the standing blood pressure but overall worsened the postural drop.

- **Conclusions**: Many commonly recommended interventions for OH have a limited evidence base supporting their use. High-quality, randomized, controlled trials are needed to underpin clinical practice for this condition.

### Enalaprilat [^113VNMtL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Enalaprilat injection results in the reduction of both supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, usually with no orthostatic component. Symptomatic postural hypotension is therefore infrequent, although it might be anticipated in volume-depleted patients (see WARNINGS). The onset of action usually occurs within fifteen minutes of administration, with the maximum effect occurring within one to four hours. The abrupt withdrawal of enalaprilat has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. The duration of hemodynamic effects appears to be dose-related. However, for the recommended dose, the duration of action in most patients is approximately six hours.

Following administration of enalapril, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in patients with renovascular hypertension.

In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. In this study, there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

---

### Vasotec [^114US5Rp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Administration of Vasotec to patients with hypertension, ranging in severity from mild to severe, results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure, usually without an orthostatic component. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it might be anticipated in volume-depleted patients (see WARNINGS, Hypotension).

In most patients studied, after oral administration of a single dose of enalapril, the onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by four to six hours. At recommended doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours. In some patients, the effects may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Hypertension). In some patients, achieving optimal blood pressure reduction may require several weeks of therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of Vasotec have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of Vasotec has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance, with an increase in cardiac output and little or no change in heart rate. Following administration of Vasotec, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in patients with renovascular hypertension.

When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure-lowering effects of Vasotec are enhanced.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension: A systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113fpocK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH). To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Data sources**: The sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions.

- **Study selection**: The study involved randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (with a more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and lasted 6 months or more. Trial comparisons were among groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, with the outcome measured as OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing.

- **Data extraction**: Two investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias.

- **Data synthesis**: Five trials examined BP treatment goals, and four examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18,466 participants with 127,882 follow-up visits. The trials were open-label with minimal heterogeneity of effects across them. Intensive BP treatment lowered the risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included four additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged.

- **Limitations**: Assessments of OH were conducted while participants were seated, which may not fully capture OH occurrences in different postural changes.

### Orthostatic hypertension: When pressor reflexes overcompensate [^112R38se]. Nature Clinical Practice. Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypertension — a rise in blood pressure upon assuming an upright posture — is an underappreciated and understudied clinical phenomenon. There is currently no widely agreed-upon definition of clinical orthostatic hypertension, with definitions being operational within the context of particular studies. The underlying pathophysiology is thought to involve activation of the sympathetic nervous system, but the actual etiology is poorly understood.

Orthostatic hypertension is observed in association with a variety of other clinical conditions, including essential hypertension, dysautonomias, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been associated with increased occurrence of silent cerebrovascular ischemia and possibly with neuropathy in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, appreciation of the true incidence of orthostatic hypertension, elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology, and an understanding of potentially effective treatment approaches and their associated risks and benefits might all have major clinical significance. Orthostatic hypertension is an aspect of hypertension that is in need of further focused investigation.

### Randomised controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy: Does exclusion of orthostatic hypotension alter treatment effect? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114Xmwv]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, adhering to the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines. The meta-analysis was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO identifier: CRD42022337669).

- **Data sources and search strategy**: To reduce research waste, we extracted data from a recent meta-analysis of antihypertensive therapy by Albrasi et al. which we considered of sufficiently high quality. We limited our search to the time period not included in this review (14 April 2020 onwards). We systematically searched PubMed and Embase databases from 14 April 2020 to 26 May 2022. The search terms included are outlined in the Supplementary Appendix (eMethods I). Two reviewers (CR and RM) screened titles and abstracts using the Rayyan web application. The reference lists of included studies were also reviewed. Full texts of remaining articles (and where applicable records) were independently assessed by two reviewers (CR and RM), with eligibility based on the predetermined criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and when a resolution was not reached by discussion, a consensus was reached through a third reviewer (MOD).

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies were considered eligible if they were (i) randomised controlled trials, (ii) included adults greater than 18 years, (iii) evaluated antihypertensives compared with placebo, a combination of antihypertensive agents compared to fewer antihypertensives, or higher compared to lower blood pressure targets.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^116SXSde]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Defining supine hypertension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) involves specific criteria. According to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) hypertension guidelines, essential hypertension is characterized by a blood pressure consistently ≥ 140/90 mmHg. Supine hypertension in nOH patients is arbitrarily defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg while in the supine position.

General treatment guidelines recommend intervention for hypertension, but supine hypertension associated with nOH requires additional considerations. In patients with autonomic failure causing nOH, supine hypertension is common and part of the underlying disease process since these patients lack the normal blood pressure buffering mechanisms that offset hypertension. Frequent periods of orthostatic hypotension (OH) may lead to chronic activation of the renin–angiotensin system.

A supine systolic blood pressure of up to 160 mmHg should be monitored but does not generally warrant treatment, especially if the symptoms of nOH have improved. The long-term risks associated with supine hypertension need to be balanced with the short-term risks of OH. Expert recommendations for the management of supine hypertension in the setting of nOH suggest that supine hypertension requires intervention if systolic blood pressure exceeds the range of 160–180 mmHg. However, it should be noted that individuals with the largest drops in blood pressure upon standing (> 80 mmHg drop) will require significantly higher supine blood pressures to achieve a standing position. Therefore, permissive supine hypertension may be necessary.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116iWimA]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, specifically concerning the choice of antihypertensives for initial therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend switching blood pressure-lowering medications that worsen orthostatic hypotension to an alternative BP-lowering therapy. They advise against merely de-intensifying therapy for managing orthostatic hypotension in patients with supine hypertension.

### Orthostatic hypotension, cardiovascular outcomes, and adverse events: Results from SPRINT [^115WqAa5]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is frequently observed with hypertension treatment, but its contribution to adverse outcomes is unknown. The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) was a randomized trial of adults aged ≥ 50 years at high risk for cardiovascular disease, with a seated systolic blood pressure (BP) of 130 to 180 mm Hg and a standing systolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to a systolic BP treatment goal of either < 120 or < 140 mm Hg. OH was defined as a drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg one minute after standing from a seated position.

We used Cox models to examine the association of OH with cardiovascular disease or adverse study events by randomized BP goal. During the follow-up period (median 3 years), there were 1170 (5.7%) instances of OH among those assigned a standard BP goal and 1057 (5.0%) among those assigned the intensive BP goal.

OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events, the primary outcome, with a hazard ratio of 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78–1.44]. Moreover, OH was not associated with syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, injurious falls, or acute renal failure. However, OH was associated with hypotension-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits (hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.11–2.82]) and bradycardia (hazard ratio, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.19–3.15]), but these associations did not differ by BP treatment goal.

OH was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease events, and BP treatment goal had no effect on OH's association with hypotension and bradycardia. Symptomless OH during hypertension treatment was thus not linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

### Nocturnal blood pressure: pathophysiology, measurement and clinical implications. Position paper of the European Society of Hypertension [^113QETnv]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

- **Special populations**: Neurological disorders: Neurogenic supine hypertension represents a key sign of autonomic failure that is often due to autonomic neuropathy, which can be secondary to chronic conditions such as diabetes and paraneoplastic syndromes. It is defined as "primary" when due to inherited or neurodegenerative diseases affecting the autonomic nervous system, including synucleinopathies such as pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, and Parkinson's disease.

	- The prevalence of supine nocturnal hypertension is around 50% in primary autonomic neuropathy, and its pathogenesis involves factors such as baroreflex failure and increased vascular resistance. It is often associated with nocturnal hypertension, and the diagnosis involves measuring blood pressure in the supine position and performing 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The clinical features include silent hypertension, nocturia, and low orthostatic tolerance. Supine hypertension is associated with long-term consequences such as increased risk of heart failure, cardiac-cerebrovascular death, and target organ damage.

	- Treatment is challenging, with a priority on managing orthostatic hypotension due to short-term risks. Nonpharmacological approaches include head-up tilt nocturnal rest, evening snacks to induce postprandial hypotension, and avoiding antihypotensive drugs. Other methods include ingestion of abundant water and elastic stockings in the evening. Local heat and CPAP have also been shown to be effective but with a low level of evidence. Pharmacological therapy requires individualization, considering the risk-benefit ratio.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113sJq7p]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for orthostatic hypotension, more specifically with respect to midodrine, EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend administering midodrine (2.5 mg PO TID, increasing gradually up to 10 mg PO TID) as first-line treatment, either alone or combined with fludrocortisone.

### New horizons in orthostatic hypotension [^113XPiuX]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common disabling condition associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Much of the evidence available is derived from younger populations with chronic neurological disease, leading to uncertainty for the diagnosis and management of older people.

- **Objective**: To provide an overview of recent and emerging evidence for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of OH in older persons.

- **Methods**: A narrative review of recent studies, emerging therapies, and relevant regulatory updates.

- **Findings**: Revisions to the diagnostic criteria for OH include the duration of the blood pressure drop, specific criteria for initial and delayed OH, and OH with hypertension. Non-drug therapies remain the first-line treatment option, and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment appears to result in lower rates of OH. Recent evidence concerning the withdrawal of causative medication is inconsistent. Midodrine has recently become the only licensed medication for OH in the UK. Other emerging treatments include atomoxetine and droxidopa, but these require further evaluation. Many other agents may be used but are not supported by high-quality evidence. The increase in mortality associated with OH is less apparent in older people.

- **Summary**: OH remains common in older people. The new diagnostic criteria address some of the previous uncertainty, but evidence concerning the withdrawal of antihypertensives is conflicting. Midodrine is now the only licensed medication for OH in the UK, but non-drug therapies remain first-line, and fludrocortisone may be considered before midodrine.

### Management approaches to hypertension in autonomic failure [^1177HmZ9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address how supine hypertension, a common finding in autonomic failure, worsens orthostatic hypotension and predisposes patients to end-organ damage. This review explores both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management approaches for hypertension in these patients.

Recent findings indicate that hypertension in autonomic failure can arise from either sympathetic-dependent or independent mechanisms, depending on the site of autonomic lesions. Management strategies for supine hypertension should initially include simple nonpharmacologic methods such as avoiding the supine position during the daytime and sleeping in a head-up tilt position at night. Despite these measures, most patients will require pharmacologic treatment.

Several antihypertensive therapies are effective in lowering nighttime blood pressure in autonomic failure, although none improve nocturnal volume depletion or morning orthostatic tolerance. Treatment decisions must be individualized. Blood pressure monitoring and dose titration are essential, as patients with autonomic failure are hypersensitive to depressor agents due to the loss of baroreceptor reflexes.

Autonomic failure presents a unique opportunity to study blood pressure regulation independent of autonomic influences. Understanding the mechanisms driving supine hypertension is crucial for the treatment of autonomic failure and enhances our comprehension of cardiovascular regulation in other populations, including those with essential hypertension and elderly individuals with comorbid hypertension.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113oZczM]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for orthostatic hypotension, specifically with respect to physical and nutritional measures, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend increasing water intake to 2–2.5 L/day and salt ingestion to over 8 g or 150 mmol/day to effectively improve orthostatic hypotension.

### Population-based study on the prevalence and risk factors of orthostatic hypotension in subjects with pre-diabetes and diabetes [^1117rpX6]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The literature has shown that age, hypertension, and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures are risk factors for orthostatic hypotension. Age was positively related to orthostatic hypotension in our subjects with NGT and pre-diabetes but not in those with diabetes. This relationship may be due to higher mortality in diabetic subjects with orthostatic hypotension. Our study showed that both hypertension and diabetes were risk factors for orthostatic hypotension, and thus the risk of orthostatic hypotension is greater in diabetic subjects with hypertension than in nondiabetic subjects with hypertension. Our results also showed that supine blood pressure was associated with orthostatic hypotension. This result is consistent with an earlier finding that supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure is related to the fall of blood pressure after standing from a supine position. Conversely, antihypertensive agent use was not associated with orthostatic hypotension in our study. There may be an adjustment of the treatment regimen because of a side effect or related symptom, resulting in an underestimation of the relationship between antihypertensive agent use and orthostatic hypotension. Furthermore, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension decreased, followed by decreasing blood pressure after use of antihypertensive agents.

In summary, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 25.5% and 17.7% in subjects with diabetes and pre-diabetes, respectively. Pre-diabetic subjects do not have a higher risk of orthostatic hypotension than subjects with NGT, although the risk of orthostatic hypotension is evident.

### Canadian cardiovascular society position statement on postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and related disorders of chronic orthostatic intolerance [^1153yfc8]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, particularly in relation to pharmacologic therapy, the CCS 2020 guidelines recommend offering the following medications to improve symptom control in patients with POTS:

- **Medication recommendations**:
	- Midodrine, at a dose of 2.5 to 15 mg, every 4 hours up to three times daily.
	- Propranolol, at a dose of 10 to 20 mg, four times daily, to also reduce standing heart rate and improve exercise capacity.

### Hypotension unawareness in profound orthostatic hypotension [^112zpMwa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinicians depend on history given by the patients when considering the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: Patients with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 60 mm Hg from baseline during a head-up tilt table test were included. They were classified according to their symptoms during the head-up tilt table test. Localization of the cause of orthostatic hypotension was sought in each of these groups.

- **Results**: Eighty-eight (43%) patients had typical symptoms, 49 (24%) had atypical symptoms, and 68 (33%) were asymptomatic. The average decrease in systolic blood pressure was 88 mm Hg, 87.5 mm Hg, and 89.8 mm Hg in the typical, atypical, and asymptomatic groups, respectively (P = 0.81). Patients reported severe dizziness with a similar frequency as lower extremity discomfort. Backache and headache were also common atypical complaints. Patients with a peripheral cause of dysautonomia were able to sustain the longest upright position during the head-up tilt table test (21 minutes, compared with central dysautonomia [15 minutes]) (P = 0.005). There was no correlation between the cause of dysautonomia and the occurrence of symptoms during the head-up tilt table test (P = 0.58).

- **Conclusion**: A third of the patients with severe orthostatic hypotension are completely asymptomatic during the head-up tilt table test, and another quarter have atypical complaints that would not lead physicians toward the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. These findings suggest that they might not provide adequate information in diagnosing profound orthostatic hypotension.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: Orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^113r9Hzq]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

Blood pressure regulation is an automatic, moment-by-moment buffering of the blood pressure in response to physiological changes such as orthostasis, exercise, and hemorrhage. This finely orchestrated reflex is called the baroreflex, a regulated arc of afferent, central, and efferent arms. Multiple physiological changes occur with ageing that can disrupt this reflex, making blood pressure regulation less effective. Furthermore, there are ageing-related diseases such as neurodegeneration, atherosclerosis, deconditioning, and polypharmacy, which can exacerbate these changes. These factors commonly result in orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, or both and are consistently associated with multiple adverse outcomes.

- **Healthy baroreflex and Impaired function**: In this article, we discuss the healthy baroreflex, alongside physiological and pathophysiological reasons for impaired baroreflex function in older people.
- **Manifestations and treatment strategies**: We discuss why the common clinical manifestations of orthostatic hypotension and concomitant supine hypertension occur, and strategies for balancing these conflicting priorities. Finally, we discuss strategies for treating them, outlining our practice alongside consensus and expert guidance.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for orthostatic hypotension (OH), an accurate assessment of the underlying causes is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendations. A stepwise approach is recommended for the diagnosis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), specifically starting with the measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases.

- **Stepwise approach to the diagnosis of nOH**: The hallmark test for OH is the measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 minutes of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or a 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH, as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

- **In-clinic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate**: The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and then stand for 3 minutes, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 minute and 3 minutes post-stand.

### Treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome with medication: A systematic review [^115ji8H7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome has been recognized for decades, but treatment is largely based on anecdotal experience and expert opinion. Pharmacologic treatment is inconsistent and unstandardized. We conducted a systematic review to identify controlled studies from which informed treatment decisions can be made.

Through a standard systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we identified all English-language studies of medication treatment for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome that included a comparison or control group and followed outcomes for at least one week of treatment.

A total of 626 studies were identified by the search criteria, and 8, involving a total of 499 patients, met the criteria. No studies were adequately similar to allow for meta-analysis. Of the identified 8 studies, 2 were randomized controlled trials and 4 had been subjected to peer review. In individual studies, there was some favorable effect with fludrocortisone, beta blockers, midodrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

There is a paucity of high-quality data about the effectiveness of medication in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Nonetheless, 2 randomized trials and 6 other reports show some favorable effects of medication.

### Zelapar [^111V54Z1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension**: Assessments of orthostatic (supine and standing) blood pressures during the 12-week study period in two controlled trials showed that the frequency of orthostatic hypotension (defined as a > 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and/or a > 10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure) was greater with Zelapar treatment than with placebo treatment. Patients taking Zelapar were most likely to experience a decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks (2 weeks after initiating 2.5 mg Zelapar). At that time, the incidence of systolic orthostatic hypotension was approximately 21% in Zelapar-treated patients, compared to 9% in placebo-treated patients. Similarly, the incidence of diastolic orthostatic hypotension was about 12% in Zelapar-treated patients versus 4% in placebo-treated patients. This suggests an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension during the period after increasing the daily dose of Zelapar from 1.25 to 2.5 mg.

	- The incidence of orthostatic hypotension was higher in geriatric patients (≥ 65 years) than in non-geriatric patients. Among geriatric patients, orthostatic hypotension occurred in about 3% of Zelapar-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients.

- **Dyskinesia**: Zelapar may potentiate dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. In controlled trials, the incidence of dyskinesia was 6% in Zelapar-treated patients compared to 3% in placebo-treated patients. Decreasing the dose of levodopa may lessen dyskinesia.

### Association of history of dizziness and long-term adverse outcomes with early vs later orthostatic hypotension assessment times in middle-aged adults [^116vyhWw]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend assessing orthostatic hypotension (OH) 3 minutes after rising from supine to standing positions. It is not known whether measurements performed immediately after standing predict adverse events as strongly as measurements performed closer to 3 minutes.

The objective of this study was to compare early vs later OH measurements and their association with history of dizziness and longitudinal adverse outcomes.

This was a prospective cohort study of middle-aged participants, ranging from 44 to 66 years, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (1987–1989).

Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a drop in blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg) from the supine to standing position, was measured up to 5 times at 25-second intervals.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The association of each of the 5 OH measurements with history of dizziness on standing was determined via logistic regression. Additionally, the association with the risk of fall, fracture, syncope, motor vehicle crashes, and all-cause mortality was analyzed using Cox regression over a median of 23 years of follow-up, through December 31, 2013.

- **Results**: In 11,429 participants (mean age, 54 years; 6,220 [54%] were women; 2,934 [26%] were Black) with at least 4 OH measurements after standing. After adjustment, OH assessed at measurement 1 (mean [SD], 28 [5.4] seconds; range, 21–62 seconds) was the only measurement associated with higher odds of dizziness (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18–1.89) as well as the highest rates of fracture, syncope, and death.

### New horizons in the ageing autonomic nervous system: orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension [^113jNhog]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical consequences of an impaired baroreflex can manifest in various ways.

- **Orthostatic hypotension (OH)**: OH is an adverse prognostic indicator associated with poor outcomes across a wide range of conditions. Most immediately, it increases the risk of falls, syncope, and injury. It is also linked to cardiac diseases, including changes in carotid intimal thickness, increased carotid plaque, elevated cardiac injury biomarkers, heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and stroke. Ultimately, OH is associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes and all-cause mortality. Even in mid-life, its presence correlates with an increased risk of dementia and progression of cognitive impairment to both Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. Higher blood pressure variability is associated with a greater risk. Thus, OH heralds underlying sinister cardiovascular disease, and its presence should alert clinicians to address it promptly along with other cardiac risk factors.

- **Supine hypertension and OH**: Neurogenic supine hypertension commonly accompanies orthostatic hypotension, especially in neurodegenerative conditions affecting the autonomic nervous system. This is defined as supine blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 after three minutes. It initially manifests as reduced nocturnal blood pressure dipping, progressing to an absence of nocturnal BP dipping, and eventually a progressive rise in nighttime BP. The association between OH and hypertension may seem counter-intuitive but can be explained by impaired baroreflex sensitivity to respond to acute changes in blood pressure.

The immediate short-term consequence of these conditions is an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

### Continuous positive airway pressure for the treatment of supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension in autonomic failure [^11493BTz]. Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Supine hypertension affects most patients with orthostatic hypotension (OH) due to autonomic failure, but it is often untreated for fear of worsening OH. We hypothesized that increasing intrathoracic pressure with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had a Valsalva-like blood-pressure-lowering effect that could be used to treat nocturnal supine hypertension in these patients while reducing nocturnal pressure diuresis and improving daytime OH.

- **Methods**: In Protocol 1, we determined the acute hemodynamic effects of increasing levels of CPAP (0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 cm H2O, 3 minutes each) in 26 patients with autonomic failure and supine hypertension studied while awake and supine. In Protocol 2 (n = 11), we compared the effects of overnight therapy with CPAP (8–12 cm H2O for 8 hours) versus placebo on nocturnal supine hypertension, nocturnal diuresis, and daytime OH in a 2-night crossover study.

- **Results**: In Protocol 1, acute CPAP (4–16 cm H2O) decreased systolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner (maximal drop 22 ± 4 mmHg with CPAP 16) due to reductions in stroke volume (-16 ± 3%) and cardiac output (-14 ± 3%). Systemic vascular resistance and heart rate remained unchanged. In Protocol 2, overnight CPAP lowered nighttime systolic blood pressure (maximal change -23 ± 5 versus placebo -1 ± 7 mmHg; P = 0.023) and was associated with lower nighttime diuresis (609 ± 84 versus placebo 1004 ± 160 mL; P = 0.004) and improved morning orthostatic tolerance (AUC upright SBP 642 ± 121 versus placebo 410 ± 109 mmHg*min; P = 0.014).

Conclusions: CPAP is a novel nonpharmacologic approach for managing supine hypertension and improving orthostatic hypotension in patients with autonomic failure.

### Local passive heat for the treatment of hypertension in autonomic failure [^115mfoEZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension affects a majority of patients with autonomic failure; it is associated with end-organ damage and can worsen daytime orthostatic hypotension by inducing pressure diuresis and volume loss during the night. Because sympathetic activation prevents blood pressure (BP) from falling in healthy subjects exposed to heat, we hypothesized that passive heat has a BP-lowering effect in patients with autonomic failure and could be used to treat their supine hypertension.

- **Methods and results**: In Protocol 1 (n = 22), the acute effects of local heat (40–42°C applied with a heating pad placed over the abdomen for 2 hours) versus sham control were assessed in a randomized crossover fashion. Heat acutely decreased systolic BP by −19 ± 4 mm Hg (versus 3 ± 4 with sham, P < 0.001) owing to decreases in stroke volume (−18 ± 5% versus −4 ± 4%, P = 0.013) and cardiac output (−15 ± 5% versus −2 ± 4%, P = 0.013).

	In Protocol 2 (proof-of-concept overnight study; n = 12), we compared the effects of local heat (38°C applied with a water-perfused heating pad placed under the torso from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.) versus placebo pill. Heat decreased nighttime systolic BP (maximal change −28 ± 6 versus −2 ± 6 mm Hg, P < 0.001). BP returned to baseline by 8 a.m. The nocturnal systolic BP decrease correlated with a decrease in urinary volume (r = 0.57, P = 0.072) and an improvement in the morning upright systolic BP (r = −0.76, P = 0.007).

- **Conclusions**: Local heat therapy effectively lowered overnight BP in patients with autonomic failure and supine hypertension and offers a novel approach to treat this condition. Future studies are needed to further explore these findings.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^117BWmPw]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for orthostatic hypotension, specifically with respect to physical and nutritional measures, the EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend several physical strategies that may improve orthostatic hypotension. These include leg crossing, squatting, the use of elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise.
