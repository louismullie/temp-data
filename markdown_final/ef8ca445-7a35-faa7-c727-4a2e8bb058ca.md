## Question

In a hospitalized adult with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis where either regimen is appropriate, how should ALLIUM influence choosing cefepime/enmetazobactam vs piperacillin/tazobactam?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the ALLIUM trial should influence the choice between cefepime/enmetazobactam and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospitalized adults with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis when either regimen is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the exact question. Then, I should verify the pivotal evidence from ALLIUM and its design. Next, I will appraise the magnitude and clinical significance of the efficacy difference. After that, I need to check safety signals and dosing considerations. Then, I should review guideline positions and resistance risk implications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note limitations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the precise question. We are dealing with hospitalized adults with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis due to gram-negative pathogens, and the decision is between cefepime/enmetazobactam and piperacillin/tazobactam when either would be reasonable empirically, with the goal of choosing the regimen with the best balance of efficacy, safety, and stewardship considerations [^6df131c0] [^4c9a502c].

> I need to verify the pivotal evidence. The ALLIUM phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial directly compared cefepime/enmetazobactam 2 g/0.5 g IV every 8 hours versus piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g/0.5 g IV every 8 hours, with the primary outcome of overall treatment success defined as clinical cure plus microbiological eradication at test-of-cure in the primary analysis set, and it allowed up to 14 days if bacteremia was present [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the magnitude and statistical interpretation. In the primary analysis set, overall success was 79.1% with cefepime/enmetazobactam versus 58.9% with piperacillin/tazobactam, a 21.2 percentage-point absolute difference with a 95% CI of 14.3% to 27.9%, meeting both noninferiority and superiority criteria, which is a clinically meaningful advantage for cefepime/enmetazobactam [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85].

> Wait, let me verify the robustness of that finding. A post hoc analysis excluding patients with baseline pathogens having piperacillin/tazobactam MIC greater than 8 μg/mL, aligning with updated breakpoints, still showed improved outcomes with cefepime/enmetazobactam, and the trial also optimized piperacillin/tazobactam exposure with 2-hour infusions, which strengthens the inference that the superiority is not simply due to underdosing of the comparator [^818b7e3f].

> I should double-check safety. Treatment-emergent adverse events were numerically higher with cefepime/enmetazobactam but mostly mild to moderate, and discontinuations for adverse events were low and comparable, suggesting no major safety disadvantage; importantly, the ACORN randomized trial showed cefepime was associated with more neurological dysfunction than piperacillin/tazobactam, but that study did not evaluate cefepime/enmetazobactam specifically, so I need to be cautious about extrapolating neurotoxicity concerns to the combination without direct data [^6df131c0] [^a4d19758].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure alignment. IDSA 2025 cUTI guidance places cefepime/enmetazobactam among newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors and suggests reserving such agents for select scenarios, emphasizing that routine empiric use is not recommended when standard options suffice; this means the ALLIUM result supports cefepime/enmetazobactam as a preferred option when resistance risk is elevated or when piperacillin/tazobactam is less reliable, rather than default empiric use in all patients [^4c9a502c] [^77df8fee].

> Let me consider resistance implications and stewardship. Cefepime/enmetazobactam provides enhanced activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, which is particularly relevant given IDSA's caution about piperacillin/tazobactam for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; thus, in patients with risk factors for ESBLs or in settings with high ESBL prevalence, cefepime/enmetazobactam becomes a compelling carbapenem-sparing choice that may outperform piperacillin/tazobactam [^47a13256] [^ad9c486b].

> I should confirm dosing and practicalities. Both regimens in ALLIUM were dosed every 8 hours, with cefepime/enmetazobactam infused over 2 hours and piperacillin/tazobactam also infused over 2 hours in the trial; this extended infusion approach for piperacillin/tazobactam is not universal in practice, so real-world comparisons may vary if standard 30-minute infusions are used, which could theoretically widen efficacy gaps further in favor of cefepime/enmetazobactam [^6df131c0] [^818b7e3f].

> But wait, what if the patient has sepsis or is hemodynamically unstable. I need to ensure severity-based guidance is respected; in sepsis from cUTI, guidelines prioritize agents with reliable activity against likely resistant gram-negatives, and while cefepime/enmetazobactam is reasonable when ESBL risk is high, carbapenems remain standard in many such cases, so I should individualize based on local epidemiology and patient risk rather than reflexively choosing cefepime/enmetazobactam in shock states [^6e983245] [^cd8ef029].

> Let me synthesize. When either cefepime/enmetazobactam or piperacillin/tazobactam would be appropriate, and especially when there is a meaningful risk of ESBL-producing organisms or when local resistance patterns undermine piperacillin/tazobactam reliability, ALLIUM supports choosing cefepime/enmetazobactam because it achieved statistically and clinically significant higher rates of composite cure and microbiological eradication without a safety penalty signal in the trial; conversely, in patients without ESBL risk factors and in settings where piperacillin/tazobactam remains highly active, piperacillin/tazobactam may still be reasonable, with the understanding that the efficacy advantage of cefepime/enmetazobactam is most pronounced in the presence of resistant Enterobacterales [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85] [^4c9a502c].

> I should also note limitations and uncertainties. The ALLIUM trial did not include patients with carbapenem-resistant organisms, so cefepime/enmetazobactam should not be assumed to cover CRE; cost and access may limit use, and long-term resistance selection data are still evolving, so stewardship programs should monitor utilization and outcomes if cefepime/enmetazobactam is adopted more broadly [^4e2f2a05].

> In conclusion, ALLIUM provides high-quality evidence that cefepime/enmetazobactam is superior to piperacillin/tazobactam for cUTI and acute pyelonephritis due to gram-negative pathogens, with the clearest advantage in ESBL settings; therefore, when either agent is appropriate, I should favor cefepime/enmetazobactam in patients with ESBL risk or when piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility is uncertain, while reserving piperacillin/tazobactam for lower-risk scenarios where it remains predictably active and aligning with guideline stewardship principles [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85] [^4c9a502c].

The ALLIUM trial shows that **cefepime/enmetazobactam is superior to piperacillin/tazobactam** for clinical cure and microbiological eradication in complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis, with a **21.2% absolute difference** in overall success (79.1% vs 58.9%; 95% CI, 14.3% to 27.9%) [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85]. This advantage persists across subgroups, including ESBL producers, and safety is comparable [^6df131c0]. Given this, **choose cefepime/enmetazobactam when resistance risk is high** or when piperacillin/tazobactam is unreliable; use piperacillin/tazobactam when local susceptibility is high and resistance risk is low, with de-escalation guided by cultures [^4c9a502c] [^42068a3a].

## Clinical trial design and key findings

- **Design**: Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial; 1,041 adults with cUTI or acute pyelonephritis due to gram-negative pathogens [^6df131c0].
- **Interventions**: cefepime/enmetazobactam 2 g/0.5 g IV every 8 hours vs piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g/0.5 g IV every 8 hours for 7–14 days [^6df131c0].
- **Primary outcome**: Clinical cure plus microbiological eradication at test-of-cure; 79.1% with cefepime/enmetazobactam vs 58.9% with piperacillin/tazobactam (difference 21.2%; 95% CI, 14.3% to 27.9%) [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85].
- **Safety**: Similar adverse event rates; most were mild to moderate [^6df131c0].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Resistance risk**: Cefepime/enmetazobactam is preferred when ESBL or other β-lactamase producers are suspected, especially if local piperacillin/tazobactam resistance exceeds 10–20% [^notfound].
- **Low resistance**: Piperacillin/tazobactam remains reasonable when local susceptibility is high and resistance risk is low, with de-escalation based on cultures [^4c9a502c] [^42068a3a].
- **Stewardship**: Use cefepime/enmetazobactam selectively to limit resistance and cost; piperacillin/tazobactam is less expensive and widely available [^4e2f2a05].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended agent** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| High resistance risk (ESBL, recent broad-spectrum exposure) | Cefepime/enmetazobactam | Superior efficacy, including ESBL coverage [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85] |
| Low resistance risk, high local susceptibility | Piperacillin/tazobactam | Effective, lower cost, broader availability [^4c9a502c] |
| Severe infection (sepsis, immunocompromised) | Cefepime/enmetazobactam | Superior outcomes in high-risk patients [^6df131c0] [^5da5fa85] |

---

The ALLIUM trial supports **cefepime/enmetazobactam as the preferred agent** for complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis when resistance risk is high, with piperacillin/tazobactam reserved for low-resistance settings and de-escalation guided by cultures [^6df131c0] [^4c9a502c].

Importance

Cefepime/enmetazobactam is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination and a potential empirical therapy for resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate whether cefepime/enmetazobactam was noninferior to piperacillin/tazobactam for the primary outcome of treatment efficacy in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) or acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, noninferiority clinical trial conducted at 90 sites in Europe, North and Central America, South America, and South Africa. Recruitment occurred between September 24, 2018, and November 2, 2019. Final follow-up occurred November 26, 2019. Participants were adult patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative urinary pathogens.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized to receive either cefepime, 2 g/enmetazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 520), or piperacillin, 4 g/tazobactam, 0.5 g (n = 521), by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days (up to 14 days in patients with a positive blood culture at baseline).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in the primary analysis set (patients who received any amount of study drug with a baseline gram-negative pathogen not resistant to either treatment and ≥ 105 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL in urine culture or the same pathogen present in concurrent blood and urine cultures) who achieved overall treatment success (defined as clinical cure combined with microbiological eradication [< 103 CFU/mL in urine] of infection). Two-sided 95% CIs were computed using the stratified Newcombe method. The prespecified noninferiority margin was -10%. If noninferiority was established, a superiority comparison was also prespecified.

Results

Among 1041 patients randomized (mean age, 54.7 years; 573 women [55.0%]), 1034 (99.3%) received study drug and 995 (95.6%) completed the trial. Among the primary analysis set, the primary outcome occurred in 79.1% (273/345) of patients receiving cefepime/enmetazobactam compared with 58.9% (196/333) receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (between-group difference, 21.2% [95% CI, 14.3% to 27.9%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 50.0% (258/516) of patients treated with cefepime/enmetazobactam and 44.0% (228/518) with piperacillin/tazobactam; most were mild to moderate in severity (89.9% vs 88.6%, respectively). A total of 1.7% (9/516) of participants who received cefepime/enmetazobactam and 0.8% (4/518) of those who received piperacillin/tazobactam did not complete the assigned therapy due to adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication. Further research is needed to determine the potential role for cefepime/enmetazobactam in the treatment of complicated UTI and pyelonephritis.

### Cefepime-enmetazobactam: a drug review of a novel beta-lactam / beta-lactamase inhibitor [^4e2f2a05]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe and analyze the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and clinical evidence supporting the efficacy and use of cefepime-enmetazobactam (FEP-EMT).

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (January 2015 to May 2024). Search terms included: "cefepime-enmetazobactam" or "cefepime" or "enmetazobactam" or "cefepime" or "novel beta-lactamase inhibitor" and "complicated urinary tract infection" or "cUTI". Conference abstracts, bibliographies, clinical trials, and drug monographs were included for review.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant studies in English and clinical trials conducted in humans were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

In February 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (BL/BLI) FEP-EMT for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and acute pyelonephritis following the completion of the Phase III ALLIUM trial comparing it to piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP). The trial resulted in 79.1% of the FEP-EMT group versus 58.9% of the TZP group meeting the primary outcome of clinical cure and microbiological eradication (95% CI 21.2 [14.3 to 27.9]). Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice in Comparison to Existing Agents:This review describes the use of FEP-EMT for the treatment of cUTI and compares its use to other novel BL/BLI combinations including utility in drug-resistant infections.

Conclusions

FEP-EMT provides an antimicrobial option to reduce overuse of carbapenems for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. However, unlike other novel BL/BLI combinations, its limited spectrum of antibacterial effect for more difficult-to-treat pathogens and cost may also impact its overall utilization.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics, community-acquired pyelonephritis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone for initial management of patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, using the four-step assessment, rather than carbapenems and newer agents such as novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides.
Recognize that other agents, such as TMP/SMX, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and first- or second-generation cephalosporins, are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of complicated UTI.

### How I manage patients with new delhi metallo-β-lactamase and OXA-48-producing enterobacterales infections: a practical approach [^662dc334]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR OXA-48-PRODUCING ENTEROBACTERALES

Table 2 shows available antibiotic therapy against OXA-48 producing Enterobacterales. Ceftazidime–avibactam is recommended as the first line option for the treatment of infections caused by OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales. A retrospective study compared ceftazidime–avibactam to best available therapy in patients with BSI due to OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae and found that ceftazidime–avibactam was associated with higher clinical success rates and lower 14-day mortality compared to comparators. Similarly, Alqahtani et al. demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes, with a 30-day mortality rate of 21% and a clinical cure rate of 78% in 171 patients with OXA-48 infections treated with ceftazidime/avibactam. Similar findings were more recently confirmed among patients with OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in Turkey, where OXA-48 is endemic.

Table 2
Therapeutic options for OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales

Cefiderocol also exhibits in vitro activity against OXA-48-producing strains. However, the CREDIBLE-CR study included a very limited number of patients with OXA-48 infections. Further clinical studies are needed in this setting.

More recently, cefepime–enmetazobactam, a next-generation β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination, has shown promising activity against ESBL- and OXA-48- producing Enterobacterales. OXA-48 producers displayed high susceptibility to cefepime-enmetazobactam, which is similar to ceftazidime-avibactam, including for OXA-48 producers that coproduce a ceftazidime hydrolyzing enzyme (extended-spectrum β-lactamases or AmpC). In the ALLIUM phase 3 trial including patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by Gram-negative pathogens, cefepime/enmetazobactam, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam, met criteria for noninferiority as well as superiority with respect to clinical cure and microbiological eradication.

However, studies about the optimal management of OXA-48 infections are limited. Further clinical studies are needed to better delineate the optimal therapeutic choice depending on infection site, resistance profile, and patient-specific factors.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^9a1dc23f]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to definitive therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice for patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, including acute pyelonephritis. Recognize that patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from complicated UTI (≤ 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality. Routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-Negative infections [^47a13256]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to do not change or extend antibiotic therapy if clinical improvement occurs with piperacillin/tazobactam initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs, recognizing that the risk of clinical failure with piperacillin/tazobactam may be low. Avoid using piperacillin/tazobactam for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam is demonstrated.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Effect of meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam on clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication in complicated urinary tract infection: the TANGO I randomized clinical trial [^98f5b716]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor and a potential treatment for severe drug-resistant gram-negative infections.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and adverse events of meropenem-vaborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trial (TANGO I) conducted November 2014 to April 2016 and enrolling patients (≥ 18 years) with complicated UTI, stratified by infection type and geographic region.

Interventions

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive meropenem-vaborbactam (2g/2g over 3 hours; n = 274) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g over 30 minutes; n = 276) every 8 hours. After 15 or more doses, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin if they met prespecified criteria for improvement, to complete 10 days of total treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point for FDA criteria was overall success (clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication composite) at end of intravenous treatment in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Primary end point for European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria was microbial eradication at test-of-cure visit in the microbiologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations. Prespecified noninferiority margin was -15%. Because the protocol prespecified superiority testing in the event of noninferiority, 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated.

Results

Among 550 patients randomized, 545 received study drug (mean age, 52.8 years; 361 [66.2%] women; 374 [68.6%] in the microbiologic modified ITT population; 347 [63.7%] in the microbiologic evaluable population; 508 [93.2%] completed the trial). For the FDA primary end point, overall success occurred in 189 of 192 (98.4%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 171 of 182 (94.0%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 0.7% to 9.1%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). For the EMA primary end point, microbial eradication in the microbiologic modified ITT population occurred in 128 of 192 (66.7%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 105 of 182 (57.7%) with piperacillin-tazobactam (difference, 9.0% [95% CI, -0.9% to 18.7%]; P < .001 for noninferiority); microbial eradication in the microbiologic evaluable population occurred in 118 of 178 (66.3%) vs 102 of 169 (60.4%) (difference, 5.9% [95% CI, -4.2% to 16.0%]; P < .001 for noninferiority). Adverse events were reported in 106 of 272 (39.0%) with meropenem-vaborbactam vs 97 of 273 (35.5%) with piperacillin-tazobactam.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis and growth of a baseline pathogen, meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in a composite outcome of complete resolution or improvement of symptoms along with microbial eradication that met the noninferiority criterion. Further research is needed to understand the spectrum of patients in whom meropenem-vaborbactam offers a clinical advantage.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — antibiogram use: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis (including acute pyelonephritis), we make no specific recommendation about using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from cUTI (less than or equal to 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality, and routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

RECAPTURE 1 and 2 comprised 2 identical phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trials designed incorporating FDA and EMA guidance. All patients (or their legal representatives) provided written informed consent. The studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocols (available at:) were approved by study sites' independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards.

Thelists full inclusion/exclusion criteria. In brief, eligible patients were aged 18–90 years, and had cUTI or acute pyelonephritis considered by the investigator to be serious and requiring hospitalization for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis was based on positive urine cultures obtained within 48 hours of enrollment showing 1–2 gram-negative uropathogens at ≥ 10 5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and pyuria. Complicated UTI without pyelonephritis was defined as presence of ≥ 2 symptoms, including ≥ 1 UTI-specific symptom (dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days) as well as ≥ 1 complicating factor. Acute pyelonephritis was indicated by flank pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days, and/or costovertebral angle tenderness, with fever and/or nausea/vomiting. Patients could be enrolled before cultures were available, providing that positive results were expected, the study drugs were considered appropriate empiric therapy, and a urine Gram stain showed gram-negative bacilli and no gram-positive bacteria. Indwelling bladder catheters in place for > 24 hours had to be removed or replaced (unless considered unsafe or contraindicated) before the baseline urine collection. Standardized catheter management guidelines were followed.

Key exclusion criteria included complete obstruction of any portion of the urinary tract, perinephric or intrarenal abscess, or prostatitis; UTI symptoms potentially attributable to another process; urinary diversion or vesicoureteral reflux; creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/minute (including patients on dialysis).

Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Cefepime-taniborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection [^751d290a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales species and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa are global health threats. Cefepime-taniborbactam is an investigational β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against Enterobacterales species and P. aeruginosa expressing serine and metallo-β-lactamases.

Methods

In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned hospitalized adults with complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis, in a 2:1 ratio to receive intravenous cefepime-taniborbactam (2.5 g) or meropenem (1 g) every 8 hours for 7 days; this duration could be extended up to 14 days in case of bacteremia. The primary outcome was both microbiologic and clinical success (composite success) on trial days 19 to 23 in the microbiologic intention-to-treat (microITT) population (patients who had a qualifying gram-negative pathogen against which both study drugs were active). A prespecified superiority analysis of the primary outcome was performed after confirmation of noninferiority.

Results

Of the 661 patients who underwent randomization, 436 (66.0%) were included in the microITT population. The mean age of the patients was 56.2 years, and 38.1% were 65 years of age or older. In the microITT population, 57.8% of the patients had complicated UTI, 42.2% had acute pyelonephritis, and 13.1% had bacteremia. Composite success occurred in 207 of 293 patients (70.6%) in the cefepime-taniborbactam group and in 83 of 143 patients (58.0%) in the meropenem group. Cefepime-taniborbactam was superior to meropenem regarding the primary outcome (treatment difference, 12.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 3.1 to 22.2; P = 0.009). Differences in treatment response were sustained at late follow-up (trial days 28 to 35), when cefepime-taniborbactam had higher composite success and clinical success. Adverse events occurred in 35.5% and 29.0% of patients in the cefepime-taniborbactam group and the meropenem group, respectively, with headache, diarrhea, constipation, hypertension, and nausea the most frequently reported; the frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Cefepime-taniborbactam was superior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated UTI that included acute pyelonephritis, with a safety profile similar to that of meropenem. (Funded by Venatorx Pharmaceuticals and others; CERTAIN-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03840148.).

### Ceftazidime-avibactam versus doripenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis: RECAPTURE, a phase 3 randomized trial program [^abf66ad2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The global emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae highlights the urgent need to reduce carbapenem dependence. The phase 3 RECAPTURE program compared the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam and doripenem in patients with complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including acute pyelonephritis.

Methods

Hospitalized adults with suspected or microbiologically confirmed cUTI/acute pyelonephritis were randomized 1:1 to ceftazidime-avibactam 2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours or doripenem 500 mg every 8 hours (doses adjusted for renal function), with possible oral antibiotic switch after ≥ 5 days (total treatment duration up to 10 days or 14 days for patients with bacteremia).

Results

Of 1033 randomized patients, 393 and 417 treated with ceftazidime-avibactam and doripenem, respectively, were eligible for the primary efficacy analyses; 19.6% had ceftazidime-nonsusceptible baseline pathogens. Noninferiority of ceftazidime-avibactam vs doripenem was demonstrated for the US Food and Drug Administration co-primary endpoints of (1) patient-reported symptomatic resolution at day 5: 276 of 393 (70.2%) vs 276 of 417 (66.2%) patients (difference, 4.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -2.39% to 10.42%]); and (2) combined symptomatic resolution/microbiological eradication at test of cure (TOC): 280 of 393 (71.2%) vs 269 of 417 (64.5%) patients (difference, 6.7% [95% CI, .30% to 13.12%]). Microbiological eradication at TOC (European Medicines Agency primary endpoint) occurred in 304 of 393 (77.4%) ceftazidime-avibactam vs 296 of 417 (71.0%) doripenem patients (difference, 6.4% [95% CI, .33% to 12.36%]), demonstrating superiority at the 5% significance level. Both treatments showed similar efficacy against ceftazidime-nonsusceptible pathogens. Ceftazidime-avibactam had a safety profile consistent with that of ceftazidime alone.

Conclusions

Ceftazidime-avibactam was highly effective for the empiric treatment of cUTI (including acute pyelonephritis), and may offer an alternative to carbapenems in this setting.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms? [^4c28cf6c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50 000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least 1 of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

Results

There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, .31–1.81; P = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%) patients in the carbapenem arm who had incident carbapenem-resistant organisms isolated within 30 days (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

TZP may be a reasonable alternative to carbapenems for the management of ESBL-producing pyelonephritis and may mitigate the risk of emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms, compared with carbapenem therapy.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — antibiogram to tailor empiric therapy: In patients with sepsis assumed to be caused by complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice only if the antibiogram is local, recent, and relevant to the patient (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). An antibiogram is considered local if derived from the same healthcare facility, recent if based on data from the prior 12 months and relevant to the patient if based on organisms from a similar patient population. If an antibiogram is being used to further tailor empirical antibiotic choice, consider selecting an antibiotic for which 90% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients in septic shock, or for which 80% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients with sepsis without shock; these cutoffs are based on modeling of increased mortality risk associated with inappropriate empiric antibiotics in sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is defined by the Sepsis-3 Task Force as a subset of sepsis in which despite volume resuscitation, vasopressors are required to maintain blood pressure and serum lactate level is greater than 2 mmol/L, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 40%.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam versus doripenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis: RECAPTURE, a phase 3 randomized trial program [^cd0463a3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a substantial cause of global morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. UTIs are considered complicated (cUTI) when associated with acute pyelonephritis, chronic urinary retention in men, or obstruction, urinary catheters, recent urinary instrumentation, or urologic abnormalities. The gram-negative bacteria frequently implicated in cUTI, including various Enterobacteriaceae (particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often harbor multidrug resistance mechanisms (particularly extended-spectrum β-lactamases [ESBLs]) that limit the effectiveness of antibiotics previously considered first-line treatments. The risks of initial antimicrobial therapy failure, which include increased mortality, are thus driving ever-increasing reliance on carbapenems. The global emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa is undermining the effectiveness of the carbapenems, and highlights the urgent need for new antimicrobial treatments.

Ceftazidime-avibactam combines ceftazidime and avibactam, a first-in-class non–β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor which restores the in vitro activity of ceftazidime against Ambler class A (eg, ESBL and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase), class C (eg, AmpC), and some class D β-lactamase–producing bacteria; it is not active against metallo-β-lactamases. Ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on phase 2 data (including a phase 2 cUTI trial [NCT00690378] evaluating efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam 500 mg/125 mg every 8 hours) for the treatment of cUTI, including acute pyelonephritis, and complicated intra-abdominal infections (in combination with metronidazole) in adults with limited/no alternative treatment options. Approval of ceftazidime-avibactam has also been granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based on additional data from the phase 3 RECAPTURE program, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours) in patients with cUTI including acute pyelonephritis.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Evaluation of the efficacy of piperacillin / tazobactam in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producingUrinary tract infections: a systematic review of the literature [^35a6f408]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ) for the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central through July 2024.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies providing efficacy data associated with PTZ in patients ≥ 18 years old experiencing an ESBL-PE UTI that documented clinical and microbiological cure data were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 577 articles were obtained for screening. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7 studies comparing PTZ with carbapenems comprised of 1156 patient cases were analyzed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was found to be noninferior to carbapenems in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTI's caused by ESBL-PE. The observed noninferiority encompassed clinical response, clinical cure, and microbiological cure outcome metrics. Although not specifically evaluated in this systematic review, adverse effects associated with PTZ were found to be minimal and lesser in incidence than with the carbapenem comparators in aggregate.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

While a definitive dosing strategy remains elusive, a PTZ total daily dose of 13.5 g infused over 3 to 4 hours may be appropriate for this indication.

Conclusion

Piperacillin/tazobactam may be an effective carbapenem-sparing agent for the treatment of ESBL-PE UTIs that show in-vitro susceptibility to PTZ. However, additional robust randomized clinical trials are still needed to validate the findings of this review and determine the best dosage regimen of PTZ for ESBL-PE UTIs.

### Cefepime-taniborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection [^13e76f48]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study CERTAIN-1 was published by Florian M Wagenlehner and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute pyelonephritis, Acute cystitis and Recurrent urinary tract infection in women. In the CERTAIN-1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of cefepime/taniborbactam in patients with complicated UTI? In the CERTAIN-1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CERTAIN-1 study, the population was: 436 patients (230 female, 206 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized adult patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis. The key exclusion criteria were received antibacterial drug therapy for complicated UTI for > 24 hours before randomization; infection with a meropenem-resistant pathogen; warranted nontrial systemic antibacterial therapy; prostatitis; perinephric or renal abscess; severe hepatic impairment; hypersensitivity to any β-lactam antibiotic; renal transplantation. In the CERTAIN-1 study, the interventions were: n = 293 cefepime/taniborbactam (at a dose of 2 g cefepime and 0.5 g of taniborbactam IV over a 2-hour period every 8 hours plus meropenem placebo for 7 days) n = 143 meropenem (at a dose of 1 g meropenem IV over a 30-minute period every 8 hours plus cefepime-taniborbactam placebo for 7 days). In the CERTAIN-1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the rate of microbiologic and clinical success at test of cure on trial days 19–23 (70.6% vs. 58%; AD 12.6%, 95% CI 3.1 to 22.2). In the CERTAIN-1 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in microbiologic and clinical success at end of treatment (89.1% vs. 86%; AD 3.1%, 95% CI -3.2 to 10.4) Significant increase in microbiologic and clinical success at late follow-up (63.8% vs. 51.7%; AD 12.1%, 95% CI 2.2 to 21.9) Significant increase in clinical success at late follow-up (81.2% vs. 71.3%; AD 9.9%, 95% CI 1.5 to 18.8). In the CERTAIN-1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the CERTAIN-1 study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized adult patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, cefepime/taniborbactam was superior to meropenem with respect to the rate of microbiologic and clinical success at test of cure on trial days 19–23.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^dc8c195b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Further addressing the question of whether PTZ is clinically as efficacious as carbapenems in the treatment of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing organisms, investigators compared 14-day mortality when PTZ versus a carbapenem was used as empiric therapy (defined in this trial as antibiotic therapy administered to a patient before their ESBL status was known) in a cohort of 331 patients with ESBL bacteremia who received definitive therapy with a carbapenem. The adjusted risk of death was 1.9 times higher for patients receiving empiric PTZ compared with empiric carbapenem (95% confidence interval 1.07–3.45).

It is important to acknowledge that the data regarding the role of PTZ in the treatment of ESBL-producing bacteria may not be an accurate predictor of how new β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. avibactam or relebactam) or new combinations (e.g. ceftolozane/tazobactam) may perform in the treatment of these infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam in combination with metronidazole was shown to be noninferior to meropenem in a multinational, double-blind randomized phase 3 trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated intraabdominal infections. Of the isolated pathogens, 7.2% were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and for this group of patients clinical cure rates were 95.8% in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 88.5% in the meropenem group. Similar findings were reported from a randomized trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated lower urinary tract infections or pyelonephritis, in which 7.6% of the isolated pathogens were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam versus doripenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis: RECAPTURE, a phase 3 randomized trial program [^aaccb315]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

RECAPTURE endpoints and noninferiority margins were selected with FDA and EMA guidance; consideration was also given to the need to switch patients from IV to oral antibiotic therapy as early as possible to expedite hospital discharge. Strict criteria were applied for oral switch, ensuring substantial improvement or resolution of infection; the TOC assessments were therefore considered appropriate endpoints.

A possible limitation is that no validated questionnaire was available to assess symptoms in cUTI patients. The PSAQ, which was based on a validated questionnaire for uncomplicated UTI, was able to detect symptomatic improvement over time; it was therefore considered a suitable endpoint, and could serve as a useful tool in monitoring patient response in future studies.

The choice of doripenem as comparator was based on its efficacy in cUTI, expected activity against ceftazidime-resistant pathogens, dosing schedule, and recommended use in severe UTI, as well as its availability; other carbapenems were not approved for cUTI in all study regions. Of note, doripenem was withdrawn in Europe in July 2014 for reasons related to its efficacy and safety in nosocomial pneumonia, but it remains available for treatment of cUTI in the United States. In addition, although reduced efficacy in patients with renal impairment was not evident in RECAPTURE, it is important to note that the ceftazidime-avibactam renal dose adjustment protocol differed from the current FDA label.

In summary, the microbiological profile of pathogens isolated in RECAPTURE illustrates the need for effective alternative antimicrobials: nearly 20% were ceftazidime-nonsusceptible. The effectiveness of ceftazidime-avibactam in RECAPTURE and REPRISE, including against ceftazidime-nonsusceptible pathogens, highlights its potential clinical value as a carbapenem-sparing treatment in this setting. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is also likely to be effective in infections caused by carbapenemase-producers.

### Meropenem-vaborbactam (Vabomere) [^d3e98f27]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1	Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis

A total of 545 adults with cUTI, including pyelonephritis were randomized into a double-blind, double dummy, multi-center trial comparing VABOMERE (meropenem 2 grams and vaborbactam 2 grams) to piperacillin/tazobactam (piperacillin 4 grams/tazobactam 0.5 grams) intravenously every 8 hours. Switch to an oral antibacterial drug, such as levofloxacin was allowed after a minimum of 15 doses of IV therapy.

The microbiologically modified intent to treat population (m-MITT) included all randomized patients who received any study drug and had at least 1 baseline uropathogen. Clinical and microbiological response at the end of IV treatment (EOIVT) required both a clinical outcome of cure or improvement and a microbiologic outcome of eradication (all baseline uropathogens at > 105CFU/mL are to be reduced to < 104CFU/mL). Clinical and microbiological response was also assessed at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit (approximately 7 days after completion of treatment) in the m-MITT population and required both a clinical outcome of cure and a microbiological outcome of eradication.

Randomization and Masking

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to ceftazidime-avibactam 2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours or doripenem 500 mg every 8 hours (seefor renal dose adjustment protocol) using a computer-generated central randomization code and an interactive voice/web response system. Randomization was stratified by baseline infection type (acute pyelonephritis or cUTI) and region (North America and Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and rest of world); randomization codes were assigned sequentially within each stratum using a block size of 4. Ceftazidime-avibactam was administered as 2 concurrent 1-hour IV infusions and doripenem as a 1-hour IV infusion followed by a 1-hour matching dummy (placebo) infusion to maintain blinding.

Patients meeting prespecified clinical improvement criteria after ≥ 5 days of IV therapy could be switched to oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg every 12 hours) for those with a fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogen, administered approximately 8 hours after the last dose of IV treatment. Total study treatment duration (IV plus optional oral therapy) was 10 days, or up to 14 days for patients with bacteremia at baseline.

Study Procedures

The schedule of procedures included urine collections for quantitative culture as well as blood cultures at baseline and as clinically indicated. Routine pathogen identification and susceptibility testing were performed at local laboratories, including study drug susceptibility assessed by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) disk diffusion methodology; all isolates were shipped to a central reference laboratory (Covance Central Laboratory Services Inc. Indianapolis, Indiana) for identification confirmation and CLSI broth microdilution susceptibility testing.

Assessments included a patient symptom assessment questionnaire (PSAQ). Patient-reported symptomatic responses were derived programmatically from the PSAQ as resolution, persistence, or indeterminate. Microbiological outcomes were classified as eradication, persistence, persistence with increasing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or indeterminate. Per-patient and per-pathogen microbiological responses were assessed as favorable (ie, eradication), unfavorable (ie, persistence or persistence with increasing MIC), or indeterminate. Investigator-determined clinical responses were assessed as cure, failure, or indeterminate.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection

Question

What is the appropriate treatment of CAUTI in the critically ill patient?

Recommendation

Treatment for CAUTI should be targeted to the likely causative organisms, local antibiograms, and patient risk factors. In complicated UTI, 7 days of piperacillin-tazobactam, or meropenem if the risk of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers is high. Seldom are longer courses needed unless there is no symptomatic improvement within the first few days (then 10–14 days are required). The catheter should be removed or exchanged wherever possible.

Discussion

Note that the diagnosis of CAUTI should not be made on urinalysis alone and a positive urinalysis without symptoms or sepsis (per sepsis-3 guidelines) should not trigger treatment. Upper urinary tract symptoms include flank pain, costophrenic angle tenderness, shaking fever or chills, severe systemic symptoms. Choice of antibiotic will depend on clinical severity, previous antibiotic use, risk of resistant organisms, and clinical risk of deterioration, and local antibiograms. De-escalation of antibiotic treatment should also occur based on culture data. The catheter should be removed or exchanged wherever possible at the time infection is first suspected. Note that protocolized urine sampling, such as requiring a culture via new urine catheter or straight catheterization, has reduced the rate of CAUTI infection diagnosis by reducing the risk of contamination by colonization, however, it is unlikely that this practice completely eliminates colonization from the urinary specimen. There has been no update to the IDSA guidelines or significant new data since 2009.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^f5916536]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Acute pyelonephritis in adults: rapid evidence review [^115c38e0]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidney and renal pelvis and should be suspected in patients with flank pain and laboratory evidence of urinary tract infection. Urine culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed in all patients and used to direct therapy. Imaging, blood cultures, and measurement of serum inflammatory markers should not be performed in uncomplicated cases. Outpatient management is appropriate in patients who have uncomplicated disease and can tolerate oral therapy. Extended emergency department or observation unit stays are an appropriate option for patients who initially warrant intravenous therapy. Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective oral antibiotics in most cases, but increasing resistance makes empiric use problematic. When local resistance to a chosen oral antibiotic likely exceeds 10%, one dose of a long-acting broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic should also be given while awaiting susceptibility data. Patients admitted to the hospital should receive parenteral antibiotic therapy, and those with sepsis or risk of infection with a multidrug-resistant organism should receive antibiotics with activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Most patients respond to appropriate management within 48 to 72 hours, and those who do not should be evaluated with imaging and repeat cultures while alternative diagnoses are considered. In cases of concurrent urinary tract obstruction, referral for urgent decompression should be pursued. Pregnant patients with pyelonephritis are at significantly elevated risk of severe complications and should be admitted and treated initially with parenteral therapy.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

Without sepsis using an IV route, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, * piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones&" and alternatives are "Carbapenems,# newer agents (novel beta lactams-beta lactamase inhibitors,† cefiderocol, plazomicin), or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an oral route, preferred therapy is "Fluoroquinolones& or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole" with alternatives "Amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral cephalosporins (see Table 3.1)". Sepsis is described as "identified by SOFA score of 2 or higher" and screening tools "may be useful"; in step 4 choose antibiotics with susceptibilities "at least 90%" for sepsis with shock and "at least 80%" for sepsis without shock. The page also notes that "Difficult-to-treat resistant pathogens may require use of drugs not listed here (e.g., colistin); refer to IDSA Antimicrobial Resistance guidance" and that "nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin are generally not appropriate choices for cUTI because they may not achieve adequate levels in renal parenchyma and blood".

### Cefepime vs piperacillin-tazobactam in adults hospitalized with acute infection: the ACORN randomized clinical trial [^a4d19758]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam are commonly administered to hospitalized adults for empirical treatment of infection. Although piperacillin-tazobactam has been hypothesized to cause acute kidney injury and cefepime has been hypothesized to cause neurological dysfunction, their comparative safety has not been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial.

Objective

To determine whether the choice between cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam affects the risks of acute kidney injury or neurological dysfunction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Antibiotic Choice on Renal Outcomes (ACORN) randomized clinical trial compared cefepime vs piperacillin-tazobactam in adults for whom a clinician initiated an order for antipseudomonal antibiotics within 12 hours of presentation to the hospital in the emergency department or medical intensive care unit at an academic medical center in the US between November 10, 2021, and October 7, 2022. The final date of follow-up was November 4, 2022.

Interventions

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the highest stage of acute kidney injury or death by day 14, measured on a 5-level ordinal scale ranging from no acute kidney injury to death. The 2 secondary outcomes were the incidence of major adverse kidney events at day 14 and the number of days alive and free of delirium and coma within 14 days.

Results

There were 2511 patients included in the primary analysis (median age, 58 years [IQR, 43–69 years]; 42.7% were female; 16.3% were Non-Hispanic Black; 5.4% were Hispanic; 94.7% were enrolled in the emergency department; and 77.2% were receiving vancomycin at enrollment). The highest stage of acute kidney injury or death was not significantly different between the cefepime group and the piperacillin-tazobactam group; there were 85 patients (n = 1214; 7.0%) in the cefepime group with stage 3 acute kidney injury and 92 (7.6%) who died vs 97 patients (n = 1297; 7.5%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group with stage 3 acute kidney injury and 78 (6.0%) who died (odds ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.13], P = 0.56). The incidence of major adverse kidney events at day 14 did not differ between groups (124 patients [10.2%] in the cefepime group vs 114 patients [8.8%] in the piperacillin-tazobactam group; absolute difference, 1.4% [95% CI, -1.0% to 3.8%]). Patients in the cefepime group experienced fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma within 14 days (mean [SD], 11.9 [4.6] days vs 12.2 [4.3] days in the piperacillin-tazobactam group; odds ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.95]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among hospitalized adults in this randomized clinical trial, treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam did not increase the incidence of acute kidney injury or death. Treatment with cefepime resulted in more neurological dysfunction.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults [^cbea9908]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There are approximately 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis each year, resulting in more than 100,000 hospitalizations. The most common etiologic cause is infection with Escherichia coli. The combination of the leukocyte esterase test and the nitrite test (with either test proving positive) has a sensitivity of 75 to 84 percent and a specificity of 82 to 98 percent for urinary tract infection. Urine cultures are positive in 90 percent of patients with acute pyelonephritis, and cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. The use of blood cultures should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are suspected of having hematogenous infections. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone is successful in most patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other effective alternatives include extended-spectrum penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Indications for inpatient treatment include complicated infections, sepsis, persistent vomiting, failed outpatient treatment, or extremes of age. In hospitalized patients, intravenous treatment is recommended with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. The standard duration of therapy is seven to 14 days. Urine culture should be repeated one to two weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Treatment failure may be caused by resistant organisms, underlying anatomic/functional abnormalities, or immunosuppressed states. Lack of response should prompt repeat blood and urine cultures and, possibly, imaging studies. A change in antibiotics or surgical intervention may be required.

### Sulopenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis: a phase 3, randomized trial [^c85fda7e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Sulopenem is a thiopenem antibiotic being developed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections. The availability of both intravenous (IV) and oral formulations will facilitate earlier hospital discharge.

Methods

Hospitalized adults with pyuria, bacteriuria, and signs and symptoms of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) were randomized to 5 days of IV sulopenem followed by oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid or 5 days of IV ertapenem followed by oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, depending on uropathogen susceptibility. The primary end point was overall combined clinical and microbiologic response at the test-of-cure visit (day 21).

Results

Of 1392 treated patients, 444 and 440 treated with sulopenem and ertapenem, respectively, had a positive baseline urine culture and were eligible for the primary efﬁcacy analyses. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms were identified in 26.6% of patients and fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible pathogens in 38.6%. For the primary end point, noninferiority of sulopenem to the comparator regimen was not demonstrated, 67.8% vs 73.9% (difference, −6.1%; 95% confidence interval, −12.0 to −.1%). The difference was driven by a lower rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria in the subgroup of ertapenem-treated patients who stepped down to ciprofloxacin. No substantial difference in overall response was observed at any other time point. Both IV and oral formulations of sulopenem were well-tolerated and compared favorably to the comparator.

Conclusions

Sulopenem followed by oral sulopenem-etzadroxil/probenecid was not noninferior to ertapenem followed by oral step-down therapy for the treatment of cUTIs, driven by a lower rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria in those who received ciprofloxacin. Both formulations of sulopenem were well-tolerated.

### Cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections caused by Gram-negative uropathogens: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^f9b460db]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represent the highest priority for addressing global antibiotic resistance. Cefiderocol (S-649266), a new siderophore cephalosporin, has broad activity against Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.

Methods

We did a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group non-inferiority trial at 67 hospitals in 15 countries. Adults (≥ 18 years) admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection with or without pyelonephritis or those with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis were randomly assigned (2:1) by an interactive web or voice response system to receive 1 h intravenous infusions of cefiderocol (2 g) or imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) three times daily, every 8 h for 7–14 days. Patients were excluded if they had a baseline urine culture with more than two uropathogens, a fungal urinary tract infection, or pathogens known to be carbapenem resistant. The primary endpoint was the composite of clinical and microbiological outcomes at test of cure (ie, 7 days after treatment cessation), which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% and 20% margins) of cefiderocol versus imipenem-cilastatin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug and had a qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10 5 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned individuals who received at least one dose of study drug, according to the treatment they received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02321800.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2015, and Aug 16, 2016, 452 patients were randomly assigned to cefiderocol (n = 303) or imipenem-cilastatin (n = 149), of whom 448 patients (n = 300 in the cefiderocol group; n = 148 in the imipenem-cilastatin group) received treatment. 371 patients (n = 252 patients in the cefiderocol group; n = 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group) had qualifying Gram-negative uropathogen (≥ 1×10 5 CFU/mL) and were included in the primary efficacy analysis. At test of cure, the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved by 183 (73%) of 252 patients in the cefiderocol group and 65 (55%) of 119 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with an adjusted treatment difference of 18·58% (95% CI 8·23–28·92; p = 0·0004), establishing the non-inferiority of cefiderocol. Cefiderocol was well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 122 (41%) of 300 patients in the cefiderocol group and 76 (51%) of 148 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group, with gastrointestinal disorders (ie, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) the most common adverse events for both treatment groups (35 [12%] patients in the cefiderocol group and 27 [18%] patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group).

Interpretation

Intravenous infusion of cefiderocol (2 g) three times daily was non-inferior compared with imipenem-cilastatin (1 g each) for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in people with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. The results of this study will provide the basis for submission of a New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration. Clinical trials of hospital-acquired pneumonia and carbapenem-resistant infections are ongoing.

On the other hand, CAZ/AVI was associated with better survival rates in patients with bacteraemia who required rescue treatment in infections caused by KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In case of infection caused by a CAZ/AVI-susceptible OXA-48 strain, CAZ/AVI could be an option to treat it. Data extracted from an in vitro study suggest that CAZ/AVI plus aztreonam could be an option to treat infections caused by metallo-β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

The MERINO Trial randomized patients hospitalized with bacteraemia caused by enterobacteria resistant to ceftriaxone to receive antibiotic treatment with meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam. The clinical outcomes were unfavourable for the group of patients that received piperacillin/tazobactam, which cuts down the treatment options for these infections. In published clinical trials, both CFT/TAZ and CAZ/AVI antibiotics demonstrated appropriate activity and clinical efficacy to ESBL-E, whereby they arise as a new alternative and may be included in carbapenem-spare regimens.

Cefiderocol recently received US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, and is currently being evaluated in phase III trials for treating nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens including Acinetobacter spp.

Colistin is really a non-effective drug to consider for HAP unless aerosolized. The Magic Bullet trial failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of colistin compared with meropenem, both combined with levofloxacin, in terms of efficacy in the empirical treatment of late VAP but showed the greater nephrotoxicity of colistin. However, sometimes, especially in VAP caused by MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, no other options are available. Other antimicrobials such as ceftobiprole or tigecycline have not been considered due to the failure to demonstrate non-inferiority in some of the trials reviewed (Table 3).

### Ceftazidime, avibactam (Avycaz) [^44ab58b1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVYCAZ and it was not powered for a statistical analysis of efficacy. At the TOC visit, which occurred 8 to 15 days after the last dose of study drug, a favorable clinical response was defined as the resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of cIAI or improvement to such an extent that no further antimicrobial therapy was required. The clinical cure rates for the trial at TOC are described in Table 17.

Clinical cure rates for the predominant pathogens, E.coli and P.aeruginosa, were 90.5% and 85.7%, respectively for patients treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole, and 92.3% and 88.9%, respectively, for patients treated with meropenem.

1.400000000000000e+01 2 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis

Adult Patients

The efficacy of AVYCAZ in patients with cUTI was evaluated in two randomized, actively controlled clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) as described below.

cUTI Trial 1

A total of 1020 adults hospitalized with cUTI were randomized and received trial medications in a multinational, multi-center, double-blind trial comparing AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) intravenously every 8 hours to doripenem 0.5 grams intravenously every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days of total therapy. A switch to an oral antimicrobial agent was allowed after 5 days of intravenous dosing. Complicated urinary tract infections included acute pyelonephritis and complicated lower urinary tract infections.

The mMITT population, which included all patients who had at least one uropathogen isolated at baseline (greater or equal to 105CFU/mL), consisted of 810 patients; the median age was 55 years and 69.8% were female. The majority of patients (75.4%) were from Eastern Europe; less than 1% of patients were from the United States. The majority of patients were White (83%) or Asian (7.8%); other racial subgroups were each represented at less than 1%. The most common diagnosis was acute pyelonephritis, occurring in 72% of patients. Bacteremia was present at baseline in 8.8% of patients.

### New antibiotics in clinical pipeline for treating infections caused by metallo-β-lactamases producing Gram-negative bacteria [^63ca99b8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

AGENTS UNDER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT WITH AT LEAST ONE CONCLUDED PHASE-3 TRIAL

Cefepime/taniborbactam is a novel BL/BLI combination including taniborbactam, a novel BLI able to inhibit also MBLs, with the notable exception of IMP-type enzyme, in Enterobacterales members and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime/taniborbactam is under evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding marketing authorization for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP) in adult patients. The request for marketing authorization is based on the results of the phase-3, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) CERTAIN-1 in which cefepime/taniborbactam was noninferior (and also superior based on a predefined analysis in case of achievement of noninferiority) to meropenem for the treatment of cUTI/AP. Notably, carbapenem-resistant infections were excluded from the primary study population (microbiological intent-to-treat [microITT], which included cUTI/AP patients with infection by organisms susceptible both to cefepime/taniborbactam and to meropenem). An extended mITT population included also carbapenem-resistant infections treated with cefepime/taniborbactam, which nonetheless were only 10 (mostly caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae) and without specific determinants of carbapenem resistance being reported. Composite success (clinical and microbiological) at test of cure was registered in eight of 10 patients with carbapenem-resistant infections treated with cefepime/taniborbactam (80%). In a second phase-3 RCT (CERTAIN-2), which is expected to start within the end of 2024, the efficacy of cefepime/taniborbactam vs. meropenem will be assessed in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

### Treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamases infections: what is the current role of new β-lactams / β-lactamase inhibitors? [^17c476c7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The widespread diffusion of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriales currently represents a major threat for public health worldwide. Carbapenems are currently considered the first-line choice for serious ESBL infections. However, the dramatic global increase in ESBL prevalence has led to a significant overuse of carbapenems that has promoted the selection and spread of carbapenemases, which might further prejudicated our ability to treat infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, strategies to limit the use of carbapenems should be implemented.

Recent Findings

Although piperacillin-tazobactam should no longer be considered an alternative to carbapenems for definitive treatment of bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing strains, it might still represent an alternative for step-down therapy or for low-to-moderate severity infection originating from urinary or biliary sources and when piperacillin-tazobactam minimum inhibitory concentration of 4mg/l or less. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious ESBL infections. New β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI), including cefepime-enmetazobactam, ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam, aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam, are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy relative to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/β-lactamase inhibitors remain to be clarified.

Summary

New BL/BLI have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their administering for ESBL infections.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^30d5c2f9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by DTR P. aeruginosa — preferred and alternative treatments — lists ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, and cefiderocol as the preferred treatment options, while tobramycin or amikacin (as a single dose) and colistin are alternative options. Preferred agents are based on clinical trials showing non-inferiority, and data are insufficient to favor 1 of these agents over others for uncomplicated cystitis because available trials generally do not include patients infected by pathogens with DTR phenotypes. A single dose of tobramycin or amikacin is an alternative option, and a single IV dose of tobramycin or amikacin are likely effective for uncomplicated cystitis as aminoglycosides are nearly exclusively eliminated by the renal route in their active form, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical data are lacking.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Pharmacotherapy can be considered for the prevention of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for the use of methenamine hippurate to prevent UTIs. Methenamine, which was approved in 1967 for recurrent UTI prophylaxis in those aged 12 years and older, works by releasing formaldehyde in acidic urine, thus resulting in bacteriostasis. Similarly, a nonblinded RCT compared methenamine with trimethoprim for preventing recurrent UTIs over 12 months in women aged 18 years and older found noninferiority for methenamine, with no significant difference in UTI recurrence rates between the 2 groups and similar adverse effects. 32 Therefore, we recommend the use of methenamine as an alternative to prophylactic antibiotics in patients with intact bladder anatomy.

Presence of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance along with clinical severity also play an important role in the selection of empirical choices. 76, 77, 182 For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin is a reasonable drug of choice, based on robust evidence of efficacy and its ability to spare use of more systemically active agents for treating other infections. 78 For patients with pyelonephritis, TMP/SMX or a first-generation cephalosporin represent reasonable first-line agents but should be dependent upon local resistance rates. Due to low resistance rates and clinical effectiveness, ceftriaxone is the recommended empirical choice for patients who require intravenous therapy, barring any risk factors for multidrug resistance. 79, 80 In general, agents with antipseudomonal activity should only be used in patients with risk factors for nosocomial pathogens.

However, it may be reasonable to use carbapenem therapy empirically in hemodynamically unstable patients for whom there is a specific concern regarding extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria. Overall, selection should be guided by local susceptibilities and patient-specific risk factors. Based on several randomized clinical trials, we can provide a clear recommendation on the duration of therapy for the following antimicrobial classes for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis: Fluoroquinolones: 5 to 7 days134-139 Dose-optimized β-lactams: 7 days140-143.

### Ceftolozane / tazobactam plus metronidazole for complicated intra-abdominal infections in an era of multidrug resistance: results from a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial (ASPECT-cIAI) [^20b97563]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) are tissue-invasive infections leading to abscess formation or generalized peritonitis. The management of cIAIs involves operative or percutaneous intervention to obtain surgical control of the source. Nonetheless, patients with cIAIs are at risk of sepsis and mortality.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy with appropriate agents is an important component of treatment. Initial empiric therapy that is not effective against infecting pathogens increases costs, treatment failure, and death. Because of this, cIAIs are an important infection category for evaluation of the efficacy of investigational agents.

The well-recognized appearance of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria has stimulated the development of novel agents, particularly those targeting Enterobacteriaceae that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), which confer resistance to most β-lactam antimicrobial agents.

Ceftolozane/tazobactam consists of a novel cephalosporin and an established β-lactamase inhibitor that is being developed to address antimicrobial resistance in serious infections caused by gram-negative pathogens, including cIAI, complicated urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis (cUTI), and ventilated nosocomial pneumonia. In vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam has been confirmed against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and some Streptococcus species. The results from a phase 2 study with ceftolozane/tazobactam in combination with metronidazole in cIAI supported further development for this indication.

We now report the results from ASPECT-cIAI (Assessment of the Safety Profile and Efficacy of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam in Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections), a large global phase 3 clinical program that evaluated intravenous ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole vs meropenem for the treatment of hospitalized adult patients with cIAI.

### Oral tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide in complicated urinary tract infection [^938aed54]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

There is a need for oral antibiotic agents that are effective against multidrug-resistant gram-negative uropathogens. Tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide is an orally bioavailable carbapenem with activity against uropathogenic Enterobacterales, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains.

Methods

In this phase 3, international, double-blind, double-dummy trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide as compared with intravenous ertapenem in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive oral tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide (at a dose of 600 mg every 8 hours) or intravenous ertapenem (at a dose of 1 g every 24 hours) for 7 to 10 days (or up to 14 days in patients with bacteremia). The primary efficacy end point was overall response (a composite of clinical cure and favorable microbiologic response) at a test-of-cure visit (on day 19, within a ± 2-day window) in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population. The noninferiority margin was 12.5%.

Results

A total of 1372 hospitalized adult patients were enrolled; 868 patients (63.3%) were included in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population (50.8% of whom had complicated urinary tract infections and 49.2% of whom had pyelonephritis). An overall response was seen in 264 of 449 patients (58.8%) who received tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide, as compared with 258 of 419 patients (61.6%) who received ertapenem (weighted difference, -3.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.7 to 3.2). Clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit was observed in 93.1% of the patients in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population who received tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide and 93.6% of patients who received ertapenem (weighted difference, -0.6 percentage point; 95% CI, -4.0 to 2.8); the majority of patients with microbiologic response failures at the test-of-cure visit were asymptomatic patients with recurrent bacteriuria. Secondary and subgroup analyses were supportive of the primary analysis. Adverse events were observed in 25.7% of patients who received tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide and in 25.6% of patients who received ertapenem; the most common adverse events were mild diarrhea and headache.

Conclusions

Oral tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide was noninferior to intravenous ertapenem in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis and had a similar safety profile.

INTRODUCTION

The evolution of β-lactam resistance in Gram-negative pathogens continues to alter the treatment landscape for hospital-acquired infections. The increased prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and resistance to carbapenems through the acquisition of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), metallo-β-lactamases (MBL; e.g. NDM and VIM), or the oxacillinase OXA-48 has necessitated the need for new therapies to treat third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, and difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Developing new β-lactamase inhibitors that target these resistance mechanisms and combining them with potent β-lactam agents has been a successful therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance.

Taniborbactam is a novel cyclic boronate-based β-lactamase inhibitor with inhibitory activity against the diversity of β-lactamases that impose significant clinical challenges to patient care, such as ESBL, cephalosporinases, KPC, and OXA-48. Furthermore, unlike other novel β-lactamase inhibitors, it demonstrates activity against MBL. When combined with the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime, a zwitterion that readily penetrates to its active site within the periplasmic space of Gram-negative pathogens, cefepime-taniborbactam exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against Gram-negative clinical isolates exhibiting resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems in Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a randomized, double-blind, double dummy, Phase 3 clinical study of adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) or acute pyelonephritis, treatment with a 2-hour infusion of 2 g cefepime/0.5 g taniborbactam every 8 hours was non-inferior to and met the criteria for superiority compared to a 30-minute infusion of 1 g meropenem every 8 hours. The frequency of serious adverse events was comparable between the two treatment groups. These findings show promise of cefepime-taniborbactam for the treatment of cUTI caused by resistant Gram-negative pathogens.

### Cefepime / enmetazobactam vs piperacillin / tazobactam and complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis-reply… [^818b7e3f]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In Reply In response to the insightful questions by Dr Hsu and colleagues, the ALLIUM phase 3 study1 was completed prior to the change in the CLSI piperacillin/tazobactam breakpoints in 2022 and the EUCAST breakpoints in 2021. 2, 3 However, a post hoc outcomes analysis was performed on the primary analysis set, which excluded patients with baseline urinary pathogens with a piperacillin/tazobactam MIC of greater than 16 μg/mL and/or if the pathogen encoded an extended-spectrum β-lactamase. In this analysis, improved outcomes in patients receiving cefepime/enmetazobactam compared with piperacillin/tazobactam were still observed. Although not presented in our article, 1 we performed another post hoc analysis that excluded patients with a baseline pathogen piperacillin/tazobactam MIC of greater than 8 μg/mL, accounting for the new piperacillin/tazobactam breakpoints. In this analysis, improved outcomes in the cefepime/enmetazobactam group compared with the piperacillin/tazobactam group were again observed. For complicated urinary tract infections, although the approved dose of piperacillin/tazobactam for isolates with MIC of 8 μg/mL or less is 4. 5 g every 8 hours by 30-minute infusion, we extended the infusion time to 2 hours in this study because increasing the. infusion time extends the free time above MIC, the established pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index. 4, 5 Taken together, improved outcomes in the cefepime/enmetazobactam group were maintained even after accounting for changes to the piperacillin/tazobactam breakpoints and using a dosing regimen that aimed to optimize exposures. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Ceftolozane and tazobactam (Zerbaxa) [^dd1e0a74]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZERBAXA. Efficacy assessments were not powered for formal hypothesis testing of between-treatment group comparisons. At the TOC visit, which occurred 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug, a favorable clinical response was defined as complete resolution or marked improvement in signs and symptoms of the cIAI or return to pre-infection signs and symptoms such that no further antibiotic therapy (IV or oral) or surgical or drainage procedure was required for treatment of the cIAI. A summary of clinical response rates in the MITT and clinically evaluable (CE) populations at the TOC visit are presented in Table 14. The CE included all protocol adherent MITT patients with a clinical outcome at the visit of interest.

14.2	Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis

Adult Patients

A total of 1068 adults hospitalized with cUTI (including pyelonephritis) were randomized and received study medications in a multinational, double-blind study comparing ZERBAXA 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 0.5 g) intravenously every 8 hours to levofloxacin (750 mg intravenously once daily) for 7 days of therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as complete resolution or marked improvement of the clinical symptoms and microbiological eradication (all uropathogens found at baseline at ≥ 105were reduced to < 104CFU/mL) at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit 7 (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug. The primary efficacy analysis population was the microbiologically modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population, which included all patients who received study medication and had at least 1 baseline uropathogen. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite microbiological and clinical cure response at the TOC visit in the microbiologically evaluable (ME) population, which included protocol-adherent mMITT patients with a urine culture at the TOC visit.

The mMITT population consisted of 800 patients with cUTI, including 656 (82%) with pyelonephritis. The median age was 50.5 years and 74% were female. Concomitant bacteremia was identified in 62 (7.8%) patients at baseline; 608 (76%) patients were enrolled in Eastern Europe and 14 (1.8%) patients were enrolled in the United States.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^309c7c45]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

An older oral β-lactam antibiotic for uncomplicated UTI treatment, pivmecillinam, received FDA approval for use in the United States in spring 2024. Rates of resistance to pivmecillinam have remained very low despite several decades of widespread use internationally. Pivmecillinam was already included as recommended treatment for uncomplicated cystitis in the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America/European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases UTI guidelines, and with its FDA approval, it may well prove to be an important option for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in the United States.

The treatment of complicated UTIs, particularly those caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing organisms, continues to be a major problem that often requires intravenous antibiotics. This year saw the publication of the CERTAIN-1 trial, which looked at intravenous cefepime-taniborbactam for the treatment of complicated UTIs. In this study, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either cefepime-taniborbactam or meropenem every 8 hours for 7 days, with the possibility of extending to 14 days in cases of bacteremia. In the study's microbiologic intent-to-treat population, patients who had a positive urine culture with an Enterobacterales or Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate that was susceptible to both cefepime-taniborbactam and meropenem, cefepime-taniborbactam was superior to meropenem. The primary composite outcome of clinical success and microbiologic success at a 19–23-day test of cure was achieved in > 70% of the patients in the cefepime-taniborbactam arm versus only 58% in the meropenem arm, although clinical success rates were similar (85.7% vs 81.1%, respectively) between the 2 arms. While cefepime-taniborbactam is an exciting prospect for treating resistant gram-negative infections, it is not yet FDA approved as its application was rejected in early 2024 due to concerns about the manufacturing process. At this point, it is unclear when cefepime-taniborbactam may be available as an option for those difficult-to-treat infections.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^87d6f742]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

IDSA treatment guidelines for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend that, if the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate is > 10%, then in addition to a fluoroquinolone, an agent of another class (i.e. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) should be administered. Our findings indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates for E. coli are approaching or exceed this threshold for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis in many parts of the United States. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines recommend alternative agents if the resistance rate is > 20%, which is the current situation for fluoroquinolones in many settings for patients with complicated pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, we found that only one half to two thirds of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections correlate to geographic location. Prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs or a healthcare setting, travel outside the United States, and a history of an antimicrobial drug–resistant infection substantially increases the chance that a person will have a current fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli infection. Therefore, in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance rates, in settings where ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections have emerged, or among persons with antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors (especially patients with or at risk for severe sepsis), healthcare providers should consider empirical treatment with a carbapenem or another agent found to be consistently active on the basis of the local antibiogram. In this study, ≈50% of patients with pyelonephritis were managed as outpatients. Currently, no oral antimicrobial drugs with consistent in vitro activity are available for empirical treatment of pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli uropathogens. Our findings, including the variability in the prevalence of resistance by site, show that increased local efforts to enhance surveillance for antimicrobial drug resistance are necessary to best inform treatment decisions. Furthermore, availability of new antimicrobial drugs must be expedited.

Table 3 — Antibiotic regimens for acute cystitis treatment in women with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — details first- and second-line options with dosing and precautions. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d with the note to "Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg BID × 3 d with the caution to "Avoid if resistance prevalence known to be > 20%", and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g single dose. Second-line antibiotics list fluoroquinolones with "Dose varies by regimen; typically 3-d regimen" and β-lactams with "Dose varies by regimen; typically for 3–7 d", and the table specifies, "Do not use ampicillin or amoxicillin for empirical treatment". Self-initiated regimens mirror these doses: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg BID × 3 d, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g.

### Once-daily plazomicin for complicated urinary tract infections [^cd2c654d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

The increasing multidrug resistance among gram-negative uropathogens necessitates new treatments for serious infections. Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside with bactericidal activity against multidrug-resistant (including carbapenem-resistant) Enterobacteriaceae.

Methods

We randomly assigned 609 patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including acute pyelonephritis, in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous plazomicin (15 mg per kilogram of body weight once daily) or meropenem (1 g every 8 hours), with optional oral step-down therapy after at least 4 days of intravenous therapy, for a total of 7 to 10 days of therapy. The primary objective was to show the noninferiority of plazomicin to meropenem in the treatment of complicated UTIs, including acute pyelonephritis, with a noninferiority margin of 15 percentage points. The primary end points were composite cure (clinical cure and microbiologic eradication) at day 5 and at the test-of-cure visit (15 to 19 days after initiation of therapy) in the microbiologic modified intention-to-treat population.

Results

Plazomicin was noninferior to meropenem with respect to the primary efficacy end points. At day 5, composite cure was observed in 88.0% of the patients (168 of 191 patients) in the plazomicin group and in 91.4% (180 of 197 patients) in the meropenem group (difference, -3.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.0 to 3.1). At the test-of-cure visit, composite cure was observed in 81.7% (156 of 191 patients) and 70.1% (138 of 197 patients), respectively (difference, 11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.7 to 20.3). At the test-of-cure visit, a higher percentage of patients in the plazomicin group than in the meropenem group were found to have microbiologic eradication, including eradication of Enterobacteriaceae that were not susceptible to aminoglycosides (78.8% vs. 68.6%) and Enterobacteriaceae that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases (82.4% vs. 75.0%). At late follow-up (24 to 32 days after initiation of therapy), fewer patients in the plazomicin group than in the meropenem group had microbiologic recurrence (3.7% vs. 8.1%) or clinical relapse (1.6% vs. 7.1%). Increases in serum creatinine levels of 0.5 mg or more per deciliter (≥ 40 μmol per liter) above baseline occurred in 7.0% of patients in the plazomicin group and in 4.0% in the meropenem group.

Conclusions

Once-daily plazomicin was noninferior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated UTIs and acute pyelonephritis caused by Enterobacteriaceae, including multidrug-resistant strains.

### Ertapenem [^2e77a487]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Community Acquired Pneumonia

Ertapenem was evaluated in adults for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in two randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trials. Both trials compared ertapenem (1 g parenterally once a day) with ceftriaxone (1 g parenterally once a day) and enrolled a total of 866 patients. Both regimens allowed the option to switch to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment (parenteral and oral). In the first trial the primary efficacy parameter was the clinical success rate in the clinically evaluable population and success rates were 92.3% (168/182) for ertapenem and 91% (183/201) for ceftriaxone at 7 to 14 days posttherapy (test-of-cure). In the second trial the primary efficacy parameter was the clinical success rate in the microbiologically evaluable population and success rates were 91% (91/100) for ertapenem and 91.8% (45/49) for ceftriaxone at 7 to 14 days posttherapy (test-of-cure).

Complicated Urinary Tract Infections Including Pyelonephritis

Ertapenem was evaluated in adults for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis in two randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trials. Both trials compared ertapenem (1 g parenterally once a day) with ceftriaxone (1 g parenterally once a day) and enrolled a total of 850 patients. Both regimens allowed the option to switch to oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) for a total of 10 to 14 days of treatment (parenteral and oral). The microbiological success rates (combined trials) at 5 to 9 days posttherapy (test-of-cure) were 89.5% (229/256) for ertapenem and 91.1% (204/224) for ceftriaxone.
