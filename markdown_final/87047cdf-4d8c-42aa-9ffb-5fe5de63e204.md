## Question

Non pruritic hives?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to approach "non-pruritic hives", specifically wheals that are not itchy, and which diagnoses and workup should be prioritized. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these lesions truly fit urticaria by morphology and time course. Then, I should verify red flags that push me away from ordinary urticaria toward vasculitis, angioedema, or other mimics. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and the key bedside and laboratory tests that help distinguish these entities. Finally, I will outline initial management pivots based on the most likely diagnosis and when to escalate or biopsy, making sure I double-check each step against guideline-based features and timelines.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical features of true urticaria: evanescent, edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema that typically last less than 24–48 hours and are usually pruritic. By definition, chronic urticaria persists beyond 6 weeks, and mast cell–mediated itch is a hallmark symptom, so "non-pruritic hives" already deviate from the classic phenotype and warrant caution [^115mUmpB] [^111u5XWi] [^112j73yM].

> Wait, let me verify the implication of absent pruritus: guidelines emphasize that painful or burning dysesthesia rather than itch suggests urticarial vasculitis, and that angioedema is typically nonpruritic and brawny, so non-pruritic "hives" should immediately prompt me to check for vasculitis, angioedema, or other mimics rather than assuming ordinary urticaria [^115mUmpB] [^115f7eS8] [^111YvrEd].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis systematically: urticarial vasculitis (painful/burning, > 24 hours, purpura, residual hyperpigmentation), angioedema (deep, nonpitting, nonpruritic, often lips/eyes/genitalia, slower to resolve), delayed pressure urticaria (deep tender swellings after sustained pressure, sometimes less pruritic), and non-urticarial mimics such as erythema multiforme, Sweet syndrome, or other inflammatory dermatoses. I need to ensure I do not anchor on "hives" if the morphology or chronology is off [^111KhoM5] [^111YvrEd] [^115rbhLw] [^112dHgQ7].

> Hold on, I should verify lesion duration and surface characteristics because this is pivotal: if individual lesions persist beyond 24–48 hours, leave bruising or hyperpigmentation, or are palpable and nonblanching, that pattern favors vasculitis over ordinary urticaria. Biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis confirms urticarial vasculitis, which changes management entirely [^115f7eS8] [^111KhoM5].

> Next, I should review bedside maneuvers and targeted testing: for suspected vasculitis, I will check ESR/CRP and consider complement levels, recognizing that hypocomplementemia correlates with more severe systemic involvement. For suspected angioedema without wheals, I must screen for hereditary or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency and ACE inhibitor–related angioedema using C4 as the initial screen. For delayed pressure urticaria, I can reproduce symptoms with a weighted challenge. And if the story is atypical or refractory, I should biopsy rather than escalate empiric urticaria therapy [^1172mi2J] [^114fWdpN] [^111YvrEd] [^111KhoM5].

> But wait, what if the "non-pruritic hives" are actually deep wheals from delayed pressure urticaria or cholinergic urticaria with atypical sensory descriptors? I should double-check provocation history (exercise, heat, sustained pressure) and, if indicated, perform standardized challenge testing to confirm a physical urticaria before labeling the case as vasculitis or idiopathic angioedema [^116V24GG] [^112Wo5B3].

> I need to ensure I do not over-order tests: in chronic urticaria without atypical features, extensive routine laboratories rarely change management. However, given the absence of pruritus here, this is not "ordinary" chronic spontaneous urticaria, so a more targeted evaluation is justified, including CBC, ESR/CRP, liver enzymes, TSH, and selective complement or autoimmune serologies guided by history and exam rather than a broad panel [^1136tgrN] [^113EQK1V] [^1172mi2J].

> Let me consider management pivots once the likely diagnosis is clearer: if urticarial vasculitis is confirmed, I should treat the vasculitis — often requiring systemic agents such as dapsone, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, or corticosteroids — with escalation to immunosuppressants for refractory or systemic disease. If angioedema is bradykinin-mediated, antihistamines and corticosteroids are ineffective and therapy must target the bradykinin pathway. If delayed pressure urticaria is diagnosed, high-dose second-generation H1 antihistamines may help, though responses can be modest and adjuncts like omalizumab can be considered in refractory cases [^111KhoM5] [^111US8xR] [^1175QBae].

> Hold on, I should verify safety steps: any presentation with urticaria or angioedema warrants exclusion of anaphylaxis and readiness to use epinephrine if airway or multisystem involvement is possible. Likewise, if angioedema is suspected, I must review medications such as ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs that can worsen or trigger episodes before concluding "idiopathic" [^114YfbQ9] [^111YvrEd] [^11422N3j].

> In summary, "non-pruritic hives" are a red flag that should redirect me to vasculitis, angioedema, or atypical physical urticarias rather than ordinary spontaneous urticaria. I should confirm morphology and duration, look for pain, burning, persistence, or bruising, perform targeted labs and, when indicated, a lesional biopsy, and tailor therapy accordingly rather than defaulting to antihistamine monotherapy meant for pruritic wheals [^115mUmpB] [^115f7eS8] [^112j73yM].

Non-pruritic hives are **not typical of classic urticaria** [^111u5XWi] and should prompt evaluation for **alternative diagnoses** such as urticarial vasculitis, angioedema, or other mimics [^115f7eS8]. Classic urticaria is defined by **pruritic, transient wheals** that resolve within 24–48 hours [^115mUmpB]; non-pruritic or persistent lesions suggest vasculitis, deeper edema, or non-urticarial conditions [^111KhoM5]. A focused history, physical exam, and selective testing (CBC, ESR/CRP, complement, thyroid, autoimmune screen) are recommended [^1172mi2J]; biopsy is indicated for persistent, painful, or atypical lesions [^1164EdRn]. Management depends on the underlying cause, with antihistamines for urticaria and immunomodulatory therapy for vasculitis or autoimmune etiologies [^112Czzfq] [^111KhoM5].

---

## Clinical features distinguishing non-pruritic hives from classic urticaria

Classic urticaria presents with **pruritic, erythematous, raised wheals** that typically resolve within 24–48 hours [^115mUmpB]; individual lesions rarely persist beyond this window. In contrast, **non-pruritic hives** often reflect alternative diagnoses such as urticarial vasculitis, angioedema, or other mimics [^117CEA92].

| **Feature** | **Classic urticaria** | **Non-pruritic hives** |
|-|-|-|
| Pruritus | Present [^111u5XWi] | Absent or minimal |
| Duration of lesions | < 24–48 hours [^115mUmpB] | Often > 24–48 hours |
| Lesion characteristics | Raised, erythematous wheals [^115mUmpB] | - Persistent <br/> - Painful <br/> - Or burning [^111KhoM5] |
| Associated symptoms | Rare systemic symptoms [^112ws4A1] | - Fever <br/> - Arthralgia <br/> - Or systemic involvement [^111Qcgrx] |
| Response to antihistamines | Good [^117Btbxz] | Poor or incomplete [^115rbhLw] |

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying non-pruritic hives

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** may underlie non-pruritic hives:

- **Urticarial vasculitis**: Small-vessel vasculitis causing persistent, painful, or burning lesions with minimal pruritus [^111KhoM5].

- **Angioedema**: Deeper dermal or subcutaneous edema, often non-pruritic, associated with bradykinin-mediated pathways [^114dcFNb].

- **Autoimmune urticaria**: Autoantibodies against IgE or FcεRI may cause atypical presentations, including reduced pruritus [^112zyexb].

- **Non-histaminergic mediators**: Prostaglandins, cytokines, and other mediators may contribute to non-pruritic presentations [^111u5XWi].

---

## Differential diagnosis of non-pruritic hives

The **differential diagnosis** of non-pruritic hives includes:

- **Urticarial vasculitis**: Persistent, painful, or burning lesions with systemic symptoms [^111KhoM5].

- **Angioedema**: Non-pruritic, deep swelling, often associated with bradykinin-mediated pathways [^114dcFNb].

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome, and other autoinflammatory syndromes [^112ad1GH].

- **Mastocytosis**: Urticaria pigmentosa with persistent lesions and systemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Drug reactions**: Non-pruritic eruptions associated with medications such as ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs [^114eK8D7].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to identify the underlying cause of non-pruritic hives. Recommended steps include:

- **Detailed history**: Onset, duration, triggers, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history [^1172mi2J].

- **Physical examination**: Lesion characteristics, distribution, and systemic signs [^115mUmpB].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR/CRP, complement levels (C3, C4), thyroid function tests, autoimmune screening (ANA, anti-dsDNA) [^1172mi2J].

- **Biopsy**: Indicated for persistent, painful, or atypical lesions to differentiate urticarial vasculitis or other inflammatory conditions [^115f7eS8].

---

## Management strategies

Management of non-pruritic hives depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Urticarial vasculitis**: Immunomodulatory therapies, including corticosteroids, dapsone, colchicine, or immunosuppressive agents [^111KhoM5].

- **Angioedema**: Avoidance of triggers, bradykinin pathway modulation, and management of underlying conditions [^111YvrEd].

- **Autoimmune urticaria**: Antihistamines, omalizumab, and immunosuppressive therapies as indicated [^117JkRPC].

- **Mastocytosis**: Avoidance of triggers, antihistamines, and mast cell stabilizers [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and clinical course

Prognosis varies by **underlying cause**. Urticarial vasculitis and autoimmune urticaria may persist for months to years and require long-term immunomodulatory therapy [^notfound]. Angioedema and mastocytosis have variable courses depending on severity and response to therapy [^notfound].

---

Non-pruritic hives are atypical and should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses such as urticarial vasculitis, angioedema, or autoimmune conditions. A thorough diagnostic evaluation and targeted management are essential for optimal outcomes [^115f7eS8].

Unlabelled

There are a number of systemic disorders that can manifest with urticarial skin lesions, including urticarial vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes. All of these conditions may enter into the differential diagnosis of ordinary urticaria. In contrast to urticaria, urticarial syndromes may manifest with skin lesions other than wheals, such as papules, necrosis, vesicles, and hemorrhages. Lesions may have a bilateral and symmetrical distribution; individual lesions have a long duration, and their resolution frequently leaves marks, such as hyperpigmentation or bruising. Moreover, systemic symptoms, such as fever, asthenia, and arthralgia, may be present. The most important differential diagnosis in this group is urticarial vasculitis, which is a small-vessel vasculitis with predominant cutaneous involvement. Systemic involvement in urticarial vasculitis affects multiple organs (mainly joints, the lungs, and the kidneys) and is more frequent and more severe in patients with hypocomplementemia. Clinicopathologic correlation is essential to establishing a correct diagnosis.

Learning Objectives

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish urticarial lesions suggesting diagnoses other than common urticaria; assess patients with urticarial lesions, and suspect systemic diseases presenting with urticarial skin lesions.

### Pruritic postoperative eruption [^112BWFa1]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: Which of the following is the mostly likely diagnosis?
A. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD)
B. Morbilliform drug eruption
C. Acute urticaria
D. Sweet syndrome
E. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)

Answers:
A. LABD – Incorrect. LABD typically presents with tense vesicles and bullae and may be intensely pruritic. However, fever and leukocytosis would be unusual.
B. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruptions may be pruritic but are not typically edematous and do not blister.
C. Acute urticaria – Incorrect. Pink, pruritic, edematous papules and plaques may raise concern for acute urticaria. However, wheals of urticaria are evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours, and do not blister or become purpuric as occurred on this patient's wrist.
D. Sweet syndrome – Correct. Sweet syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is an inflammatory skin disorder characterized by the abrupt eruption of painful and edematous papules, plaques, and nodules. Lesions are typically erythematous or violaceous and accompanied by fever and leukocytosis. Bullous or targetoid lesions may be present. Three etiologic subtypes have been described: classical (idiopathic), malignancy-associated, and drug-induced. Our patient met all criteria for drug-induced Sweet syndrome: abrupt onset of characteristic lesions, histopathologic evidence of a dense neutrophilic infiltrate with minimal to no evidence of vasculitis, pyrexia > 38 °C, temporal relationship between drug exposure and onset, and temporal relationship between treatment and resolution. This case is remarkable in that the patient's primary complaint was pruritus rather than tenderness or a burning sensation. Notably, 1 retrospective study of 77 patients with Sweet syndrome reported pruritus in 18% of cases.
E. SJS – Incorrect. The emergency physician initially raised concern for SJS. However, the majority of this patient's lesions were pink, edematous papules and plaques with notable involvement of the head and upper extremities, typical of Sweet syndrome. There was no mucosal involvement as is typical of SJS.

### Urticaria: a comprehensive review: epidemiology, diagnosis, and work-up [^112snufS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common clinical condition presenting with wheals (hives), angioedema, or both. Urticaria has a complex pathogenesis, along with a high disease burden, a significant impact on quality of life, and high health care costs. The first article in this continuing medical education series covers the definition, classification, epidemiology, diagnosis, and work-up of urticaria, taking into account the recent literature and the best available evidence.

### Unusual urticarias [^115rbhLw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Typical urticarial lesions are transient cutaneous swellings of sudden onset, often itchy, persisting for less than 24 hours and resolving to leave normal appearing skin. Angioedema lesions are similar subcutaneous lesions. Atypical urticarias persist for longer than 24 hours, may be painful and bruised in appearance and accompanied with severe systemic symptoms. Conditions where prolonged weals are present include delayed pressure urticaria and urticarial vasculitis. These conditions do not respond well to antihistamine therapy. In delayed pressure urticaria, weals appear after a delay of hours at sites of sustained pressure on the skin and occur in association with ordinary chronic 'idiopathic' urticaria. Weals of urticarial vasculitis show histological features of venulitis, and can be accompanied by arthralgia and abdominal pain. Rarely, the condition is due to infective or autoimmune disease. Urticarial diseases, sometimes with features of urticarial vasculitis, and with associated systemic features include Schnitzler's Syndrome, Still's disease and Muckle-Wells syndrome. The latter syndrome is linked with chromosome 1q44, as is autosomal dominant cold urticaria, an unusual physical urticaria. Persistent cholinergic erythema, a variant of cholinergic urticaria, has been mistaken for a drug eruption or cutaneous mastocytosis. Rarely, food and exercise induced urticaria and anaphylaxis occur when exercise follows a specific food or any meal within a few hours. The early stages of inflammatory disease may be mistaken for urticaria and angioedema, but lesions usually persist for longer than 48 hours and are accompanied by epidermal changes.

### Severe urticarial rash as the initial symptom of COVID-19 infection [^114sLVUd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 54-year-old woman presented with pruritic rash and hives of 3days' duration followed by shortness of breath for 1day. SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for COVID-19 was positive. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 include acral lesions, urticarial rash, erythematous maculopapular rash, vascular rashes and vesicular rash. The cutaneous manifestations are mostly described as self-limiting. Urticarial rashes are not reported as the initial presentation symptom of COVID-19 infection but mostly noted to occur at the same time or after the onset of non-cutaneous symptoms. Management of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 affecting quality of life has not been well studied. Antihistamine therapy is the primary recommended therapy. Role of antiviral therapy for severe cases of rash needs to be further assessed.

### Urticarial lesions: if not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: part I. cutaneous diseases [^112dHgQ7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Acute urticaria is self-limiting, and a cause can be identified in many patients. Chronic urticaria is a long lasting disease, and patients are commonly examined for an autoimmune origin and for associated diseases. Although the diagnosis of urticaria is straightforward in most patients, it may pose some difficulties at times and it may require a careful differential diagnosis with a number of conditions. Urticarial syndromes comprise both cutaneous and systemic disorders. Part I of this two-part series focuses on the clinical and histologic features that characterize common urticaria and on the cutaneous diseases that may manifest with urticarial lesions and must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Learning Objectives

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish between the typical wheals of urticaria and urticarial lesions suggesting other diagnoses and to assess patients with urticarial lesions in order to exclude or confirm other cutaneous diseases.

### Urticaria: a review [^111AUH2f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Urticaria is often classified as acute, chronic, or physical based on duration of symptoms and the presence or absence of inducing stimuli. Urticarial vasculitis, contact urticaria, and special syndromes are also included under the broad heading of urticaria. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria include the finding of autoantibodies to mast cell receptors in nearly half of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. These patients may have more severe disease and require more aggressive therapies. Extensive laboratory evaluation for patients with chronic urticaria is typically unrevealing and there are no compelling data that associate urticaria with chronic infections or malignancy. Pharmacologic therapy consists primarily of the appropriate use of first- and second-generation histamine H(1) receptor antihistamines. Additional therapy may include leukotriene receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents for severe, unremitting disease. Despite our greater understanding of the pathogenesis of urticaria, the condition remains a frustrating entity for many patients, particularly those with chronic urticaria.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^115kZYoM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnosis and management algorithm — patients with a history suggestive of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are first assessed for angioedema; if present, "Consider medications, C1INH syndromes, or conditions that mimic angioedema". If not and the "history, review of systems, and physical examination" are not consistent, "Consider alternative diagnoses (see Differential Diagnosis Section)". When the history suggests a physical component, "Does the history suggest physical urticaria? Is there a physical component to the urticaria and/or" and the action is to "Consider appropriate challenge testing for physical urticaria". If vasculitis is suggested, "If skin biopsy diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis. If biopsy negative go to box 10". If "history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests" indicate an underlying cause, "Evaluate and manage specific conditions", otherwise proceed with "Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema" and ensure "Periodic reassessment for underlying etiology and response to therapy".

### Advancements in novel therapeutics for chronic spontaneous urticaria [^1163SY63]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined by pruritic wheals with or without angioedema, associated with severe itch, which persist for greater than 6 weeks. Lesions move from one part of the body to another and generally are evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours. The global prevalence of the disease ranges from 0.5–5%, and is correlated with an annual economic burden over $200 million in the United States. CU can be further divided into chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU). Whereas CSU has no identifiable trigger, CIndU can be provoked by both physical and non-physical stimuli. As many as 7–30% of CU patients can have both types. Mast cells are the major effector cells in the pathogenesis of CU. When activated, mast cells characteristically release bioactive mediators including histamine that bind to specific receptors causing vasodilation and extravasation of fluid from the blood vasculature. This causes the characteristic wheals and itch. However, the pathophysiology of CU is much more complex, involving many mast cell surface receptors, cytokines, and cell activation pathways which are targets for many of the currently available and investigational therapies. Studies have demonstrated that CU causes a significant amount of distress and disruption to patients' daily lives that can be evaluated using validated patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMS). In this review, we will review CU epidemiology, pathophysiology, subtypes and diagnosis with discuss current and novel therapies.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^112ad1GH]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Is it necessary to perform extensive diagnostic studies by complementary testing in all patients with CSU?

The indiscriminate search for underlying causes that may include an extensive battery of tests is discouraged – due to low cost-effectiveness. A careful and detailed medical history and physical examination are essential. Patient-oriented questions are helpful to establish the type of chronic urticaria and to define baseline laboratory studies and/or other complementary tests tailored to the individual patient (Table 2). In most cases, there is no need to order an extensive work-up unless data from the clinical history suggest an underlying disease. Table 3 lists the essential tests that should be performed.

Table 2
Recommended data to obtain from the patient's medical history

Table 3
Minimal work-up studies on chronic spontaneous urticaria *

Key point: Unless suggested by the clinical history, there is no need to perform extensive tests when examining a CSU patient.

What is the differential diagnosis to be established for a patient with CSU?

Apart from urticaria vasculitis for which diagnosis is made through biopsy, It can be difficult to differentiate hives from other dermatoses (Table 4). However, the natural course differs in these pathologies. Erythema multiform clears on its own within a maximum of 3 weeks; it is included in the differential diagnosis because of its severity and should always be ruled out at the onset of symptoms, when it can resemble chronic urticaria. Autoinflammatory syndromes have symptoms that may be confused with chronic urticaria, but they are rare, and although skin rashes are always associated with systemic symptoms, itching is not as striking a feature as it is in the case of chronic urticaria. Certain systemic diseases are associated with urticaria-like lesions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Schnitzler syndrome (IgM monoclonal gammopathy, urticaria, fever, lymphadenopathy and weight loss), mastocytosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of chronic urticaria

Key point: Chronic urticaria differs from other dermatosis on its duration, the evanescence of lesions and intense itching.

### Allergic and hypersensitivity conditions in non-specialist care: flow diagrams to support clinical practice [^114aCQP3]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.5 Urticaria

Urticaria is mistakenly believed by many to be an IgE‐mediated type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) with the consequence that unnecessary investigations are performed which in turn provide results, which are open to misinterpretation with significant impact on the life of the patient. The frequently associated angioedema frequently leads to unscheduled visits, including emergency room visits. We have drawn on EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria. This has been subsequently superseded by the 2021 update, which re‐affirms our approach.

### Chronic urticaria and recurrent angioedema: clues to the mimics [^113Ym3Ep]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Urticaria and angioedema are experienced by up to 1 in 5 people, usually the result of common allergen or medication triggers and infections. Similarly, the majority of recurrent angioedema has an exogenous trigger, for example, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or is hereditary (type 1 and 2 hereditary angioedema); chronic spontaneous urticaria are most often autoimmune or autoallergic in routine clinical practice. There are, however, several skin and systemic conditions that can imitate the clinical appearance of either angioedema or urticaria, whereas there are several uncommon conditions that have chronic urticaria and/or recurrent angioedema as part of their disease manifestations. Correct diagnosis is paramount to ensuring subsequent tailored therapy for many of these conditions, and in many instances, diagnostic delay can be several years with morbid consequence. In this grand rounds article, we present 2 illustrative clinical cases as the backdrop to discussing a practical diagnostic approach for clinicians to recognize copycat phenotypes and "red flags" that should prompt further investigation of several uncommon mimics. We highlight key diagnostic features, epidemiology, and management for mimics where treatment is distinct from the common phenotypes of recurrent angioedema and chronic urticarias.

### How to manage chronic urticaria' beyond' guidelines: a practical algorithm [^111kvJmx]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a disease characterized by pruritic weals, angio-oedema or both occurring for at least 6 weeks. It encompasses spontaneous and inducible urticarias. The national and international guidelines outline the principles of treatment. Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody, has transformed the management of many severe and treatment-refractory patients. However, current UK guidance on its use does not address the needs of those with less severe disease, inducible urticarias, idiopathic histaminergic angio-oedema without weals as a presentation of CU and omalizumab non-responders. Our algorithm and a summary of the evidence to support its principles offers guidance and a more systematic targeted approach to using a range of 'off-label' agents for specific phenotypes of CU. It will be of use when guideline-recommended mast cell mediator antagonists fail to control symptoms and/or using omalizumab is ineffective, not practical or unfunded.

### An approach to the patient with urticaria [^1163gdAq]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with urticaria make up a large proportion of the referrals to allergy clinics. There are many causes of urticaria and it is the clinical history which is most important when attempting to identify potential causes; however, urticaria is very often idiopathic. In a small minority of patients urticaria may be a symptom of a serious underlying medical illness or the allergic symptoms may progress to cause systemic reactions, and it is important to identify these patients and to remember that severe urticaria is a distressing and disabling condition. This review will discuss classification, investigation and treatment of urticaria and will consider some of the more unusual types of urticaria that may be encountered in the out-patient clinic.

### An overview of chronic urticaria [^113EUAYD]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Acknowledging urticaria as a symptom of mast cell degranulation is stressed. The biology of the mast cell, and the recognized immunologic and non-immunologic mast cell secretagogues are individually discussed along with mechanisms of activation and mediators released. The major, preformed mediator histamine in the skin produces a prototypic, short-lived urticaria, however, the clinical spectrum and pattern of "hives" indicate that other mediators contribute to the polymorphism and variable behavior of this symptom. The clinical assessment is almost exclusively restricted to the history and physical examination. Features to review and examine are presented. The cause of "acute" urticaria is identifiable (by history) in the majority of patients, and except for hives that accompany an anaphylactic reaction, these patients rarely present to the physician for care. The persistent, or "chronic" hiver whose history cannot elicit a cause, is rarely triggered by an individual trigger, despite extensive professional evaluation. Evidence to support changing the chronological, "acute" and "chronic" classification of urticaria to "identifiable" and "non-identifiable" triggered urticaria is discussed, as is the futility of extensive, costly laboratory work-ups. The natural history of urticaria reveals that management should be directed toward allowing the patient to maintain an acceptable quality of life (with or without some urticaria), until the episode resolves.

### Chronic urticaria as a systemic disease [^112dZHLF]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Urticaria is one of the most common diseases seen in everyday dermatologic practice, characterized by the development of wheals, angioedema, or both. While acute urticaria is mostly related to allergic or pseudoallergic reaction to food, drugs, or infections, chronic urticaria is a more complex disease with different additional ethiopathologic mechanisms and evoking factors. While urticaria is an undisputed disease of the skin, growing evidence supports, like in other dermatologic diseases, the concept of urticaria as a systemic disease with clinical symptoms and signs predominantly presenting on the skin. In this review, we describe the evidence and association between chronic urticaria and a variety of disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, atopy, infections, metabolic conditions, and neoplastic disorders. Beyond the mechanistic association, the possible common underlying pathomechanisms, such as systemic immunologic processes, are discussed.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^114pp4R3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and isolated angioedema — evaluation and testing guidance: Patients with recurrent angioedema without urticaria "should be evaluated for hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor–associated angioedema before a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema is made". For CU, "Skin biopsy can be performed in patients with refractory CU and should be performed when vasculitis is suspected or when other nonurticarial immunologic skin diseases are a consideration", whereas "Routine skin biopsies are not required in most cases of CU". Allergy testing is limited: "Immediate hypersensitivity skin or serologic testing for food or other allergens is rarely useful and not recommended on a routine basis".

Introduction

Chronic urticaria, defined as urticaria that persists for longer than 6 weeks, is a frustrating condition for both patients and caregivers due to the persistence of lesions in spite of using available treatment options. Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) can be categorized according to the EAACI classification into two main types: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and physical or inducible urticaria (Table 1). CSU is defined by the spontaneous appearance of wheals with or without angioedema that persist for ≥ 6 weeks. CSU is occasionally associated with other types of chronic urticaria, such as inducible (physical or cholinergic) urticaria. The present article is focused on CSU and covers several aspects regarding its diagnosis and management.

Table 1
Classification of urticaria

Despite the impact on quality of life and the morbidity associated with CSU, relatively little is known about the pathophysiology of this condition. Moreover, with the exception of physical urticaria, in the majority of cases, a cause cannot be established. An autoimmune origin is found in a subpopulation of CSU patients as assessed by the ability of the patients' sera to activate normal donor basophils and to induce histamine release. However, this subpopulation is clinically indistinguishable from the nonautoimmune group.

There are several guidelines and reviews – on the management of urticaria. However, these guidelines do not completely agree on key points, such as which test to order or the adequate treatment approach for the different clinical scenarios. This disagreement is even more obvious in the latest published guidelines.

Omalizumab has emerged as a treatment that is able to control CSU symptoms in a significant percentage of non-responder patients to antihistamines at high doses or in combination with other drugs –. Omalizumab also opens a new avenue of research because this drug works both in autoimmune and in nonautoimmune urticaria. Its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Omalizumab is able to capture IgE, down-regulating IgE receptors and preventing IgE binding to its high- and low-affinity receptors, and seems to desensitize mast cells. This drug was approved for the treatment of CSU in March 2014 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Background

Urticaria is a common disease in children and is estimated to affect 15–25% of people at some point in their lives. Symptoms of urticaria (e.g. recurrent itching, generalized wheals and sleep disturbances) can persist for several days to months and are a significant source of patient stress. There are many etiologies of urticaria in children, including foods, infections, physical contact, temperature changes, and idiopathic causes. Moreover, fruits and insect venom have also been reported to induce allergic reactions or urticaria in childhood. Among children with urticaria, simple infections have been associated with the majority of acute episodes. However, the stress and urticarial symptoms caused by simple infections are usually transient, particularly when patients are protected from the source of infection.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — duration-based definition and association with triggers: Acute urticaria and angioedema are differentiated from chronic urticaria and angioedema (CUA) based on duration of illness. (D), and the presence of urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, with the distinction of 6 weeks as a dividing interval between acute urticaria and CU, although somewhat arbitrary, being useful because the most common cause of acute urticaria and angioedema, particularly in children, is a transient viral infection; for this reason, acute urticaria, in contrast to CUA, can often be associated with a specific cause or trigger.

### Cold urticaria syndromes: diagnosis and management [^114pLXCF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Cold urticaria is a chronic condition causing episodic symptoms of cold-induced wheals or angioedema in response to direct or indirect exposure to cold temperatures. Whereas symptoms of cold urticaria are typically benign and self-limiting, severe systemic anaphylactic reactions are possible. Acquired, atypical, and hereditary forms have been described, each with variable triggers, symptoms, and responses to therapy. Clinical testing, including response to cold stimulation, helps define disease subtypes. More recently, monogenic disorders characterized by atypical forms of cold urticaria have been described. Here, we review the different forms of cold-induced urticaria and related syndromes and propose a diagnostic algorithm to aid clinicians in making a timely diagnosis for the appropriate management of these patients.

### Urticarial vasculitis [^111KhoM5]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Urticarial vasculitis is a clinico-pathologic entity typified by recurrent episodes of urticaria that have the histopathologic features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The cutaneous features may include painful, burning or pruritic skin lesions, the persistence of individual lesions greater than 24 hours, palpable purpura, pronounced central clearing of lesions, and residual hyperpigmentation following resolution. However, because clinical characteristics of urticarial vasculitis may overlap with those of allergic urticaria, confirmation of the diagnosis requires a lesional skin biopsy. This condition is idiopathic in many patients but can also occur in the context of autoimmune disorders, infections, drug reactions, or as a paraneoplastic syndrome. In idiopathic urticarial vasculitis common laboratory findings are an elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and reduction of serum complement. An association between urticarial vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus has been hypothesized as some clinical manifestations of disease overlap and C1q autoantibodies may be present in both diseases. Normo-complementemic patients usually have minimal or no systemic involvement and often have a better prognosis. On-the-other-hand, hypocomplementemic patients have the propensity to have more severe multi-organ involvement. Response to treatment is variable and a wide variety of therapeutic agents may be efficacious. Initial recommendations for treatment of urticarial vasculitis manifest only as non-necrotizing skin lesions include antihistamines, dapsone, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine or indomethacin, but corticosteroids are often required. With necrotizing skin lesions or visceral involvement, corticosteroids are regularly indicated. Cases of severe corticosteroid resistant urticarial vasculitis or where corticosteroid morbidity is evident [table: see text] may require treatment with other immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine.

Chronic urticaria (CU) initial evaluation and lesion characterization — The initial patient evaluation should be focused to determine (through history and physical examination) whether the lesions that patients describe are consistent with CU (D). Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

Chronic urticaria (CU) forms — autoantibody-associated and physical urticarias: Autoantibody-associated urticaria denotes urticaria with autoantibodies and is considered a subset of CU; although it can be differentiated from chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) by the presence of autoantibodies, the etiologic, therapeutic, and prognostic value of these autoantibodies has not been determined. CU triggered exclusively by specific physical causes (eg, heat, cold, pressure, vibration) is considered a distinct entity, and physical urticaria/angioedema can occur concomitantly with CIU.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### Physical urticaria: clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, and management [^116V24GG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical urticaria is a type of urticaria in which recurrent wheals and/or angioedema occur following exposure of the skin to a physical stimulus. It is classified according to its triggers, which may be mechanical (friction, pressure, and vibration), thermal (cold and heat), or solar electromagnetic radiation. Symptoms of different physical urticarias can develop following specific activities that expose patients to an eliciting stimulus and may be variably accompanied by mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms, including nausea, headache, or even anaphylaxis. Differentiation of physical urticaria from other chronic urticarias requires careful clinical assessment and confirmatory provocation testing, which in turn can inform appropriate management. This clinical review provides an evidence-based summary of the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, and management of physical urticaria.

### Chronic urticaria and angioedema: masqueraders and misdiagnoses [^114dcFNb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a common condition presenting with intensely pruritic wheals. Although individual lesions resolve within 24 hours, by definition, chronic urticaria lasts for a duration of at least 6 weeks. Both spontaneous and inducible forms exist. In the spontaneous variant, chronic urticaria occurs in the absence of clearly identifiable triggers. In chronic inducible urticaria, specific triggers may include dermatographism, cholinergic (heat), cold, exercise, delayed pressure, and solar. Extensive laboratory evaluation for chronic spontaneous urticaria is not required unless indicated by clinical history or physical examination. Angioedema describes sudden onset of localized edema involving the deep layers of the skin and submucosal tissues. It can be seen in isolation or in conjunction with chronic urticaria. Angioedema typically resolves slower than wheals, taking up to 72 hours or longer. Histamine- and bradykinin-mediated forms exist. Both chronic urticaria and angioedema have many mimics, and a broad range of differential diagnoses should be considered. Importantly, an incorrect diagnosis may have significant implications for the additional investigation, treatment, and prognosis of the affected patient. The aim of this article is to discuss the characteristics of chronic urticaria and angioedema, and an approach to the investigation and diagnosis of their mimics.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — definition, duration, epidemiology, and pathobiology: CU is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks, and the duration varies considerably, with physical urticarias tending to persist the longest, often for many years. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, and the incidence has been estimated at 1.4% per year. Some patients with CU might have both urticaria and angioedema, occurring simultaneously or separately. Pathogenically, the skin mast cell is the most important cell in patients with CU, and histamine is the predominant mediator, although other cells and mediators also play a key role; activation of the coagulation cascade, including increased prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer levels, has been described and might be a marker of CU with angioedema severity.

### The definition, classification, and history of urticaria [^116evQ2t]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The term "urticaria" was first introduced by William Cullen in the eighteenth century. Urticaria is a common mast cell-mediated cutaneous disease presenting with pruritic wheals, angioedema, or both. It is classified as acute (≤ 6 weeks) or chronic (> 6 weeks) and as spontaneous (no definite triggers) or inducible (definite and subtype-specific triggers). The international urticaria guideline on the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria is revised every 4 years. The global network of Urticaria Centers of Reference and Excellence, the biggest and most active consortium of urticaria specialists, offers physicians and patients several research, educational, and digital care initiatives.

Guidelines for diagnostic work-up of patients with CU present detailed history, selective laboratory evaluation, and conditional additional testing. History and physical examination items include Onset (eg, timing of symptoms with any change in medication or other exposures), Frequency, duration, severity, and localization of wheals and itching, Known precipitating factors of urticaria (eg, physical stimuli, exertion, stress, food, or medications), Associated angioedema or systemic manifestations (eg, headache, joint pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms), Known allergies, intolerances, infections, systemic illnesses, or other possible causes, Family history of urticaria and atopy, Degree of impairment of quality of life, Response to prior treatment, and Physical examination. For laboratory evaluation, Testing should be selective. A majority of members of the Practice Parameters Task Force expressed a consensus for the following routine tests in managing a patient with CU without atypical features: CBC with differential; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; Liver enzymes; TSH. The utility of performing the above tests routinely for patients with CU has not been established. Additional evaluation might be warranted based on patients' circumstances and might include but not be limited to the diagnostic tests listed below. A thorough history and meticulous physical examination are essential for determining whether these additional tests are appropriate: Skin biopsy; Physical challenge tests; Complement system (eg, C3, C4, and CH50); Stool analysis for ova and parasites; Urinalysis; Hepatitis B and C serologies; Chest radiography, other imaging studies, or both; Anti-nuclear antibody; Rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein; Cryoglobulin levels; Serologic and/or skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity; Thyroid autoantibodies; Serum protein electrophoresis. More detailed laboratory tests, skin biopsies, or both merit consideration if urticaria is not responding to therapy as anticipated, and Additional laboratory testing might be required before initiation of certain medications, such as G6PD screening before prescribing dapsone.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and angioedema — diagnostic algorithm (Fig 3) — defines CU when episodes persist for greater than 6 weeks, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. In 40% to 50% of patients with urticaria, angioedema will also be a part of the spectrum, and when angioedema occurs alone it can last for greater than 24 hours and be nonpruritic. If urticaria/angioedema is exclusively or primarily triggered by an external physical trigger, the work-up should proceed to Box 6; if only partially triggered by physical factors or not at all, the work-up should progress to Box 10. For suspected physical urticaria or angioedema, physical challenge procedures can be used to confirm the diagnosis, and if confirmed by challenge testing the condition should be managed with a combination of avoidance measures. If urticarial vasculitis is suspected — lesions often persist for greater than 24 to 48 hours — a biopsy is important for confirming the diagnosis; if the skin biopsy is diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis, and if negative, proceed to Box 10. In evaluating angioedema, for a patient taking an ACE inhibitor, drug discontinuation and replacement with an equally efficacious alternative agent should be considered.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^1138G4BC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In spite of being an old disease and apparently easy to diagnose, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is still perceived as an uncontrollable and difficult to manage disease. The perception of the patient is that his/her condition is not well understood and that is suffering from a disorder with hidden causes that doctors are not able to tackle. Sometimes patients go through a number of clinicians until they found some CSU expert who is familiar with the disease. It is surprising that myths and believes with no scientific support still persist. Guidelines are not widely implemented, and recent tools to assess severity are infrequently used. European and American recent guidelines do not agree in several key points related to diagnosis and treatment, which further contributes to confusion. With the aim to clarify some aspects of the CSU picture, a group of allergists and dermatologists from the Spanish Dermatology and Allergy societies developed a Frequent Asked Questions leaflet that could facilitate physicians work in daily practice and contribute to a better knowledge of common clinical scenarios related to patients with CSU.

Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) is characterized by the appearance of hives (urticaria) and/or angioedema in response to specific triggers or stimuli. For accurate diagnosis, anamnesis-driven specific, and if available, standardized trigger testings, as well as patient reported outcomes, should be applied. The currently recommended treatment algorithm is the same as for chronic spontaneous urticaria but is largely off-label for CIndU. New, and possibly more disease-specific, treatment options are needed for CIndU patients, who are often severely impacted by their disease. Several clinical trials are currently ongoing.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112xXbHJ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute urticaria:

- **Definition**: Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition characterized by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals or hives.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute urticaria is caused by mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to characteristic skin lesions. The activation of these cells can occur through multiple triggers, including IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute urticaria in the United Kingdom is estimated at 355 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acute urticaria presents as itchy, raised welts that can appear anywhere on the body. These hives are transient, often moving from one area of the body to another. In some cases, acute urticarial lesions may display central clearing with an ecchymotic or hemorrhagic hue.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute urticaria is generally good, as it is typically a self-limiting condition that resolves within 6 weeks.

HES diagnostic features and manifestations — Summary Statement 64: HES should be considered when the peripheral total eosinophil count exceeds 1500/µL for greater than 6 months in the absence of other causes of peripheral eosinophilia (C). Cutaneous lesions are common and urticaria and angioedema can occur in all HES subtypes. In contrast to CIU, patients with HES typically have multiorgan involvement, and a diagnostic peripheral eosinophilia of greater than 1500 eosinophils/µL with multiorgan involvement is a requirement for HES. Patients with HES present with fever (12%), fatigue (26%), cough (24%), dyspnea (16%), pruritic papules, plaques, or nodules (12%), angioedema or myalgias (14%), and, rarely, mucosal erosions.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — lesion characteristics and differential include that CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, whereas a painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis. Individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours, but new lesions might be developing simultaneously at other skin sites, while in contrast, vasculitis lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes, although in some cases lesions might be more evanescent, similar to ordinary CU. Angioedema typically appears as nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema, and the medical work-up should keep in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases.

Are there biomarkers of activity in CSU?

The severity of CSU should be evaluated based on the intensity of its clinical symptoms. Several biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein and D-dimers, metalloproteinase-9 and complement C3 and C4, have shown distinctive patterns in CSU patients, but these molecules have still not been validated as useful biomarkers.

Key point: Although several substances may show specific levels in CSU patients, they have not yet been validated as CSU biomarkers.

Does isolated angioedema have clinical, therapeutic and/or prognostic implications?

Isolated angioedema with no hives that responds to antihistamines should be explored and phenotyped. Most guidelines – include isolated angioedema as a subtype of CSU. However, this condition does not share the typical features of chronic urticaria, such as being more frequent in women or having an autoimmune profile. In certain cases, typical CSU starts with isolated angioedema that evolves into cutaneous wheals. On the other hand, histaminergic angioedema is clearly different from bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which does not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids, has a different physiopathology – and requires a different treatment approach. The differential diagnosis for isolated angioedema is shown in Table 5.

Table 5
Differential diagnosis of isolated angioedema

Key point: Isolated angioedema does not share the typical features of CSU.

How should the diagnosis of CSU in children be approached?

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is less frequent in children, but in general, it shares the underlying causes and physiopathology of CSU in adults. Therefore, the diagnostic approach in children and adults is the same. However, it should be noted that infants are more prone to develop acute urticaria secondary to an infection.

Key point: The diagnostic approach to CSU in children should be the same as that in adults.

### Aquagenic urticaria: presentation, diagnosis and management [^1139iuZ7]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Table 2
Common differential diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria and associated diagnostic evaluation tests

Given its ambiguous pathogenesis, treatment options for aquagenic urticaria remain limited and often yield varied results. Non-sedating, second-generation H1 antihistamines are commonly the primary line of treatment, with some patients requiring doses up to four times the typical daily amount. Yet, the response to this regimen can differ significantly from one individual to another. In cases where standard treatments are ineffective, ultraviolet (UV) monotherapy or UV combined with antihistamines, has demonstrated some efficacy. It is postulated that the UV therapy leads to an enhanced thickness of the epidermis, potentially inhibiting water from penetrating and interacting further within the epidermal environment. Alternative therapeutic measures encompass the use of topical barrier creams and acetylcholine antagonists. Notably, there have also been recent accounts of aquagenic urticaria being successfully managed with omalizumab.

Aquagenic urticaria, though rare, presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians due to its unique water-induced aetiology. Detailed patient history, thorough physical examinations and water provocation tests are invaluable tools in establishing a definitive diagnosis. While the pathogenesis remains enigmatic, the efficacy of treatments such as second-generation H1 antihistamines underscores the strides made in managing this condition. Continued research is vital to deepen our understanding and enhance therapeutic strategies, ensuring the best possible patient outcomes.

Learning points

Aquagenic urticaria, although a rare dermatological condition, demands heightened clinical awareness due to its significant impact on patient quality of life, particularly during sensitive developmental periods such as adolescence. Clinicians should consider aquagenic urticaria in the differential diagnosis when patients present with recurrent urticarial lesions triggered by water exposure.
The diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria relies on a detailed clinical history, ruling out other forms of inducible urticaria and the implementation of water provocation test to assess the skin for an urticarial reaction secondary to water exposure.
The management of aquagenic urticaria should be individualised, considering the variability in response to treatments. While non-sedating, second-generation H1 antihistamines are the cornerstone of treatment, some patients may require higher doses or adjunctive therapies.
Continued research and clinical documentation of aquagenic urticaria cases are essential to unravel its pathophysiology and develop more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

Chronic urticaria (CU) laboratory testing — After a thorough history and physical examination, no further diagnostic testing might be appropriate; however, limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes, with targeted testing based on clinical suspicion. Extensive routine testing for exogenous and rare causes of CU or immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for inhalants or foods is not warranted, and routine laboratory testing in patients with CU whose history and physical examination lack atypical features rarely yields clinically significant findings (C). Extensive testing uncovered an otherwise undiscovered specific underlying disease process in 1.6% of cases of CU, and a more recent study found that although 17% of laboratory tests performed in 356 patients with CU were abnormal and 8.4% of patients underwent additional testing, only 1 patient had a management change leading to improvement; in 2 other reports a definite cause was found in only 5% or less. Limited testing might be justified for its 'reassurance value'; however, extensive routine testing is not favorable from a cost-benefit standpoint and does not lead to improved patient care outcomes.

### Chronic urticaria: impact of allergic inflammation [^116F9pxp]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Urticaria is defined by weals (hives), with or without angioedema, that appear and peak in minutes to hours, usually disappear within 24 h, and are accompanied by pruritus that worsens during the night. Urticaria is caused by cutaneous mast cell degranulation, attributed to immunological, nonimmunological, and idiopathic causes. Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is the diagnosis when the pathophysiological mechanism of persistent urticaria remains unclear; up to half of patients with CIU have functional autoantibodies directed against the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) or against IgE itself, which appear to induce mast cell degranulation. Systemic histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as desloratadine, are central to the management of CIU. The efficacy and safety of desloratadine, 5 mg once daily, was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial that included 190 patients, ages 12 and above, with at least a 6-week history of CIU and experiencing a flare of at least moderate severity. Desloratadine was superior to placebo in controlling pruritus and total symptoms after the first dose, and its superiority was maintained throughout the full 6 weeks of the study. Measures of sleep, daily activity, therapeutic response, and global CIU status were also significantly improved with desloratadine after the first dose and maintained throughout the study.

Urticaria, also known as hives, is a common condition thought to affect up to 20% of individuals worldwide in their lifetime. This skin condition is characterized by the appearance of pruritic, erythematous papules or plaques with superficial swelling of the dermis. The major complaint is the symptom of pruritus. Angioedema, which involves a deeper swelling of dermal or mucosal tissues, may accompany urticaria. Urticaria can be classified by both time course of symptoms and the underlying etiology.

Clinical features distinguishing chronic urticaria from urticarial vasculitis and angioedema — CU lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals of variable size and shape with surrounding erythema and are generally pruritic, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. A painful or burning dysesthesia is not characteristic of CU and suggests the presence of cutaneous vasculitis, in which lesions are palpable and usually nonblanching, spanning several days or more and often followed by residual hyperpigmented changes; diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis should be confirmed by a biopsy demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Because urticarial vasculitic lesions might sometimes be evanescent, lasting less than 24 hours, this condition cannot be completely excluded based on a history of lesions spanning less than 24 hours. Angioedema typically appears as nonpitting, brawny, nonpitting edema, typically without well-defined margins and without erythema.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — definition and epidemiology: CU is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, although true point, cumulative, and lifetime prevalence have not been established; the incidence of CU has been estimated at 1.46 per year. The duration varies considerably, with physical urticarias tending to persist the longest, and some patients with CU might have urticaria and angioedema occurring simultaneously or separately; activation of the coagulation cascade, including increased prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels, has been described.

### The diagnostic workup in chronic spontaneous urticaria-what to test and why [^111r7UA2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), the guidelines recommend very limited diagnostic procedures during the routine workup, although additional investigations might be indicated in some patients with CSU. For physicians treating patients with CSU, it is often difficult to decide which diagnostic tests are useful.

Objective

To provide recommendations on what diagnostic tests should be performed on which patients with CSU.

Methods

We performed an extensive literature search on the respective topics and identified relevant questions that should prompt diagnostic procedures based on the published evidence and expert consensus among all authors.

Results

We provide questions, diagnostic testing, where appropriate, and recommendation that should be included when assessing the history of a patient with CSU, to explore and rule out differential diagnoses, to assess patients for underlying causes and modifying conditions, to explore patients for comorbid diseases and consequences of having CSU, and to assess patients for CSU components that can help to predict their disease course and response to treatment.

Conclusions

Here, we provide physicians treating patients with CSU with information about which clues should lead to which tests and why.

### Evaluating chronic urticaria patients for allergies, infections, or autoimmune disorders [^1135YhGJ]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common disorder affecting one-fifth of the world's population. The pathophysiology is characterized by an increased propensity for mast cell degranulation with the release of potent mediators into the dermal and subdermal tissues with resulting vasoactive, chemotactic, and inflammatory effects. The final clinical manifestation of the typical urticarial lesion is the effect of several diverse effects and causes. The general classification is acute, chronic, and physical urticaria. In general, allergenic triggers can be identified in between 60–80% of acute urticarias. Physical urticarias are characterized by the onset after the specific inciting stimulus, which can reproduce the characteristic lesion which is usually of shorter duration (with the exception of delayed pressure urticaria). Chronic idiopathic urticaria is associated with thyroid autoimmunity and, more recently, anti-mast cell receptor antibodies. An extensive work-up is usually not indicated or helpful in identifying a cause. Food or other allergens are rare causes of this type of presentation. The evaluation and work-up is dependent on clues identified by history. The treatment is removal of specific and non-specific triggers and the use of symptomatic medications generally attenuating the mediator effects.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

### Efficacy of treatment of non-hereditary angioedema [^114pbi3M]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema (AE) frequently occurs as part of urticaria, a disease characterized by the development of wheals, AE, or both. AE with wheals, also known as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), is presumably mast cell-mediated. AE without significant wheals can be the presenting symptom of a variety of diagnoses, such as hereditary AE caused by C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency, resulting in the release of the key mediator bradykinin. Accumulation of bradykinin can also be caused by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi-AE) in patients with normal C1INH. ACEi-AE is estimated to occur in up to 0.68% of patients who receive ACE inhibitors. However, a majority of patients suffer idiopathic acquired AE, which implies AE with normal C1INH with no family history of AE, in which known causes of AE have been excluded. It is unclear to what extent idiopathic AE is similar to angioedema with wheals (CSU), or to presumably bradykinin-mediated subtypes of AE.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria/angioedema is "acute" if it spans less than 6 weeks in duration, and in generalized cases a patient might merit administration of immediate emergency treatment (eg, epinephrine) to manage laryngeal obstruction. A comprehensive history and physical examination should be performed to identify a cause, documenting potential triggers and their timing, and a comprehensive review of systems should be carried out to assess for related disorders; physical examination should focus on lesion extent and dermatographia and include examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system. Findings from history and examination might serve to focus evaluation on a clear trigger for acute urticaria/angioedema, and a limited laboratory diagnostic evaluation might include CBC with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, TSH, and renal and liver profiles. Initial treatment is to remove or avoid factors that induce urticaria/angioedema, and once identifiable triggers have been eliminated, evidence supports the use of antihistamines as first-line therapy for persistent symptoms. Second-generation antihistamines are designed through chemical modifications.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — biopsy and evaluation — Although skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases, it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders, and biopsy is rarely indicated when lesions are typical of urticaria with duration < 24 hours without bruising or purpura; biopsy might be indicated when mastocytosis or urticarial vasculitis is suspected. Most often acute urticaria is self-limiting and resolves in less than 6 weeks, and extensive evaluation for causes not suggested by history or examination is not cost-effective and has not been associated with improved outcomes.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112Czzfq]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Urticaria commonly presents with intensely pruritic wheals, sometimes with edema of the subcutaneous or interstitial tissue. It has a lifetime prevalence of about 20%. Although often self-limited and benign, it can cause significant discomfort, continue for months to years, and uncommonly represent a serious systemic disease or life-threatening allergic reaction. Urticaria is caused by immunoglobulin E- and non-immunoglobulin E-mediated release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils. Diagnosis is made clinically; anaphylaxis must be ruled out. Chronic urticaria is idiopathic in 80% to 90% of cases. Only a limited nonspecific laboratory workup should be considered unless elements of the history or physical examination suggest specific underlying conditions. The mainstay of treatment is avoidance of triggers, if identified. The first-line pharmacotherapy is second-generation H1 antihistamines, which can be titrated to greater than standard doses. First-generation H1 antihistamines, H2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, high-potency antihistamines, and brief corticosteroid bursts may be used as adjunctive treatment. In refractory chronic urticaria, patients can be referred to subspecialists for additional treatments, such as omalizumab or cyclosporine. More than one-half of patients with chronic urticaria will have resolution or improvement of symptoms within a year.

### Urticaria [^113XJdqh]. Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Urticaria has been known as a disease since antiquity. However, in the last decades an increasing understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis has shown the high heterogeneity of different urticaria subtypes. Clear distinction of the subtypes is required not only to choose the correct measures in diagnosis and management, but also to interpret the available data in research. The subtypes can be grouped into spontaneous urticaria, which includes acute urticaria and chronic urticaria, the physical urticarias, special types of urticaria including, e.g. contact urticaria, and diseases related to urticaria for historical reasons, e.g. urticaria pigmentosa. Most urticaria subtypes have a profound impact on the quality of life and effective treatment is thus required in case the diagnostic procedures do not reveal a cause which can be treated. Although, for symptomatic relief, nonsedating H1-antihistamines are the first choice in most subtypes of urticaria, double-blind controlled studies have shown that dosages required may exceed those recommended for other diseases, e.g. allergic rhinitis. Alternative treatments should be reserved for unresponsive patients.

### Potential therapeutic approaches for chronic urticaria: beyond H1-antihistamines and biologics [^112wcu4p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a disease that can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and ability to function. There are effective treatment options, such as nonsedating antihistamines or biologics, but some patients do not respond to these therapies, or the therapies are not available or affordable to all patients. This review aims to summarize potential treatment strategies for patients (1) who do not respond to antihistamines and (2) cannot readily access or do not respond to biologics. The review emphasizes the importance of sound clinical practice, including correct diagnosis of chronic urticaria phenotypes, treatment of associated comorbidities, and consideration of add-on pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Although some treatments may lack high-quality evidence, they may still be justifiable in certain cases, provided that there is shared decision-making, regular reassessment, and early recognition of adverse events.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic inducible urticaria [^115BgUGQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is defined by pruritic wheals with or without angioedema, associated with severe itch, which persist for greater than 6 weeks. Chronic urticaria can be divided into chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic inducible urticaria. Whereas chronic spontaneous urticaria has no identifiable trigger, chronic inducible urticaria can be induced by both physical and non-physical triggers.​ As many as 7–30% of chronic urticariapatients can have both types.​​ Mast cells are the core effector cells involved in the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria. When activated, they release bioactive mediators including histamine and leukotrienes that bind to histamine receptors causing vasodilation and extravasation of fluid from the blood vasculature, resulting in wheals and itch. However, the pathophysiology of chronic urticaria is much more complex, involving many mast cell surface receptors, cytokines, and cell activation pathways which are targets for many of the currently available and investigational therapies for this condition.​​ Studies have demonstrated that chronic urticaria causes a significant amount of distress and disruption to patients' daily lives that can be measured using various validated patient-reported outcomes measures.​​ In this review, we will explore the epidemiology, pathophysiology, chronic urticaria subtypes, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of chronic urticaria.

### Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach [^113qfUoj]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria (i.e., pruritic, raised wheals) and angioedema (i.e., deep mucocutaneous swelling) occur in up to 25 percent of the U.S. population. Vasoactive mediators released from mast cells and basophils produce the classic wheal and flare reaction. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially if symptoms are chronic or minimally responsive to therapy. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and methodical investigation are necessary to uncover diagnostic clues. Although serious medical illness can occur concurrently with chronic urticaria, acute urticaria generally is benign and self-limited. The mainstay of therapy for urticaria is avoidance of known triggering agents, judicious use of oral corticosteroids, and treatment with long-acting second-generation antihistamines, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory leukotriene antagonists. Consultation for investigative therapy may be necessary if symptoms continue despite a stepwise approach to diagnosis and therapy.

### Urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^114KLjLg]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria involves intensely pruritic, raised wheals, with or without edema of the deeper cutis. It is usually a self-limited, benign reaction, but can be chronic. Rarely, it may represent serious systemic disease or a life-threatening allergic reaction. Urticaria has a lifetime prevalence of approximately 20 percent in the general population. It is caused by immunoglobulin E- and nonimmunoglobulin E-mediated mast cell and basophil release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Diagnosis is made clinically. Chronic urticaria is usually idiopathic and requires only a simple laboratory workup unless elements of the history or physical examination suggest specific underlying conditions. Treatment includes avoidance of triggers, although these can be identified in only 10 to 20 percent of patients with chronic urticaria. First-line pharmacotherapy for acute and chronic urticaria is nonsedating second-generation antihistamines (histamine H1 blockers), which can be titrated to larger than standard doses. First-generation antihistamines, histamine H2 blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and brief corticosteroid bursts may be used as adjunctive treatment. More than one-half of patients with chronic urticaria will have resolution or improvement of symptoms within one year.

Concluding remarks

Due to the lack of knowledge of the physiopathological CSU mechanisms, a plethora of causative theories and alternative therapies have always emerged. CSU landscape has greatly changed. We now have much better tools to assess severity and quality of life. More importantly at the present time, we could offer a real hope to control symptoms to these desperate patients. For that reason, it is very important to provide physicians with updated knowledge. Delivering clear and simple recommendations on when and how apply these new tools and treatments also reinforces good clinical practice that in turn will greatly improve patients' life and healthcare performance. It is quite discouraging to observe differences between the American and European CSU diagnosis and treatment approaches. Both sides have points to make and each of them has strengths and weaknesses. We tried to offer a FAQ (Frequent Asked Questions) section for the physician who approaches a CSU patient. Our main point would be to take into consideration the recent existence of a very effective treatment and not to continue offering outdated treatment options.

Urticarial wheals and angioedema are 2 different clinical symptoms. Both belong to various disease entities, and may occur in combination or be isolated. Increased vasodilation and vasopermeability is a common feature. Histamine and bradykinin are well-known mediators. For clinical purposes, 3 groups of diseases can be differentiated: diseases with urticaria and angioedema, diseases with angioedema alone, and diseases with urticarial lesions without angioedema. The article presents an overview of these groups and the role of the main mediators, and the clinical features of urticaria and angioedema.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria: the devil's itch [^112mTAGF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is defined as the presence of urticaria for a period exceeding 6 weeks, assuming symptoms for most days of the week. It is divided into chronic inducible urticarias and chronic spontaneous urticaria, previously termed chronic idiopathic urticaria. The latter designation emphasizes that patients can experience urticaria independent of any exogenous stimulus even if one can define circumstances that may worsen symptoms. A search for such an external "cause" is fruitless because the underlying abnormality is "intrinsic", whether it is autoimmune, or some unknown process. Approximately 40% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria report accompanying episodes of angioedema, whereas 10% have angioedema as their primary manifestation. In most cases, it is a self-limiting disorder, persisting for 2 to 5 years in most cases, although 20% of patients suffer for more than 5 years. The treatment that has evolved is largely empiric, based on double-blind, placebo-controlled studies whenever possible, but is not yet targeted to any particular pathogenic mechanism. In this article, we review the current status regarding pathogenesis, discuss the diagnostic workup, and update the approach to treatment including consideration of published guidelines, our own experience, and guideline updates that are being prepared.

### The urticaria spectrum: recognition of clinical patterns can help management [^1172t6Qk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria has diverse clinical presentations and causes. The implication of classifying urticaria primarily by clinical presentation rather than aetiology is that management can be focused on specific clinical problems without extensive investigations. Management pathways may involve nonpharmacological measures and drug interventions, which can be grouped into first-, second- and third-line therapies. Stronger, but potentially more risky, second- and third-line approaches may be justified for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy with antihistamines even though it may not be possible to define a specific aetiology, such as autoimmune urticaria, with confidence.

### An approach to the hospitalized patient with urticaria and fever [^112ws4A1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common skin disorder with a long differential diagnosis. Most cases are readily treated symptomatically and have no systemic implications. However, a number of diseases and syndromes, including vasculitides, immunologic disorders, infectious diseases, hematologic diseases, and autoinflammatory syndromes, can present with urticaria and systemic symptoms, which may lead to hospitalization of the patient. These urticarial syndromes are important to recognize as they often have significant health implications. A comprehensive history and physical exam is important in distinguishing cases of simple urticaria from these syndromes. The presence of atypical wheals, systemic symptoms such as fever or arthralgia, and a lack of response to antihistamine therapy are important diagnostic clues that should prompt further workup.

A growing body of evidence shows that at least 40% of patients with unexplained (idiopathic) chronic urticaria have clinically relevant functional autoantibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor on basophils and mast cells. The term "autoimmune urticaria" is used for this subgroup of patients presenting with continuous ordinary urticaria. This article reviews the evidence for the autoimmune hypothesis and other nonantibody serum histamine-releasing factors in the etiopathogenesis of urticaria; defines autoimmune urticaria; looks at how autoimmune urticaria fits into existing classifications of urticaria; proposes diagnostic criteria that may be useful to the clinician; and reviews the management implications for patients with this subset of chronic disease.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^111fWigc]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

There are many unsolved issues in CSU, from the underlying lack of large epidemiology studies. In the present review, practical guidance based on common questions related to the clinical management of patients with CSU is provided. We selected key questions from previously published guidelines and updated them using the most recently available evidence obtained from a careful critique of the literature. We also tried to cover a number of topics that are given less attention in current CSU guidelines, such as prognosis, severity assessment and urticaria duration.

### Chronic urticaria [^111u5XWi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic urticaria:

- **Definition**: Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a persistent pruritic disorder defined by recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both occurring most days for more than 6 weeks without an external trigger. Symptoms are mediated by transient, localized dermal edema and sensory nerve activation and substantially impair QoL.
- Pathophysiology: Dermal mast cells are central drivers; their degranulation releases histamine, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor, and cytokines that increase vascular permeability and recruit eosinophils, basophils, T cells and neutrophils. Two immune endotypes are recognized: an IgE-driven "autoallergic" mechanism with IgE autoantibodies to self antigens, and a type IIb autoimmune mechanism with IgG anti-FcεRI or anti-IgE that activates mast cells and complement; additional contributors include coagulation pathway activation, cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-33, and MRGPRX2-mediated non-IgE mast cell activation.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of chronic urticaria in the US is estimated at 230 cases per 100,000 adults.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for chronic urticaria include autoimmune disorders and a history of acute urticaria. Certain triggers or exacerbating factors, such as drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics), can also induce urticaria.
- Disease course: Onset is usually abrupt after a latency period and the course is heterogeneous: many patients remit within months but a substantial fraction experience years of intermittent flares; angioedema occurs in roughly 40–50% and may dominate the clinical picture. Disease activity is assessed clinically (UAS7) and by biomarkers that correlate with severity or treatment response, for example low total IgE and basopenia with type IIb disease and elevated D-dimer or CRP with more active disease.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic spontaneous urticaria is typically self-limited, with most patients improving within months to a few years, though some experience prolonged or recurrent disease. Severe activity, angioedema, autoimmune features, and elevated inflammatory markers predict a slower response and greater chronicity. Mortality is negligible, but persistent symptoms can markedly affect QoL, requiring long-term monitoring and individualized treatment.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1171hJDv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria — diagnosis and management algorithm begins when a "Patient presents with possible acute urticaria and/or angioedema", prompting "DETAILED HISTORY INCLUDING REVIEW OF SYSTEMS" (including "Drug or biologic agent exposure(s)?" and "Physical triggers – evaluate with visual analog scale and itch severity scale") and "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION" (e.g., "Extent and characteristics of the urticaria/angioedema lesions" and "Presence of dermatographism"). When "Is the general evaluation listed in Box 2 suggestive of an underlying cause?" the next step is "SPECIFIC EVALUATION focused on the evaluation results of Box 2", followed by "Is specific evaluation suggestive of an underlying etiology?" and, if "Management of specific condition improves urticaria?", then "Follow up in 2–6 weeks, as symptoms and treatment response dictate: Modify (step down or discontinue) based on clinical response". If the general evaluation is not suggestive, the pathway states "MAY CONSIDER LIMITED NON-SPECIFIC EVALUATION" with labs that "May include CBC with diff, ESR, TSH, renal and liver profiles" and notes "Additional testing may be necessary depending on physician evaluation and patient circumstances", then proceed to "Initial Treatment" to "Remove/Avoid factors that may induce urticaria/angioedema", give "Antihistamines", consider "For moderate to severe cases oral glucocorticosteroids", and use "Epinephrine if potential for anaphylaxis".

### Urticaria and angioedema: an update on classification and pathogenesis [^112FHL9u]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a common, mast cell-driven disease presenting with wheals or angioedema or both. In the last years, urticaria has increasingly attracted notice to clinicians and researchers, last but not least inspired by the approval of omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody, for urticaria treatment. There is wide consensus on the clinical classification based on duration and elicitation. However, the pathogenesis is incompletely understood. This review summarizes current guidelines for the management and novel insights in the pathogenesis of urticaria with special focus on their impact on clinical praxis. The classification of urticaria subgroups is mainly based on clinical criteria: acute and chronic urticaria (CU). Chronic urticaria comprises both chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) that includes physical and non-physical urticarias. Recent research focused on characterizing the role of cells and mediators involved in the pathogenesis of urticaria, identifying the mechanisms of mast cell activation, and investigating underlying autoimmune processes in chronic spontaneous urticarial. Currently, non-sedating antihistamines and omalizumab, an antiimmunoglobulin E antibody, are recommended for the therapy of chronic urticaria, as both exhibit a favorable efficacy and safety profile. Novel therapeutic strategies aim at specifically targeting cells and mediators involved in the pathogenesis of urticaria.
