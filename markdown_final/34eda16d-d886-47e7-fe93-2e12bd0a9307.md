## Question

SGLTI cardiovascular benefits

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, including their magnitude, mechanisms, populations benefiting, and how to apply this in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence and extract key outcomes. Then, I should verify the consistency of effects across trials and subgroups. Next, I will examine mechanisms that plausibly explain benefits beyond glycemic control. After that, I need to check guideline positions and real-world applicability. Finally, I will consider safety, dosing, and practical implementation, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the strength of evidence and the main outcomes. Multiple large randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure by about 30% across diverse populations, with additional reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and this benefit emerges early and is largely independent of A1C change [^1b149a66] [^33ee429e] [^31240667] [^bfe221da].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing. In a 2024 Lancet meta-analysis of 15 trials and 100,952 patients, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced first HF hospitalization by 29% in HF, 28% in T2D, 32% in CKD, and 28% in ASCVD, and reduced cardiovascular death by 14% in HF, 15% in T2D, 11% in CKD, and 13% in ASCVD, with effects seen within weeks to months, supporting a hemodynamic rather than antiatherosclerotic mechanism [^1b149a66]. Earlier meta-analyses reported a 23% reduction in CV death or HF hospitalization and an 11% reduction in MACE in patients with established ASCVD, reinforcing a class effect with the most robust signal for HF outcomes [^33ee429e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MACE. I initially thought SGLT2 inhibitors uniformly reduce MACE, but I should double-check. The clearest MACE benefit is in patients with established ASCVD, whereas in primary prevention populations without ASCVD, MACE reductions are smaller and not always statistically significant, though HF and mortality benefits persist, which aligns with a mechanism more about ventricular loading and renal hemodynamics than plaque stabilization [^33ee429e] [^72b5095e] [^bfe221da].

> I need to check whether benefits extend to people without diabetes. Dedicated HF trials show that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduce HF hospitalization or CV death in HFrEF regardless of diabetes status, and empagliflozin also shows benefit in HFpEF, indicating that the cardiorenal effects are not contingent on glycemic control [^19a8369a] [^1b149a66] [^e5a87f58].

> Next, I should review mechanisms that explain these effects. Natriuresis and osmotic diuresis reduce plasma volume and preload, while modest blood pressure lowering and reduced arterial stiffness decrease afterload; tubuloglomerular feedback reduces intraglomerular pressure and albuminuria, and shifts in myocardial substrate toward ketone utilization may improve energy efficiency; anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects likely contribute, though some mechanistic data are preclinical and should be interpreted cautiously [^bfe221da] [^6fb05ded] [^455e9c8f].

> Let me consider guideline direction to ensure clinical alignment. Contemporary guidelines recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for T2D with ASCVD, HF, or CKD, and endorse their use for HF risk reduction irrespective of A1C, with some pathways prioritizing SGLT2 inhibitors in HF or CKD and GLP-1 RAs in ASCVD, while acknowledging that combination therapy can be considered when benefits outweigh risks [^91731342] [^96864688] [^993740f2] [^d174b7ad].

> I should confirm real-world applicability and disparities. Observational comparative effectiveness studies show lower risks of HF, death, MI, and stroke with SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP-4 inhibitors, supporting external validity, but underuse remains substantial, particularly among women, racial and ethnic minorities, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, highlighting a need for equity-focused implementation [^377a8a97] [^186ef1dd].

> Now, I need to ensure safety and dosing are addressed. Common adverse effects include mycotic genital infections and a small increase in euglycemic ketoacidosis risk; volume depletion can occur, so I should monitor blood pressure and volume status, especially in older adults or those on diuretics; for renal function, I should start at the trial-tested dose and avoid use for glycemic control when eGFR is below the labeled threshold, while recognizing that cardiorenal benefits persist down to eGFR around 20–30 mL/min/1.73 m² in many trials [^4da026dc] [^ded576d2] [^f064943e].

> But wait, what if the patient is at low cardiovascular risk and already on metformin. In low-risk T2D, head-to-head and comparative data suggest similar cardiovascular outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors versus metformin, so metformin remains reasonable first-line, though SGLT2 inhibitors can be considered when additional cardiometabolic benefits are desired or when metformin is not tolerated, with shared decision-making about modest A1C differences and cost [^5f10df41] [^db246d8c].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing is missing. SGLT2 inhibitors confer robust, early, and consistent reductions in HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death across T2D, HF, and CKD populations, with the strongest evidence for HF outcomes and benefits that are largely independent of A1C; clinically, I should prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D and HF or CKD, consider them in T2D with ASCVD, and extend use to HFrEF and HFpEF even without diabetes, while applying guideline-concordant dosing, monitoring, and safety checks [^1b149a66] [^33ee429e] [^91731342] [^96864688].

SGLT2 inhibitors provide **cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control** [^bfe221da], with consistent reductions in heart failure hospitalization [^1b149a66] and cardiovascular death across diverse populations, including patients with and without diabetes [^6e7a7016]. These benefits are **largely independent of HbA1c** [^bfe221da] and are mediated by hemodynamic, metabolic, and anti-inflammatory effects [^6fb05ded]. Major guidelines recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease [^91731342] [^96864688], and their use is expanding into heart failure care regardless of diabetes status [^e5a87f58].

## Key cardiovascular outcomes

### Heart failure outcomes

- **Hospitalization for heart failure (HHF)**: SGLT2 inhibitors consistently reduce HHF by approximately 30–35% across major trials [^1b149a66] [^33ee429e], including EMPA-REG OUTCOME [^notfound], CANVAS [^notfound], DECLARE-TIMI 58 [^notfound], DAPA-HF [^notfound], and EMPEROR-Reduced [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular death or HHF**: Significant reductions in the composite of cardiovascular death or HHF are observed in multiple trials [^1b149a66], including DECLARE-TIMI 58 [^notfound] and DAPA-HF [^notfound].

- **Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**: Emerging evidence suggests benefits in HFpEF, with the EMPEROR-Preserved trial demonstrating reduced cardiovascular death or HHF [^notfound].

---

### Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes

- **Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce MACE by approximately 11–14% in patients with established ASCVD [^33ee429e] [^62eb33e4], with the most pronounced effects observed in this subgroup [^33ee429e].

- **Cardiovascular death**: Significant reductions in cardiovascular death are reported in several trials, including EMPA-REG OUTCOME [^32903482] and DAPA-HF [^notfound].

- **Myocardial infarction and stroke**: While some trials show modest reductions, the most consistent and significant benefits are observed in heart failure and cardiovascular death outcomes [^1b149a66] [^33ee429e].

---

### Renal outcomes

SGLT2 inhibitors also provide **substantial renal benefits**, including a significant reduction in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^33ee429e] and renal composite outcomes, further contributing to cardiovascular risk reduction [^4da026dc].

---

## Mechanisms underlying cardiovascular benefits

The cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are **multifactorial and largely independent of glycemic control**:

- **Hemodynamic effects**: Natriuresis and osmotic diuresis reduce plasma volume, preload, and afterload, thereby improving cardiac function and reducing heart failure symptoms [^bfe221da] [^6a2d1d66].

- **Metabolic effects**: Shift towards ketone body metabolism improves myocardial energy efficiency and reduces oxidative stress [^bfe221da] [^94214aa1].

- **Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects**: Reductions in inflammatory markers and cardiac fibrosis contribute to improved cardiac structure and function [^bfe221da] [^94214aa1].

- **Renal effects**: Improved renal hemodynamics and reduced intraglomerular pressure slow CKD progression, indirectly benefiting cardiovascular outcomes [^bfe221da] [^6a59c1d9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines strongly recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for the following indications:

| **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Established cardiovascular disease (CVD) | Strong recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors [^91731342] [^96864688] |
| Heart failure (HF), particularly HFrEF | Strong recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors [^91731342] [^96864688] |
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | Strong recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors [^91731342] [^96864688] |
| High cardiovascular risk without established CVD | Consider SGLT2 inhibitors [^91731342] [^96864688] |

---

## Populations benefiting from SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits across **diverse populations**:

- **Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)**: Consistent reductions in cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalizations, and cardiovascular death [^33ee429e] [^1b149a66].

- **Patients with heart failure**: Benefits observed in both HFrEF and HFpEF, regardless of diabetes status [^1b149a66] [^e5a87f58].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: Significant reductions in cardiovascular events and slowing of renal disease progression [^33ee429e] [^4da026dc].

- **Primary prevention populations**: Emerging evidence suggests potential benefits in high-risk individuals without established cardiovascular disease, though further research is needed [^72b5095e] [^62eb33e4].

---

## Safety considerations

SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but clinicians should be aware of the following safety considerations:

- **Genital mycotic infections**: Increased risk, particularly in women [^3ed01fae].

- **Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis**: Rare but serious; patients should be educated about symptoms and risk factors [^f064943e].

- **Volume depletion**: Caution advised in elderly patients or those on diuretics [^notfound].

- **Renal function monitoring**: Recommended at initiation and periodically thereafter [^notfound].

---

SGLT2 inhibitors provide **significant cardiovascular benefits**, particularly in reducing heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, across diverse patient populations. These benefits are largely independent of glycemic control and are supported by robust clinical evidence and contemporary guidelines, making SGLT2 inhibitors a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk management in appropriate patients [^1b149a66] [^91731342].

## References

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^3a2b4cee]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

Cardiovascular protection mechanisms of SGLT2i

The cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2i are mediated by multiple direct and indirect mechanisms that are interwoven and interactional (Fig. 2). These mechanisms improve many aspects of the cardiovascular system, including hemodynamics, metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation.

Fig. 2
Cardiovascular protection mechanisms of SGLT2i. SGLT2i directly increase natriuresis and glycosuria, leading to a spectrum of secondary beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Inhibition of the cardiac Na + /H + exchanger and protection of renal function mediated by SGLT2i may also, to some extent, play a beneficial role. These effects jointly contribute to the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2i, especially the reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure

### How should we monitor the cardiovascular benefit of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition? [^119c5ec6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system beyond their glucose-lowering effect and are increasingly prescribed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure (HF). Although the magnitude of the treatment effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on such cardiorenal outcomes varied among the large-scale outcome trials, no explanation for the statistical evidence of heterogeneity in the treatment effects on such outcomes could be clearly identified. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors have plausible class effects on cardiorenal outcomes. Indeed, some large-scale observational cohort studies also demonstrated that initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors compared with other glucose-lowering drugs, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, was associated with a decreased risk of cardiorenal events among patients with T2D in clinical practice.

### How should we monitor the cardiovascular benefit of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition? [^f0fb75b3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly prescribed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure (HF). The mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce such risk are likely to be independent of diabetes status and improvement of glycemic control. In this commentary, based on recent mediation analyses of cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, we discuss the prognostic role of a well-known HF-related biomarker, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Interestingly, the NT-proBNP concentration had a relatively small impact on the SGLT2 inhibitor-associated benefit on HF events, suggesting a limited value in measuring NT-proBNP concentrations to monitor effects on cardiovascular outcomes after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Instead, clinical factors, such as body weight and volume status, were prognostic for cardiovascular outcomes. As shown in some biomarker studies, short-term SGLT2 inhibitor treatment significantly improved volume and HF-related health status, despite the absence of a significant change in NT-proBNP concentration. Given the early and continuous risk reduction in HF events seen in the cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, changes in these fundamental clinical parameters after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, independent of NT-proBNP, could be more prognostic and could represent key determinants to identify responders or non-responders to SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, this commentary highlights the clinical importance of establishing how clinicians should monitor patients initiating SGLT2 inhibitor therapy to predict the expected cardiovascular benefit. Further detailed investigations and discussion to better understand this "black box" are urgently warranted.

### Cardiovascular effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors: what we have learned from cardiovascular outcome trials and what we still need to understand [^9332b17b]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The recent results of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial forces a profound reflection about the cardiovascular protection conferred by SGLT-2 inhibitors. DECLARE-TIMI 58, the largest cardiovascular outcome trial in diabetes, failed to show a significant reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) conferred by dapagliflozin compared with placebo. However, a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure was reported. Whilst the lack of benefits on MACE may seem in contrast with the results of previous SGLT-2 inhibitors cardiovascular outcome trials, DECLARE clearly delineates the real cardiovascular effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, which mainly tackle heart failure. Differences in study design and population enrolled are crucial to correctly value each molecule and to translate results of clinical trials in daily clinical practise.

### Mechanisms of cardiovascular benefits of sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: a state-of-the-art review [^19a8369a]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Whereas the aforementioned trials provided robust evidence to suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can prevent incident heart failure, 2 important questions remained unanswered. First, could these therapies also be used in the treatment of prevalent heart failure, and second, is the benefit seen in people without type 2 diabetes? Importantly, in this regard, the recently completed DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure) trial, which enrolled 4,744 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction demonstrated a marked reduction on worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death on top of excellent heart failure standard-of-care therapy. Furthermore, this benefit was similar in those with and without type 2 diabetes and was consistent across the spectrum of A 1c evaluated either categorically or continuously.

From a List To Synthesis: What Mechanisms Most Likely Explain The Benefits Observed?

A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors have impressive beneficial cardiovascular effects in both patients with diabetes and patients who do not have diabetes, but do have heart failure. As a result, SGLT2 inhibitors are a new weapon that can be added to the arsenal of weapons used to treat heart failure. However, it remains unclear exactly how SGLT2 inhibitors produce their impressive clinical benefits in patients with heart failure (Central Illustration). It is clear that its classical actions of lowering blood glucose cannot fully explain these benefits. The early onset of the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials suggests that these benefits are not occurring as a result of slowing the atherosclerotic process. Whereas the published reports are replete with numerous proposed mechanisms linking SGLT2 inhibition to cardiovascular protection, how do we synthesize and prioritize these to help explain the observed clinical benefits? Taking a bedside-to-bench approach, the clinical data would suggest that the mechanism(s) involved must account for the following key elements: 1) efficacy in the treatment and prevention of heart failure; 2) efficacy on top of excellent background therapy, including neprilysin inhibition; 3) rapid onset of the benefit; 4) efficacy independent of glycemic status; and 5) association with renal protection. We opine that the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are an important mechanism of action and that some of the cardiovascular benefits are secondary to this. According to this theory, SGLT2 inhibition result in an early hemodynamic effect at the level of the proximal renal tubule. This in turn promotes sodium and water loss while also, through tubule-glomerular feedback, promoting afferent arteriolar constriction. The ensuring reduction in intraglomerular pressure leads to renal protection. Improving renal function and/or reducing renal stress can indirectly improve cardiac function through various pathways, including a reduction in afferent SNS activation, reduction in inflammation, and ROS generation. We propose that future studies are required to examine these possibilities. We also argue that the renal hemodynamic effects are observed independent of glycemia, because in the DAPA-HF trial an initial drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate was observed in people both with and without diabetes. The increase in EPO production may also be secondary to an improvement in renal health and may explain why the hematocrit is increased to a similar extent in people both with and without diabetes in DAPA-HF. Additional intriguing mechanisms for the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in heart failure include improving cardiac energy metabolism and decreasing cardiac inflammation. Further studies are needed to examine SGLT2 inhibition impacts on these pathways in the setting of heart failure, as well as the potential inter-relationship between these 2 pathways (because ketones can inhibit the inflammatory pathway). Further studies should help elucidate exactly how SGLT2 inhibitors exert these impressive cardiovascular effects.

### How should we monitor the cardiovascular benefit of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition? [^ebac8b81]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly prescribed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure (HF). The mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce such risk are likely to be independent of diabetes status and improvement of glycemic control. In this commentary, based on recent mediation analyses of cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, we discuss the prognostic role of a well-known HF-related biomarker, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Interestingly, the NT-proBNP concentration had a relatively small impact on the SGLT2 inhibitor-associated benefit on HF events, suggesting a limited value in measuring NT-proBNP concentrations to monitor effects on cardiovascular outcomes after initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

### Cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in diabetic and nondiabetic patients [^33611f31]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) were developed as antidiabetic agents, but accumulating evidence has shown their beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) suggested that these benefits are independent of glycemic control. Several large-scale outcome trials of SGLT2i also showed cardiovascular benefits in nondiabetic patients, strengthening this perspective. Extensive animal and clinical studies have likewise shown that mechanisms other than the antihyperglycemic effect underlie the cardiovascular benefits. Recent clinical guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases because of the proven cardiovascular protective effects. Since the cardiovascular benefits are independent of glycemic control, the therapeutic spectrum of SGLT2i will likely be extended to nondiabetic patients.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^058c93ac]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Maximising Benefits in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: Beyond HbA1c

Treatment with SGLT2i medication has demonstrated efficacy in attaining glycaemic targets, for which the class is currently indicated. The SGLT2i class is associated with weight loss and lowering of BP, no increase in hypoglycaemia and, via a number of mechanisms, has increasingly robust evidence for the reduction of CVD, HF hospitalisation and CV death, in people with and without pre-existing CVD. Although the evidence on effects on overall mortality and ASCVD are still evolving, there is a demonstrated class effect showing benefit in HF. Treatment of T2DM with SGLT2 inhibition has been associated with significant reduction in albuminuria and reduced incidence of worsening albuminuria.

SGLT2i treatments are well tolerated and have a favourable risk–benefit profile for many people with T2DM. In practice, SGLT2i therapies appear to have a meaningful impact, with an NNT for several CVD outcomes similar to those of commonly prescribed drugs for the management and prevention of CVD.

As HCPs seek to personalise medicine for people with T2DM, it is appropriate to not only take a glucocentric approach. An approach of 'treating the person, rather than a disease' is of particular importance in managing T2DM, where multiple comorbidities are common. Treating each condition in isolation may lead to missed opportunities in improving overall outcomes for people with T2DM.

The Improving Diabetes Steering Committee suggests that SGLT2i therapies, for many people with T2DM and at risk of CVD, may represent a logical first escalation from metformin.

While glucose control remains the cornerstone of diabetes management, including selecting appropriate HbA1c targets and aggressiveness of therapy in consultation with the patient, there are clearly outcome benefits beyond attainment of glycaemic targets. It is prudent therefore to consider the CVD risk factors people with T2DM may have and then consider treatment options that take these factors into account. This is important considering the shared risk factors, particularly elevated blood pressure, dyslipidaemia and obesity, for developing CVD and T2DM.

### Cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in diabetic and nondiabetic patients [^40e0efb2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Large-scale clinical trials of SGLT2i all showed cardiovascular benefits across different patients, most notably a significant decrease in the occurrence of HF. Because of the proven benefits of SGLT2i, which are independent of glycemic control, many international guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i in diabetic patients with CVD. SGLT2i directly increase natriuresis and glycosuria, leading to a spectrum of downstream effects. These effects jointly underlie the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2i. Recently, several large-scale trials have discovered similar cardiovascular benefits in nondiabetic patients with HFrEF. Consequently, SGLT2i will be likely to be used to treat nondiabetic patients with HFrEF.

### Potential mechanisms of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitor-related cardiovascular benefits [^6a2d1d66]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The findings of recent clinical trials have shown that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors produce effects beyond glucose lowering and have demonstrated beneficial cardiovascular effects that have been observed across a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In particular, the cardiovascular benefit results largely from substantial and early effects of SGLT2 inhibition on cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. Recent cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) have also shown that relative risk reductions in cardiovascular outcomes were observed with SGLT2 inhibition both in patients with current and prior heart failure. Since the observed reductions of cardiovascular outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy were observed much earlier than would be expected by an anti-atherosclerotic effect, these results have led to speculation about the potential underlying pathways. Suggested mechanisms include natriuresis and osmotic diuresis; reductions in inflammation, oxidative stress, and arterial stiffness; reductions in blood pressure and body weight; and possible renoprotective effects. These effects could produce cardiovascular benefits through a range of cardiac effects, including reduction in left ventricular load, attenuation of cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, and improved myocardial energy production. Other possible mechanisms include inhibition of sodium-hydrogen exchange, increases in erythropoietin levels, and reduction in myocardial ischemia or reperfusion injury. It is likely that a range of mechanisms underlie the observed cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors; further elucidation of these mechanisms will be answered by ongoing research.

SGLT2 inhibitor therapy and cardiovascular outcomes

In response to concerns about the increased cardiovascular risk associated with some treatments for diabetes, regulators in the USA and Europe mandated cardiovascular safety trials of all new hypoglycaemic drugs in 2008. In recent cardiovascular outcome trials, the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) and SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular events, reversing the trend of previous therapies. While the benefits with GLP-1RAs are associated with reduced atherothrombotic events like myocardial infarction and stroke, SGLT2-inhibitor therapies have demonstrated improved outcomes in heart failure(table 2). Interestingly, the reduction in heart failure hospitalisation was observed within months of randomisation, suggesting a different mechanism of effect from those of other glucose-lowering drugs which usually takes years to manifest. The consistent signal of improved heart failure outcomes in the early trials led to the 'Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction' (DAPA-HF trial) which was specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of the SGLT2-inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. This trial showed that dapagliflozin reduces the risk of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes by 26%, regardless of diabetes status, suggesting that these benefits are independent of the drug's glucose-lowering effect'. More recently, results from the 'Empagliflozin outcome trial in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction' (EMPEROR-Reduced) trial showed that empagliflozin also reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalisation in patients with known heart failure with reduced ejection fraction regardless of diabetes status. In both of these trials, the risk reduction seen in their primary outcomes was principally driven by a reduction in hospitalisations for heart failure. Meta-analysis of these two trials shows consistency of effect of both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin with reductions in all the individual endpoints of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure or decline in renal function. Thus, these striking benefits appear to be a class effect of SGLT2-inhibitor therapies. So, what is the mechanism of these marked benefits?

Conventional potential mechanisms of benefit with SGLT2 inhibition

The desirable cardiovascular effects seen with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment may be multifactorial, but key pathways involved are currently being explored. Some of the conventional theories are discussed in the following section.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor: comparing trial data and real-world use [^677fb3b7]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

It should be clearly stated that SGLT2 inhibitors have benefits beyond cardiovascular risk reduction: predominantly improved glycemic control and weight loss. Our real-world data demonstrate that people prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors have a higher BMI than others with T2DM. This trend suggests that the weight loss benefits of the class are a key consideration in prescribing. Whilst our analysis demonstrates that the cardiovascular benefit identified in the EMPA-REG trial can only be extrapolated to a small proportion of those currently prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors, this group will still experience glycemic and weight loss benefits.

The SGLT2 inhibitor class of medication is costlier than older therapies. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK has previously undertaken an economic analysis of the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and considers their use to be below the cost-effectiveness thresholds. Otherwise analyses also suggest SGLT2 inhibitors provide cost-effective benefit. The benefits in these analyses are based on the glucose-lowering potential and do not consider the additional cardiovascular benefits seen in the EMPA-REG trial. Although we show that the trial findings can be only applied directly to a small proportion of those with T2DM, incorporation of the additional cardiovascular risk reduction into existing economic models is still likely to improve the cost–benefit estimates.

Future Research

Our data highlight the importance of further research to identify any cardiovascular benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors in lower-risk groups which make up the majority of SGLT2 inhibitor use currently. This leads to several important clinically relevant questions: Are there any cardiovascular benefits with canagliflozin and dapagliflozin (which makes up the majority of SGLT2 inhibitor prescriptions currently)? What, if any, is the degree of cardiovascular benefit afforded in the lower cardiovascular risk groups? The ongoing cardiovascular safety trials with canagliflozin (CANVAS) and dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58) will go some way to answering these questions. The CANVAS trial is estimated to complete in 2017 and DECLARE-TIMI 58 in 2019. These trials should be supported by real-world analyses of cardiovascular outcomes in people currently treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

The EMPA-REG, CANVAS, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials also exclude people with certain comorbidities. Many of those excluded may have had significant cardiovascular risk. Additional real-world evidence may also be needed to clarify whether the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in those with multimorbidity confers cardiovascular benefit.

### Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2… [^31240667]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

This meta-analysis of 10 high-quality randomized clinical trials found that use of SGLT2-Is was associated with lower occurrence of cardiovascular death or HHF by 33% in high-risk patients. For the primary outcome of HHF or cardiovascular death, the study showed equal benefit of SGLT2-Is in both sexes; lower risk in participants who were younger than 65 years compared with those 65 years or older; and greater risk reduction in participants who were Asian, Black, or of other races or ethnicities compared with White participants. Meaning These findings suggest that SGLT2-Is may be associated with an overall cardiovascular benefit for patients with high-risk cardiovascular features compared with placebo in both sexes, different age groups and different races and ethnicities. Importance The cardiovascular outcome in selected populations when sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are emerging as standard therapy is not clearly understood.

It is important to learn the magnitude of cardiovascular benefit using SGLT2-Is across the select subgroups that include both sexes and multiple age and racial and ethnic groups. Our study found that SGLT2-I use was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular death or HHF by 33%, with a number needed to treat of 5. 7 at P <.
001. This result was significant when HHF admissions and cardiovascular death were analyzed independently as well. There was a 2. 44% decreased event rate in the SGLT2-I group compared with the placebo group. The cardiac benefits of SGLT2-Is have been hypothesized to be due to several mechanisms. The cardioprotective effects of SGLT2-Is are secondary to an improvement in ventricular load through a reduction in preload by eliciting natriuresis and osmotic diuresis and a decrease in afterload by lowering blood pressure and improving vascular function.

23 In addition, SGLT2-Is have been compared in other studies with loop diuretics; both were associated with a similar natriuretic effect and reduced interstitial fluid. Our meta-analysis evaluated a wide spectrum of efficacy outcomes, further characterizing the primary outcome in different subgroups from several well-designed large clinical trials. It supports that SGLT2-Is have emerged as an effective class of drugs for improving cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including the prevention of HHF and reducing all-cause mortality in selected patients.

### Different sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: can they prevent death? [^78da2379]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) demonstrate cardiovascular (CV) safety and benefits. Some dedicated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate benefit in terms of renal outcomes and hospitalization due to heart failure (HF). RCTs report differences in the secondary outcomes with respect to mortality (CV and/or all-cause). We undertook a meta-analysis of all SGLT2is for which in addition to CVOT, HF outcome/renal outcome studies are available to establish whether individual SGLT2is were able to prevent death.

Methods

We included available event-driven randomized, placebo-controlled CVOTs and dedicated RCTs of SGLT2is exploring renal outcomes and HF. We included 3 trials of empagliflozin, 3 of dapagliflozin, 2 of canagliflozin, and 2 of sotagliflozin. The efficacy outcomes included all-cause mortality and CV mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were pooled for individual molecules.

Results

The HR for all-cause mortality including all trials was 0.86 (0.80–0.93). The HRs for all-cause mortality in empagliflozin (N = 16738), dapagliflozin (N = 26208), canagliflozin (N = 14543), and sotagliflozin (N = 11806) were 0.86 (0.69–1.08), 0.83 (0.72–0.97), 0.86 (0.75–0.97), and 0.95 (0.81–1.11), respectively. The HR for CV mortality including all trials was 0.85 (0.78–0.92). The HRs for CV mortality in empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, sotagliflozin, and canagliflozin were 0.81 (0.63–1.03), 0.88 (0.78–1.00), 0.89 (0.74–1.07), and 0.84 (0.72–0.98), respectively.

Conclusion

SGLT2is as a class reduce both all-cause mortality and CV mortality. Canagliflozin possibly reduces both all-cause mortality and CV mortality, whereas dapagliflozin may reduce all-cause mortality but not CV mortality. Empagliflozin and sotagliflozin may reduce neither.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: are they all the same? A narrative review of cardiovascular outcome trials [^6f8329cc]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinically important improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and adverse cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes have been observed in numerous cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) investigating the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors over the last 5 years. However, differences in study outcomes between the various SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs are often challenging to interpret because of differences in the study design, participant characteristics and primary outcomes of the various trials. In clinical practice, this frequently challenges the clinician when choosing between the different SGLT2 inhibitors for a patient with type 2 diabetes and various cardiovascular or renal comorbidities. Discussion around the choice of SGLT2 inhibitor has been again revived by the recent publication of results from the VERTIS-CV, EMPEROR-reduced and DAPA-CKD trials investigating cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes associated with various SGLT2 inhibitors. This narrative review gives an overview of the mechanism of action and differences in the underlying pharmacology of the various SGLT2 inhibitors and discusses the key cardiovascular, heart failure and renal outcomes from completed CVOTs for SGLT2 inhibitors. Discussion highlights important differences in the study design and participant characteristics which limit the comparison of trials and medications within this drug class.

Further indirect mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated cardiovascular benefit include improved myocardial energy efficiency by shifting to ketone metabolism, a more energy efficient substrate than glucose or fatty acids. However, this effect is quite modest and some question the significance of this impact on cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, as SGLT2 inhibitors promote glycosuria these drugs induce a state of 'fasting mimicry' which activates the enzymes sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). As these enzymes have important anti-inflammatory effects within the heart, they may improve cardiac function.

Other putative direct mechanisms of cardiovascular benefit associated with these drugs include improved endothelial function, though this is often argued to be an indirect consequence of improved metabolic parameters generally associated with diabetes treatment. Further direct mechanisms suggested for the benefits seen with SGLT2 inhibitors include direct myocardial Na/H pump inhibition which improves sensitivity to endogenous natriuretic peptides, and reduces cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and remodelling. Finally, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been shown to have anti-fibrotic effects to reduce cardiac remodelling and fibrosis. Nevertheless, many of these mechanisms have only been observed in animal models and are yet to be corroborated in human studies. Figure 1 summarises the proposed direct and indirect mechanisms of cardiovascular benefit associated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^4c80c9ac]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Unresolved questions for sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — key uncertainties and cautions include: Several important clinical questions regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs remain unanswered, including what are the benefits and risks of using both classes of medications simultaneously, as current guidelines do suggest the use of both classes of medications in some patient groups, but whether combination therapy leads to further improvements in outcome is unknown. It is also uncertain whether an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1RA should be the initial therapy in drug-naïve patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and what is the role for these medications in patients who do not have diabetic kidney disease (DKD) or established ASCVD but are at high risk, although we and others recommend their use in patients with a high burden of risk factors for CV disease. Finally, prioritization and sequencing among novel therapies are highlighted, and the writing committee emphasizes the importance of these drugs to CV specialists on the basis of their effects on CV risk reduction rather than a direct effect through glucose lowering; however, increased vigilance to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with HbA1c near or below target levels at SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA initiation is warranted, especially if the patient's existing T2D therapies include sulfonylureas, glinides, or insulin.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^97f8a864]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart failure (HF), is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). CVD and T2DM share common risk factors for development and progression, and there is significant overlap between the conditions in terms of worsening outcomes. In assessing the cardiovascular (CV) safety profiles of anti-diabetic drugs, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapies have emerged with robust evidence for reducing the risk of adverse CVD outcomes in people with T2DM who have either established CVD or are at risk of developing CVD. A previous consensus document from the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee has examined the potential role of SGLT2is in T2DM management and considered the risk–benefit profile of the class and the appropriate place for these medicines within the T2DM pathway. This paper builds on these findings and presents practical guidance for maximising the pleiotropic benefits of this class of medicines in people with T2DM in terms of reducing adverse CVD outcomes. The Improving Diabetes Steering Committee aims to offer evidence-based practical guidance for the use of SGLT2i therapies in people with T2DM stratified by CVD risk. This is of particular importance currently because some treatment guidelines have not been updated to reflect recent evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) and real-world studies that complement the CVOTs. The Improving Diabetes Steering Committee seeks to support healthcare professionals (HCPs) in appropriate treatment selection for people with T2DM who are at risk of developing or have established CVD and examines the role of SGLT2i therapy for these people.

### Benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases [^f4072a83]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as a class of medications with positive cardiovascular (CV) effects across a spectrum of patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there is clear evidence that SGLT2i reduce hospitalisations and mortality regardless of the presence of diabetes, and they are now recognised as the fourth pillar of pharmacological management. Recent trial data also indicate promising effects in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In patients with T2D and atherosclerotic CV diseases, multiple CV outcomes trials have shown reductions in major adverse CV events. Meta-analysis of these trials also shows lower rates of incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation with SGLT2i. Concerns regarding utilisation in patients with chronic kidney disease have been allayed in trials showing SGLT2i in fact have renoprotective effects. Questions still remain regarding the safety of SGLT2i in the acute heart failure setting and immediately post myocardial infarction, as well as in patients with more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, studies are underway evaluating SGLT2i in patients with heart valve disease, where positive effects on left ventricular remodelling may, for example, improve functional mitral regurgitation. In this review, we summarise the available evidence of recent CV outcomes trials of SGLT2i, focusing particularly on the application of these agents across various CV diseases. We detail evidence to support increased utilisation of these drugs, which in many cases will reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients routinely encountered by the CV specialist physician.

The Role of the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee

The Improving Diabetes Steering Committee comprises a panel of clinical experts from across primary and specialist care, who meet with the objective of improving diabetes care. The Committee aims to ensure that HCPs who prescribe diabetes medicines have access to balanced and accurate information and evidence concerning type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) medicines, with a specific focus on the sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) class of treatments. The group is committed to providing healthcare colleagues with clarity concerning the evidence base supporting SGLT2i agents, highlighting the relative benefits and risks of these therapies. Educational materials and publications, such as the previous consensus document, provided by the panel are intended to increase confidence and understanding regarding the appropriate place of these medicines within the current UK T2DM treatment paradigm. Due to the nature of the Committee, this article and related discussions are based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### The cardioprotective and anticancer effects of SGLT2 inhibitors: state-of-the-art review [^0da6ba98]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events, particularly heart failure, in patients with and without diabetes. An intriguing research area involves exploring the potential application of SGLT2 inhibitors in cardio-oncology, aiming to mitigate the cardiovascular adverse events associated with anticancer treatments. These inhibitors present a unique dual nature, offering both cardioprotective effects and anticancer properties, conferring a double benefit for cardio-oncology patients. In this review, the authors first examine the established cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure and subsequently explore the existing body of evidence, including both preclinical and clinical studies, that supports the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the context of cardio-oncology. The authors further discuss the mechanisms through which SGLT2 inhibitors protect against cardiovascular toxicity secondary to cancer treatment. Finally, they explore the potential anticancer effects of SGLT2 inhibitors along with their proposed mechanisms.

Cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes — use of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs for cardiovascular benefit independent of A1C is described as follows: addition of specific SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs that have demonstrated CVD benefit is recommended in individuals with established CVD, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure; the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs are not contingent upon A1C lowering, so initiation can be considered in people with type 2 diabetes and CVD independent of the current A1C, A1C goal, or metformin therapy; two strategies are offered — if already on dual or multiple glucose-lowering therapies and not on these agents, consider switching to one with proven cardiovascular benefit, and introduce SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs in people with CVD at A1C goal (independent of metformin) for cardiovascular benefit, independent of baseline A1C or individualized A1C goal.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality, but benefit is… [^bb83d1c9]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION What are the major cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in different patient populations. BOTTOM LINE A 14% reduction in cardiovascular death and a number needed to treat of 200 for 3 years to prevent one death was reported with SGLT-2 inhibitors. SYNOPSIS The authors of the meta-analysis included studies that compared SGLT-2 inhibitors with placebo in at least 1, 000 patients who were followed up for at least 6 months. They found a total of 11 studies with 78, 607 patients; all studies were industry sponsored. The mean age ranged from 62 to 72 years, 34% were female, and 75% were White. Nearly 80% of patients had diabetes, and 37% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m.

In four studies of patients with diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease, there was a significant overall reduction in the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events with SGLT-2 inhibitors. A similar benefit was seen in three studies of patients with chronic kidney disease but not in studies of patients with heart failure. It is important to point out that in the four trials with patients at high risk for CVD, two studies included only patients with established CVD, and the other two studies included 40% to 67% of patients with CVD. There was heterogeneity; for example, two of three trials that included patients with kidney disease produced negative results, and only one showed a significant benefit.

There was no significant reduction in myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, although cardiovascular deaths were significantly reduced.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D and associated comorbidities-differentiating within the class [^e5397fc2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single most common cause of mortality. In 2008 and 2012, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) respectively mandated cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) on all new anti-diabetic agents, as prospective trials statistically powered to rule out excess cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D. Unexpectedly, some of these CVOTs have demonstrated not only cardiovascular safety, but also cardioprotective effects, as was first shown for the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in EMPA-REG OUTCOME.

Expert Opinion

To debate newly available CVOT data and to put them into context, we convened as a group of medical experts from the Central and Eastern European Region. Here we describe our discussions, focusing on the conclusions we can draw from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and other SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs, including when considered alongside real-world evidence.

Conclusion

CVOTs investigating SGLT2 inhibitors have suggested benefits beyond glucose lowering that have been confirmed in real-world evidence studies.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: mechanisms of cardiovascular benefit beyond glycaemic control [^bfe221da]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are effective antidiabetic therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and are associated with improved glycaemic control as well as with reductions in body mass and blood pressure. In large cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, including hospitalization for heart failure, with this benefit extending to patients without diabetes who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The possible mechanisms of benefit are being extensively investigated because they are unlikely to be related to improved glycaemic control. Early natriuresis with a reduction in plasma volume, a consequent rise in haematocrit, improved vascular function, a reduction in blood pressure and changes in tissue sodium handling are all likely to have a role. Additional mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors that might be beneficial include a reduction in adipose tissue-mediated inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a shift towards ketone bodies as the metabolic substrate for the heart and kidneys, reduced oxidative stress, lowered serum uric acid level, reduced glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria, and suppression of advanced glycation end-product signalling. Further outcome trials and mechanistic studies, including in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or non-diabetic kidney disease, might identify other possible mechanisms of benefit of SGLT2-inhibitor therapy.

### Mechanistic insights regarding the role of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonist drugs on cardiovascular disease in diabetes [^a74e99ed]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment landscape for patients with established or at high risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus has entirely changed over the past decade, with the introduction of several anti-hyperglycemic agents. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are two anti-hyperglycemic classes which have been of special interest after multiple large cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes studies have demonstrated superiority of these agents compared to placebo for major adverse CVD events and in some cases, hospitalization for heart failure. Despite the dramatic results of these trials, only recently have we began to understand the mechanisms underlying these CVD benefits. Here we review the underlying mechanisms which have the greatest plausibility for both of these agents including the impact of ventricular loading conditions, direct effects on cardiac structure and function, myocardial energetics and sodium/hydrogen exchange for SGLT2 inhibitors, and the anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory, and modulation of endothelial function for GLP-1 agonists.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^096b81a0]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The Improving Diabetes Steering Committee has already commented on the risk–benefit considerations and the practical implications of the broad data from each pivotal SGLT2i trial available at the time of publication: EMPA-REG OUTCOME and Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS); subsequently the Dapagliflozin Effect on CardiovascuLAR Events (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial has provided additional data particularly for those at lower risk of CVD.

Here, the Committee considers the available evidence in the context of maximising benefit for people with T2DM and risk of CVD, with informed treatment selection and management strategy. A summary of study populations and selected endpoints is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2
Overview of trial population and selected cardiovascular endpoints in SGLT2i CVOTs. This figure reports selected outcomes from three trials of an active comparator versus placebo in addition to standard of care, and is not a head-to-head trial outcome. 3P-MACE 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events, CI confidence interval, CVD cardiovascular disease, CVOT cardiovascular outcomes trials, HHF hospitalisation for heart failure, HR hazard ratio

EMPA-REG OUTCOME examined the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg, compared with placebo, in addition to standard of care. The trial enrolled 7020 people with T2DM at high risk for CVD outcomes — all participants had established CVD. EMPA-REG OUTCOME reported a 14% relative risk reduction (RRR) in the 3P-MACE primary outcome versus placebo (HR 0.86; 95.02% CI 0.74–0.99; P = 0.04 for superiority), a 38% RRR in CV deaths (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49–0.77; P < 0.001), a 35% RRR for HHF (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.50–0.85; P = 0.002) and a 32% RRR in all-cause mortality (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57–0.82, P < 0.001). The study observed no significant differences between empagliflozin and placebo in MI reports (4.8% and 5.4%, respectively) or stroke incidence (3.5% and 3.0%, respectively).

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor therapy: mechanisms of action in heart failure [^6149c57e]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

SGLT2-inhibitor therapies are a promising new class of drugs for treating type 2 diabetes and heart failure. The cardioprotective effect of SGLT2 inhibition has been demonstrated in models of diabetic cardiomyopathy, heart failure and ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The mechanism through which SGLT2-inhibitor therapy exerts its benefit in patients with heart failure remains incompletely understood. It is possible that a combination of systemic and direct effects of SGLT2 inhibition on the myocardium ultimately leads to the cardiovascular benefits. However, there is strong pre-clinical evidence to suggest that improved myocardial ionic homeostasis has a role to play with regards to the cardiovascular benefits seen with SGLT2-inhibitor therapy. Studies examining the mechanistic role of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping our understanding of heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy and may open avenues for the development of future drug therapies that target these pathways.

### Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure outcomes and cardiovascular death across the cardiometabolic disease spectrum: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b149a66]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been studied in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. Individual trials were powered to study composite outcomes in one disease state. We aimed to evaluate the treatment effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on specific clinical endpoints across multiple demographic and disease subgroups.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we queried online databases (PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and SCOPUS) up to Feb 10, 2024, for primary and secondary analyses of large trials (n > 1000) of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including acute myocardial infarction). Outcomes studied included composite of first hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death, first hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death, total (first and recurrent) hospitalisation for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024513836.

Findings

We included 15 trials (N = 100952). Compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of first hospitalisation for heart failure by 29% in patients with heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·67–0·77]), 28% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·72 [0·67–0·77]), 32% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·68 [0·61–0·77]), and 28% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·72 [0·66–0·79]). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced cardiovascular death by 14% in patients with heart failure (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·79–0·93]), 15% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·85 [0·79–0·91]), 11% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·89 [0·82–0·96]), and 13% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·87 [0·78–0·97]). The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on both first hospitalisation for heart failure and cardiovascular death was consistent across the majority of the 51 subgroups studied. Notable exceptions included acute myocardial infarction (22% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (26% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death).

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibitors reduced heart failure events and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These effects were consistent across a wide range of subgroups within these populations. This supports the eligibility of a large population with cardiorenal-metabolic diseases for treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### SGLT2 inhibitors for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials [^33ee429e]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

The magnitude of effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on specific cardiovascular and renal outcomes and whether heterogeneity is based on key baseline characteristics remains undefined.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular outcome trials of SGLT2i in patients with type 2 diabetes. We searched PubMed and Embase for trials published up to Sept 24, 2018. Data search and extraction were completed with a standardised data form and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Efficacy outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death), the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, and progression of renal disease. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were pooled across trials, and efficacy outcomes were stratified by baseline presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and degree of renal function.

Findings

We included data from three identified trials and 34322 patients (60·2% with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), with 3342 major adverse cardiovascular events, 2028 cardiovascular deaths or hospitalisation sfor heart failure events, and 766 renal composite outcomes. SGLT2i reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 11% (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·83–0·96], p = 0·0014), with benefit only seen in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·86 [0·80–0·93]) and not in those without (1·00 [0·87–1·16], p for interaction = 0·0501). SGLT2i reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure by 23% (0·77 [0·71–0·84], p < 0·0001), with a similar benefit in patients with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and with and without a history of heart failure. SGLT2i reduced the risk of progression of renal disease by 45% (0·55 [0·48–0·64], p < 0·0001), with a similar benefit in those with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of benefit of SGLT2i varied with baseline renal function, with greater reductions in hospitalisations for heart failure (p for interaction = 0·0073) and lesser reductions in progression of renal disease (p for interaction = 0·0258) in patients with more severe kidney disease at baseline.

Interpretation

SGLT2i have moderate benefits on atherosclerotic major adverse cardiovascular events that seem confined to patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, they have robust benefits on reducing hospitalisation for heart failure and progression of renal disease regardless of existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a history of heart failure.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor effects on cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^73d131b8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events, specifically those related to heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. Reductions in major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) outcomes are also observed, but confined largely to patients who have prior cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular outcome benefits extend to patients with type 2 diabetes and reduced estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate down to 30mL/min/1.73m2 and to patients with heart failure but without diabetes. Ongoing trials are exploring whether patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but without diabetes will gain similar benefits from this class of agents. Although some safety concerns have emerged, it seems likely that SGLT2 inhibitors will be used more widely in CKD patients to reduce their cardiovascular risk.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists: established and emerging indications [^f064943e]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are used in patients with type 2 diabetes as glucose lowering therapies, with additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction. Data from cardiovascular outcome trials have highlighted that these drugs confer protection against major cardiovascular disease in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reduce the risk of admission to hospital for heart failure, and reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ongoing research using hard renal endpoints such as end stage kidney disease rather than surrogate markers might clarify the renoprotective benefits of both agents. When used for glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are most effective if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is more than 60 mL per min per 1·73m 2 at initiation and should be avoided where there is a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. GLP-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in those with a history of medullary thyroid cancer and used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis of a known cause. These drugs are now second-line, or even arguably first-line, glucose lowering therapies in patients with cardiorenal disease, irrespective of glycaemic control. If an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist is considered suitable in patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment should be prioritised according to existing evidence: GLP-1 receptor agonists should be considered in patients at a high risk of, or with established, cardiovascular disease and SGLT2 inhibitors considered for patients with heart failure (with reduced ejection fraction) or chronic kidney disease (with or without established cardiovascular disease). There is now compelling data on the benefits of these drugs for a range of other clinical indications even without type 2 diabetes, including for GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with obesity and overweight with weight-related comorbidities.

In 2015, the first large-scale placebo-controlled trial designed to assess cardiovascular safety of glucose-lowering with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition in type 2 diabetes mellitus raised hypotheses that the class could favourably modify not only risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but also hospitalization for heart failure, and the development or worsening of nephropathy. By the start of 2021, results from 10 large SGLT2 inhibitor placebo-controlled clinical outcome trials randomizing ∼71000 individuals have confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors can provide clinical benefits for each of these types of outcome in a range of different populations. The cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors appear to be larger than their comparatively modest effect on glycaemic control or glycosuria alone would predict, with three trials recently reporting that clinical benefits extend to individuals without diabetes mellitus who are at risk due to established heart failure, or albuminuric chronic kidney disease. This European Society of Cardiology position paper summarizes reported results from these 10 large clinical outcome trials considering separately each of the different types of cardiorenal benefit, summarizes key molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms, and provides a synopsis of metabolic effects and safety. We also describe ongoing placebo-controlled trials among individuals with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and among individuals with chronic kidney disease.

### Longer-term benefits and risks of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3ed01fae]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) are a recent class of medication approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous meta-analyses have quantified the benefits and harms of SGLT2Is; however, these analyses have been limited to specific outcomes and comparisons and included trials of short duration. We comprehensively reviewed the longer-term benefits and harms of SGLT2Is compared to placebo or other anti-hyperglycemic medications.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to July 2019 for randomized controlled trials of minimum 52 weeks' duration that enrolled adults with T2D, compared an SGLT2I to either placebo or other anti-hyperglycemic medications, and reported at least one outcome of interest including cardiovascular risk factors, microvascular and macrovascular complications, mortality, and adverse events. We conducted random effects meta-analyses to provide summary estimates using weighted mean differences (MD) and pooled relative risks (RR). The study was registered a priori with PROSPERO (CRD42018090506).

Results

Fifty articles describing 39 trials (vs. placebo, n = 28; vs. other anti-hyperglycemic medication, n = 12; vs. both, n = 1) and 112,128 patients were included in our analyses. Compared to placebo, SGLT2Is reduced cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hemoglobin A1c, MD-0.55%, 95% CI-0.62,-0.49), macrovascular outcomes (e.g., hospitalization for heart failure, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62, 0.78), and mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80, 0.94). Compared to other anti-hyperglycemic medications, SGLT2Is reduced cardiovascular risk factors, but insufficient data existed for other outcomes. About a fourfold increased risk of genital yeast infections for both genders was observed for comparisons vs. placebo and other anti-hyperglycemic medications.

Discussion

We found that SGLT2Is led to durable reductions in cardiovascular risk factors compared to both placebo and other anti-hyperglycemic medications. Reductions in macrovascular complications and mortality were only observed in comparisons with placebo, although trials comparing SGLT2Is vs. other anti-hyperglycemic medications were not designed to assess longer-term outcomes.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor: comparing trial data and real-world use [^6bf1c355]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Extrapolation of the EMPA-REG trial cardiovascular benefits to people with T2DM in the real world should be performed with extreme caution. In a large nationally representative sample of people with T2DM we found that only a small proportion of people had the same high cardiovascular risk as those people included in the EMPA-REG trial. Additionally, an even smaller proportion of those currently treated with SGLT2 inhibitors had the same high risk. It remains to be seen whether people with T2DM, multimorbidity, and high cardiovascular risk (who were excluded from the trials) similarly benefit from treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors. Further data are also needed to identify possible cardiovascular benefit in the remaining lower cardiovascular risk group.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^593c8f2c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global pandemic, with an estimated 370 million people currently affected. 1, 2 It is a major risk factor for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with CVD the leading cause of death in people with T2DM. 3 Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of glucose‐lowering agent whose mechanism of action involves blockade of SGLT2 cotransporters on the luminal surface of the proximal renal tubule. The resultant increase in glycosuria and natriuresis contributes to a broad range of metabolic benefits, 4 including reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin, body weight, blood pressure, and albuminuria. 5

Large randomized control trials of SGLT2 inhibition in T2DM 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 have shown a clear reduction in CVD events among individuals with established atherosclerotic CVD. 12, 13 There remains, however, significant uncertainty about the potential benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in those without established CVD, with recent reviews suggesting this is an area of uncertainty that needs further evaluation and clarification. 14 North American guidelines currently recommend the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as second‐line therapy after metformin, specifically in those with established atherosclerotic CVD. 15, 16

The comparative effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without reduced kidney function are also yet to be fully elucidated, with concerns that the renal mechanism of action might lead to attenuated efficacy in this population. The recent publication of the CREDENCE (The Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial, which reports on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes in patients with CKD and high vascular risk, enables this subgroup to be examined in greater detail. 10 In addition, people with concomitant T2DM and heart failure (HF) have a 10‐fold increase in mortality compared with those with T2DM without HF, 17 and the comparative effects of SGLT2 inhibition in these individuals are of great interest.

The aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to define the cardiovascular benefits and the effects on key safety outcomes of SGLT2 inhibition, overall and separately among participants with and without established CVD, reduced kidney function, or HF.

CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF SGLT2 INHIBITORS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES BASED ON DATA FROM CVOTs

Three CVOTs involving three SGLT2 inhibitors have been published to date, the Empagliflozin and Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE–TIMI 58). These studies randomized patients with type 2 diabetes with either a prior cardiovascular event or with cardiovascular risk factors to empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin or placebo, respectively. The proportion of patients who had experienced a prior cardiovascular event differed between these studies, ranging from 100% in EMPA-REG OUTCOME through 65.6% in CANVAS and 40.6% in DECLARE-TIMI 58 (Table 1). Although designed to confirm safety, all three studies demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events, particularly heart failure, in patients randomized to active drug.

Table 1
Details of CKD patients studied in SGLT2 inhibitor trials with main cardiovascular outcomes (compared with non-CKD patient subgroups where possible)

What can we learn from these trials about clinical outcome benefits in 'high-risk' patients who have both type 2 diabetes and CKD? As with most cardiovascular trials, exclusion criteria limited enrolment of patients with more severely impaired kidney function. Patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded from EMPA-REG and CANVAS, while a creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft–Gault) of 60 mL/min was the lower cut-off for kidney function in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial. Because of these inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients with Stages 4 and 5 CKD were not recruited into these studies. However, all three CVOTs did include patients who fulfil criteria for Stage 3 CKD (on the basis of a sustained reduction in eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and Stages 1 and 2 CKD (on the basis of an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with persistent albuminuria).

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is contraindicated. For empagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended.

Inconsistencies and Similarities in Cardiovascular Outcomes: 3-P MACE, Mortality and HHF

Whilst these trials each explore similar cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitors with a similar trial design, there appears to be inconsistent cardiovascular benefit associated with these drugs. All SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs so far have demonstrated safety (non-inferiority) for 3-point MACE versus placebo. However, cardiovascular superiority for 3-point MACE has been demonstrated for empagliflozin (EMPA-REG) and canagliflozin (CANVAS and CREDENCE), but not for dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI) or ertugliflozin (VERTIS-CV). Further confusion arises when we compare cardiovascular outcomes from the heart failure outcome trials published to date; DAPA-HF (dapagliflozin) and EMPEROR-reduced (empagliflozin). These trials only included participants with HFrEF. In contrast with the previous CVOTs for each of these drugs, dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death versus placebo in DAPA-HF, whilst empagliflozin did not reduce cardiovascular death in EMPEROR-reduced.

With respect to hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) outcomes, all trials consistently showed superior outcomes versus placebo. Interestingly, the superior primary cardiovascular outcome of CV death or HHF was observed in participants with or without underlying T2D in the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-reduced trials. Indeed, superiority for the combined outcome of cardiovascular death or HHF in the DECLARE-TIMI trial was driven by the significant reduction in HHF. Similarly, in renal outcome trials SGLT2 inhibitors appear to reduce HHF as shown in CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD. In DAPA-CKD the composite risk of HHF or cardiovascular death was 29% lower than placebo (HR 0.71, CI 0.55–0.92), and we await the full publication of results. Across all the completed CVOTs there was no statistical difference compared with placebo for non-fatal MI or stroke. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in the EMPA-REG and DAPA-HF trials, though this was largely driven by the reduction in cardiovascular mortality already discussed.

### How generalizable are cardiovascular outcome trials of sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 inhibitors? A national database study: study protocol [^78891d2f]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral antihyperglycemic agents for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Two recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and CANVAS Program, have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors have cardiovascular benefit in high-risk cardiovascular patients. The aim of our study will be to identify the prevalence of patients in an English primary care setting with the equivalent cardiovascular risk profile to those included in each of four SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs: CANVAS, DECLARE, EMPA-REG, and VERTIS CV.

Methods

Routinely collected primary care data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) network database will be used. We will perform a cross-sectional analysis to calculate the prevalence of people that have equivalent cardiovascular risk to participants included in each of the four above-mentioned SGLT2 inhibitor CVOTs. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the subgroups will also be compared with participants in each trial. The study cohort will include people with T2DM in the RCGP RSC dataset. Subgroups of people will be identified using Read codes that most closely match the inclusion criteria of each trial. Descriptive statistics will be used to report the characteristics of people at high cardiovascular risk and compared against those of people in each CVOT.

Planned Outputs

Findings from the study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to report the applicability of each SGLT2 inhibitor trial to real-world clinical practice.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor: comparing trial data and real-world use [^5927f050]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The first cardiovascular safety trial in the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor drug class, the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcomes and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial, demonstrated significant cardiovascular risk reduction with empagliflozin. It is currently not clear what proportions of people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have the same high cardiovascular risk as those included in the trial, and will therefore be likely to experience the same cardiovascular benefit. We aimed to identify and describe the proportion of people with T2DM from a representative English national population who have the comparable high cardiovascular risk to those included in the EMPA-REG trial.

Method

A cross-sectional analysis of cardiovascular risk in people with T2DM and a subgroup prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients were identified from the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre database. Cardiovascular risk factors were identified from electronic patient records.

Results

From 1,238,909 patients at 128 GP practices, we identified 60,327 adults with T2DM (mean age 66.1 years, SD 13.9) of whom 55.6% were male. From these 1642 (2.7%) people had been initiated on an SGLT2 inhibitor (mean age 58.1 years, SD 10.4; 58.8% male). In the complete T2DM group only 15.7% (95% CI 15.5–16.0%) had the same high cardiovascular risk as those included in the EMPA-REG trial. In those already initiated on SGLT2 inhibitors this proportion was 11.1% (95% CI 9.8–12.4%). Whilst the proportion was higher in the oldest age groups, in those 70+ years old less than a quarter met the EMPA-REG trial high cardiovascular risk criteria.

Conclusions

The EMPA-REG trial results are applicable only to a small proportion of people with T2DM and a smaller proportion of those currently treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Additional data are required to identify any cardiovascular benefit in people with lower cardiovascular risk.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### Effects of sodium / glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in patients without diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^6e7a7016]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor is a class of antihyperglycemic drugs increasingly used for patients with diabetes mellitus. 1 By blocking glucose reabsorption at the proximal renal tubule, SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and hence lower blood glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Beyond and independent of glycemic control, clinical trials have demonstrated an improvement in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus treated with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo. 2, 3, 4 Furthermore, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes mellitus was shown to be associated with metabolic benefits such as weight loss, 5, 6 blood pressure reduction, 7 and improvement in renal function. 4, 8 The efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors is reflected in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guideline as a first‐line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. 9

Despite its initial indication as a diabetic drug with cardiovascular outcome benefits, recent clinical trials have demonstrated similar cardiovascular and metabolic benefits in patients without diabetes mellitus treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In patients with heart failure (HF), the EMPEROR‐Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) study 10 and the DAPA‐HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure) trial 11 demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, regardless of diabetic status. Beyond cardiovascular benefits, recent clinical trials showed that the metabolic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors extended beyond patients with diabetes mellitus to those without. 12, 13 Given the increasing burden of metabolic syndrome and the subsequent morbidity and mortality, there is an urgent need to identify agents that may attenuate the deleterious effects of this condition in patients without diabetes mellitus. 14, 15

To date, there has been no meta‐analysis examining whether SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes in patients without diabetes mellitus. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to determine the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in patients without diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that in patients without diabetes mellitus, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors, compared with those without, was associated with improvement in cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes.

### A review of the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^4da026dc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

The benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors have been well established through major clinical trial evidence. Among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and elevated cardiovascular risk or chronic kidney disease (CKD), SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; consisting of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke or nonfatal myocardial infarction) by around 10%. They reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in people with or without diabetes, and with or without a pre‐existing heart failure diagnosis. The kidney benefits are also substantial, with a 37% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.69), and with similar kidney benefits with or without co‐existing diabetes.SGLT2 inhibitors also have benefits for weight loss, blood pressure reductionand diabetes prevention. These benefits in large‐scale clinical trials have been predominantly demonstrated on a background of renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) blockade, as a majority of participants in large randomized trials were receiving these agents. However, subgroup analyses have suggested similar benefits irrespective of RAS blockade use.

Despite the wealth of benefits, SGLT2 inhibitors remain underutilized. For example, in a United States of America cohort of more than 500 000veterans with T2DM and confirmed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and hence a clear evidence‐based indication for SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, only 11.2% were receiving such treatment. Potential factors include cost barriers and clinical inertia to newer therapies, but concern regarding the safety profile may also contribute. For example, observational reports initially suggested an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), raising concern in the nephrology community, yet subsequent clinical trialsand real‐world evidencehave suggested a protective effect against AKI. We present the latest evidence for the risk of adverse events and practical prescribing advice to reduce the likelihood of these events to improve clinician confidence with these agents.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^92deef5b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — evidence summary in T2D shows that SGLT2 inhibitors have emerged as important new oral therapies for patients with T2D, and Large, randomized controlled trials in patients with T2D have demonstrated that many of these agents reduce MACE in patients with established ASCVD and/or DKD, and reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations. The benefit of reducing HF hospitalizations reflected primarily prevention of symptomatic HF in T2D patients at high risk, as ~90% did not have HF at baseline. The benefits of an SGLT2 inhibitor in treating established HF were demonstrated in the DAPA-HF trial, in which dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV death or worsening HF, and improved HF-related symptoms in ~4,800 patients with HFrEF.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor effects on cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^f27f5aa2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The available data from completed trials demonstrate that the SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly heart failure outcomes in patients with CKD with albuminuria and an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (Figure 1). In the context of heart failure, these benefits extend to CKD patients who do not have type 2 diabetes. Ongoing trials will further explore the cardiovascular benefits of these agents in patients with lower levels of eGFR and in those without diabetes. Assuming no unexpected safety signals emerge from these studies, it seems likely that SGLT2 inhibitors could become standard therapy along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials and systematic review [^72b5095e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in patients with prior ASCVD and type 2 diabetes; however, this benefit is uncertain in patients without established ASCVD. Methods and Results Large-scale cardiovascular outcome randomized controlled trials or their prespecified subgroup analyses were selected, evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo for primary prevention of ASCVD (inception, March 2023). The primary outcome was atherosclerotic major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), which was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The secondary outcomes were individual components of MACEs and all-cause mortality. The outcomes were reported as random-effect relative risk (RR) with a 95% CI. This analysis, comprising 23987 patients enrolled in 5 randomized controlled trials with a mean follow-up duration of ≈135weeks, found no significant reduction in atherosclerotic MACEs with SGLT2 inhibitors in comparison to placebo (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.71–1.01]; P = 0.07; I² = 44). There were no significant differences in cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.77–1.14]; P = 0.50; I² = 0), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.69–1.11]; P = 0.28; I² = 23), and stroke (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.62–1.16]; P = 0.29; I² = 46). SGLT2 inhibitors significantly improved all-cause mortality (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.72–1.0]; P = 0.04; I² = 23). On subgroup analyses, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors led to significant reductions in MACEs (RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61–0.89]; P = 0.001), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.47–0.97]; P = 0.03), and stroke (RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.41–0.91]; P = 0.01) primarily in patients with chronic kidney disease along with type 2 diabetes, whereas these benefits were not observed in patients with type 2 diabetes without chronic kidney disease. Conclusions SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced atherosclerotic MACEs in subjects having both chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes without established ASCVD.

Discussion

These data provide strong evidence of cardiovascular and mortality benefits with SGLT2 inhibition, with limited evidence that effects vary between patient subgroups or across completed trials. In conjunction with reductions in total SAEs in every individual trial, these findings indicate that a broad range of patients with T2DM are likely to achieve important net benefits from use of this drug class.

A key strength of these analyses is the inclusion of new data from the recently completed CREDENCE trial, which enrolled large numbers of individuals who were at high vascular risk but free of CVD at baseline. In contrast to previous reports suggesting that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition on MACE are restricted to those with established CVD, 12, 13 our updated analyses suggest comparable benefits for those with and without CVD. The prior interpretations were based on marginal evidence for an interaction by baseline CVD (P = 0.0501), 12 which was probably a chance finding. We found no evidence of an interaction in either our primary analysis or a series of sensitivity analyses and conclude that there is little evidence that effects in the primary versus secondary prevention subgroups differ by more than chance for the MACE outcome. Furthermore, with clear and separately significant evidence of protection against HF, and the composite of HF or vascular death, in the primary prevention subset, there is a strong case for the use of these agents in the primary prevention setting. Our results call for a reevaluation of current guideline recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, with a view to include those with and without established CVD. A recent update to the European Guidelines (European Society of Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes) 31 has partially addressed this issue, recommending that SGLT2 inhibition or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists may be used as first‐line therapy in those with T2DM and high risk of atherosclerotic CVD, irrespective of whether they are treatment naïve or already on metformin.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^dd5ee993]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the benefits of SGLT2i agents on the heart. To date, none of the proposed mechanisms have been able to unequivocally explain the CV benefit demonstrated in randomised clinical trials (RCTs). SGLT2 inhibition may improve cardiac metabolism and bioenergetics by elevating the production of ketones, which represent a more efficient myocardial energy source than fatty acids and which require less oxygen to metabolise, consequently improving myocardial oxygen efficiency. The myocardium is less flexible in its use of available energy sources when stressed by diabetes or HF, and this increased availability of ketones may allow for more efficient cardiac function. In addition, the haemoconcentration that is typically induced by SGLT2 inhibition may result in improved tissue oxygen delivery, and a potential synergistic effect with the myocardial metabolic substrate shift. More favourable ventricular loading conditions may also arise from reduced arterial stiffness and BP, as a result of this osmotic diuresis and natriuresis. Finally, SGLT2 inhibition may inhibit the Na + /H + exchanger (NHE)-1 isoform in the myocardium, activation of which has been associated with elevated sodium and calcium levels in experimental models of HF. Further investigation into the potential roles of modified cardiac fibrosis and cytokine production with SGLT2i treatment is underway.

It has been hypothesised that HF outcomes may be most sensitive to SGLT2i treatments. While atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) mechanisms may also be affected by SGLT2i treatment, the fact that a significant improvement in 3P-MACE was not achieved in the recent DECLARE-TIMI 58 study points to a tenuous link between ASCVD and SGLT2 inhibition in clinical outcomes. However, the beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibition on improving HF outcomes has been consistent.

SGLT2i treatments also appear to have positive renal benefits in reducing the rate of albuminuria progression and a reduced worsening of nephropathy. These benefits are postulated to arise from the restoration of tubuloglomerular feedback, which is a key mechanism in the kidney for the regulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Other mechanisms, including amelioration of intrarenal hypoxia and subsequent anti-inflammatory effects have also been proposed.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications [^6a59c1d9]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction, and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits. SGLT2 inhibition also is associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by ≈5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and ≈30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. On the basis of reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated in chronic kidney disease. With regard to long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and > 30% reductions in cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and heart failure hospitalizations associated with empagliflozin, even though, by design, the hemoglobin A1c difference between the randomized groups was marginal. Aside from an increased risk of mycotic genital infections, empagliflozin-treated patients had fewer serious adverse events, including a lower risk of acute kidney injury. In light of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results, some diabetes clinical practice guidelines now recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit be prioritized in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic targets and who have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. With additional cardiorenal protection trials underway, sodium-related physiological effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical correlates of natriuresis, such as the impact on blood pressure, heart failure, kidney protection, and mortality, will be a major management focus.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: comparing trial and real world use (study protocol) [^912c4a06]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Recent findings from the first cardiovascular safety trial in SGLT2 inhibitors to be completed, the BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trial demonstrated reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with high cardiovascular risk (Table 1) who were treated with empagliflozin. How these findings can be extrapolated into real world clinical practice remains unclear. Other cardiovascular safety trials are still ongoing and will help to answer some of these questions as their inclusion criteria are somewhat broader than those of the EMPA-REG trial, with a lower cardiovascular risk population included. In the meantime, a comparison of the characteristics of people treated with SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice with those of the EMPA-REG trial is important to enable an understanding of how these important trial results can be applied to clinical practice. A measure of the proportion of people with T2DM, to whom these trial criteria apply in clinical practice, is vitally important to enable correct interpretation of the results.

### Adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with SARS-CoV-2 treated with SGLT2 inhibitors [^cdd6dd87]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results are consistent with the large body of evidence showing protective cardiac and kidney benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in people who require antihyperglycemic therapy. Evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may provide protective cardiorenal effects through various mechanisms beyond glucose control –. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce the risk of acute kidney disease; whether and to what extent the reduction in risks of MACE and MAKE is mediated by reduction in risk of acute kidney disease (a risk factor for both MACE and MAKE) should be evaluated in future studies. However, the question of whether those for whom antihyperglycemic therapy may not be indicated would benefit from initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors remains to be addressed (e.g. whether those at high risk of cardiovascular and kidney events following SARS-CoV-2 infection (sans diabetes and other established indications for SGLT2 inhibitors) may derive benefit from initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors to lessen the risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease post-COVID is yet to be investigated) –.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^993740f2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

### Navigating the "MACE" in cardiovascular outcomes trials and decoding the relevance of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease benefits versus heart failure benefits [^8610928c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The publication of results from recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) has transformed the landscape of diabetes treatment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated CV benefits in large, well-conducted, randomized studies. Today, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and liraglutide are US Food and Drug Administration-approved not only for glucose-lowering, but also to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events/CV mortality in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and established CV disease (CVD)/high CVD risk. Although the CVOTs were primarily powered for CV safety (non-inferiority), they also demonstrated CV efficacy (superiority). This initially surprised many in the diabetes community, but the replication of the CV benefits with different compounds in the same class alleviated concerns about the CV benefits being chance findings. However, many questions remain. While the heterogeneity in the CV benefits in the various CVOTs can be attributed to the variability in CV risk in the different studies, the reason(s) for the differences in the CV benefits between the GLP-1RA class and the SGLT2 inhibitor class appear to be more complex. An analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in the CVOTs shows that the CV benefits of GLP-1RAs are predominantly specific to atherosclerotic CV events (non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI], non-fatal stroke and CV death). By contrast, the SGLT2 inhibitors do not have any significant effects on atherosclerotic CV events (non-fatal MI/stroke). Their benefits are predominantly on hospitalization for heart failure (HF), suggesting effects primarily on myocardial function ("the pump"), and not on the "pipes" (coronary arteries). In the present review, we discuss the rationale for the conduct of CVOTs, highlight the inability of the classic three-point MACE to capture the entire spectrum of atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic CVD morbidity, especially HF in T2DM, and discuss the results of the CVOTs with a focus on the clinical significance of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) versus HF, which develops in a sizeable proportion of people with diabetes and without prior ASCVD.

### SGLT2 inhibitors improve all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in… [^a50ae569]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What effect do sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with and without diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or kidney disease. Bottom Line SGLT2 inhibitors — medications ending in -flozin, such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin — reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Similar mortality reduction occurs in patients with diabetes regardless of comorbid heart failure, and in patients with heart failure regardless of the presence of diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce the progression of renal disease in all patients.

Synopsis Two researchers independently searched three databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL, with the bibliographies of identified studies and abstracts of major cardiology meetings, to identify randomized studies in any language that evaluated the impact of treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with or without heart failure or type 2 diabetes. Two researchers independently abstracted the data. The researchers followed PRISMA guidelines and assessed the quality of evidence. They included eight studies of 59, 747 patients, comprising three studies that included patients without diabetes. Treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor reduced the risk of mortality due to all causes, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure compared with placebo, and reduced a composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the serum creatinine level, and kidney-related mortality. There were similar mortality and renal benefits for patients with or without diabetes and patients with or without heart failure. Heterogeneity among study results was moderate for mortality outcomes and low for heart failure hospitalization and kidney outcomes.

### The CANVAS program: implications of canagliflozin on reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^0ab21d94]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that reduces blood glucose, as well as blood pressure, body weight, and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program, patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk treated with canagliflozin had a significantly lower risk of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; hospitalization for heart failure; and renal outcomes, but also a greater risk of lower-limb amputation. Cardiovascular outcomes trials of some other T2DM agents (i.e., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide) have also shown potential cardiovascular and renal benefits. As a result, diabetes treatment guidelines have begun to incorporate consideration of cardiovascular and renal benefits into their treatment recommendations. Antihyperglycemic agents with proven beneficial cardiovascular effects represent a new opportunity for the diabetologist and cardiologist, in the setting of a multidisciplinary approach, to concomitantly improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. This review briefly discusses the pharmacology of canagliflozin, including clinical and preclinical data; it also describes the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes and side-effects, and compares these effects with other glucose-lowering agents with proven cardiovascular benefits.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^7ee9af83]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Discussions and implication of pathway — type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction states that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown to directly improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, with randomized trials proving reductions in acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CV death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); SGLT2 inhibitors also have heart failure (HF) and renal benefits that appear independent of HbA1c, even in patients without T2D. CV specialists "now need to incorporate these agents", and this ECDP provides a practical guide for initiation and monitoring that "should be used in concert with established risk factor modification guidelines" (including lipids, blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy) and "applied in the context of guideline-directed diabetes care". The document "should complement, rather than supersede, good clinical judgement", emphasizes that achieving goals "requires a team-based approach", and notes that, if used appropriately, these therapies "should significantly reduce CV morbidity and mortality", while also stating that evidence is still emerging and algorithms may change as new data appear, with the overarching goal of improved CV outcomes remaining consistent.

### Overcoming disparities in using SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal protection in persons with and without type 2 diabetes [^186ef1dd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite mounting evidence supporting the cardio-kidney benefits of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, significant disparities in their use exist among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular or kidney disease that reveals a significant disconnect between guidelines and practice. These discrepancies are particularly pronounced among women, minority races, and lower socioeconomic groups. These groups remain underrepresented in major cardiovascular trials, potentially leading to their exclusion from optimal therapies and increasing morbidity and mortality rates. This review aims to highlight disparities in the use of SGLT2i in populations with T2D, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It examines the factors that influence the prescription of SGLT2i medications within these populations and evaluates their downstream impact on clinical outcomes. Finally, the review summarizes recent clinical trial findings on strategies that enhance the adoption of SGLT2i and other cardioprotective agents through a multifaceted approach, aiming to improve real-world adoption for patients with T2D and/or cardiovascular and kidney diseases.

### Cardiometabolic and renal benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [^6fb05ded]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The therapeutic scope of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors has expanded beyond glycaemic regulation in the management of diabetes mellitus. Studies published in the past few years highlight their substantial effect on cardiovascular outcomes, notably in decreasing mortality and the need for heart failure-related hospitalization. These agents also lead to pronounced improvements in a range of renal outcomes. The primary actions of SGLT2 inhibition, glycosuria and natriuresis, are pivotal in enhancing glucose control, promoting weight loss and lowering blood pressure. These effects initiate a series of beneficial mechanisms: facilitating haemodynamic improvement by reducing interstitial volume, enhancing cardiac function, boosting energy efficiency through altered ketone body metabolism and mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress. Additional effects include heightened erythropoiesis, reduced hyperuricaemia and increased levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin (1–7). SGLT2 inhibitors also attenuate sympathetic overactivity by modulating neurohumoral activation and renal afferent signalling, contributing to their cardioprotective and renoprotective profiles. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse mechanisms underpinning the cardiometabolic and renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, emphasizing their clinical relevance and therapeutic potential.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials and systematic review [^6a56a49b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in patients with prior ASCVD and type 2 diabetes; however, this benefit is uncertain in patients without established ASCVD.

Methods and Results

Large‐scale cardiovascular outcome randomized controlled trials or their prespecified subgroup analyses were selected, evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo for primary prevention of ASCVD (inception, March 2023). The primary outcome was atherosclerotic major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), which was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The secondary outcomes were individual components of MACEs and all‐cause mortality. The outcomes were reported as random‐effect relative risk (RR) with a 95% CI. This analysis, comprising 23 987 patients enrolled in 5 randomized controlled trials with a mean follow‐up duration of ≈135 weeks, found no significant reduction in atherosclerotic MACEs with SGLT2 inhibitors in comparison to placebo (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.71–1.01]; P = 0.07; I² = 44). There were no significant differences in cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.77–1.14]; P = 0.50; I² = 0), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.69–1.11]; P = 0.28; I² = 23), and stroke (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.62–1.16]; P = 0.29; I² = 46). SGLT2 inhibitors significantly improved all‐cause mortality (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.72–1.0]; P = 0.04; I² = 23). On subgroup analyses, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors led to significant reductions in MACEs (RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.61–0.89]; P = 0.001), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.47–0.97]; P = 0.03), and stroke (RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.41–0.91]; P = 0.01) primarily in patients with chronic kidney disease along with type 2 diabetes, whereas these benefits were not observed in patients with type 2 diabetes without chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions

SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced atherosclerotic MACEs in subjects having both chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes without established ASCVD.

### Risk of cardiovascular events and death associated with initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors: an analysis from the CVD-REAL 2 multinational cohort study [^377a8a97]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular outcome trials have shown cardiovascular benefit with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have not shown an effect. We aimed to address knowledge gaps regarding the comparative effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitor use in clinical practice (with DPP-4 inhibitor use as an active comparator) across a range of cardiovascular risks and in diverse geographical settings.

Methods

In this comparative cohort study, we used data from clinical practice from 13 countries in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, European, and North American regions to assess the risk of cardiovascular events and death in adult patients with type 2 diabetes newly initiated on SGLT2 inhibitors compared with those newly initiated on DPP-4 inhibitors. De-identified health records were used to select patients who were initiated on these drug classes between Dec 1, 2012, and May 1, 2016, with follow-up until Dec 31, 2014, to Nov 30, 2017 (full range; dates varied by country). Non-parsimonious propensity scores for SGLT2 inhibitor initiation were developed for each country and patients who were initiated on an SGLT2 inhibitor were matched with those who were initiated on a DPP-4 inhibitor in a 1:1 ratio. Outcomes assessed were hospitalisation for heart failure, all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by country and then pooled in a weighted meta-analysis.

Findings

Following propensity score matching, 193124 new users of SGLT2 inhibitors and 193124 new users of DPP-4 inhibitors were included in the study population. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 12·2), 170 335 (44·1%) of 386248 were women, and 111933 (30·1%) of 372 262 had established cardiovascular disease. Initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor versus a DPP-4 inhibitor was associated with substantially lower risks of hospitalisation for heart failure (HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·61–0·77; p < 0·0001), all-cause death (0·59, 0·52–0·67; p < 0·0001), and the composite of hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause death (0·64, 0·57–0·72; p < 0·0001). Risks of myocardial infarction (HR 0·88, 0·80–0·98; p = 0·020) and stroke (0·85 0·77–0·93; p = 0·0004) were significantly but modestly lower with SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP-4 inhibitors.

Interpretation

In this large, international, observational study, initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors versus DPP-4 inhibitors was associated with lower risks of heart failure, death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, providing further support for the cardiovascular benefits associated with use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Pathophysiological basis of the cardiological benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors: a narrative review [^cda8e0ca]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At present there are a number of classes of pharmacological agents used for type 2 diabetes (T2D), with multiple agents available in each class. In recent years, new classes of agents have become available, namely GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), and SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i). These newer agents have become valuable additions to therapy for T2D as they are associated with low risk for hypoglycemia as well as cardiovascular (CV) benefits. As a result, treatment approaches are changing rapidly with preference now given to agents whose benefits extend beyond glucose-lowering. To aid the prescriber, comprehensive algorithms are now available for diabetes management, which emphasize personalization of glycemic targets and CV risk.

Of note, T2D is one of the main risk factors for CV diseases. It is directly associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy and increases risk of ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF). In this regard, SGLT-2i have emerged as a promising class of agents to treat HF and have a prominent role in current guidelines, and some of these agents have been approved for treatment of HF.

Four major CV outcome trials (CVOTs) – EMPA-REG (empagliflozin), CANVAS (canagliflozin), DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin), and VERTIS CV (ertugliflozin), investigated the CV benefits of SGLT-2i in patients with T2D. Reductions in the relative risk for hospitalizations for HF of 30%, 33%, 27%, and 35%, respectively, were seen in these four trials. In addition, a meta-analysis of CVOTs on over 34,000 patients found that SGLT-2i reduced the risk of major adverse CV events by 11%, with benefits only for patients with atherosclerotic CV disease.

Faced with these promising results, dedicated trials in patients with HF were initiated. Based on these results, the EMA approved dapagliflozin for the treatment of HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF, HFpEF) and empagliflozin for symptomatic chronic HF. Moreover, a class effect has been suggested based on meta-analyses.

### Clinical implications of cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes: from DCCT to EMPA-REG [^d9dd1f90]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a major threat to people with diabetes. Attempts have long been made to lower cardiovascular risk by means of glucose-lowering treatment. Initially, it seemed that was an option, but subsequent trials could not verify the original observations and there was concern that some glucose-lowering drugs can actually cause cardiovascular harm. This led medical product agencies in the United States and Europe to require major outcomes trials before accepting new glucose-lowering drugs. The least requirement was noninferiority compared with existing treatment modalities. A large number of such trials have been performed or are ongoing, including > 100,000 patients. The drug classes investigated are basal insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This commentary discusses these trials and their outcomes, the reasons why several of them ended with neutral results (noninferiority), and that the likelihood for showing cardiovascular benefit was minor or even nonexistent. The surprising and highly rewarding impact of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin is described and potential mechanisms for cardiovascular benefits are discussed.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes: a Bayesian meta-analysis and meta-regression [^3796ec6e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in adults with established CVD or at high cardiovascular risk. This recommendation is in part informed by meta‐analyses noting that the benefit of SGLT‐2 inhibitors for cardiovascular outcomes was limited to this patient subgroup. For instance, in the meta‐analysis by Zelniker et al,3 cardiovascular outcome trials were pooled to derive summary estimates for several outcomes, stratified by established CVD. Of note, in adults without established CVD, SGLT‐2 inhibitors did not decrease the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. Our study is the most comprehensive analysis to date, including 10 cardiovascular and renal outcome trials. In contrast to prior analyses, we estimated the effects of individual drugs, while carefully examining whether treatment effects were associated with the control group event rates as a combined proxy measure for the underlying percentage of patients with established CVD, their disease severity, and other comorbidities. With this approach, we found positive to strong evidence that empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. In contrast, there was little evidence for ertugliflozin or sotagliflozin for reducing mortality outcomes.

There was no association between treatment effects and the control group event rate for all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, resulting in negligible differences in the predicted treatment effect for a primary and secondary prevention population. The implications of these findings are 2‐fold. First, given the comparable relative treatment effect across baseline risk, SGLT‐2 inhibitors warrant consideration as the preferred second‐line treatment for primary prevention of CVD in adults with T2DM and a baseline risk comparable to participants in the cardiovascular outcome trials. This finding may inform future iterations of guidelines in identifying adults in whom the use of SGLT‐2 inhibitors should be preferred. Second, given a similar relative treatment effect across baseline risk, adults at the highest absolute risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality will derive a greater absolute benefit from SGLT‐2 inhibitors. The potential for a large absolute benefit of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in adults with established CVD lends support to the existing European Society of Cardiology guidelines, which recommend SGLT‐2 inhibitors as the first‐line treatment for the secondary prevention of CVD.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk: lessons learned from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study [^32903482]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Although cardiovascular (CV) mortality is the principal cause of death in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), reduction of plasma glucose concentration has little effect on CV disease (CVD) risk. Thus, novel strategies to reduce CVD risk in T2DM patients are needed. The recently published BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated that in T2DM patients with high CVD risk empagliflozin reduced the primary major adverse cardiac event end point (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke) by 14%. This beneficial effect was driven by a 38% reduction in CV mortality with no significant decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Empagliflozin also caused a 35% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure without affecting hospitalization for unstable angina. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors exert multiple metabolic benefits (decreases in HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure and an increase in HDL cholesterol), all of which could reduce CVD risk, it is unlikely that the reduction in CV mortality can be explained by empagliflozin's metabolic effects. More likely, hemodynamic effects, specifically reduced blood pressure and decreased extracellular volume, are responsible for the reduction in CV mortality and heart failure hospitalization. In this Perspective, we will discuss possible mechanisms for these beneficial effects of empagliflozin and their implications for the care of T2DM patients.

### Effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular death and all-cause death in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: an updated meta-analysis including the SCORED trial [^f4b5741e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Three relevant meta-analysis studies – have demonstrated that sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are superior to placebo in lowering mortality and cardiorenal events among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), while three others – have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors are superior to placebo and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in lowering cardiovascular or renal composite outcomes among patients with T2D and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the three meta-analyses – conducted in patients with T2D and CKD have failed to reveal significant effects of SGLT2 inhibitors versus comparator on cardiovascular death (CV death) and all-cause death (AC death) due to the limited statistical power for the death outcomes.

Recently, a large randomized trial named SCOREDhas been published and designed to evaluate the cardiorenal efficacy of sotagliflozin in patients with T2D and CKD, which provides new evidence of gliflozins for the treatment of concomitant T2D and CKD. Although the SCORED trial is powered to evaluate the effect of sotagliflozin on heart failure (HF) composite outcome and also reveals a significant reduction with sotagliflozin versus placebo in this outcome, this trial does not have sufficient power to evaluate the effects of sotagliflozin on mortality endpoints such as CV death and AC death. Sotagliflozin is a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor. The cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors have been confirmed by large outcome trials. Conversely, it is not clear what clinical benefits were derived through the inhibition of SGLT1 with sotagliflozin therapy in two sotagliflozin trials.

Moreover, Salah et al. identified that the estimators for the cardiovascular benefits of sotagliflozin versus placebo were similar with those of SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo, and therefore concluded that, as for treatment with sotagliflozin, the cardiovascular benefits might be almost attributable to the inhibition of SGLT2, while the potential incremental efficacy of SGLT1 inhibition remains to be explored. Thus, we sought to evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on various cardiorenal and death outcomes, including CV death and AC death, in patients with concomitant T2D and CKD, by implementing an updated meta-analysis incorporating relevant trials including the latest SCORED trialassessing sotagliflozin.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes: a Bayesian meta-analysis and meta-regression [^8e35b7f9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium‐glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitors are glucose‐lowering agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). When added to guideline‐recommended treatment, these agents improve glucose control, reduce body weight, and reduce the incidence of heart failure and progression of renal disease.SGLT‐2 inhibitors also reduce mortality and cardiovascular outcomes, although existing studies suggest this benefit is limited to adults with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and renal disease. Inferences about which patient population will benefit from SGLT‐2 inhibitors are challenging because the existing pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are not directly comparable: cardiovascular outcome trials for empagliflozin and ertugliflozin were restricted to adults with established CVD, whereas other outcome trials for canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and sotagliflozinhave involved a mixture of adults with and without established CVD and renal disease, with the lowest average cardiovascular risk found in patients included in the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events) trial for dapagliflozin.

Currently, the effectiveness of SGLT‐2 inhibitors for reducing mortality and cardiovascular outcomes across the spectrum of baseline risk remains unclear. We therefore performed a Bayesian meta‐analysis integrating all available randomized evidence to determine the effectiveness of different agents versus placebo while incorporating outcome‐specific external evidence on between‐trial heterogeneityto appropriately reflect the current uncertainty when adequately powered trials are few. We also examined the association between the magnitude of treatment effects and control group event rates for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes as measures of cardiovascular baseline risk.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e9e3e2a3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

This meta‐analysis combines data from 4 large randomized studies, each with a robust design and low risk of bias, providing good power to explore the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes both overall and for subgroups. The broad constancy of the findings across subgroups suggests wide clinical utility for the drug class and that the few differences in effects observed in the overview should be treated with caution. The statistical evidence of heterogeneity of effects between patient subsets in these analyses is in almost every case only moderate in strength and unless confirmed by future analyses the overall effect estimates provide the best current guide for clinical practice. The lack of individual patient data for some of the included studies is a limitation to the current analysis, but is unlikely to change the overall findings of this report.

The low absolute rates of events for those without a history of CVD at baseline meant that there was limited statistical power to define effects of SGLT2 inhibition separately in that patient subset. However, given comparable directions of effect and no evidence of heterogeneity between effects for any outcome between those with and without CVD, the overview findings support consideration of SGLT2 inhibition in primary, as well as secondary, prevention settings. Similarly, only a small proportion of patients had HF at baseline, and HF was defined by history rather than by rigorous validation based on imaging and natriuretic peptide assay. The recently published DAPA‐HF study 30 in HF with reduced ejection fraction has provided additional insight into the role of SGLT2 inhibition in HF, with a clear reduction in hospitalization for HF and other key cardiovascular outcomes. The DEFINE‐HF (Dapagliflozin Effect on Symptoms and Biomarkers in Patients With Heart Failure) trial 33 also demonstrated an improvement in HF‐related health status, as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire in those with HF with reduced ejection fraction treated with SGLT2 inhibition. There remains some uncertainty with respect to the benefit in HF with preserved ejection fraction that will be addressed in ongoing large trials DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure) [NCT03619213] and EMPEROR‐Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) [NCT03057951].

In conclusion, SGLT2 inhibitors protect against CVD and death in diverse subsets of patients with T2DM. The magnitude of protection achieved may vary across patients, but among those studied to date, the available evidence does not identify clearly a patient group that is unlikely to achieve significant cardiovascular protection from use of this drug class.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^96864688]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), multiple ASCVD risk factors, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) — an sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit is recommended to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and/or heart failure hospitalization; in people with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit is recommended to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events; combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1 RA may be considered to provide complementary cardiovascular and kidney outcomes benefits.

### Are the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction influenced by background therapy? Expectations and realities of a new standard of care [^9779a0d2]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The finding that the effect of SGLT2 inhibition in the DAPA-HF trial is not influenced by background therapy for heart failure is consistent with the findings of large-scale cardiovascular outcomes trials in type 2 diabetes. In these trials, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure by ∼30%; yet most patients in these trials were not receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or neprilysin inhibitors. In contrast, in the DAPA-HF trial, the use of broad-based neurohormonal antagonism was strongly encouraged, and yet the magnitude of the benefit with SGLT2 inhibitors was similar to that seen in the trials in type 2 diabetes.

The additive benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors is particularly noteworthy in patients receiving neprilysin inhibitors. Compared with older treatments for heart failure, both SGLT2 inhibitors and sacubitril/valsartan are more expensive, raising the question as to whether physicians can simply prescribe only one of the two newer drugs. The subgroup analyses of DAPA-HF demonstrate that treatment with sacubtril/valsartan does not attenuate the benefit of dapagliflozin, confirming that neprilysin inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors provide independently important benefits in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death. Therefore, it is not reasonable to propose that physicians must choose between the two newer approaches. If mortality reduction is important, then a combination of an SGLT2 inhibitor and a neprilysin inhibitor represents the only acceptable standard of care. The addition of both drugs would be expected to yield an incremental ∼35% reduction in the risk of death in patients already receiving an inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system, a beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Cardiovascular effects of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and different risk categories: a meta-analysis [^150c7172]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with these individuals at approximately twice the risk of CVD compared with people without diabetes. Although rates have declined, a large burden still remains.

The link between improved glycaemic control and an improvement in microvascular outcomes is well established; however, although epidemiological evidence suggests a link, the effect on CVD risk is less clear. In addition, the potential harm associated with severe hypoglycaemia might counterbalance the potential benefit of intensive glucose lowering treatment. The need for personalised treatment of hyperglycaemia has been advocated and a multifactorial approach to the treatment of risk factors is needed to decrease the cardiovascular (CV) risk.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose reabsorption in the kidney independently of insulin secretion or action, resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion with associated osmotic diuresis and caloric loss. The efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin has been studied in a wide range of populations as monotherapy or in combination with a variety of other glucose-lowering therapies. The mechanism of action of dapagliflozin influences a number of CVD risk factors, in particular, decreasing blood pressure, reducing body weight (predominantly through reductions in total body fat mass, including visceral adipose tissue), reducing waist circumference, and lowering albuminuria and serum uric acid levels, with a low intrinsic risk of hypoglycaemia.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have issued guidance requiring that new diabetes therapies should rule out an unacceptable increase in CVD risk. Since then, a number of large CV outcome studies to clarify the effects of new classes of glucose-lowering therapies have either been conducted or are ongoing. Positive CV outcomes data, including a beneficial effect on hospitalisation for heart failure, were recently published for the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, which has a similar profile to dapagliflozin, showing the benefits of improving multiple CV risk factors with SGLT2 inhibitors. Additionally, the ongoing large CV outcome trial DECLARE TIMI-58 is being conducted in a broad population of patients with either established CVD or multiple CV risk factors and will aim to evaluate the effects of dapagliflozin on CV outcomes, with an estimated completion date of 2019.

### Combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonist and SGLT2 inhibitor [^33e3f745]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

The SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLTi) and glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) effectively reduce HbA1c, but via very different mechanisms, making them an effective duet for combination therapy. Recently, drugs in both of these antidiabetic classes have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events, most probably by different mechanisms. SGLT2i appear to exert their CV protective actions by haemodynamic effects, while GLP-1 RAs work via anti-atherogenic/anti-inflammatory mechanisms, raising the possibility that combined therapy with these 2 classes may produce additive CV benefits. The SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs also reduced macroalbuminuria, decreased the time for doubling of serum creatinine, and slowed the time to end-stage renal disease. In this perspective, we review the potential benefit of combination SGLT2i/GLP-1 RA therapy on metabolic-cardiovascular-renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Cardiovascular benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in diabetic and nondiabetic patients [^8579ed60]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Prospects for use of SGLT2i in CVD

Extensive clinical studies of SGLT2i consistently suggested an improvement in the quality of life and prognosis of individuals with HFrEF, including more advanced but stable HFrEF. A comparative analysis of three large randomized controlled trials also supports the combined use of an SGLT2i, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, and a β-blocker as a new treatment standard for HFrEF. This new therapeutic regimen produced greater treatment effects than traditional therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and β-blocker. In the future, SGLT2i have great potential to be a preferred class of cardiovascular drugs to treat HFrEF.

Almost half of patients with HF have HFpEF. In observational studies, patients with HFpEF have a similar incidence of hospitalization and death to patients with HFrEF, but have better outcomes. Several hemodynamic and molecular mechanisms, such as left atrial hypertension, increased circulating volume, microvascular inflammation, cardiometabolic dysfunction, and cardiac fibrosis, have been suggested to offer potential treatment opportunities for HFpEF. As discussed above, many experimental and clinical studies have shown that SGLT2i have a beneficial role in these aspects of disease, though the subjects in most studies did not have HFpEF. SGLT2i improved left ventricular remodeling and diastolic function in animal models with HFpEF and in cardiac tissues from patients with HFpEF. The SOLOIST-WHF trial demonstrated that sotagliflozin significantly reduced the composite risk of hospitalization or urgent visit for HF or death from cardiovascular causes in patients with HFpEF. Whether other SGLT2i likewise have cardiovascular benefits in patients with HFpEF remains unknown.

### Sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: comparing trial and real world use (study protocol) [^1d2108f2]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (gliflozins) are the newest class of medication available to treat type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Recent findings from the first complete cardiovascular safety trial in SGLT2 inhibitors, the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in type 2 diabetes (EMPA-REG OUTCOMES) trial, demonstrated reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with high cardiovascular risk. How to apply these findings to clinical practice remains unclear, with questions remaining on who will reap this cardiovascular benefit.

Aim

To describe the proportion of people in the real world currently treated with SGLT2 inhibitors who meet the inclusion criteria of the EMPA-REG trial and therefore could expect the cardiovascular benefit identified by the trial. Similarly, to describe the proportion of people from the whole T2DM population who could also expect this same benefit.

Design and Setting

Routinely collected data from UK primary care in the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database will be used. The study population will include all people with T2DM within this database (approximately 60,000). We will perform a cross-sectional investigation to describe the characteristics of people currently using SGTL2 inhibitors compared with the population of the EMPA-REG trail. We will similarly compare the characteristics of the RCGP RSC T2DM cohort with the inclusion criteria of the EMPA-REG trial.

Method

People with T2DM using a pre-existing verified clinical ontological process will be identified, as will people with prescriptions for SGLT2 inhibitors and other medications using Read coded and other proprietary coding systems. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterise the key clinical characteristics of people with T2DM using SGLT2 inhibitors and to compare these characteristics to people included in EMPA-REG trial; the proportion of people who match the trial criteria will be reported.

Planned Outputs

Peer review publication reporting the real world lessons for clinical practice.

### SGLT2 inhibition and adipose tissue metabolism: current outlook and perspectives [^0cae4143]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

SGLT2i: class effects and unmet needs

Several SGLTi, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin, are currently approved in Europe. The primary mechanism of action of SGLT2i involves the inhibition of the SGLT2 protein in the proximal convoluted tubule of kidney, which is responsible for the reabsorption of approximately 90% of filtered glucose. By blocking this transporter, SGLT2i promote glucosuria, leading to a reduction in glycemia. Data from randomized clinical trials suggest that the beneficial effects observed can be ascribed to class features and are not specific to the single drug.

Beyond their glucose-lowering effects, SGLT2i have shown significant cardiorenal benefits, extensively validated in several landmark clinical trials, demonstrating that SGLT2i reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), to a varying extent depending on the drug and/or the enrolled population. They significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular death and regardless of T2DM status reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and slow the progression of kidney failure. Importantly, SGLT2i have been shown to enhance heart functional capacity, as indicated by improvements in peak VO2 and performance in the 6-minute walking test (6MWT), both key metrics that reflect overall cardiovascular and metabolic health of patients. Beyond these physiological benefits, SGLT2i have also been linked to improved quality of life, reinforcing their role in comprehensive cardiometabolic care.

Blood pressure reduction, nephron remodeling, reduction in arterial stiffness, are all well-known mechanisms associated with the CV benefits observed with the use of SGLT2i but they are not sufficient to fully explain the metabolic effects.

The impact of SGLT2i on adipose tissue, in terms of body weight loss and the shift in energy source from glucose to fat, has been observed in both rodents and humans. These findings suggest potential mechanisms that could explain cardiovascular (CV) benefits. However, the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying this interaction remain not fully understood.

We thus decided to focus on the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on adipose tissue and its direct or indirect potential effects on the cardiovascular system.

### Continued efforts to translate diabetes cardiovascular outcome trials into clinical practice [^710928a0]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic patients suffer from a high rate of cardiovascular events and such risk increases with HbA1c. However, lowering HbA1c does not appear to yield the same benefit on macrovascular endpoints, as observed for microvascular endpoints. As the number of glucose-lowering medications increases, clinicians have to consider several open questions in the management of type 2 diabetes, one of which is the cardiovascular risk profile of each regimen. Recent placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have responded to some of these questions, but careful interpretation is needed. After general disappointment around CVOTs assessing safety of DPP-4 inhibitors (SAVOR, TECOS, EXAMINE) and the GLP-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide (ELIXA), the EMPA-REG Outcome trial and the LEADER trial have shown superiority of the SGLT2-I empagliflozin and the GLP-1RA liraglutide, respectively, on the 3-point MACE outcome (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) and cardiovascular, as well as all-cause mortality. While available mechanistic studies largely support a cardioprotective effect of GLP-1, the ability of SGLT2 inhibitor(s) to prevent cardiovascular death was unexpected and deserves future investigation. We herein review the results of completed CVOTs of glucose-lowering medications and suggest a possible treatment algorithm based on cardiac and renal co-morbidities to translate CVOT findings into clinical practice.

### The pleiotropic effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: beyond the glycemic benefit [^db289bae]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased risk of macro- and microvascular complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Of the currently available glucose-lowering therapies, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are the only class to target the pathophysiologic increase in renal glucose reabsorption in patients with T2D. In CV outcomes trials of SGLT-2is in patients with T2D and established CVD or varying levels of CV risk, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin were associated with significant improvements in the risk of composite CV and renal outcomes compared with placebo that extended beyond their glycemic effects. Real-world observational studies have also reported improvements in CV outcomes with SGLT-2is compared with other glucose-lowering therapy in routine clinical practice. This review describes the pleiotropic effects of SGLT-2is and discusses the potential mechanisms for these effects as well as how they potentially provide benefits beyond glycemic control in patients with T2D. These favorable nonglycemic effects indicate that SGLT-2is may be of particular benefit in patients with diabetic complications, such as CVD, HF, or CKD. Ongoing large randomized trials in specific patient populations, including those with CVD, HF, or CKD (with or without T2D), may help to confirm the benefits of SGLT-2is in these patients and further elucidate the potential mechanisms of their pleiotropic effects.

### Increasing societal benefit from cardiovascular drugs [^3a37823c]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

During the past few years, several innovative treatments for noncommunicable chronic disease have become available, including SGLT2i (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors), GLP-1a (glucagon-like-peptide 1 agonists), ARNI (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors), and finerenone, a selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Each of these medications improves clinically relevant outcomes when added to existing therapies, and the indications for their use are rapidly expanding. Because existing drug regimens are already complex and costly, ensuring that society derives the maximal benefit from these new agents represents a major challenge. This Primer discusses how society can meet this challenge, which we address in terms of 5 principles: maximizing benefit, minimizing harm, optimizing uptake, increasing value for money, and ensuring equitable access. The Primer is most relevant for stakeholders in high-income countries, but the principles are broadly applicable to stakeholders in other settings, including low- and middle-income countries. We have focused the discussion on SGLT-2i, but the 5 principles herein could be used with reference to ARNI, finerenone, or any other health product.

GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 Inhibitors in Patients with Cardiovascular Risk

In the past decade, seven cardiovascular outcome trials have provided consistent data on the efficacy of some GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular events in people with T2D. Meta-analyses of the cardiovascular outcomes trials show that some GLP-1 RAs can reduce major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction rates and stroke, among other benefits. Likewise, strong evidence of reduction in major cardiovascular events and hospital admissions for heart failure and cardiovascular death has been observed for some SGLT2 inhibitors. For these reasons, the ADA, the EASD and the European Society of Cardiology published recommendations for the prescription of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular or renal benefits to patients with T2D and established CVD or high cardiovascular risk. Some current guidelines also suggest that GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular or renal benefits should be administered as first-line monotherapy in patients with atherosclerotic CVD or with high cardiovascular risk and that the decision to treat with these drugs should be considered independently of baseline HbA1c or individualised HbA1c target. Early initiation with combination therapy based on metformin and a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor could be an option for most people newly diagnosed with T2D. Also, a significant advantage of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2 inhibitor treatments is their effect on body weight. Although the extent of the loss varies, there is substantial evidence from clinical trials on the weight-loss effects of some of these drugs. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that some GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors could have the potential for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two conditions with currently very limited therapeutic options. However, there are still no randomised clinical trials with conclusive evidence to support this indication for use.

### Sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors versus metformin on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with diabetes with low cardiovascular risk: a nationwide cohort study [^db246d8c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Main Findings

Our nationwide, population‐based cohort study found that patients with diabetes without a previous history of established cardiovascular diseases who received SGLT2 inhibitor‐based regimens had similar all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, and renal outcomes compared with those receiving metformin‐based regimens. It is important to note that, among patients < 65 years of age, those taking SGLT2 inhibitor‐based regimens had a significantly lower risk of death from all causes as well as progression to ESRD compared with those taking metformin‐based regimens. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitor‐based regimens are perhaps more beneficial than metformin‐based regimens among younger patients with diabetes presenting very low cardiovascular risk, in terms of all‐cause death and renal outcomes.

Benefits ofInhibitors in Patients With Diabetes

Following the EMPA‐REG OUTCOMES (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial, cardiovascular benefits have consistently been shown in other SGLT2 inhibitors, such as canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, by their respective clinical trials.SGLT2 inhibitors have thus been recommended as first‐line treatments for patients with diabetes with established cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, clinical trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of renal failure among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline, metformin should be combined with a SGLT2 inhibitor as the first‐line treatment for patients with diabetes with CKD.

However, in contrast to the substantial evidence in high‐risk patients with diabetes, the evidence on the primary prevention role of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients was mostly derived either from subgroup analyses of prior cardiovascular outcome trials, or from real‐world cohort studies involving heterogeneous populations. Although these studies signified the compelling findings of the primary prevention role for SGLT2 inhibitors, most studies compared the efficacy of these agents with placebos or other glucose‐lowering agents. Because metformin has historically been regarded as the cornerstone of treatment for type 2 diabetes, the question of whether SGLT2 inhibitors can replace metformin as the first‐line treatment among people with diabetes at low risk is very relevant to the current state of diabetes care.

Concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs — evidence summary: To date, no trials have studied the CV outcome effects of concomitant use of both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit. DURATION-8 (Phase 3 28-Week Study With 24-Week and 52-Week Extension Phases to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Exenatide Once Weekly and Dapagliflozin Versus Exenatide and Dapagliflozin Matching Placebo) demonstrated greater reductions in blood pressure and body weight in patients randomly allocated to the combination of dapagliflozin and exenatide than to either agent alone. Combination therapy with both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA for glycemic management also accords with current T2D management guidelines, and in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide have shown an additive glucose-lowering benefit over placebo.

Inhibitors Versus Metformin in Low‐Risk Patients

In order to assess the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors as the first‐line therapy, previous studies have directly compared the cardiovascular outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin using either a multi‐institution or a population‐based database. The results of these studies, however, were based on patients with diabetes with a broader spectrum of cardiovascular risk, which led to inconsistent results between studies and could not be extrapolated to people at low risk of cardiovascular diseases. Because recent American Diabetes Association consensus recommended a personalized approach to prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors as the first‐line therapy in certain high‐risk patients with diabetes (eg, those having high heart failure or CKD risks), whether the cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors over metformin can be also extrapolated to those of low cardiovascular risk remains unclear. From the standpoint of primary prevention, this study was the first to directly compare the treatment efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor‐based with metformin‐based regimens primarily among low‐risk patients with diabetes by excluding patients with prior established cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, we also examined renal outcomes in our study to investigate the preventive role of SGLT2 inhibitors over metformin in patients who have not yet developed CKD. The results demonstrate that low‐risk patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors as a first‐line treatment for type 2 diabetes showed similar cardiovascular and renal outcomes to those receiving metformin‐based therapy.

The nonsuperiority of SGLT2 inhibitors over metformin among patients with low cardiovascular‐risk indicated that the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors could possibly be offset by the inferiority of glycemic control compared with metformin. As metformin reduces glycosylated hemoglobin levels by around 1%, SGLT2 inhibitors exhibit only a modest reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin at approximately 0.5% to 1.0%. The unequal efficacy in glycemic control between metformin versus SGLT2 inhibitors can be inevitably encountered in the head‐to‐head comparison studies. Due to the lack of granular data on glycosylated hemoglobin, whether the presumed cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors were offset by the inferior glycemic control remained unclear. Further mechanistic studies would be mandatory to explore the underlying mechanisms.

Despite the similar outcomes between SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin shown in the overall study population, our subgroup analyses revealed that patients younger than 65 years old would be more likely to benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors. As diabetes diagnosed at a younger age was considered a greater long‐term cardiovascular risk, further randomized controlled trials will be warranted to examine whether the use of SGLT2 inhibitors over metformin is beneficial at an earlier age among low‐risk patients.

3.5 Composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization

In pooled analysis of four trials, the RR (95% CIs) for the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization was 0.88 (0.76–1.02; I² = 51%; 95% CI 0, 84%; p for heterogeneity = .11) when comparing SGLT2‐Is with placebo in those on RAAS‐I treatment at baseline. For those that were not on RAAS inhibition, the corresponding risk was 0.73 (0.65–0.82; I² = 0%; 95% CI 0, 85%; p for heterogeneity = .50) (Figure 3). There was no evidence of significant interaction between the effects of SGLT2 inhibition and RAAS inhibition status on the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (p ‐value for meta‐regression = .12).

3.6 Cardiovascular death

The outcome of cardiovascular death was reported by one study. SGLT2‐Is compared with placebo reduced the risk of the cardiovascular death in those on RAAS inhibition at baseline: 0.61 (95% CI, 0.48–0.79). The corresponding risk for those not treated with RAAS inhibition was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.39–1.06).

3.7 Estimated GFR

Two studies reported the effect of SGLT2 inhibition vs placebo on estimated GFR changes across the subgroup of RAAS‐I users. In the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, the initial change in estimated GFR in patients taking the combination of empagliflozin and RAAS‐Is was higher than for those taking empagliflozin alone (Table 2). The long‐ and post‐treatment changes were also similar for both groups. In the study that pooled data across 13 trials, the effect of dapagliflozin on estimated GFR was similar in patients with or without RAAS inhibition(Table 2).

SGLT2 inhibitors: evidence for reduced risk of HHF

Both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are approved in Europe and the US for the treatment of patients with chronic HFrEF, based on published findings of dedicated HF outcomes studies, DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced (Fig. 2 A, B). In February and March 2022, empagliflozin also received FDA and European Commission approval for the treatment of patients with preserved EF (HFpEF), in light of encouraging findings from the recently reported EMPEROR-Preserved trial, while the DELIVER trial of dapagliflozin in patients with HFpEF is ongoing. The recently completed EMPEROR-Preserved and ongoing DELIVER trials are covered in the 'Where Next?' section of this review.

Fig. 2
Exploring possible HF benefits with glucose-lowering drugs (mainly SGLT2 inhibitors). All clinical trials shown are of SLGT2 inhibitors, except for AMPLITUDE-O (efpeglenatide, GLP-1 RA). A consistent pattern of fewer HHF events, with a large effect size, has been seen across the SGLT2 inhibitor class. These reductions were closely mirrored in a dedicated renal outcomes study of canagliflozin in patients with diabetic kidney disease, and in dedicated HF outcomes studies of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF with or without diabetes and of empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF with or without diabetes (A). Results from these trials are shown to illustrate the consistency of findings regarding HHF; they should not be directly compared, due to differences in study design, definitions and populations. Note that HHF as a standalone endpoint was not a primary outcome measure in any of the studies shown and has not been reported for the SOLOIST-WHF HF outcomes study, DAPA-CKD renal outcomes or SCORED cardiorenal studies. Diabetes CVOTs were not initially designed to assess any protective effect on HHF (for example, most patients were not diagnosed with HF at baseline (B)). International guidelines for the treatment of patients with T2D now recommend SGLT2 inhibitors to protect patients from HF (C), while real-world studies have confirmed the pattern of fewer HHF events in the more diverse patients seen in routine clinical practice (D).

### Clinical application of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor into a real-world setting of heart failure care [^8b1f500e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

For years there have been concerns whether the results of large-scale clinical trials that include limited specific patient populations can be applied to patients in real-world clinical practice. Therefore, it is crucially important to verify whether emerging evidences obtained from large-scale clinical trials on limited specific patient populations can be applied to patients at real-world clinical settings. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors showed a consistent risk reduction of approximately 30% for hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and the SGLT2 inhibitors had a great potential to be effective for prevention of HF in a wide variety of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients independent of their history of HF or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, the DAPA-HF trial also demonstrated that dapagliflozin proved clinically effective in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction regardless of diabetes, suggesting its robust benefits in some specific patients with HF. According to these evidences, SGLT2 inhibitor is increasingly recognized as an emerging and promising option to reduce the risk of HF in patient with T2D. To use appropriately SGLT2 inhibitors for HF prevention in the real-world setting, it would be required to determine the optimal patient population who can receive better clinical benefits from SGLT2 inhibitors. In this commentary, based on the current understandings and lessons learned from the most recent studies, we discussed the importance of future research on the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor in clinical situations of HF other than those examined in previous cardiovascular outcome trials.
