## Question

Cure for irritable bowel syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a cure for irritable bowel syndrome and, if not, what the most effective, evidence-based management looks like. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how IBS is defined and whether it is considered curable. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about treatment goals and whether they ever frame therapy as curative. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence for current therapies and their expected benefits. After that, I should consider emerging or investigational approaches that might be misconstrued as "cures". Finally, I will synthesize a practical, subtype-tailored management plan and communicate the prognosis clearly, including when remission occurs and what that means clinically.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct. IBS is a chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by recurrent abdominal pain with altered bowel habits. It is diagnosed clinically using symptom-based criteria (Rome IV) and is not a structural disease, which already hints that "cure" in the conventional sense is unlikely [^115DgFY5] [^115YXMbN]. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on goals of care: both ACG and BSG emphasize symptom control, quality-of-life improvement, and individualized management rather than eradication of disease, reinforcing that treatment is about durable control rather than cure [^117RztFg] [^112pDjf1].

> I should confirm whether any authoritative source claims a cure. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some reviews mention spontaneous remission, but that is not equivalent to a cure. Remission can occur and may persist, yet recurrence remains common and predictable, so calling it a cure would be misleading [^1173zRTk]. I need to ensure I'm precise: contemporary guidelines consistently frame IBS as a chronic condition requiring ongoing management, not a disease with a definitive cure [^115DgFY5] [^117RzWTx].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for current therapies and their realistic benefits. Most medical therapies improve global symptoms in a minority of patients, with therapeutic gains over placebo often in the 7–15% range, which underscores modest average efficacy and the need for trial-and-error strategies [^117AfuLK]. Let me double-check key recommendations: for IBS-C, guanylate cyclase-C agonists (linaclotide, plecanatide) and lubiprostone have high-quality evidence; for IBS-D, rifaximin and eluxadoline are recommended; for global symptoms across subtypes, low-dose TCAs and gut-directed psychotherapies (CBT, hypnotherapy) are supported, though evidence quality varies [^114TNY9N] [^113PAuCf] [^115ZbPDu] [^116VdVkG]. Hmm, wait a minute — about probiotics, I initially thought they might be broadly helpful, but I should correct that: ACG suggests against probiotics for global IBS symptoms due to very low-quality evidence and heterogeneity, so they are not a reliable "cure" or even a consistent therapy [^1152cfsG].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic therapies that patients often ask about. Dietary approaches such as a structured low FODMAP diet (with dietitian supervision and reintroduction) and soluble fiber (psyllium) have supportive evidence and are guideline-endorsed for symptom improvement, but again, these are management tools rather than cures [^117JMGn2] [^117BaoHe]. Let me verify the role of brain–gut behavioral therapies: CBT and gut-directed hypnotherapy improve global symptoms and are reasonable options, particularly when medications are insufficient or declined, yet they do not eradicate the underlying disorder [^116VdVkG] [^112Th3Zu].

> But wait, what about emerging or investigational treatments — could any of these be a cure? Fecal microbiota transplantation shows signals of benefit in some studies, but results are mixed, durability is uncertain, and it is not established as standard curative therapy; similarly, other experimental agents targeting specific pathways remain under study and are not validated cures [^1159mGsg] [^117V47ym]. I should confirm that current research priorities still focus on better phenotyping, biomarkers, and head-to-head trials rather than on curative strategies, reflecting the absence of a cure at present [^114QVSAr].

> Let me consider prognosis and the concept of remission. Spontaneous remission does occur in a subset, more often with acute onset, short duration, post-infectious features, and minimal psychological comorbidity; however, recurrence is common, so even "remission" should be framed as prolonged symptom control rather than eradication of disease [^1173zRTk]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this view: they emphasize education, self-management, and longitudinal care precisely because IBS is chronic and relapsing, not curable [^114o5hXB] [^112pDjf1].

> Now, I need to translate this into a practical, subtype-tailored plan. For all patients, I should confirm a positive diagnosis using symptom criteria, screen for celiac disease in those with diarrhea, and provide education about IBS as a gut–brain disorder with common triggers. Then tailor therapy to the predominant symptom and severity, escalating care as needed and reassessing periodically [^113xgX7a] [^117RztFg]. For IBS-C, I would start with soluble fiber and consider linaclotide or plecanatide if symptoms persist; for IBS-D, I would consider loperamide acutely and rifaximin or eluxadoline for recurrent symptoms; for pain-predominant disease, low-dose TCAs are reasonable; and for refractory or psychologically comorbid cases, I would integrate CBT or hypnotherapy and coordinate multidisciplinary care, recognizing that most patients will require ongoing, not curative, strategies [^117BaoHe] [^114TNY9N] [^113PAuCf] [^115ZbPDu] [^116VdVkG] [^114WV7B8].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: there is no cure for IBS at this time. Management is chronic, individualized, and focused on achieving durable symptom control and quality-of-life improvement using diet, behavioral therapies, and medications matched to subtype and severity. Remissions can occur, but recurrence is expected, so expectations should be set accordingly [^117RzWTx] [^111USGWv] [^1173zRTk].

There is **no cure** for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [^117RzWTx]; it is a chronic, relapsing disorder of gut–brain interaction [^111USGWv] managed with symptom-targeted therapies and lifestyle changes [^114hQr3D]. Most patients experience **long-term symptom control** rather than permanent remission, though some have sustained improvement with diet, psychological therapies, or medications [^1173zRTk]. Current treatments — including low FODMAP diets, soluble fiber, antidiarrheals, secretagogues, neuromodulators, and gut-directed psychotherapies — reduce symptoms and improve quality of life, but **do not cure IBS** [^114TNY9N] [^117JMGn2]. Emerging therapies such as microbiome-based treatments and novel agents are under study, but no cure exists at present [^114QVSAr].

---

## Current treatments and their effectiveness

While there is **no cure**, several treatments effectively manage IBS symptoms:

| **Treatment category** | **Examples** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Dietary interventions | - Low FODMAP diet [^117JMGn2] <br/> - Soluble fiber (psyllium) [^117BaoHe] <br/> - Gluten-free diet (selective) | - Effective in reducing symptoms [^114jPReS] <br/> - Improving quality of life [^notfound] |
| Pharmacological treatments | - Antidiarrheals (loperamide) [^114WV7B8] <br/> - Secretagogues (linaclotide, plecanatide) [^1167ZEP8] <br/> - Neuromodulators (TCAs, SSRIs) [^111MTCoi] <br/> - Rifaximin (for IBS-D) [^113PAuCf] | - Effective in symptom control [^114TNY9N] <br/> - Particularly when tailored to IBS subtype [^1143Xb8E] |
| Psychological therapies | - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) [^112Th3Zu] <br/> - Gut-directed hypnotherapy [^112Th3Zu] <br/> - Mindfulness-based therapies [^notfound] | - Effective in reducing symptoms [^116VdVkG] <br/> - Improving quality of life [^notfound] |
| Probiotics | - Bifidobacterium infantis <br/> - Lactobacillus species [^notfound] | - Modest symptom improvement [^114KqJQV] <br/> - Particularly in IBS-D [^notfound] |

---

These treatments provide **significant symptom relief** and improve quality of life, but they do not cure IBS [^113xQVCG] [^117RzWTx].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Recent research explores novel therapies, including **microbiome-based treatments** (fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and prebiotics) [^1159mGsg], which show promise but require further study [^114QVSAr]. Investigational drugs targeting serotonin receptors, chloride channels, and guanylate cyclase-C are in development [^1167ZEP8], and personalized medicine approaches based on genetic, microbial, and psychological profiling may improve outcomes [^112rFyA2].

---

## Factors influencing remission

Several factors influence the likelihood of **symptom remission or sustained improvement**:

- **IBS subtype**: IBS-D may respond better to certain treatments (e.g. rifaximin) than IBS-C or IBS-M [^117RztFg].
- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety, depression, and stress significantly impact symptom severity and treatment response [^111MTCoi].
- **Diet and lifestyle**: Dietary modifications, regular exercise, and stress management improve symptoms [^notfound].
- **Patient demographics**: Younger patients and those with shorter disease duration may have better prognoses [^1173zRTk].

---

## Long-term prognosis

IBS is a **chronic condition** with fluctuating symptoms [^115DgFY5]. Many patients experience periods of remission and relapse, and while some achieve sustained symptom control, a definitive cure remains elusive [^117RzWTx]. Long-term management focuses on symptom control, improving quality of life, and preventing relapses [^117RzWTx].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no cure** for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) at present [^117RzWTx]. Management focuses on symptom control through dietary, pharmacological, and psychological interventions [^114TNY9N]. Emerging therapies and personalized medicine approaches offer hope for improved outcomes, but further research is needed [^114QVSAr].

### Soluble or insoluble fibre in irritable bowel syndrome in primary care? Randomised placebo controlled trial [^1131Pp5o]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with an altered bowel habit, not explained by any structural or biochemical changes in the gut. The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome in the population is in the order of 10%, and approximately a quarter of people with irritable bowel syndrome symptoms seek medical advice.

Most studies report a female predominance, and the reported incidence of irritable bowel syndrome in primary care is 4–13 per 1000 patients per year, less than 5% of whom are referred to hospital. Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic recurrent condition with relapsing symptoms in more than half of patients. It should not be diagnosed by exclusion but rather as a "positive" diagnosis. Diagnostic tools such as the Rome criteria have been developed to facilitate this. The Rome criteria are primarily designed for research purposes, and their validity in clinical primary care is not well established; most general practitioners do not use them.

In the management of irritable bowel syndrome, dietary advice is often given. Most general practitioners recommend an increase in the fibre content of the daily diet, through the addition of insoluble fibre in the form of bran. Furthermore, approximately half of patients with irritable bowel syndrome receive drug treatment, often including psyllium based supplements. However, pooled analyses show limited evidence that fibre actually alleviates symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and insoluble fibre may even worsen the symptoms. Most available studies on fibre treatment have severe methodological limitations, such as inadequate outcome assessment and lack of placebo control, and all trials were done in secondary care. In contrast, most patients with irritable bowel syndrome are treated in primary care, and this patient group may benefit more from fibre treatment than do those in secondary care.

We did a randomised placebo controlled trial in primary care patients with irritable bowel syndrome to assess the effectiveness of treatment with either psyllium or bran on symptoms and quality of life.

Objective

This review is based on the research and guidelines for IBS management. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases (Google Scholar, EBSCO, Springer, ScienceDirect) with a focus on the latest publications. In reference to the characteristics of IBS, including new findings regarding etiopathogenesis, an interdisciplinary treatment approach is proposed and the role of medical and psychological interventions is underlined. The review may be useful for matching the best strategy for IBS management.

1.1 Target audience

These guidelines are directed towards patients and their caregivers, primary up to quaternary health care professionals, researchers in gut motility and DGBI, and public policy makers. The treatment recommendations in this guideline are formulated to establish a framework for shared decision making between patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals, rather than to mandate a standard of care. It is essential to exercise caution when interpreting these guideline recommendations in isolation and consider the qualifying remarks that accompany them, as they may be important in individual cases.

### The role of fiber in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: therapeutic recommendations [^114Rnfio]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common clinical condition that often presents a therapeutic challenge. There is no standard therapy and a multilevel approach is recommended. A high-fiber diet is often one of these components. Many investigators have studied the effectiveness of either fiber supplementation or bulking agents in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature on the use of fiber in irritable bowel syndrome and to provide some specific recommendations. Systematic reviews of these trials have generally not found fiber to be significantly more effective than placebo at relieving global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. There may be differences between results obtained with soluble and insoluble fiber. Adverse effects of fiber use may include abdominal discomfort and bloating. Although dietary fiber or bulking agents do not appear to be useful as sole treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, they may have a limited role in empiric therapy depending upon the patient's symptom complex, especially if constipation is the most significant symptom. The basic principles for using fiber therapy are to start with a low dose and increase slowly, to give an adequate trial and to evaluate the results early and periodically.

### Making a positive diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^1141Hg7B]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The traditional diagnostic approach for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is to exclude other gastrointestinal conditions, which has led to patients being subjected to excessive testing. However, the development of consensus guidelines, such as Rome III, has enabled physicians to make a positive diagnosis of IBS based on the pattern and nature of symptoms. It is now possible to employ a more rational diagnostic strategy with a reduced need for laboratory testing based on symptom-based approaches aimed at standardizing IBS patient subgroups. Patient outcomes in IBS can be further improved by careful consideration of several diagnostic issues including differentiating between disorders (IBS is 1 of > 20 functional gastrointestinal disorders), practical aspects of testing, the indications for colonoscopy, and the need to improve the physician-patient relationship and enhance the patient's adherence to treatment.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^115DgFY5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — definition, core symptoms, and epidemiology are summarized as follows: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, often debilitating, and highly prevalent disorder of gut-brain interaction (previously called functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders). In clinical practice, IBS is characterized by symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain and disordered defecation. Although bloating is a commonly reported symptom, its presence is not mandatory to accurately diagnose IBS. IBS is a common source of referrals to gastroenterologists with a prevalence of approximately 4.4%–4.8% in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada and affects most commonly women and individuals younger than 50 years.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: the burden and unmet needs in Europe [^114Akpeu]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome affects approximately 10–15% of the European population, although prevalence rates vary depending on the classification used and the country surveyed. This may be due to differences in patterns of medical care and diagnosis of the condition. Up to 70% of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome may not have been formally diagnosed. The disorder affects 1.5–3 times as many women as men and poses a significant economic burden in Europe, estimated at euro 700-euro 1600 per person per year. It also reduces quality of life and is associated with psychological distress, disturbed work and sleep, and sexual dysfunction. It is a chronic disorder, which affects many individuals for more than 10 years. Most patients are managed in primary care, although some are referred to gastroenterologists and other specialists. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome undergo more abdomino-pelvic surgery than the general population. We propose that a positive diagnosis of the condition may avoid the delay in diagnosis many patients experience. We conclude that, in Europe, there are significant unmet needs including lack of familiarity with irritable bowel syndrome, difficulties in diagnosis and lack of effective treatments for the multiple symptoms of the disorder. The development of pan-European guidelines for irritable bowel syndrome will benefit patients with this condition in Europe.

### Effect of fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114C3iHn]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Whether any of these agents are effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome is controversial. Results of randomised controlled trials are conflicting, and many have been underpowered to detect a difference between active treatment and control intervention. Systematic reviews have also come to different conclusions about the efficacy of the three treatments in irritable bowel syndrome. As a result confusion exists as to the roles of these agents, with current management guidelines for irritable bowel syndrome making varying recommendations.

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of fibre, antispasmodics, and peppermint oil in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

We recommend the use of chloride channel activators and guanylate cyclase activators to treat global IBS with constipation symptoms. We recommend the use of rifaximin to treat global IBS with diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that gut-directed psychotherapy be used to treat global IBS symptoms.

### Treatments targeting putative mechanisms in irritable bowel syndrome [^113CBGg4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is heterogeneous; it is possible for several mechanisms to be disturbed in the same patient. Isolating a single target for pharmacological manipulation is also difficult because of the complexity and overlap of the neural circuitry in the enteric and central nervous system. This review summarizes the rationale and efficacy of current and future therapies for IBS, on the basis of putative pathophysiological models. The modulation of gastrointestinal sensorimotor function, intestinal gas handling, the gastrocolonic reflex, neurohormonal stress responses, central processing of afferent information, and microbial flora are the current frontiers for experimental therapeutics for IBS. Patients presumed to have POSTINFECTIOUS IBS have also been targeted as a distinct group. In the very near future, it is unlikely that a single drug will come to the fore as a suitable and successful treatment for everyone with IBS, but new data on potential therapeutic targets lend hope for the improved long-term management of IBS. Disease modification rather than just symptom-based treatments must remain the goal.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis: probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome [^1135JCC9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder and the evidence for efficacy of most drug therapies in the treatment of IBS is weak. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several conditions. including IBS. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in alleviating symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We searched Ovid versions of MEDLINE (1950–2007), EMBASE (1980–2007), CINAHL (1982–2007), AMED (1985–2007), the Cochrane library and hand searched retrieved papers.

Results

We identified 14 randomized placebo controlled trials. Combined data suggested a modest improvement in overall symptoms after several weeks of treatment: for dichotomous data from seven trials the overall Odds Ratio (OR) was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2); for continuous data from six trials the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.38).

For individual symptoms the results differed between the pooled dichotomous and pooled continuous data. Trials varied in relation to the length of treatment (4–26 weeks), dose, organisms and strengths of probiotics used.

Conclusion

Probiotics may have a role in alleviating some of the symptoms of IBS, a condition for which currently evidence of efficacy of drug therapies is weak. However, as IBS is a condition that is chronic and usually intermittent longer term trials are recommended. Such research should focus on the type, optimal dose of probiotics and the subgroups of patients who are likely to benefit the most.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria and trial applicability — The Rome IV criteria differ from Rome III by removing abdominal discomfort and requiring abdominal pain to be present at least 1 day per week on average during the preceding 3 months; fewer individuals meet Rome IV than Rome III, and for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that measure abdominal pain, Rome IV is more applicable, though it is not known whether these diagnostic changes alter efficacy and safety outcomes in RCTs.

### The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome [^116G45fA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional bowel disorder routinely encountered by healthcare providers. Although not life-threatening, this chronic disorder reduces patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to the healthcare system. IBS is no longer considered a diagnosis of exclusion that can only be made after performing a battery of expensive diagnostic tests. Rather, IBS should be confidently diagnosed in the clinic at the time of the first visit using the Rome III criteria and a careful history and physical examination. Treatment options for IBS have increased in number in the past decade and clinicians should not be limited to using only fiber supplements and smooth muscle relaxants. Although all patients with IBS have symptoms of abdominal pain and disordered defecation, treatment needs to be individualized and should focus on the predominant symptom. This paper will review therapeutic options for the treatment of IBS using a tailored approach based on the predominant symptom. Abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhea are the four main symptoms that can be addressed using a combination of dietary interventions and medications. Treatment options include probiotics, antibiotics, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and agents that modulate chloride channels and serotonin. Each class of agent will be reviewed using the latest data from the literature.

### An update on irritable bowel syndrome: from diagnosis to emerging therapies [^1141dwM6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal discomfort or pain that is accompanied by a disturbance in defecation. Although the exact etiopathogenesis is not completely understood, recent advances in the understanding of the biochemical, physiologic, and biopsychosocial mechanisms of IBS have resulted in exciting new insights as well as therapies. This article will review the recent developments in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

Recent Findings

IBS may be the product of various pathogenic mechanisms which include IBS as a serotonergic disorder; the role of genetics; IBS as an inflammatory state and the potential role of mast cells; IBS as a result of bacterial overgrowth and altered gastrointestinal microbiome; and abnormal pain processing and pain memory. Emerging therapies have developed targeting these mechanisms.

Summary

IBS remains a symptom-based diagnosis that can usually be made comfortably based on clinical history without testing in the absence of alarm features. Novel and emerging therapies that are based upon the evolving understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS hold significant promise and for the first time there are potential therapies that may alter the natural history of this disorder.

Regarding medical management for irritable bowel syndrome, more specifically with respect to antidepressants, TCAs, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to offer TCAs (at a low dose, such as 10 mg amitriptyline once daily, and titrated slowly to a maximum of 30–50 mg once daily) as second-line therapy, initiated in primary or secondary care, for global symptoms and abdominal pain in patients with IBS. Provide patients with a careful explanation to the rationale for their use and counsel about their side effect profile.

### Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in women [^113gJkts]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex clinical process with multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms. There has recently been a shift in the treatment of patients with severe IBS symptoms to disease-modifying therapies as opposed to symptomatic treatment. Because pathophysiologic differences exist between men and women, so does the efficacy of treatment options. These differences could further explain gender-related differences in disease prevalence and treatment response. A brief discussion of the definition, epidemiology, and diagnostic criteria of IBS is followed by a comprehensive review of the current treatment choices and potential future therapeutic options of IBS in women.

### Potential future therapies for irritable bowel syndrome: will disease modifying therapy as opposed to symptomatic control become a reality? [^1173zRTk]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome can remit spontaneously, implying cure is possible. Predictors of good prognosis include a short history, acute onset(possibly postinfective origin), absence of psychological disorders, and resolution of chronic life stressors. Possible-disease modifying treatments with long-lasting effects include diet and anti-inflammatory and psychological treatments. Dietary modifications, which often involve excluding dairy and wheat products, are successful in some patients. Anti-inflammatory treatments have been subjected to one RCT in postinfective IBS without benefit. Probiotics may have benefit in altering bacterial flora and as anti-inflammatory agents, but further trials are needed before they can be recommended. Psychological treatments may produce long-lasting responses. Relaxation therapy appears to have a nonspecific benefit. Psychotherapy has been shown to have long-term benefit and is particularly acceptable to, and effective for, those with overt psychological distress. Hypnotherapy has been shown to be effective in randomized placebo controlled trials and has a sustained effect.

### Centrally acting therapies for irritable bowel syndrome [^115Kyync]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders typically defy traditional diagnostic methods based on structural abnormalities, and has led to the emergence of the discipline of neurogastroenterology or the study of the "brain-gut axis", which is based on dysregulation of neuroenteric pathways as a key pathophysiological feature of IBS. Centrally acting treatments can influence these pathways and improve the clinical manifestations of pain and bowel dysfunction associated with this disorder. To successfully implement these treatment strategies, it is important to recognize their dual effects on brain and gut, understanding the nature and severity of the GI symptoms and their psychosocial concomitants, and applying them within the context of the patient's understanding of their value.

### Cognitive behaviour therapy for irritable bowel syndrome [^114YCkgd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The UK Department of Health states that there is suggestive, although not conclusive, evidence for the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and that CBT should be considered as a treatment option for the syndrome. This paper provides a general introduction to CBT, the principles which underlie it and how they can be applied to IBS. The components of CBT for IBS are described in some detail. Guidelines for gastroenterologists are provided on how these principles can be used to inform their practice and the existing outcome data are reviewed.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^111USGWv]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders seen by clinicians in both primary and secondary care. Since publication of the last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline in 2007, substantial advances have been made in understanding its complex pathophysiology, resulting in its re-classification as a disorder of gut-brain interaction, rather than a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Moreover, there has been a considerable amount of new evidence published concerning the diagnosis, investigation and management of IBS. The primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, is to review and summarise the current evidence to inform and guide clinical practice, by providing a practical framework for evidence-based management of patients. One of the strengths of this guideline is that the recommendations for treatment are based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of trial-based and network meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of dietary, pharmacological and psychological therapies in treating IBS. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, summarising both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, this guideline identifies novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need for future research.

### Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome: primary care based pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^111k8mA1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acupuncture is used by patients as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but the evidence on effectiveness is limited. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome in primary care when provided as an adjunct to usual care.

Methods

Design: A two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial.

Setting: Primary care in the United Kingdom.

Patients: 233 patients had irritable bowel syndrome with average duration of 13 years and score of at least 100 on the IBS Symptom Severity Score (SSS).

Interventions: 116 patients were offered 10 weekly individualised acupuncture sessions plus usual care, 117 patients continued with usual care alone.

Measurements: Primary outcome was the IBS SSS at three months, with outcome data collected every three months to 12 months.

Results

There was a statistically significant difference between groups at three months favouring acupuncture with a reduction in IBS Symptom Severity Score of −27.43 (95% CI: –48.66 to −6.21, p = 0.012). The number needed to treat for successful treatment (≥ 50 point reduction in the IBS SSS) was six (95% CI: 3 to 17), based on 49% success in the acupuncture group vs. 31% in the control group, a difference between groups of 18% (95% CI: 6% to 31%). This benefit largely persisted at 6, 9 and 12 months.

Conclusions

Acupuncture for irritable bowel syndrome provided an additional benefit over usual care alone. The magnitude of the effect was sustained over the longer term. Acupuncture should be considered as a treatment option to be offered in primary care alongside other evidenced based treatments.

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment [^117V47ym]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common reason to visit a gastroenterologist. IBS was believed to be a functional disease, but many possible pathophysiologic mechanisms can now explain the symptoms. IBS patients are classified into subtypes according to their predominant bowel habit, based on the Rome IV criteria. These include diarrhea-predominant and constipation-predominant IBS, as well as the mixed type, a combination of the two. Usually, IBS treatment is based on the predominant symptoms, with many options for each subtype. A new promising treatment option, fecal microbiota transplantation, seems to have beneficial effects on IBS. However, treating the pathophysiological causative agent responsible for the symptoms is an emerging approach. Therefore, before the appropriate therapeutic option is chosen for treating IBS, a clinical evaluation of its pathophysiology should be performed.

### The spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome: a clinical review [^113xQVCG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with a substantial burden on individual patients, health care systems, and society as a whole.

Objectives

This review article provides an overview of the disease state and discusses treatment options.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was searched for original research and review articles published in English (from 1966 to July 2005) using the medical subject heading irritable bowel syndrome and the following subheadings: diagnosis, economics, pathophysiology, and therapy. Preference was given to articles that focused on new insights regarding pathophysiology and to those that addressed global symptom improvement for IBS.

Results

Symptoms of IBS vary with each patient and disease episode. Although improvement in individual IBS symptoms is desirable, the overall goal in managing patients with IBS is to achieve global symptom improvement. Traditional IBS therapies (ie, psychotherapy/behavioral therapy, bulking agents, antidiarrheals, antispasmodics, and tricyclic antidepressants) have lacked demonstrable efficacy in randomized controlled trials. Recent improvements in the understanding of IBS pathophysiology, particularly regarding the role of neurotransmitters and hormones in gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and visceral perception, have resulted in the development of novel treatments for IBS. In clinical trials, IBS-specific treatments (ie, agents that affect serotonergic pathways) have been associated with significant improvements in global symptoms. However, the added cost of treatment with these agents and the potential risks of serious adverse events (eg, severe constipation, severe diarrhea, ischemic colitis) may preclude their widespread use. Initial cost-effectiveness analyses with the novel IBS-specific agents suggest the benefits may outweigh the added costs. From a managed care perspective, the costs incurred by IBS-specific therapies may be offset by subsequent reductions in health care resource utilization by patients with IBS.

Conclusions

IBS-specific agents offer an opportunity for patients with IBS to achieve global symptom improvement. However, when weighing the costs and potential risks against the potential benefits, clinicians should consider the nature and severity of the patient's symptoms, the degree of functional impairment, and the presence of psychosocial comorbidities.

### Antidepressants in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111rHxmF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome is complex, and many of the recommended therapies lack high-quality evidence
Several neuromodulators exert localized effects on both the central and peripheral nervous systems and may offer benefits to these patients

What the new findings are:

Atidepressants from various classes have demonstrated efficacy not only in refractory patients or those with underlying psychopathology but also in the majority of patients, regardless of subgroup classification
Beyond their role in alleviating overall symptoms, antidepressants serve as a valuable therapeutic option for the relief of abdominal pain and bloating — the latter being a symptom for which few treatments have been conclusively proven effective

### Medical therapies for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [^114YEewu]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that manifests with abdominal pain and diarrheal bowel patterns, without structural explanation. Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is a heterogeneous condition resulting from diverse pathophysiologic processes. Treatment strategies with varied mechanisms of action are beneficial in its management. The clinician must become familiar with a multi-dimensional approach to irritable bowel syndrome. The 3 approved medications are central to disease management. Effective treatment uses off-label medications and emerging therapies and a growing number of over-the-counter and supplemental agents to optimize symptom improvement for the patient with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

### Common mental disorders in irritable bowel syndrome: pathophysiology, management, and considerations for future randomised controlled trials [^111XaZgN]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

The frequent co-occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome and the common mental disorders of anxiety and depression is well established. A range of biological and psychosocial disease mechanisms are common to both disorders, many of which contribute to a dysregulated gut-brain axis. Clinical and subthreshold psychological comorbidity adds to the functional impairment and disease burden in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. Progress is being made with regard to understanding irritable bowel syndrome in the clinical setting from a biopsychosocial perspective. However, until now, most trials of irritable bowel syndrome treatment still consider the disease as a gut disorder in isolation, which leaves major gaps in knowledge about disease-disease interactions and treatment outcomes in irritable bowel syndrome. In this Viewpoint, we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of anxiety and depression in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. We also provide methodological recommendations for future randomised controlled trials and outline guidance for research that better incorporates psychiatric comorbidity into its design, with a view to improve treatment outcomes for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: questions and answers for effective care [^117RzWTx]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions related to specific biologic and cellular abnormalities that are not fully understood. Psychological factors do not cause IBS, but many people with IBS also have anxiety or depressed mood, a history of adverse life events, or psychosocial stressors. Physicians must understand the fears and expectations of patients and how they think about their symptoms and should also respond empathetically to psychosocial cues. Anxiety related to the unpredictability of symptoms may have a greater effect on quality of life than the symptoms themselves. Patients in generally good health who have ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal stool patterns most likely have IBS or another functional gastrointestinal disorder. Patients who meet symptom-based criteria and have no alarm features may be confidently diagnosed with few, if any, additional tests. Patients may not completely understand the diagnostic process; asking about expectations and carefully explaining the goals and limitations of testing leads to more effective care. There is no definitive treatment for IBS, and recommended treatments focus on symptom relief and improved quality of life. Trusting patient-physician interactions are essential to help patients understand and accept an IBS diagnosis and to actively engage in effective self-management.

### New and emerging therapies for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: an update for gastroenterologists [^112tfzxh]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, straining, urgency, incomplete evacuation, nausea, and bloating) that occur alongside bowel function alterations (i.e. constipation, diarrhea, or both). Patients with irritable bowel syndrome may also experience comorbid anxiety and depression. Irritable bowel syndrome is common, with a prevalence estimated between 3% and 28%, affecting patient health and quality of life. Patients with moderate or severe irritable bowel syndrome generally seek medical care, whereas those with milder symptoms may choose self-management. Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome receive outpatient care, but irritable bowel syndrome-related hospitalizations do occur. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is multifactorial (i.e.g.enetics, immune components, changes in the gut microbiota, disturbances in physiologic stress response systems, and psychosocial factors). Management of irritable bowel syndrome can include lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, counseling, psychologic medication, and agents that affect gastrointestinal motility. A number of therapies have emerged in recent years with clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy and safety for patients with irritable bowel syndrome, including agents that target gastrointestinal motility (i.e. linaclotide), gastrointestinal opioid receptors (i.e. asimadoline, eluxadoline), and gut microbiota (i.e. rifaximin). Linaclotide has been shown to significantly improve stool frequency and abdominal pain compared with placebo in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (number needed to treat, 5.1). Asimadoline shows efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome-related pain. Rifaximin provided adequate relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms versus placebo for a significantly greater percentage of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (p < 0.001). Management that encompasses all aspects of irritable bowel syndrome (gastrointestinal symptoms) and comorbid psychologic symptoms (e.g. anxiety or depression) is important for improving overall patient health and well-being.

### Focus on pharmacotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^112NtSfZ]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is a common disorder that significantly impairs quality of life. There are now multiple classes of therapeutics that have been shown via rigorous clinical testing to improve the abdominal and bowel symptoms attributed to irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. These include the secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide, tenapenor) and the prokinetic agent tegaserod. This article highlights the pivotal evidence for these agents and most recent treatment guidance from the major North American gastroenterological societies. When pharmaceuticals are used, a patient-specific approach based on efficacy, safety, tolerability, access, and affordability is recommended.

### Measuring successful treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: is "satisfactory relief " enough? [^115mA6xu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment options for the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are expanding as new therapies, including probiotics and serotonin receptor agents, become available. Before any new agents gain widespread use, they must be studied in appropriately designed clinical trials. Symptom improvement remains the key clinically but the best technique to measure symptom improvement is unclear. Many IBS therapy studies have used a binary endpoint such as "Have you had satisfactory relief of your IBS symptoms in the past week? Yes/No?" The study by Whitehead and colleagues in this issue suggests that "satisfactory relief" is affected by baseline symptom severity and may not always truly reflect the symptom burden. Future research needs to determine whether "satisfactory relief" is truly adequate, or whether alternatives such as the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in symptom severity would represent a superior approach to capture clinically important improvement.

### The dilemma of persistent irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease [^111mQVhW]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease differ in their natural evolution, etiopathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and therapeutic approach. However, recent evidence has suggested some similarities in mechanisms underlying symptom development and progression. There is a relevant role for alterations in the microbiome-brain-gut axis in both diseases. The presence of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease is common in clinical practice. To determine the cause of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease is a clinical challenge. This review aims to illustrate possible causes and solutions for these patients.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: straightening the road from the Rome criteria [^115WB1rB]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Medium credibility.

A sequence of consensus-based Rome criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been published since 1989. The fundamental definition based on abdominal pain in association with bowel dysfunction has been consistent. However, two major changes occurred in the Rome II and IV criteria. The former change involved "splitting off" of symptoms that were not consistently associated with pain, such as functional, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. In Rome IV, the main changes were the exclusion of discomfort (in contrast to pain) and the more stringent frequency criteria for the pain to be eligible for diagnosis of IBS (specifically, on average, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months). Validation studies of the consensus, symptom-based criteria have identified multiple deficiencies that question the rationale for "splitting" the different syndromes, and favor a simpler identification of the classical symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating, and exclusion of alarm symptoms. Advances in the identification of actionable biomarkers related to the symptoms suggestive of functional gastrointestinal disorders have the potential to usher a change in practice from positive diagnosis of symptom complexes followed by empirical treatment to identification of the mechanisms causing the symptoms and targeted therapy.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: new and emerging therapies [^1113C7co]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome refers to abdominal discomfort associated with altered bowel habits. Recent evidence suggests that the primary pathophysiologic mechanism is brain-gut dysregulation. Many central and peripheral factors are involved. This article will review important pathophysiologic mechanisms with a focus on new and emerging therapies.

Recent Findings

Prior gastroenteritis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may be important for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Understanding of serotonergic receptors in gastrointestinal function has led to the development of serotonergic agents such as alosetron and tegaserod. Novel agents targeting other receptor sites include neurokinin and neurohormonal modulators, chloride channels and opioid receptors. Other therapeutic approaches - behavioral treatments, probiotics, antibiotics and alternative therapies - have developing roles in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

Summary

A better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms has resulted in therapeutic advances. Prokinetic therapies may have a role in nondiarrhea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Antidepressants are used to modulate pain and treat comorbid psychological distress. Newer agents target various receptor sites. Advances in psychological/behavioral treatments and alternative modalities hold promise for the future.

### Current and emergent pharmacologic treatments for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: evidence-based treatment in practice [^114aHu85]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a common, chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder with symptoms that can be distressing for patients and often result in substantially impaired quality of life. This review focuses on providing clinicians with information on practical, evidence-based treatment for IBS-D. Current therapies commonly used for the treatment of IBS-D, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, are briefly reviewed, followed by discussion of the emergent pharmacologic treatments (rifaximin and eluxadoline) and medical foods (IBgard ® and EnteraGam ®). Given the lack of a standard treatment algorithm for IBS-D and the emergence of new pharmacologic therapies, treatment needs to be tailored to the individual patient and take into account the severity of disease. In this context, the latter part of this manuscript examines how treatments for IBS-D can be used in clinical practice by presenting three patient case scenarios with varying degrees of IBS-D severity. For each case, the patient's medical history and clinical presentation are related to the Rome Foundation multidimensional clinical profile (MDCP) and potential treatment options with current and emergent therapies are reviewed. The interplay of gastrointestinal symptoms and their psychosocial impact, as well as the importance of a patient-centered approach to therapy, are discussed. Consideration is given to the potential need for combination therapies and how emergent treatments could fit into the treatment pathway for mild, moderate, and severe cases of IBS-D in clinical practice.

### Therapeutic advances in functional gastrointestinal disease: irritable bowel syndrome [^112rFyA2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Reported prevalence rates of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are between 8% to 20% in the US general population with an average medical expenditure of US$1.35 billion direct and US$205 million indirect costs. Current pathophysiologic theories are based on abnormalities of both the brain and gut, thus setting a new stage for current and future therapeutic approaches. There are numerous treatment options in IBS acting centrally and peripherally by influencing motility and visceral sensitivity. Clinical evidence is variable; however, newer emerging treatments are being evaluated using better-designed clinical trials. Accurate assessment of IBS drug efficacy is still hampered by heterogeneity of the IBS population. Novel methods such as pharmacogenomics or brain imaging may be helpful in the future to better understand and characterize IBS patient subtypes, and this in turn will lead to more specific and efficient therapeutic options. Patient subpopulation measurement of side effects is also a clinical challenge and further understanding could improve treatment efficacy enhancing the patient compliance.

### European and north American guidelines for treating irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain in childhood: a guide for health-care professionals [^11785dSZ]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2025). High credibility.

Abdominal pain-related disorders of gut-brain interaction (AP-DGBI; including irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified, abdominal migraine, and functional dyspepsia) are very common among children and adolescents worldwide. Two of these disorders, irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified, have high rates of school absenteeism, psychological comorbidities, and chronicity into adulthood. A wide range of psychosocial, dietary, and pharmacological treatments have been explored for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children. However, the evidence remains broad but shallow, limiting certainty about the effectiveness of specific therapies. This Health Policy translates the new evidence-based treatment guidelines for irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified produced by the European and North American societies for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition into practical guidance for general paediatricians and primary care providers. This Health Policy aims to empower clinicians at all levels of care to make informed, evidence-based decisions through a shared decision-making approach tailored to the management of children with irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: basis of clinical management strategies [^116w3GnK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are often described as challenging. The diagnosis of IBS can safely be made using the Rome II criteria in conjunction with a thorough physical examination and a limited number of diagnostic studies. Although the diagnosis is generally made with a high degree of accuracy, the pathophysiology of IBS remains elusive, and treatment can be frustrating for both patient and physician alike. Important areas of research focus on the psychology of IBS, visceral hypersensitivity, motility abnormalities (e.g., heightened gastrocolonic response), and the "brain-gut axis". A multidisciplinary effort is often required to ameliorate symptoms and improve the patients' quality of life. This review article will discuss the myriad of treatments available for patients with IBS, and provide both a clinical and practical discussion of their use, providing evidence where available and clinical experience where it is not.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^117RztFg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent, chronic disorder that significantly reduces patients' quality of life. Advances in diagnostic testing and in therapeutic options for patients with IBS led to the development of this first-ever American College of Gastroenterology clinical guideline for the management of IBS using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Twenty-five clinically important questions were assessed after a comprehensive literature search; 9 questions focused on diagnostic testing; 16 questions focused on therapeutic options. Consensus was obtained using a modified Delphi approach, and based on GRADE methodology, we endorse the following: We suggest that a positive diagnostic strategy as compared to a diagnostic strategy of exclusion be used to improve time to initiating appropriate therapy. We suggest that serologic testing be performed to rule out celiac disease in patients with IBS and diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that fecal calprotectin be checked in patients with suspected IBS and diarrhea symptoms to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. We recommend a limited trial of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disacchardies, monosaccharides, polyols (FODMAP) diet in patients with IBS to improve global symptoms. We recommend the use of chloride channel activators and guanylate cyclase activators to treat global IBS with constipation symptoms. We recommend the use of rifaximin to treat global IBS with diarrhea symptoms. We suggest that gut-directed psychotherapy be used to treat global IBS symptoms. Additional statements and information regarding diagnostic strategies, specific drugs, doses, and duration of therapy can be found in the guideline.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: evaluation and treatment [^1143Xb8E]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and disturbed defecation in the absence of other medical conditions with similar presentations. Because physical findings and currently available diagnostic tests lack sufficient specificity for clinical use, the diagnosis of IBS is based on characteristic symptoms as outlined in several symptom-based criteria for IBS. When used in combination with a detailed history, physical examination, and limited diagnostic testing, these criteria are a valid method of diagnosing IBS. Once a confident diagnosis of IBS has been made, treatment of IBS should be based on the predominant symptom while taking into account the severity of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment both physically and psychologically. Most patients with IBS have mild symptoms and education, reassurance, dietary and lifestyle changes, and a therapeutic physician-patient relationship form the backbone of treatment. A smaller number of patients have moderate symptoms, which are typically intermittent, but may at times interrupt their normal activities. In addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic intervention based on the predominant symptom (diarrhea, constipation, or pain) may be used to relieve symptoms. Finally, a small subset of patients has severe or intractable symptoms. These patients, often seen in tertiary referral centers, often have constant pain symptoms and psychosocial impairments. A multidisciplinary approach including pharmacologic treatments, psychologic treatments, and possibly a mental health or pain center involvement may be beneficial.

### Treating irritable bowel syndrome through an interdisciplinary approach [^1168cASq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder with a multifactorial etiology and a complex clinical picture. The recent discovery of the dysregulation of the gut-brain axis as an important pathogenetic mechanism for the development of IBS is a kind of breakthrough in the understanding of IBS and prevalent comorbidities. Nevertheless, IBS treatment still causes many problems and often turns out to be ineffective or brings only short-term effects in reducing symptom severity. In reference to the characteristics of IBS, including new findings regarding etiopathogenesis, an interdisciplinary treatment approach is proposed and the roles of medical and psychological interventions are underlined. The literature search was conducted using electronic databases with a focus on the latest publications. The review may be useful for matching the best strategy of IBS management.

### FDA and EMA end points: which outcome end points should we use in clinical trials in patients with irritable bowel syndrome? [^116boMkK]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Trial design and endpoints for the evaluation of drug efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) underwent major changes over the last two decades. A systematic review in the early 1990s concluded that there were few well-designed and well-executed treatment trials in IBS. Over the next decade, the so-called binary endpoints were used in several clinical trials in IBS in the US, Europe and other parts of the world. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a general guidance for the evaluation of symptom benefit in clinical trials based on patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, which had a major impact on trial design in IBS. In May 2012, the FDA recommended to use as provisional endpoint the quantification of two major IBS aspects, abdominal pain and disordered defecation, to assess the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in IBS. In the present issue of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, the performance of the FDA Responder Endpoint for clinical trials in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation was evaluated using data from two large Phase III clinical trials of linaclotide. The FDA interim endpoints are clinically relevant as they are also able to capture the smallest patient-reported difference in the domain of Abdominal Pain intensity and Abnormal Defecation with good diagnostic accuracy. The FDA responder definition and the European Medicines Agency responder definitions generate similar response rates, while binary endpoints generate higher responder rates. The implications for optimalization and harmonisation are discussed.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and probiotics: from rationale to clinical use [^117KSV7F]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Few therapies are of proven efficacy in irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, there is great interest in the development of a natural therapy that can be both safe and effective. An understanding that probiotics are heterogeneous, with multiple targets and mechanisms of action, is fundamental to the development of clinical trials.

Recent Findings

A bidirectional model for the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome is proposed in which gut-driven and brain-driven mechanisms contribute to the genesis of gut dysfunction and symptoms. In-vitro and animal studies have generated most of the mechanistic rationale for the use of probiotics in functional bowel disorders. A MEDLINE search of publications from 1989 to date revealed only eight placebo-controlled clinical trials on the subject of probiotics and irritable bowel syndrome. All these studies suffer from methodologic problems. By contrast, numerous reviews have been published in the past 2 years on this subject.

Summary

Animal research will continue to identify novel targets and elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotics, thus providing a rational basis for their use in irritable bowel syndrome. The notion of treating irritable bowel syndrome with probiotics is particularly attractive to patients and generates great interest, although clinical evidence is not yet sufficient to enable clear guidelines to be designed. Large, well-designed, controlled clinical trials using specific probiotics are warranted.

### Diagnostic criteria in IBS: useful or not? [^116yxUU6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

There are a number of reasons to establish the accurate diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): to relieve patient uncertainty; to avoid adverse effects of unnecessary medications or treatments; to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and surgeries; to conserve limited healthcare resources; and, of course, to initiate the most appropriate treatment. However, making the diagnosis of IBS remains difficult because it is clinically heterogeneous, no biological marker to detect it exists, many other diseases share the same clinical manifestations and it is often difficult for both physicians and patients to accept the uncertainty of a symptom-based diagnosis. Different diagnostic criteria have been developed during the last 4decades but none have proved to be an ideal method of accurately diagnosing IBS. Just as importantly, physicians are frequently unaware of published guidelines or consciously ignore these diagnostic criteria. Most clinicians still believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion and not a positive diagnosis based on history, physical examination, use of published diagnostic criteria such as the Rome III criteria, and the absence of alarm features. In the sections to follow we will address the inherent difficulties of diagnosing IBS, highlight the importance of symptom-based diagnoses to help reign in soaring healthcare costs, and discuss future strategies that may enable a more cost-efficient diagnosis of IBS.

### Report from the multinational irritable bowel syndrome initiative 2012 [^116R5Cxo]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

In 2012, a group of 29 internationally recognized experts in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) convened to audit the current state of IBS research. The meeting was preceded by a comprehensive online survey that focused on research needs for IBS diagnosis (particularly the strengths and shortcomings of current criteria), definitions used in clinical trials for IBS patients and "healthy controls", potential biomarkers for IBS, and outcome measures in drug trials. While the purpose of the meeting was not to make binding recommendations, participants developed a framework for future questions and research needs in IBS. First, participants indicated the need for revised criteria for the diagnosis of IBS; in particular, inclusion of bloating and de-emphasis of pain as criteria were considered critical needs. Second, participants noted that definitions of normal, healthy controls varied widely among clinical trials; these definitions need to be standardized not only to improve the reliability of results, but also to better facilitate inter-trial comparisons and data synthesis. Third, participants highlighted the need for accurate biomarkers of disease. Fourth and finally, participants noted that further defining outcome measures, so that they are functionally relevant and reflect normalization of bowel function, is a critical need. Together, the discussions held at this workshop form a framework to address future research in IBS.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis: probiotics in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome [^114KqJQV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Probiotics may have a role in alleviating some of the symptoms of IBS, a condition for which currently evidence of efficacy of drug therapies is weak. Longer term trials are recommended as IBS is a condition that is chronic and usually intermittent. However, further research should focus on the type, optimal dose of probiotics and the subgroups of patients who are likely to benefit the most.

### Emerging pharmacological therapies for the irritable bowel syndrome [^113tViYc]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a symptom-based disorder defined by the presence of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Clinical presentations of IBS are diverse, with some patients reporting diarrhea, some constipation, and others a mixture of both. Like the varied clinical phenotypes, the pathogenesis of IBS is also diverse. IBS is not a single disease entity, but rather likely consists of several different disease states. This fact has important implications for the choices and efficacy of IBS treatment. This article reviews the IBS drugs that have reached phase II or III clinical trials.

### Non-pharmaceutical treatments for irritable bowel syndrome [^113FRmND]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction that impacts a significant portion of the population and is associated with substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life, and economic impact globally. The pathophysiology of IBS is complex and incompletely understood, and the heterogeneity of IBS is reflected in the variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical therapies utilized for the management of IBS. Given limitations with pharmaceutical treatments, many patients with IBS seek non-pharmaceutical options. Several non-pharmaceutical treatments such as the low FODMAP diet and brain-gut behavior interventions such as gut directed hypnosis and cognitive behavioral therapy are now considered standard of care and are part of all major guidelines for the treatment of IBS. However, challenges with access to and optimal implementation of these therapies remain. This review focuses on the current evidence for common non-pharmaceutical treatments for IBS, including the latest advances in dietary and brain-gut behavioral care, in addition other complementary and integrative health practices and emerging therapies.

### Dietary interventions and irritable bowel syndrome-what really works? [^112ShPR2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review examines the latest research on the use of dietary interventions in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in order to understand what is the evidence supporting the efficacy of a dietary approach in this disorder.

Recent Findings

A general dietary advice should be offered to all IBS patients. Psyllium supplementation is recommended in IBS with both constipation and diarrhea predominance. There is increasing evidence showing the beneficial effects of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet (LFD) on IBS symptoms. FODMAPs that are well tolerated should be reintroduced in daily diet, to increase acceptability of the diet, and limit potentially harmful effects. The benefits observed with the gluten-free diet seem determined by the reduction of FODMAPs rather than gluten. Modulation of gut microbiota using probiotics shows promising results, but there are unanswered questions regarding the optimal strains, dose and duration of treatment. Additional evidence is also needed for the role of prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS.

Summary

Food is both trigger of IBS symptoms and therapeutic tool. Recent studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of LFD on symptom control, as well as the role of probiotics, which seem to contribute to gut health and function.

### Using best practice to create a pathway to improve management of irritable bowel syndrome: aiming for timely diagnosis, effective treatment and equitable care [^112sjkHB]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating condition, which places a significant burden on the National Health Service (NHS), both in terms of financial cost and strain on primary and secondary care. The total attributable cost of IBS in the UK was almost £12 million per annum in 2012–2013. Despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines recommending that IBS management should take place within primary care, a significant proportion of patients aged 16–45 years with likely IBS are still referred to secondary care despite a low probability of pathology. Research suggests that general practitioners (GP) still see IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion often due to uncertainty about diagnosis and in the belief that negative diagnostic tests are useful. Overall demands for inpatient and outpatient diagnostic endoscopies are increasing steadily. Hence, better GP education around diagnosis of IBS within primary care, along with an effective management pathway, should lead to direct NHS savings, which would allow secondary care gastroenterology services to target their resources more effectively.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: current approach to symptoms, evaluation, and treatment [^111CdN7R]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

There are frequent advances in knowledge about the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. It is important for clinicians to be aware of available therapies and the supporting evidence for those therapies to increase patient satisfaction. This is best achieved with a collaborative and long-term clinician-patient relationship and mutual commitment to modify therapy and try new modalities until the greatest relief of symptoms and improvement in health-related quality of life is achieved. This article reviews symptoms, comorbidities, gender differences, and measure of severity in irritable bowel syndrome and current and evidence-based approaches to evaluation and treatment, and the new symptom-based Rome III diagnostic criteria are reviewed and explained.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: new and emerging treatments [^114hQr3D]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in developed nations. It is characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating. Several non-pharmacological and pharmacological agents, which target the peripheral gastrointestinal system and central nervous system, are used to treat the syndrome. The individual and societal impact of investigating and managing the syndrome is substantial, and despite newer treatments, many patients have unmet needs. Intense research at many international sites has improved the understanding of pathophysiology of the syndrome, but developing treatments that are effective, safe, and that have tolerable side effects remains a challenge. This review briefly summarizes the currently available treatments for irritable bowel syndrome then focuses on newer non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies and recent evidence for older treatments. Recent guidelines on the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are also discussed.

### Treating irritable bowel syndrome through an interdisciplinary approach [^114hKmoS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

IBS management

The cause of IBS has not been clearly identified so far, so the possibility of an effective cure was also limited. However, the remarkable progress in our knowledge of the pathophysiology of IBS that has been made in recent years allows for a better understanding of this condition and brings new perspectives for IBS management. Despite the growing number of publications on various IBS treatment strategies, there is no universally accepted treatment protocol, while current clinical guidelines often indicate the need for further research or clarification. Considering the complex nature of IBS, treatment should be interdisciplinary according to the biopsychosocial model. Assembling a group of different specialists (including gastroenterologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, urologists, gynecologists, etc.) would allow a proper diagnosis and further actions according to the totality of patient complaints. Differences between isolated interventions and a multidisciplinary approach are presented in Fig. 1 and 2.

Figure 1
Isolated methods of irritable bowel syndrome management

Figure 2
Interdisciplinary team for irritable bowel syndrome management

A multidimensional approach should become an essential part of clinical practice as a "lone ranger" model is no longer sufficient for present-day gastroenterology, or even medicine in general. The diagnostic complexity of IBS is presented in Table 2, showing the possible diagnostic traps awaiting the consultant. Central sensitivity syndromes share common pathophysiological features and overlap; therefore, only a well-knit group of specialists can adequately diagnose and treat functional GI disorders, including IBS. Comprehensive management of IBS should then start with an adequate diagnosis and include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods of treatment, according to disease severity and the patient's needs.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: modern concepts and management options [^114HePgq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, manifesting as abdominal pain/discomfort and altered bowel function. Despite affecting as many as 20% of adults, a lack of understanding of etiopathogenesis and evaluation strategies results in diagnostic uncertainty, and in turn frustration of both the physician and the patient. This review summarizes the current literature on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome, with attention to evidence-based approaches. A 4-step treatment strategy that has been used successfully in our tertiary referral practice is presented and should lead to successful therapeutic outcomes in the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

### New insights into irritable bowel syndrome: from pathophysiology to treatment [^1159mGsg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

IBS is a very common disease. However, its pathophysiology is still not fully understood. Usually, treatment for IBS is based on the predominant symptoms, with many options for each subtype. FMT is a promising new option for patients with IBS and seems to have a beneficial effect. However, treating the pathophysiological causative agent responsible for the symptoms is an emerging approach. Hence, before choosing the appropriate therapeutic option for treating IBS, clinical judgement on its pathophysiology should be made.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^114PwBRW]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria context for trials notes that the Rome IV criteria differ from Rome III by deleting abdominal discomfort and requiring abdominal pain to be present at least 1 day per week on average during the preceding 3 months, resulting in fewer individuals meeting Rome IV than Rome III. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that generally measure changes in abdominal pain, Rome IV criteria are described as more applicable, but it is not known whether these diagnostic changes would alter the efficacy and safety of IBS treatments in RCTs.

### Integrated care for irritable bowel syndrome: the future is now [^111Ljw46]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common symptom-based condition of heterogeneous pathogenesis and clinical phenotype. This heterogeneity and multidimensional nature creates significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. Recent evidence has documented the benefits of diet and behavioral interventions. These nonmedical strategies are causing a shift from the traditional care model to a multidisciplinary care model. Recent evidence suggests that collaborative, team-based integrated care leads to better clinical outcomes and reduced cost per cure compared with traditional care. Although it is growing increasingly clear that integrated care offers significant benefits to IBS patients, widespread dissemination will require solutions to structural, cultural, and financial barriers.

### The management of irritable bowel syndrome: a European, primary and secondary care collaboration [^116M8rfJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop recommendations for the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome for European doctors delivering primary care. These recommendations can be adapted by local medical groups according to their language, custom and health-care systems.

Methods

Twenty-one general practitioners and gastroenterologists from Europe attended a workshop planned by a steering committee. After a state-of-the-art symposium, four working groups considered the following aspects of irritable bowel syndrome management: what to tell the patient, diagnosis, non-medical treatment and psychosocial management. Current and future drug management was reviewed by the steering committee. The resulting recommendations were considered at two plenary sessions during the meeting, and by circulation of the material during development of the manuscript.

Results

The process permitted a unique dialogue between general practitioners and gastroenterologists, in which it was necessary to reconcile the specialists' emphasis on thoroughness with the practical, epidemiological and economic realities of primary care. Despite this dichotomy, consensus was achieved.

Conclusions

European general practitioners and gastroenterologists have produced recommendations that emphasize education of the patient, a positive symptom-based diagnosis, diet and lifestyle advice, psychological support and a critical analysis of current specific psychological and pharmacological treatments.

### Guidelines on the irritable bowel syndrome: mechanisms and practical management [^111MTCoi]. Gut (2007). Low credibility.

Background

IBS affects 5–11% of the population of most countries. Prevalence peaks in the third and fourth decades, with a female predominance.

Aim

To provide a guide for the assessment and management of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

Methods

Members of the Clinical Services Committee of The British Society of Gastroenterology were allocated particular areas to produce review documents. Literature searching included systematic searches using electronic databases such as Pubmed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases and extensive personal reference databases.

Results

Patients can usefully be classified by predominant bowel habit. Few investigations are needed except when diarrhoea is a prominent feature. Alarm features may warrant further investigation. Adverse psychological features and somatisation are often present. Ascertaining the patients' concerns and explaining symptoms in simple terms improves outcome. IBS is a heterogeneous condition with a range of treatments, each of which benefits a small proportion of patients. Treatment of associated anxiety and depression often improves bowel and other symptoms. Randomised placebo controlled trials show benefit as follows: cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic interpersonal therapy improve coping; hypnotherapy benefits global symptoms in otherwise refractory patients; antispasmodics and tricyclic antidepressants improve pain; ispaghula improves pain and bowel habit; 5-HT(3) antagonists improve global symptoms, diarrhoea, and pain but may rarely cause unexplained colitis; 5-HT(4) agonists improve global symptoms, constipation, and bloating; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors improve global symptoms.

Conclusions

Better ways of identifying which patients will respond to specific treatments are urgently needed.
