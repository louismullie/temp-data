## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of four geometric figures has the largest area. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact formulas and parameters for each shape. Then, I should verify the calculations one by one. Next, I will compare the results and identify the largest. Finally, I will double-check for any errors and confirm the answer with a concise summary.

> Let me first confirm the approach and the figures. I need to calculate the area for: (A) a triangle with angles 60°, 45°, and side AC = √2; (B) a trapezoid with diagonals √2 and √3 intersecting at 75°; (C) a circle with radius 1; and (D) a square with diagonal 2.5. I should verify that I'm using the correct formulas and that I'm not overlooking any constraints or special cases before proceeding.

> For the triangle in option A, I should confirm the third angle and then use the Law of Sines to find the missing sides before applying the area formula. The third angle is 180° − 60° − 45° = 75°, so I can use the Law of Sines: AB / sin 60° = AC / sin 45° = BC / sin 75°. Given AC = √2, I get AB = √2 × sin 60° / sin 45° = √2 × (√3/2) / (√2/2) = √3, and BC = √2 × sin 75° / sin 45°. Wait, let me verify sin 75°; sin 75° = sin(45° + 30°) = sin 45° cos 30° + cos 45° sin 30° = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = (√6 + √2)/4, so BC = √2 × (√6 + √2)/4 / (√2/2) = (√6 + √2)/2. Now, area = (1/2) × AB × AC × sin(angle between them) = (1/2) × √3 × √2 × sin 60° = (1/2) × √6 × (√3/2) = √18/4 = 3√2/4 ≈ 1.0607. Hold on, I should verify that I'm using the correct pair of sides and included angle; yes, AB and AC with included angle A = 60° is valid, so the area is approximately 1.06 square units.

> For the trapezoid in option B, I need to check the formula for area when diagonals and the angle between them are known. The area of a quadrilateral with diagonals d1 and d2 and included angle θ is (1/2) × d1 × d2 × sin θ. Here, d1 = √2, d2 = √3, and θ = 75°, so area = (1/2) × √2 × √3 × sin 75°. I already calculated sin 75° = (√6 + √2)/4, so area = (1/2) × √6 × (√6 + √2)/4 = (√6 × √6 + √6 × √2)/8 = (6 + √12)/8 = (6 + 2√3)/8 = (3 + √3)/4 ≈ 1.1830. Wait, let me double-check the arithmetic; yes, that simplifies correctly and gives approximately 1.18 square units.

> For the circle in option C, I should confirm the basic area formula. Area = πr² with r = 1, so area = π ≈ 3.1416. I need to ensure I'm not mixing up radius and diameter; the problem states radius is 1, so this is correct.

> For the square in option D, I should verify the relationship between diagonal and side length. If the diagonal is 2.5, then by the Pythagorean theorem, side s satisfies s√2 = 2.5, so s = 2.5/√2 = 2.5√2/2. Area = s² = (2.5√2/2)² = 6.25 × 2 / 4 = 12.5/4 = 3.125. Hold on, I should verify the calculation; yes, that's correct and equals 3.125 square units.

> Now, I will compare the results. Triangle A ≈ 1.06, trapezoid B ≈ 1.18, circle C ≈ 3.14, and square D = 3.125. At first glance, the circle appears largest, but wait, let me verify the exact values because 3.1416 versus 3.125 is close. π is approximately 3.1416, which is indeed greater than 3.125, so the circle edges out the square by about 0.0166 square units. Therefore, the circle has the largest area among the four options.

> I should double-check for any missteps. Initially, I wondered if the trapezoid formula might differ because it's a trapezoid rather than a generic quadrilateral, but the diagonal-based area formula applies to any convex quadrilateral, so using (1/2)d1d2sinθ is appropriate here. Also, I briefly thought the square might be larger than the circle, but the exact calculation confirms π > 3.125, so the circle remains the largest. No other obvious errors stand out after rechecking the steps and arithmetic.

> Final answer: The circle (option C) has the largest area, approximately 3.14 square units, followed closely by the square at 3.125 square units, with the trapezoid and triangle significantly smaller.

---

The largest area is **the circle (C)** with area π ≈ 3.14. The square (D) is close at 3.125, while the triangle (A) and trapezoid (B) are smaller at ≈ 1.06 and ≈ 1.18, respectively. Thus, **C > D > B > A**.

## Calculations

### A. Triangle ABC

- **Angles**: A = 60°, B = 45°, so C = 75°.

### Performance characteristics of methods for quantifying spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: data from the efficacy of nitric oxide in stroke (ENOS) trial [^81f2b5b8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The sources of error that effect variation between ABC/2 and SAS merit consideration. First, the largest diameter of haemorrhage was measured in the axial plane but this may not be the largest ICH diameter, which may also have contributed to differences between 'A' and the visual size categorisation. Sucu et al suggested using the maximum length and width not necessarily on the same slice and found better correlation between ABC/2 and SAS. However, this adaptation applies only to chronic subdural haematomas which differ from spontaneous haemorrhages by extending to the cranial vault and being crescentic. Second, when using ABC/2, the scan plane is measured through AB/2, the formula for the area of a triangle. However, a triangle is not necessarily the most appropriate description of a haematoma. Last, standard ABC/2 approximates the haematoma volume as an ellipsoid with all three axes extending in three perpendicular directions; to compensate for the varying slice thickness, 'C' is derived by multiplying the number of slices of which the haematoma is seen by the slice thickness in centimetres. For the modified ABC/2, 'C' does not include slices if the area of the haemorrhage is less than 25% of the largest area, an approach that has no theoretical justification. Hence, this method does not estimate all three Cartesian coordinates of the ellipsoid. Since the modified ABC/2 method underestimated the ICH volume (by 2–4 cm 3), and small differences in volume equate to the variation in outcome, the modified ABC/2 method cannot be recommended. Further, modern CT scanners provide thin slices and the ability to directly measure 'C', thereby eliminating the need for approximating slice areas.

Scan haemorrhage quantification

Scans were visualised and analysed using OsiriX for Mac (V.3, 32 bit, on a 26 inch Apple iMac. Two trained observers (KK, SFM) measured baseline ICH volumes of 193 patients using ABC/2, modified ABC/2, semiautomatic segmentation (SAS) and automatic volume calculation (AVC, using three-dimensional (3D) rendering of a stack of two-dimensional slices). Both observers assessed scans blinded to each other's data, and repeated a proportion of the scans (47 and 34 scans for KK and SFM, respectively) at a different time blinded to their original measurements. Thus, intraobserver and interobserver variation could be estimated. For the remaining 355 patients, one observer (KK) calculated ICH volumes using all four methods.

The ABC/2 method requires measurement of the longest diameter of the haemorrhage in the axial plane ('A'), longest axis at 90° to 'A' in the axial plane ('B'), and the number of slices ('C') showing the haemorrhage (noting that slice thickness may vary through the scan). 'C' is the product of slice thickness and number of slices showing any haemorrhage. Volume is calculated as A×B×C/2. In the modified ABC/2 method, the area of haemorrhage seen on a slice has to be at least 25% of the haemorrhage area seen on the largest slice if the slice is to be considered in 'C'; if the area is more than 75% of the largest area, the slice counts as 1, and 0.5 if the measured value of the area is between 25% and 75%.

For SAS and AVC, it was possible to use thresholds so that the haemorrhage ROI was measured within certain segmentation parameters. Upper and lower attenuation values (typically 40–80 HU) of haemorrhage were established manually by sampling from the haemorrhage and normal brain. Where the threshold did not exclude non-haemorrhage areas (as with the pineal gland, calcified choroid plexus, bone) in close proximity with the haemorrhage, the haemorrhage boundary was manually edited. The area of each slice that was included within these parameters was measured, added together and multiplied by scan thickness to obtain the SAS volume. AVC used an Osirix '3D growing region (entire series)' method after selecting a threshold part of the haemorrhage near to its centre. With all methods, IVH blood was included in the final ICH volume.

### Risk stratification in GIST: shape quantification with CT is a predictive factor [^0355c46a]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The largest dimension of the lesion was selected when measuring the LD and SD of the lesion in the cross-sectional, coronal-reconstructed imaging, or sagittal reconstructed imaging (multiplanar reformation (MPR) imaging). Comparing the size of the cross-sectional, coronal, and sagittal planes of the tumor, the LD (line "AB") (Fig. 2) of the lesions was determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors [RECIST], and then the maximum SD (line "CD") perpendicular to the LD was measured in this section. The four angles of the quadrangle ABCD were measured and each angle named by its summit (A, B, C, D). A ngle measurements on the PACS system were very convenient, with three points determining an angle. The angle corresponding to the LD was angle A and angle B (A ≥ B), and the angle corresponding to the SD was angle C and angle D (D ≥ C). Line "AB" and line "CD" intersected at point "O." Point "O 1 " and point "O 2 " were the middle of line "AB" and line "CD." When the mass was regular, oval, or circular, we took the two opposite angles of the LD, angle A and angle B (Fig. 3a, b). For irregular lesions, if it was easy to discern the larger ratio of the angle A/angle B ratio to angle D/angle C ratio, we can directly measure the opposite angles corresponding to the larger ratio (Fig. 3c, d). If it was difficult to discern the two ratios, we would compare the angle A/angle B ratio with the angle D/angle C ratio and select the larger ratio for analysis (Fig. 3e, f). We used the pattern diagram to explain the irregular lesions in detail (Fig. 4). We took out the LD and SD of the lesion separately. In Fig. 4a, b, the LD and the SD intersected at point "O." When the LD crossed the midpoint of the SD or was within its vicinity, angle D was approximately equal to angle C. The closer point "A" was to point "O," the larger the angle A was. The larger angle A/angle B ratio was, the mass would grow more prominently in the "OB" direction, and then the more irregular the whole lump was. The principles of Fig. 4c, d are the same as Fig. 4a, b. If it was difficult to judge the size of the angle A/angle B ratio and the angle D/angle C ratio visually (Fig. 4e), we measured each angle and calculated the angle ratio and then compared the two ratios and selected a larger ratio for analysis. Two of the authors (X and W) independently measured the LD and SD, BiA, and the opposite SmA of each lesion, and the LD/SD ratio and BiA/SmA ratio were calculated. For the length, angle, and CT attenuation coefficient to be measured, when the difference between the two radiologists was within 0.1 cm, 1′ and 1 HU, respectively, the average was taken. If this range was exceeded, the two authors would negotiate together to find out the cause of the measurement error and re-measured to determine the final result. The values of measured LD, SD, LD/SD ratios; BiA, SmA, and BiA/SmA ratios; and UE, ApU, VpU, and DpU were used in the analysis.

Geometric models of the Spatial relationships between the stent struts and the perforating arteries

After the dimensions of all perforating artery origins were measured, the formulas for the coverage percentage of the perforating artery origins depending on the stent strut width were calculated. Two clinical situations were considered — stent strut lies on the major axis of the perforating artery ostium (Model 1) and two parallel stent struts cover the ostium, mimicking the telescopic technique (Model 2, Fig. 1). The formulas were as follows:

whereis the stent strut width and whereis the length of origin short axis. For every perforating artery, calculations were performed for stent strut widths of 30, 60, 78, 100 and 150. The first three values are typical of flow diverting stents, and the other two values are typical of conventional stents. The analysis was performed with SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Fig. 1
Geometric representations of the problem of coverage of perforating artery origin (red ellipse) by stent struts (grey boxes). The width of the stent strut is equal to d, the long and short axes of the origin are equal to 2a and 2b, respectively. MCA middle cerebral artery

The geometrical analogy of an ostium of a perforating artery covered by a stent strut is an ellipse covered by a rectangle (Model 1). The least optimal situation is when the stent strut lies on the major axis. Figure 1 shows the geometrical problem: an ellipse (semimajor axis lengthand semiminor axis length) covered by a rectangle (shorter side length).

We would like to calculate the area of the ostium of the perforating artery uncovered by the stent strut: four times the green figure area. The green figure shows the area of a disk sector (radius length, central angle) minus the area of the orthogonal triangle (hypotenuse, cathetus); the disc sector area should be scaledtimes.

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Impact of single eyelid on superior visual field [^124d2c7b]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Calculation of the SVF. Based on the lengths of the 2 sides " d 1 " and " d 2 " of triangle A1, with an angle of 15 degrees formed at the apex between " d 1 " and " d 2," the area of the triangle can be determined as "1/2 sin15° × d 1 × d 2." Area of SVF can be approximated as the sum of the area of the 12 triangles.

Because the important value is not the absolute value of aSVF, but rather the comparison between preoperative and postoperative aSVF, the value of 1/2 sin15° (which can be assumed to represent a coefficient) was omitted from our calculation. We then compared variables, that is, the sum of the product of both sides of triangles (d 1 d 2 + d 2 d 3 + d 3 d 4… d 12 d 13), which we subsequently defined as aSVF.

After defining the visual field of the upper 90-degree meridian on the GP as the superior visual angle (SVA), we inspected differences in ERD, BRD, aSVF, and SVA between preoperatively and postoperatively. To evaluate the difference in SVF between single and double eyelids with an equivalent ERD range, we compared preoperative and postoperative aSVF among patients with ERD, which ranged between 2.0 and 4.0 mm. We then evaluated the correlation both between ERD and aSVF and between ERD and SVA.

This study was approved by our institutional review board (approval no. #424) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent for participation was obtained before patient inclusion in the study.

Statistical Analysis

Comparisons between preoperative and postoperative ERD and BRD, and comparisons for SVA and aSVF between preoperative natural, taped, and postoperative values were performed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations between ERD and aSVF and between ERD and SVA were estimated using Spearman correlation coefficient rank test. P values less than 0.01 were considered significant in all statistical tests. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP 10 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Combined petrosal intertentorial approach: a cadaveric study of comparison with the standard combined petrosectomy [^95cede2f]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Areas of Surgical Exposure

Two areas of exposure (petroclival skull base and brainstem) were calculated by obtaining the sum of areas formed by juxtaposed triangles. For the petroclival area, we identified 4 fixed anatomic landmarks (posterior clinoid process, MC, internal acoustic canal, and jugular foramen) and 2 variables (uppermost and lowest medial clivus). Measuring the coordinates of these 6 points created a hexagonal shape. For the brainstem area, we identified 2 fixed points (trigeminal and facial nerve root entry zone [REZ]) and 3 variables (the lowest medial, the uppermost medial, and uppermost lateral brainstem), obtaining a pentagon-shaped area (Figure 5 A and 5 B drawing). Each polygon was divided along diagonals to create triangles whose area was calculated by the length of each side using Heron's formula. The areas of the 4 triangles of the petroclival skull base and the 3 triangles of the brainstem were then summed to calculate the total area of surgical exposure.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^55f4a482]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ i P i (t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P 1, P 2, P 3) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities 1/ n and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, P i > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time, and. This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W 0 = W 1, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### Graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications: the good, the bad, and how not to be the latter [^a3a1cb03]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Graphs, figures, and tables can save readers time and energy, aid their understanding of an article, and reduce the word count of the main text. However, many graphics submitted to and published in scientific journals fail to meet their potential and include mistakes that jeopardize their clarity. Many formats are available for presenting data, as well as a variety of techniques for enhancing interpretability. When the appropriate format is used to depict data, it conveys the greatest amount of information in the clearest fashion, complements the text, and deepens readers' understanding. The aims of this article are to draw attention to the necessity of well-constructed graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications, and to show how to create them.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Guidelines for reporting of figures and tables for clinical research in urology [^4958d6ed]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

In an effort to improve the presentation of and information within tables and figures in clinical urology research, we propose a set of appropriate guidelines. We introduce 6 principles (1) include graphs only if they improve the reader's ability to understand the study findings; (2) think through how a graph might best convey information, do not just select a graph from preselected options on statistical software; (3) do not use graphs to replace reporting key numbers in the text of a paper; (4) graphs should give an immediate visual impression of the data; (5) make it beautiful; and (6) make the labels and legend clear and complete. We present a list of quick "dos and don'ts" for both tables and figures. Investigators should feel free to break any of the guidelines if it would result in a beautiful figure or a clear table that communicates data effectively. That said, we believe that the quality of tables and figures in the medical literature would improve if these guidelines were to be followed. PATIENT SUMMARY: A set of guidelines were developed for presenting figures and tables in urology research. The guidelines were developed by a broad group of statistical experts with special interest in urology.

The red curve with triangles describes the following data where test specificity is the same as in Fig. 1, but sensitivity has been increased.

Here, assuming a rating of 3 or more conveys a diagnosis of cancer, then seven positive cases are missed (sensitivity 86%) and eight negative cases are labeled positive (specificity 84%); the AUC is 0.89:The black ROC curve with solid circles describes the following data where test sensitivity is increased to the same level as the red curve but with specificity dropped by a corresponding amount. Assuming a rating of 3 or more conveys a diagnosis of cancer, then just three cases are missed (sensitivity 94%) but 47 negative cases are labelled positive (specificity 6%). The empirical ROC AUC is 0.50 and the "curve" is actually a straight line:

Distribution of confidence scores (data from Fig. 1). Patients with cancer are represented by the dotted line and patients without cancer by the solid line. In this example using a threshold at greater or equal to a confidence rating of 3 provides the best separation between patients with and without cancer and is optimally balanced between sensitivity versus specificity. Moving this boundary to the right or left of the graph corresponds to raising or lowering the diagnostic threshold, respectively. If CT were perfect at discriminating between patient groups, the two distributions would not overlap. The less good a test at discriminating between patients with and without an abnormality, the more the two distributions will overlap

### Newborns' asymmetrical processing of order from sequentially presented magnitudes [^5b8386ef]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1.3 Procedure

All aspects of the stimulus presentation procedure were identical to those used in Experiment 1 and 2 (Figure 2). Newborns were habituated to increasing or decreasing sequences of triangles, squares, and circles, and were then tested with both increasing and decreasing sequences containing newly sized bars (Figure 6). Like in Experiment 1 and 2, the three different habituation stimulus sets were presented in a consistent fixed order (either increasing or decreasing) across trials until newborns met the habituation criterion: from the smallest to the largest shape for the increasing condition (i.e. 5‐15‐45, 7‐21‐63, 10‐30‐90 cm 2) and from the largest to the smallest square for the decreasing condition (i.e. 90‐30‐10, 63‐21‐7, 45‐15‐5 cm 2).

For 27% of all trials, a third observer was involved in coding recorded data offline as the two initial coders' judgments differed by more than 5 s. Intercoder agreement between the two measurements, as assessed by Pearson's correlation on total fixation times on each of the four test trials, was r = 0.96. Statistical analyses were performed on log‐transformed averages of the two closest values for each trial.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^74d28925]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Ventral/incisional hernia — prosthetic sizing to reduce recurrence risk: Generally, the larger the defect is, the more stress will be placed on the fixation points of the prosthetic, and as the size of the prosthetic increases, the prosthetic area: defect area ratio will increase, and the tension on the prosthetic fixation sites will decrease. Since all defects are of different sizes and shapes and in a variety of locations, it is important that surgeons consider the total area encompassing all defects in a patient, rather than basing their prosthetic calculation on the largest or dominant defect; in patients with an incisional hernia from a previous midline incision with multiple hernia defects, it is more useful for choosing the right sized prosthetic to refer to the entire area as a single defect, encompassing the entire gap between the rectus muscles. Table 3 summarizes factors that are associated with choice of prosthetic size when considering recurrence as the primary outcome measure, but since there are few data available directly comparing the long-term outcomes of different prosthetics in humans, no recommendation can be made about a specific prosthetic, and as the defect becomes larger in size, these parameters will be more important in determining recurrence rates.

### Patency of the lenticulostriate and pontine arteries after stenting of the intracranial arteries [^d71c12cf]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The next step is to multiply the green figure area by 4 and introduce the trigonometric function of theangle.

Thus, the area of the part of the ellipse uncovered by the rectangle is as follows:

Obviously, the formula can be used only when the stent strut width is no greater than the perforating artery ostium width, i.e.

In the case of Model 2, the coverage of the perforating artery ostium by two parallel stent struts can be calculated similarly. The area of the ellipse covered by two rectangles amounts to four times the area of dark blue figure minus four times the area of light blue figure. The areas of blue figures are calculated in the same way as the area of the green figure in Model 1. Finally, the formula is as follows:

Again, the formula can be used only when the stent strut width is no greater than half of the perforating artery ostium width, i.e.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^2f33fbd5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Step diagrams for asthma management — Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group; Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years, Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years, and Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older. Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments, and a lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options. In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy. The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams; instead, these options are listed in Table IF, and the guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient management and the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Reveal, don't conceal: transforming data visualization to improve transparency [^e70712b9]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Reports highlighting the problems with the standard practice of using bar graphs to show continuous data have prompted many journals to adopt new visualization policies. These policies encourage authors to avoid bar graphs and use graphics that show the data distribution; however, they provide little guidance on how to effectively display data. We conducted a systematic review of studies published in top peripheral vascular disease journals to determine what types of figures are used, and to assess the prevalence of suboptimal data visualization practices. Among papers with data figures, 47.7% of papers used bar graphs to present continuous data. This primer provides a detailed overview of strategies for addressing this issue by (1) outlining strategies for selecting the correct type of figure depending on the study design, sample size, and the type of variable; (2) examining techniques for making effective dot plots, box plots, and violin plots; and (3) illustrating how to avoid sending mixed messages by aligning the figure structure with the study design and statistical analysis. We also present solutions to other common problems identified in the systematic review. Resources include a list of free tools and templates that authors can use to create more informative figures and an online simulator that illustrates why summary statistics are meaningful only when there are enough data to summarize. Last, we consider steps that investigators can take to improve figures in the scientific literature.

### Objective computerized determination of the minimum cross-sectional area of the nasal passage on computed tomography [^8d66c27f]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Current methods that measure cross-sectional areas of the nasal passage on computed tomography (CT) do not determine the minimum cross-sectional area that may be an important factor in nasal airway resistance. Objective measurement of the dimensions of the nasal passage may help in the diagnosis, as well as the choice and evaluation of surgical treatment for upper airway insufficiencies.

Study Design

Retrospective and clinical study.

Methods

Software was developed that automatically calculates the minimum cross-sectional area of the nasal passage on CT.

Results

Evaluation shows that the minimization algorithm in the software reliably calculates the position and orientation of the oblique plane on which the minimum cross-section lies.

Conclusion

The developed method may be used for objective and observer-independent evaluation of surgical treatment options.

### The use of plots in orthopaedic literature [^95fed5f5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Plots are an elegant and effective way to represent data. At their best they encourage the reader and promote comprehension. A graphical representation can give a far more intuitive feel to the pattern of results in the study than a list of numerical data, or the result of a statistical calculation. The temptation to exaggerate differences or relationships between variables by using broken axes, overlaid axes, or inconsistent scaling between plots should be avoided. A plot should be self-explanatory and not complicated. It should make good use of the available space. The axes should be scaled appropriately and labelled with an appropriate dimension. Plots are recognised statistical methods of presenting data and usually require specialised statistical software to create them. The statistical analysis and methods to generate the plots are as important as the methodology of the study itself. The software, including dates and version numbers, as well as statistical tests should be appropriately referenced. Following some of the guidance provided in this article will enhance a manuscript.

### A short trapezoidal speculum for suprasellar and infrasellar exposure in endonasal transsphenoidal surgery [^91583beb]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

A key limitation of the transsphenoidal approach for suprasellar and infrasellar lesions is restricted exposure. Microscope and endoscope-assisted procedures have traditionally used an oval-shaped speculum, the distal end of which restricts superior and inferior visualization. To improve visualization and use of the endoscope, shorter specula, with a trapezoidal distal end, were designed.

Methods

The new specula have a working length of 60 mm. The proximal 20-mm segment is oval-shaped to conform to the nostril; the middle 20-mm segment has vertically oriented blades; and the distal 20-mm segment transitions to a trapezoidal orientation, with the distal blades angled 15 degrees upward and outward on the suprasellar speculum, or 15 degrees downward and outward on the infrasellar speculum. Both specula have a 5-degree distal outward flare. The upward-angled trapezoidal 60-mm speculum was compared with 70- and 80-mm oval specula in a transsphenoidal clay model. A pen light was projected from the nasal speculum end to a target 100 mm away using a blade opening width of 16 mm. Line drawings were made to quantify the impact of speculum length on the horizontal angle of exposure. The clinical utility of the trapezoidal specula was also assessed.

Results

In the model, the 60-mm upward-angled trapezoidal speculum yielded a surface area illumination of 759 mm, as compared with 579 and 432 mm with the 70-and 80-mm oval specula, an increase in exposure of 31 and 76%, respectively. In the line drawings, the 60-mm speculum provided a horizontal angle of exposure of 30 degrees, as compared with 26 and 23 degrees for the 70- and 80-mm specula, an increase of 17 and 33%, respectively. In patients, provided sufficient mucosa and bone are removed from the posterior nasal cavity, the trapezoidal specula provide an expanded working volume that facilitates endoscopy.

Conclusion

Short upward- or downward-angled trapezoidal endonasal specula increase parasellar surface area exposure and the horizontal angle of exposure. Initial clinical experience suggests that reducing the speculum length and eliminating the distal curved blades result in greater instrument maneuverability and enhanced visibility for removing parasellar tumors.

### The anatomic rationale for transforaminal endoscopic interbody fusion: a cadaveric analysis [^ee8a102f]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The authors describe a cadaveric analysis to determine the ideal dimensions and trajectory for considering endoscopic transforaminal interbody implantation. METHODS The soft tissues of 8 human cadavers were removed from L-1 to the sacrum, exposing the posterior bony elements. Facetectomies were performed bilaterally at each lumbar level with resection of the pars interarticularis, revealing the pedicles, nerve roots, and interbody disc space. Each level was digitally photographed with a marker for scale and evaluated with digital analysis software. The traversing and exiting nerve roots and pedicle margins were identified, and the distances between these structures and their relationships to the surrounding structures were documented. RESULTS The dimensions of 2 areas were measured: the working triangle and safe zone. The working triangle is the triangle between the exiting and traversing nerve roots above the superior margin of the inferior pedicle. The safe zone is the trapezoid bounded by the widths of the superior and inferior pedicles between the exiting and traversing nerve roots. The mean surface area for the working triangle was 1.83 cm(2), with L5-S1 having the largest area at 2.19 cm(2). The mean surface area of the safe zone was 1.19 cm(2), with L5-S1 having the largest area at 1.26 cm(2). At the medial border of the pedicle extending superiorly, there were no nerve structures within 1.19 cm at any level. On the lateral border of the pedicle, the exiting nerve root was closer superiorly, with the closest being 0.3 cm. CONCLUSIONS The working triangle is a relatively large area. The safe zone, just superior to the pedicle, is free of nerve structures. By utilizing the superior border of the pedicle, the disc space can be accessed within this safe zone without risk of injury to the nerves. A thorough understanding of foraminal anatomy is fundamental for considering how to safely access the disc space, thereby utilizing less invasive endoscopic techniques, and is an important first step in considering what shapes and sizes of interbody implants and retractors are feasible for use in the foramen.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Communicating evidence for participatory decision making [^152d13d2]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Informed patients are more likely to actively participate in their care, make wiser decisions, come to a common understanding with their physicians, and adhere more fully to treatment; however, currently there are no evidence-based guidelines for discussing clinical evidence with patients in the process of making medical decisions.

Objective

To identify ways to communicate evidence that improve patient understanding, involvement in decisions, and outcomes.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Systematic review of MEDLINE for the period 1966–2003 and review of reference lists of retrieved articles to identify original research dealing with communication between clinicians and patients and directly addressing methods of presenting clinical evidence to patients.

Data Extraction

Two investigators and a research assistant screened 367 abstracts and 2 investigators reviewed 51 full-text articles, yielding 8 potentially relevant articles.

Data Synthesis

Methods for communicating clinical evidence to patients include nonquantitative general terms, numerical translation of clinical evidence, graphical representations, and decision aids. Focus-group data suggest presenting options and/or equipoise before asking patients about preferred decision-making roles or formats for presenting details. Relative risk reductions may be misleading; absolute risk is preferred. Order of information presented and time-frame of outcomes can bias patient understanding. Limited evidence supports use of human stick figure graphics or faces for single probabilities and vertical bar graphs for comparative information. Less-educated and older patients preferred proportions to percentages and did not appreciate confidence intervals. Studies of decision aids rarely addressed patient-physician communication directly. No studies addressed clinical outcomes of discussions of clinical evidence.

Conclusions

There is a paucity of evidence to guide how physicians can most effectively share clinical evidence with patients facing decisions; however, basing our recommendations largely on related studies and expert opinion, we describe means of accomplishing 5 communication tasks to address in framing and communicating clinical evidence: understanding the patient's (and family members') experience and expectations; building partnership; providing evidence, including a balanced discussion of uncertainties; presenting recommendations informed by clinical judgment and patient preferences; and checking for understanding and agreement.

### Submicron structures provide preferential spots for carbon and nitrogen sequestration in soils [^7ae39d54]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

NanoSIMS images were evaluated using the Open MIMS Image plugin for the ImageJ software. All images were corrected for electron multiplier dead time (44 ns). ROIs were chosen according to the distribution of the 12 C − and 12 C 14 N − secondary ions as an OM indicator. The threshold option of the ImageJ software was used to automatically generate the ROIs for these images. For this, the triangle algorithm was used. The ROIs of the 12 C − and 12 C 14 N − images were combined afterward to obtain the ROIs for the OM distribution. Areas and sums of secondary ion counts for each ROI were extracted from all images. All ROIs with an area greater than 10 pixels were used for further calculations. Mineral particles were selected as ROIs on the basis of 16 O − and 27 Al 16 O − images. For structural analyses, the visible mineral surface areas were divided into clustered particles and individual particles on the basis of the corresponding SEM images.

Data presentation and statistical analysis

Mean values and standard deviations were calculated using Microsoft Excel (2007). IRMS data were statistically analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics (ver. 19.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). For this analysis, the means of three independent replicates were tested using a non-parametric test (U -test) with a significance level of 95%. Figures were prepared and regressions were performed with SigmaPlot software (ver. 11.0, Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany).

### A validated, automated, 3-dimensional method to reliably measure tibial torsion [^0be69db1]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 5.
Cross-sectional area, looking at the axial view from proximal to distal of a range of left-sided distal tibiae. The medial tibia (right side of the image) consistently fits into the shape of an automatically generated ellipse. However, the lateral tibia where the fibula rests is more variable and does not form a consistent shape. Whereas in the left image, the fibular notch forms a second elliptical shape, the center and right images show that this was not consistently the case.

Given the variability of the distal tibial and fibular relationship, and because it is unknown what determines or influences fibular or tibial morphology distally, we decided to base the distal axis on the use of a single ellipse, fitted to the medial border, taking its medial and lateral borders as the points of reference (Figure 6).

Figure 6.
Greatest cross-sectional area of the distal tibia, looking at the axial view from proximal to distal of a left-sided distal tibia. Line 1, the border of the distal slice of the tibia found to have the largest cross-sectional area. Line 2, the automatically generated ellipse fitted to the shape of the medial distal tibia. Line 3, the distal reference line for calculation of tibial torsion generated by the major axis line connecting the widest medial and lateral aspects of the ellipse.

Tibial torsion, therefore, was calculated as the angle between the proximal tibial slice defined above and the distal tibial slice as described when they were overlaid with each other (Figure 7). The slices with the widest diameters proximally and distally were chosen.

Figure 7.
Left image shows the full tibia reconstructed 3-dimensionally with the proximal and distal ellipse outlined. Right image shows determination of tibial torsion taken as the angle between the described proximal (orange ellipse) and distal (yellow ellipse) slices of the tibia.

### Identification and disruption of a neural mechanism for accumulating prospective metacognitive information prior to decision-making [^e35a3e0e]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

Behavioral data

To evaluate performance during the metacognitive judgment stage (Figures 3 B, 6, and 7 C), we employed an analysis based on signal detection theory. Specifically, we classified the metacognitive judgment trials with coherences of 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.25 into those trials in which it was optimal for participants to choose the internal task and into those trials in which it would be optimal to choose the external task. For each participant, if the external probability of reward offered by the external task option was higher than the probability of reward that would be expected given the baseline level of perceptual performance of the internal task option (obtained during the follow-up task), then such trials were categorized as external task optimal trials. If not, they were categorized as the internal task optimal trials. Based on the proportion of trials in which they chose the internal task option when the internal option was optimal (Hit trials) and when the external option was optimal (False alarm [FA] trials), we calculated the area under the ROC curve (type II A ROC). We first plotted points indicating the proportion of 'Hit' trials (Hit rate; y axis) and the proportion of 'FA' trials (FA rate; x axis) separately for trials with coherence levels = 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.25 (see Figure S2 A for a representative participant: the four dots on the line represent the proportion of Hit over FA trials for each of these four coherence levels). Participants chose the internal task option as the coherence of the internal task option increased (see also Figure 3 A). We then connected these points and defined the area under the curve as type-II A ROC. The higher the proportion of hit trials compared to false alarm trials, the more closely type-II A ROC approaches 1. Chance level of type-II A ROC is 0.5.

### Error-correcting dynamics in visual working memory [^e7f2394b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Experiment 1a - humans

For the laboratory version of Experiment 1a we presented stimuli on a CRT monitor positioned at a viewing distance of 60 cm. We calibrated the monitor using an X-Rite i1Display Pro colorimeter to ensure accurate color rendering. During the experiment, participants were asked to remember the color and spatial location of either 1 or 3 square sample stimuli. The color of each sample was drawn from 360 evenly spaced points along an isoluminant circle in CIELAB color space. This circle was centered at (L = 60, a = 22, b = 14) and the radius was 52 units. Colors were drawn pseudorandomly, with the caveat that colors presented on the same trial had to be at least 22° apart in color space. The samples measured 2° of visual angle (DVA) on each side. Each sample could appear at one of eight possible spatial locations. All possible locations had an eccentricity of 4.5 DVA and were positioned at equally spaced angles relative to central fixation (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180° clockwise and counterclockwise relative to the vertical meridian). The dimensions of the stimuli for the online experiment were defined by pixels rather than degrees of of visual angle. The samples had an edge length of 30 pixels and were presented at an eccentricity of 170 pixels.

### The pararectus approach in acetabular surgery: radiological and clinical outcome [^782cb5e6]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Measurement Parameters

To analyze fracture reduction, the joint step and joint gap were measured in preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. Therefore, a fracture-specific 3D reconstruction including the weight-bearing region of the acetabulum was performed in each case. The joint gap was measured in a circular area which correlated with the largest circumference of the femoral head (Fig. 2). The middle of the circle was formed by the tip of the acetabular dome. The measurement of the joint step was performed in the transversal plane and was defined to be the largest dehiscence in a 90 degrees angular position in relation to the main fracture line (Fig. 3).

FIGURE 2.
Measurement of the hip head diameter in the transversal plane in the CT scan.

FIGURE 3.
Measurement of the largest joint gap at the tip of the acetabular dome in the transversal plane of the CT scan within a circle with the size of the hip head diameter.

In 11 cases of the P-group and in 3 cases of the I-group, the preoperative step had to be measured outside the previously described circle because fracture dehiscence was larger than the circle and therefore located outside the circumference. Starting from the tip of the acetabular dome, the largest step was measured in CT scans and recorded for further analysis. The joint step was measured in the coronal and sagittal planes: In the sagittal plane until 60 degrees to the dorsal side and until 45 degrees to the frontal side (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 3,), and in the coronal plane completely to the lateral side and until 45 degrees to the medial side (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 4). Angles were measured related to a straight line through the tip of the acetabular dome that had a 90 degrees angle to a straight line through both tips of the acetabular domes. Those areas scanned for the largest step are corresponding to the main weight-bearing area of the acetabulum as indicated elsewhere.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical data analysis for preoperative and postoperative CT measurements and duration of surgery was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Testing for normality was performed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Because normal distribution of each measurement parameter was not confirmed for both groups, the Mann–Whitney test was used for between-group comparisons. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.

### Ray-optics cloaking devices for large objects in incoherent natural light [^f23c3eef]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Experimental characterization of the aquatic cloak

Using the simplified sixfold cloaking design, we first construct a cloak hiding a fish in an aquatic environment using widely available optical glass. The cloak is constructed with six isosceles triangles of air with a refractive index of n 2 = 1 and six isosceles triangles of glass with a refractive index of n 1 = 1.78, as shown in Fig. 2a. The angle at the apex of the isosceles triangle of glass is α = 13°, and the angle at the apex of the isosceles triangle of air is β = α +60°. The central hexagon area is the hidden region. The cloak has an outer radius of r 2 = 60 mm, an inner radius of r 1 = 11.4 mm and a height of h = 50 mm. Analytical calculations show that the optical path length of the rays travelling through the cloak is 0.02 m shorter than the optical path length of those passing by the cloak. Figure 2b shows the experimental set-up in which a cloak is immersed in a fish tank filled with water with a refractive index of n b = 1.33; the tank serves as a living environment for a goldfish. In the cloak fabrication, the outer shell of the cloak is constructed by gluing together thin glass pieces (with a thickness of 2 mm), a technique that is used to separate the background medium from the air space inside the cloak. Some green grass behind the cloak is used as background scenery to verify the performance of the cloak, and also to provide oxygen for the fish. A camera placed in front of the tank records the dynamic scene from the front observation angle.

Figure 3a–d shows the dynamic process of the goldfish swimming from inside the cloak to the external aquatic environment. When swimming inside the cloak, the goldfish becomes invisible and does not block the scene of green plants behind the cloak. The edges of the transparent container are still visible because of some glue residue left at the edges of this homemade container. This cloak works for six different incident directions.

### Practical guide to choosing an appropriate data display [^63bd2040]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The primary objective of graphing research data is to communicate key information visually in a rapid, accurate, and concise way. Graphs might be considered visual take-home lessons of the major point(s) of the manuscript. In choosing a graph, it is tempting to concentrate only on ways of illustrating summary statements characterizing the group(s). However, individual patients are unique, and their characteristics or outcomes may not be predicted by a group summary. Consequently, if possible, graphs should demonstrate individual responses as well as group summaries. "Graphical literacy", "graphical excellence", and "graphical acumen" are achievable with work and collaboration. To produce a well-designed graph, a combination of by-subject detail and overall results should be the goal within the same illustration. The practice gap addressed in this article is that little attention from authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers seems to be paid to graphical literacy. The purpose of this article is to present some practical guidelines for choosing or evaluating more appropriate data displays.

### Comparison between spectral-domain and swept-source OCT angiography scans for the measurement of hyperreflective foci in age-related macular degeneration [^de01dda0]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

In contrast, Figure 4, Figure 5 show examples of eyes with relatively larger differences between the measured areas on SS-OCTA and SD-OCTA images. The case in Figure 4 corresponds to the one identified by the blue asterisk in the Bland–Altman plot (Fig 1 B) and shows the eye with the largest area difference in favor of the SS-OCTA image. In this example, the sqrt total HRF area measured 0.43 mm (total area = 0.19 mm 2) on the SS-OCTA image, while on the SD-OCTA image it measured 0.32 mm (total area = 0.10 mm 2). Figure 5 shows the eye with the largest area difference in favor of the SD-OCTA image, which corresponds to the datapoint identified by the magenta asterisk in the Bland–Altman plot (Fig 1 B). In this example, the sqrt total HRF area measured on the SS-OCTA image was 0.65 mm (total area = 0.42 mm 2) compared with 0.80 mm (total area = 0.63 mm 2) on the SD-OCTA image.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^6a46fa06]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views," with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line," and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour." Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions," with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened," "Endocardial dropout," and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes." For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion," with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened," "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions," and "Limited published data on normal population."

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

### Synchronization of visual perception within the human fovea [^5a7188eb]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

Modeling RGC axonal density across the retina

The model specified the pathways of RGC axons from their soma of origin to the optic disc. It did not specify how many RGC somas were present at each retinal location. We modeled the RGC soma density using the following function:where ρ RGC was the RGC density at a distance D fov from the center of the fovea; ρ min and ρ max were the minimal and maximal RGC densities across the retina, respectively; τ was a spatial scaling parameter; and r fov was the radius of the umbo, the area in the center of the fovea devoid of RGCs. To reflect the human RGC density, we set the parameters to ρ min = 1,500 RGCs per mm 2, ρ max = 50,000 RGCs per mm 2, τ = 1.43 and r fov = 0.2 mm. We then applied Delaunay triangulation to overlay the model retina with 167,000 triangles of approximately equal size. We determined the count of RGC somas within each triangle by integrating equation (3) across the triangle surface. Subsequently, the model enabled us to estimate, for each triangle, the axonal pathway connecting the triangle's centroid to the optic disc. Thus, each of the 167,000 axonal pathways was linked to a certain number of RGC axons, which followed this pathway closely. To ascertain the quantity of axons traversing between two closely spaced points on the retina, designated as A and B, we identified the field lines crossing the line connecting A and B and summed up the corresponding RGC axon counts.

Calculating RGC axonal lengths at the TEM sampling locations

For each of the locations at which we measured axon diameters using TEM, we calculated the length of the axons passing through this location by using our model. To this end, we divided the retina into small triangles. We assigned the average RGC density within its area to each triangle. We then calculated three streamlines from random locations within each triangle to the optic disc, which resulted in ~170k streamlines. For each TEM location, we calculated which streamline passed the location within a 100 µm radius. We then weighted each streamline with the RGC density of its triangle of origin and calculated its length. To calculate the number of RGCs of a specific length that passed the TEM location, we computed a weighted histogram over length, taking into account the RGC density of each streamline (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

### Border ownership from intracortical interactions in visual area v2 [^14d9dcef]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

A border between two image regions normally belongs to only one of the regions; determining which one it belongs to is essential for surface perception and figure-ground segmentation. Border ownership is signaled by a class of V2 neurons, even though its value depends on information coming from well outside their classical receptive fields. I use a model of V2 to show that this visual area is able to generate the ownership signal by itself, without requiring any top-down mechanism or external explicit labels for figures, T junctions, or corners. In the model, neurons have spatially local classical receptive fields, are tuned to orientation, and receive information (from V1) about the location and orientation of borders. Border ownership signals that model physiological observations arise through finite range, intraareal interactions. Additional effects from surface features and attention are discussed. The model licenses testable predictions.

### Basic mapping principles for visualizing cancer data using geographic information systems (GIS) [^636f342e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Maps and other data graphics may play a role in generating ideas and hypotheses at the beginning of a project. They are useful as part of analyses for evaluating model results and then at the end of a project when researchers present their results and conclusions to varied audiences, such as their local research group, decision makers, or a concerned public. Cancer researchers are gaining skill with geographic information system (GIS) mapping as one of their many tools and are broadening the symbolization approaches they use for investigating and illustrating their data. A single map is one of many possible representations of the data, so making multiple maps is often part of a complete mapping effort. Symbol types, color choices, and data classing each affect the information revealed by a map and are best tailored to the specific characteristics of data. Related data can be examined in series with coordinated classing and can also be compared using multivariate symbols that build on the basic rules of symbol design. Informative legend wording and setting suitable map projections are also basic to skilled mapmaking.

### Optimal policy for value-based decision-making [^bca8115a]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Optimal decisions with collapsing boundaries, and by diffusion models. A consequence of parallel decision boundaries is that optimal choices can be performed by tracking only the difference in expected option rewards, rather than bothandindependently. To see this, consider rotating these boundaries in-space by −45° such that they come to be parallel to the horizontal axis in the new-space (Fig. 4a, b). After the rotation they boundand are independent of.

For Gaussian a priori rewards (Fig. 2a), numerical solutions reveal that the distance between the two boundaries decreases over time, resulting in 'collapsing boundaries' (Fig. 4c) that can be explained as follows. In the beginning of the decision, the true option rewards are highly uncertain due to a lack of information. Hence, every small piece of additional evidence will make the running reward estimates substantially more certain. This makes it worth to withhold decisions by far-separated decision boundaries (Fig. 4c for small t). Once a significant amount of evidence is accumulated, further evidence will barely increase certainty about the true rewards. Thus, it becomes more preferable to decide quickly rather than to withhold choice for an insignificant increase in choice accuracy (even for similar reward estimates, and residual uncertainty about which option yields the higher reward). The narrowing boundary separation ensures such rapid decisions (Fig. 4c for large t).

We can further simplify the optimal decision procedure by implementing the computation of the expected option reward difference by a diffusion model. As long as, such an implementation remains statistically optimal, as the diffusing particle, x (t)≡ x 1 (t)− x 2 (t), (recall that) and elapsed time t form a set of sufficient statistics of the posterior r 1 (t)− r 2 (t)| δ x (0: t) over this difference (see Methods section). Furthermore, x j (t) can be interpreted as the sample path of a particle that diffuses with variance σ 2 and drifts with rate z j. For this reason, x (t) diffuses with variance 2 σ 2 and drifts with rate z 1 − z 2, thus forming the particle in a diffusion model that performs statistically optimal inference. The same mapping between expected reward difference and diffusing particle allows us to map the optimal boundary on reward into boundaries on x (t) (Fig. 4c, d). Therefore, models as simple as diffusion models can implement optimal value-based decision-making.

### Confidence bounds when the estimated ROC area is 1.01 [^28dc467d]. Academic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In studies with small samples, the authors often encounter data sets in which the estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 1.0. In such cases, neither asymptotic nor resampling methods provide a means of estimating the standard error or constructing a lower confidence bound. The purpose of this study was to develop tables for determining the approximate 95% lower confidence bound when the estimated ROC area is 1.0.

Materials and Methods

Using Monte Carlo simulation, the authors generated 10,000 data sets for each specification of sample sizes, ROC curve shape, and data format (continuous and ordinal scale). For each of these combinations the authors determined the 95% lower confidence bound.

Results

When the estimated ROC area is 1.0, the 95% lower confidence bounds differ dramatically depending on the shape of the ROC curve and on whether the test results are ordinal or continuous. Four tables of 95% lower confidence bounds are provided, along with guidelines for their use.

Conclusion

Given the different shapes of ROC curves and the different formats in which ROC data are collected, it is not feasible to offer one simple method of constructing confidence bounds that works for all ROC curves. The tables provided in this article are useful for interpreting studies with estimated ROC areas of 1.0.

### Combined petrosal intertentorial approach: a cadaveric study of comparison with the standard combined petrosectomy [^ce03966a]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical Freedom

Surgical freedom was defined as the maximal permissible working area allowed by the most superficial surgical opening (dura mater or bone). The 6 extreme most positions in each direction were measured, forming an imaginary hexagonal area (Figure 5 C cadaveric picture for CPIA). Similarly to the skull base and brainstem exposure calculations, the coordinates of each of the positions were obtained using neuronavigation, and the area of surgical freedom was calculated by the sum of the areas formed by juxtaposed triangles.

Angles of Attack

The angles of attack were obtained by fixing the distal end of the dissector on each anatomic target. The targets of interest were the oculomotor foramen (OF), MC, Dorello canal, and the REZ of CN VII (Figure 5 D).

The angle was calculated using the Law of Cosines applied on the triangle created by the distal point (ie, the anatomic target) and 2 farthest positions of the proximal end of the dissector that were the limiting points of movement in the vertical or horizontal planes.

Statistical Analysis

Data were exported to Stata Statistical Software (release 14, StataCorp). Comparisons of the area of exposure, surgical freedom, and angles of attack were performed using a one-way repeated measure analysis of variance with post hoc Holm-Šídák analysis. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

### Tetris-inspired detector with neural network for radiation mapping [^5ccb314f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Figure 3 b–j shows the dynamical process of radiation mapping and position determination using the S-shaped detector. The detector geometry is the same as before, and the radius of motion is chosen randomly distributed from 0.5 m to 5 m. Figure 3 b–d shows the inferred radiation mappings at three different timestamps t = 10, 30, 60 s at the beginning, half-circle, and close to the end of the circular motion. The ground-truth location of the radiation source is shown as the black cross in all three figures. At the early t = 10 s, there is not sufficient information for MAP to estimate the radiation position, and the estimation (red lines in Fig. 3 b) has a ray shape that acts more like directional mapping. After 30 s, the MAP estimation is improved, though the estimated radiation is located at a broader spatial area rather than the ground truth. Finally, the detector could complete the mapping process with sufficient accuracy to point out the position of the radiation source (Fig. 3 d). The detector's readouts and the predicted directions at each timestamp (t = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 s) are illustrated as Fig. 3 e–j. The detailed results with other Tetris-inspired detectors are shown in Supplementary Note 4. Figures S9 – S11 present the moving detector and radiation mapping using the detectors of 2 × 2 square, J-shape and T-shape, respectively. Supplementary Movies 2–4 visualize these mapping processes at each timestamp. The actual and predicted relative angle are plotted throughout the observed time in Fig. S12.

When performing a realistic radiation mapping, the area of interest may contain multiple radiation sources, which increases the level of difficulties of radiation mapping. To tackle this challenge, we further study the radiation distribution map, which includes multiple radiation sources (Fig. 4). We can see good agreement can be achieved for two radiation sources. However, we would like to point out that more detector pixels such as 10 × 10 (Fig. 4 a) or 5 × 5 (Fig. 4 b) grids are used since the 2 × 2 square-grid detector does not show adequate performance unless the restriction of fixed distances between the detector and the radiation sources, as shown in Fig. S6. Figures S13 and S14 in Supplementary Note 5 present the intermediate process of radiation mapping with the square detectors of 10 × 10 and 5 × 5 configurations, respectively.

### Quantification of the magnification and distortion effects of a pediatric flexible video-bronchoscope [^d7b5246b]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Photographic Object: A square of graph paper 3 cms × 3 cms with 1 mm × 1 mm units and concentric circles of varying diameter (2 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm) and diameter markings (AE, BF, CG, DH) all generated by Auto CAD.

Figure 2
The end view of the tip of the Olympus BF Type 3160 bronchoscope displaying the "off set" lens and lights and the geometric centre.

Magnification was calculated by repeatedly measuring the image diameters AE, BF, CG, DH across the 4 concentric circles (Fig. 1) at distances of 100, 80, 60, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 and 3 mm and then dividing these measurements by the corresponding value of the object. These magnification measurements were repeated in 3 separate experiments and the mean value for all of the diameters of that particular circle at that particular distance was taken as the final magnification for that circle at that distance. Between the distances of 100 mm and 40 mm the calculations of the inner circle were incomplete or impossible because of the effects of the light spot obscuring the object (Fig. 3a). Similarly as the lens approached very close to the object (5 mm to 3 mm) the outer circles became incomplete or outside the field of view (Fig. 3b).

Figure 3
Effects of distance from object on the image appearance within the Field of View (FOV) and Light intensity obscuring parts of the image. Note the barrel appearance of the graph paper at the periphery in image "A" while in image "C" these effects are clearly offset or asymmetrical.

Geometrical distortion was defined as the radial length ratios from each interlocking circle with radii A taken as the denominator for all subsequent radial measurements within the outer circle and then other elements of radius A for the other circles. The uniformity of the ratios was then tested in quadrant or sectors: a sector or quadrant being an area defined in accordance with mathematical convention whereby sector 1 is the NNE sector and sector 2 is NNW continuing in a anticlockwise direction for sectors 3 and 4. The comparisons were as follows: sector 1 with sector 3; sector 2 with sector 4 or the diagonal sectors with their respective opposites. This provided an understanding of the homogeneity of the distortion profile or geometrical distortion and also gives reference to curvilinear distortion.

### The zombie plot: a simple graphic method for visualizing the efficacy of a diagnostic test [^d842ae60]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

One of the most important jobs of a radiologist is to pick the most appropriate imaging test for a particular clinical situation. Making a proper selection sometimes requires statistical analysis. The objective of this article is to introduce a simple graphic technique, an ROC plot that has been divided into zones of mostly bad imaging efficacy (ZOMBIE, hereafter referred to as the "zombie plot"), that transforms information about imaging efficacy from the numeric domain into the visual domain.

Conclusion

If 2 injections will be performed, then the second injection should be at least 1 inch away from the first injection.

Choose Injection Site

Figure H

Do not inject into areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, or have scars or stretch marks.

Important:

You should select a different injection site each time you give yourself an injection.

If you want to use the same injection site for a dose requiring 2 injections, make sure the second injection site is at least 1 inch away from the first injection site.

Step 3B: Clean the injection site using a new alcohol swab (Figure I).

Allow site to dry for 5–10 seconds to avoid stinging.

If giving 2 injections, then the distance between the 2 injection sites should be at least 1 inch apart.

Step 4 –Inject medication

Step 4A: Remove the prepared syringe and needle from the vial.

Step 4B: With your other hand, pinch the skin around the injection site to create a firm surface (Figure J).

Important: Keep skin pinched while inserting the needle.

Step 4C: Insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle (Figure K)

When the needle is inserted, you can release the pinched skin.

Do not hold or push on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin.

### Four-dimensional computed tomography analysis of bicuspid aortic valves [^fa5c9992]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

The software allows calculation of geometric features, including 3D and projected 2D parameters. To calculate the AA area in 3D, triangles were formed between 2 consecutive points on the spline in 3D, delineating the border of the annulus and the AA centroid of the 18 seed points. The AA area was then calculated as the sum of each triangle's area. The perimeter was estimated as the length of the interpolated spline in 3D. For 2D measurements, a best-fit plane was adjusted to the 18 seed points of each time phase using a principal component analysis approach. AA area was estimated in 2D, projecting the spline points into the best-fit plane. The height of the annulus was estimated as the sum of distances of the farthest points on the 3D spline describing the AA below and above the best-fit plane. The longest distance between each pair of opposite points around the TA was adopted as the maximal diameter value, and the distance between the pair of points orthogonal to the maximal diameter was called orthogonal to maximal diameter. The eccentricity index was calculated using the following formula:

Statistical Analysis

Analyses were done using SPSS 26.0 (IBM). Continuous variables were reported as mean ± SD, and their normality of distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparisons between 3D and 2D areas, perimeters, and diameters were performed using the 2-tailed t test. Comparisons for categorical data were performed using the χ 2 test. Statistical significance between parameters was defined as P < .05.

The decision tree for odontoid type I/III fractures similarly identified age as the most important determinant for surgery (figure 4). Patients > 85 years were rarely estimated to have surgery (< 4%). A displaced odontoid type II fracture and a cervical subluxation were the two remaining determinants of surgical management. The estimated surgery rate was 13.7% for patients ≤ 85 years old, increased slightly to 16.3% if the fracture was displaced, and was 46.7% if there was also cervical subluxation.

Figure 4
Decision tree for operative intervention of odontoid type I/III fractures. Shading indicates largest (darkest) to smallest (lightest, < 5% of total N) patient group size. Misclassification rate = 10.5%, area receiver operating characteristic = 0.68.

The decision tree for non-odontoid fractures had more nodes, but many of these nodes had small patient groups sizes of < 5% of the total sample (figure 5). The presence of cervical subluxation was the most important determinant for surgery of non-odontoid fractures, although only 10% of patients had cervical subluxation with an estimated rate of surgery of 13.7%. Among patients without cervical subluxation (90% of patients), determinants of surgery were cervical ligament sprain and age. The estimated rate of surgery was 8.8% in patients without a cervical ligament sprain and 29.7% for patients with cervical ligament sprain who were ≤ 80 years old. A displaced fracture was not a consideration for surgery in this fracture diagnosis.

### Dandelion pappus morphing is actuated by radially patterned material swelling [^11f46d03]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

For local expansion rates, a Delaunay triangulation was mapped onto the landmarks of the dry state samples using R package deldir. Triangles that were not fully enclosed by the overall outline of the dry sample were excluded. The area of each triangle was calculated and normalized area change calculated by dividing the area of a triangle when wet by its area when dry. The data were smoothed by calculating the arithmetic mean of the normalized area change for each triangle and its adjoining neighbouring triangles. Principal orientations of strain were calculated for each triangle and annotated as a cross scaled to 3 times larger than the original values for improved visibility.

Regions of the apical plate were designated by manually outlining the floral podium, vasculature, side regions and central cavity on the original images using the Fiji polygon tool. Triangles in the dry state that overlapped at least 40% with any of the dry state regions were assigned to those regions and all others were designated as cortex triangles. Mean area changes were calculated for each region for each sample and these values used to generate boxplots and for statistical analysis.

For a very small number of triangles the nonuniform expansion process rearranged nearby landmarks relative to one another such that triangles then appeared to overlap in the wet state. As it is not physically possible for cells to actually overlap in a connected cellular structure, these triangles were omitted from the analysis and comparisons between regions.

Geometrical measurements of the apical plate were obtained from images and used as inputs for the computational model. Measurements of the sizes and geometry of regions were taken from the wet-state confocal images of apical plate half-sections using Fiji. For some parameters such as the vascular displacement (d vasc) and holding angle (θ), measurements were taken from consistent points on the dry and wet images and differences calculated. For region density measurements, 10 μm sections stained with ruthenium red gave consistent red staining across all cell types. These images were thresholded using the automatic colour thresholding in Fiji, converted to a binary image and the ratio of stained to unstained pixels used to calculate the density of cell wall material in manually selected rectangular areas of each region.

Annual cholera cases in sub-Saharan Africa averted as a function of the number of people targeted with an ideal intervention or mix of interventions

The optimum grid cell targeting curve (blue) represents a strategy targeting all 20 km × 20 km grid cells in rank order by number of cases. The optimum district targeting curve (red) represents a strategy targeting all districts in rank order by number of cases regardless of country. The green curve represents a more realistic and practical strategy that targets all high-risk districts in each country at once, with countries ranked by the number of cases prevented. Lines are the mean values and shading shows the 95% credible intervals. Strategies targeting grid cells or districts by ranked incidence instead of number of cases are presented in the appendix.

In practice, targeting the high-incidence areas irrespective of geography, population size, accessibility, or other factors is probably not feasible because of logistical challenges. A more practical strategy might be to prioritise countries on the basis of the number of cases that could be averted if all high-incidence districts in the country were targeted, then launch country-specific programmes aimed at those districts. Using this approach, 38·4% of cholera cases could be prevented by covering 50·8 million people (95% CrI 39·7 million to 62·8 million) in five countries: Somalia, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and Ghana (figure 3).

### Graphics and statistics for cardiology: designing effective tables for presentation and publication [^69ab87cd]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Research is of little use if its results are not effectively communicated. Data visualised in tables (and graphs) are key components in any scientific report, but their design leaves much to be desired. This article focuses on table design, following two general principles: clear vision and clear understanding. Clear vision is achieved by maximising the signal to noise ratio. In a table, the signal is the data in the form of numbers, and the noise is the support structure necessary to interpret the numbers. Clear understanding is achieved when the story in the data is told effectively, through organisation of the data and use of text. These principles are illustrated by original and improved tables from recent publications. Two special cases are discussed separately: tables produced by the pharmaceutical industry (in clinical study reports and reports to data safety monitoring boards), and study flow diagrams as proposed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses initiatives.

### Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids [^98dda885]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Hedgehog topological defects and 3D polymer glass model

Given the large variety of topological defects that can be defined within a three-dimensional vector field (point defects, line defects, and surface defects), we suggest that hedgehog topological defects (HTD) are the simplest choice to start with. We adapt the definition of HTDs from nematic liquid crystals – and Heisenberg magnets – to the eigenvector and displacement fields of a 3D simulation glass.

For a 3D unit vector fieldwe define the hedgehog topological charge as in refs. –, where Σ is an arbitrary closed 2D surface parametrized by coordinates (x 1, x 2). Q represents a topological invariant in the sense that it does not change under continuous and smooth deformations of the manifold. We notice that whenever the system is invariant under the parity transformation(e.g. nematic liquid crystals), then the sign of the topological charge Q is ambiguous and hence not physical.

We implement the concept of 3D point defect on a lattice following the methods in refs. From our simulations, we first obtain the unit vector fieldat each lattice grid point (l, m, n) in a simple cubic lattice. More details are provided in the "Methods" section. Let, andbe the unit vectors of the field associated with one face of the cube, where, andare positioned at the corners of triangle i on that face, chosen such that the sequence 1 − 2 − 3 − 1 corresponds to a counterclockwise rotation along the outward normal to the surface of the triangle. See Fig. 1a for a representation of these vectors on the example of a radially outgoing field (monopole). The topological charge Q enclosed by the unit cube is then expressed in a discrete fashion as refs.where the sum is carried over all 6 vertices of the unit cube and x * is the vertex associated with the four vectors, and(as shown in Fig. 1a). Here, q (x *) is expressed aswhereis the signed area of the spherical (non-Euclidean) triangles with corners, and. The sign of the area can be calculated as. Finally, the value of A is calculated as, A visual representation of this algorithm for the case of hedgehog defects with charges Q = ± 1 (monopole and anti-monopole) is presented in Fig. 1a–d.

Pediatric transthoracic echocardiography — area and length-based LV measurements include end-diastolic area (EDA) obtained in 2DE: parasternal short-axis or subcostal sagittal (short-axis) view at maximum area at end-diastole for LV size; EDA is used for LV volume and mass calculation and is appropriate for abnormal LV shape but depends on good blood-endocardium border. End-systolic area (ESA) uses minimum area at end-systole and is used for LV volume calculation and is appropriate for abnormal LV shape. End-diastolic length (EDL) uses 2DE: apical four-chamber or subcostal coronal (long-axis) view and is measured just after MV closure at end-diastole; it is used for LV volume and mass calculation and is appropriate for abnormal LV shape, but depends on good blood-endocardium border, especially at apex, and foreshortening can limit accuracy.

### J-shapedness: an often missed, often miscalculated relation: the example of weight and mortality [^9e991138]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

We present three considerations in analysing the association between weight and mortality, as well as other relations that might be non-linear in nature. First, authors must graphically plot their independent and dependent variables in a continuous manner. Second, authors should assess the shape of that relation, and note its shape. If it is non-linear, and specifically, J-shaped or U-shaped, careful consideration should be given to using the 'best' statistical model, of which multivariate fractional polynomial regression is a reasonable choice. Authors should also refrain from truncating their data to avoid dealing with non-linear relations.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Mapping global urban land for the 21st century with data-driven simulations and shared socioeconomic pathways [^29cbc983]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Regional variations

At the regional level, we find that all world regions, not just developing regions, can experience more than 4.5-fold urban land expansion in the high urbanization scenario (SSP 5) by 2100 (Supplementary Table 1). Under the middle of the road scenario, urban land in Europe (excluding Russia, which is a separate region in this analysis due to its large land area) is projected to expand by more than 275 thousand km 2, more than outpacing Africa's increase of about 193 thousand km 2. These projections result from an often overlooked pattern in observed land change trends: economically developed regions have not stopped building new urban land. For example, according to our own analysis of time series observational data, during the decade of 2000–2010, more than 15 thousand km 2 of new urban land was built in Europe (excluding Russia), and 17 thousand km 2 in Africa. These similar amounts of urban land development occurred despite the fact that in 2000, Europe already had more than 144 thousand km 2 urban land (with about 0.6 billion people), while Africa had only about 46 thousand km 2 urban land (with about 0.7 billion people). Many European countries have been consistently expanding urban land areas after their population growth has stopped. Although the change rate in percentage terms is much lower than what is seen in Africa and Asia, the absolute amount of new urban land development is substantial, reflecting the much larger amount of existing urban land in the developed world. This observed trend led to the result that, depending on societal trends and choices, a large amount of new urban land might be built in the developed world during the 21st century (Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. 2). Two dynamics observed in the recent past may help explain such urban expansion patterns. First, even in the regions and countries whose total population size decreased, their urban population size continued to grow. Over the 21st century, we expect to see more population concentrate in urban areas globally, and new urban land will be built to support this change. Second, though functional types of urban land are not explicitly distinguished in this work, a sizable fraction of urban land development globally is non-residential, e.g. built-up land used for industrial, commercial, and institutional purposes. These developments do not necessarily scale with population size, and might be driven by shifts in economy, governance, livelihood, culture, and lifestyle as urbanization matures –. Although these abstract factors are not explicitly modeled, their effects may be represented in empirical models through implicit relations with measurable variables (e.g. GDP, urban population share). Such relations, if present during historical times, are likely to continue affecting urban land development after population size stabilizes.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^eca48f27]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Guidance on community viral load: a family of measures, definitions, and method for calculation [^33678436]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 — decision tree for conducting viral load analyses using 2009 data directs sequential checks and analysis pathways. The process starts with "Are there regulations in place to support receipt of all viral load (VL) results, including undetectable levels?"; if "NO" the path indicates "stop," whereas "YES" or "NO, but received" proceeds to "Do ≥ 90% labs in your jurisdiction report VLs?" with "NO" leading to "stop." If "YES," the next step is "Has your jurisdiction completed death ascertainment and deduplication (intra- and interstate) for cases diagnosed through 2009?" where "NO" leads to "stop" and "YES" defines the "Living population to include" "Jurisdictional case" and "Residential case." The algorithm then asks "Do at least 75% have a VL result in 2009?"; if "NO," conduct "MONITORED VIRAL LOAD analyses" including "Categorical measures" and "Other site-specific categories," and if "YES," determine "Are supplemental† data collected?" with "NO" leading to "IN-CARE VIRAL LOAD" and "YES" to "COMMUNITY VIRAL LOAD." A separate "GEOGRAPHIC analyses" branch checks "Are complete and current addresses available?" with "NO" to "stop" and "YES" to "Proceed with spatial VL/social determinants analysis." Footnotes specify "diagnosed in jurisdiction and current resident (or no evidence moved out) of jurisdiction," "current resident of jurisdiction (in-migration) but diagnosed outside jurisdiction," and that supplemental data are "from chart abstraction such as in HIV care, use of antiretroviral agents, etc."

### Introduction to clinical decision making [^9046941c]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In the last few years there has been a remarkable increase in the amount of clinical data in the average hospital chart, and more and more problem-solving algorithms have been developed. We need better "thinking tools" to help us handle the flow of information. The term "clinical decision making" is used to describe a systematic way to handle data and algorithms to decide on a best course of action. This introductory article discusses some of the problems in establishing a decision criterion, both for a population and for an individual patient. Comparing the probabilities and utilities of various diagnostic outcomes (true positive, false positive, etc.) leads to a diagnostic strategy. The article also discusses conditional probability. Bayes' theorem, and likelihood ratios.

### Diagnostic utility of allergy tests to predict baked egg and lightly cooked egg allergies compared to double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges [^4e80bd98]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2 Basophil activation test and specific IgE to egg white are the best tests to predict the outcome of baked egg and lightly cooked egg challenges

The results of tests were compared between BE allergic and BE tolerant children (Figure 2; Table S4). The diagnostic performance of the various tests was determined in relation to the gold‐standard OFC. Among SPT, SPT to EW extract had the largest area under the ROC curve but was not statistically significantly different from SPT to raw egg or the BE slurry (Figure S2). Although the performance was similar, the diagnostic cut‐offs for SPT to raw egg were higher than the one for SPT to EW. We also assessed the diagnostic performance of the difference and the ratio between the results of SPT to EW and SPT to raw egg; however, neither the difference nor the ratio of SPT to EW and raw egg seemed useful (Figure S3). SIgE to EW had a larger area under the ROC than sIgE to ovalbumin or ovomucoid (Figure S4). In terms of BAT, 16 (10.8%) patients had non‐responder basophils. The stimulant that provided the largest area under the ROC curve for BAT was egg extract at 10 or 100 ng/mL using the activation marker CD63 (Figure S5). Figure 3 shows the ROC curve for the best test for each test modality, namely BAT to egg, specific IgE to EW and SPT to EW. BAT to egg and sIgE to EW were the tests with the best performance, both for BE and LCE allergies. All of the above‐mentioned ROC curves had AUC in agreement to resampling and simulation estimates pointing out for internal validity of our results.
