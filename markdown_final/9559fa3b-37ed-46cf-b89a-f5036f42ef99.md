## Question

What is the heparin dosing for treatment of DVT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about heparin dosing for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and guideline-based first-line choices. Then, I should verify the weight-based intravenous unfractionated heparin regimen and its monitoring. Next, I will examine subcutaneous unfractionated heparin options, including weight-adjusted and fixed-dose strategies. After that, I need to check low-molecular-weight heparin dosing and its advantages. I will then review special populations and scenarios such as renal impairment, obesity, pregnancy, and thrombolysis. Finally, I should confirm transition strategies, duration of therapy, and a concise dosing summary with caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and hierarchy of options. For acute DVT, contemporary guidelines prefer direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists for initial treatment, with LMWH reserved for specific contexts such as cancer, pregnancy, or severe renal impairment; UFH is typically reserved for inpatient use, hemodynamic instability, or when rapid reversibility is needed, so I need to ensure I frame UFH/LMWH dosing within that broader pathway before diving into specifics [^116KC85Q] [^116ceJ2x] [^111J5MhN].

> Now, I will examine intravenous unfractionated heparin dosing. The standard weight-based regimen is an 80 units/kg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hour, with aPTT monitoring every 6 hours initially and titration to a therapeutic aPTT range that corresponds to anti-Xa activity of 0.3–0.7 IU/mL. Wait, let me verify the caps and alternatives, because some sources list a fixed 5,000-unit bolus and 1,000 units/hour as an acceptable alternative, though weight-based dosing achieves therapeutic levels faster and is associated with lower recurrence in some studies, so I should emphasize weight-based dosing as preferred when feasible [^114UZm63] [^111kBnyQ] [^111swaBM] [^111LGyQc].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence and targets. Typically, aPTT is checked 6 hours after any dose change until stable, with a therapeutic aPTT commonly defined as 46–70 seconds in institutional nomograms mapping to anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 IU/mL. I need to ensure I note that some centers use anti-Xa assays for UFH when aPTT is unreliable, though evidence linking routine anti-Xa monitoring to improved outcomes is limited, so I should not overstate its routine utility [^111kBnyQ] [^116nSAFJ].

> Next, I should review subcutaneous unfractionated heparin options. A weight-adjusted regimen of 333 units/kg subcutaneously as the initial dose, then 250 units/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours without routine aPTT monitoring, has been studied and suggested for selected outpatients; wait, let me double-check the monitoring claim — some guidance still recommends periodic aPTT checks early on, so I should qualify that many programs use unmonitored weight-adjusted SC UFH while acknowledging institutional variability and the need for early lab assessment if clinical status changes [^114XfzXF] [^115Fp1ZY] [^1119tJBi].

> I will now examine fixed-dose subcutaneous UFH regimens. Options include 15,000–20,000 units every 12 hours or 8,000–10,000 units every 8 hours using concentrated solutions. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought these were interchangeable in effect, but I should correct that — subcutaneous absorption is less predictable than IV, and while some programs use fixed SC UFH, weight-adjusted regimens or IV UFH with aPTT-guided titration are generally preferred when precise, rapid therapeutic anticoagulation is needed, especially inpatients or those with high thrombotic burden [^116KMQAp] [^11367yXP] [^1133y5QC].

> Let me consider low-molecular-weight heparin, since it is often the parenteral agent of choice when DOACs are not selected. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg once daily are both FDA-labeled and guideline-supported options with equivalent efficacy to IV UFH in trials; I should confirm that once-daily regimens are acceptable but twice-daily may achieve steadier levels, and that routine anti-Xa monitoring is not required for most patients unless extremes of body weight, pregnancy, or severe renal impairment are present [^1142aXTo] [^114GG6nQ] [^115vwU4Y].

> But wait, what if renal function is impaired. I need to ensure dose adjustments are addressed: for LMWH, dose reduction is suggested when creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min, and for UFH, the lack of renal clearance makes it advantageous in severe renal dysfunction. I should also confirm that anti-Xa monitoring can be considered for LMWH in renal impairment or obesity, recognizing the evidence base is limited and institution-specific [^117Rq5d8].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. In pregnancy, LMWH is preferred over UFH due to lower risks of osteoporosis and HIT, with weight-based therapeutic dosing typically used. In obesity, standard weight-based dosing applies, though some centers consider anti-Xa levels if clinical response is suboptimal. During catheter-directed thrombolysis for iliofemoral DVT, subtherapeutic UFH is commonly used with the lytic infusion, with transition back to fully therapeutic anticoagulation promptly thereafter. And in cancer, LMWH is often favored for initial and extended therapy phases rather than DOACs or VKAs in many guidelines [^112SiWuc] [^112688Xh] [^116vbzUU] [^113PcAoY] [^116ceJ2x].

> I need to check the transition strategy when using heparin as a bridge. For VKA therapy, overlap UFH or LMWH for at least 5 days and until the INR is therapeutic for at least 24 hours. For DOACs, transitions vary by agent — enoxaparin is typically overlapped until the oral agent takes effect per label, whereas rivaroxaban and apixaban have specific early initiation windows that obviate parenteral overlap. I should confirm that fondaparinux can be used as an alternative parenteral with weight-based dosing and a similar overlap principle when VKA is chosen [^111SxyZo] [^1142aXTo] [^111J3BzX].

> Let me verify duration and intensity guidance to close the loop. For provoked DVT, 3 months of anticoagulation is standard; for unprovoked DVT, at least 3 months is recommended with consideration of extended therapy based on bleeding risk; VKA therapy should target INR 2.5 with a range of 2.0–3.0, and extended-phase anticoagulation with reduced-dose DOACs is reasonable for some patients; I should also note that after stopping anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE, aspirin can be considered to modestly reduce recurrence risk in selected patients [^112yVtAk] [^11269z7m] [^116eGNgV] [^113udtMh].

> Finally, I should synthesize a concise dosing summary and sanity-check it against the references. Preferred IV UFH: 80 units/kg bolus, then 18 units/kg/hour with aPTT every 6 hours and titration to a therapeutic aPTT corresponding to anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 IU/mL; acceptable alternative fixed regimen: 5,000-unit bolus then 1,000 units/hour, though weight-based achieves therapeutic levels faster. Subcutaneous UFH options include weight-adjusted 333 units/kg once then 250 units/kg every 12 hours, or fixed high-dose regimens such as 15,000–20,000 units every 12 hours or 8,000–10,000 units every 8 hours, recognizing lower bioavailability and less predictable pharmacokinetics with SC UFH. LMWH options: enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily, with consideration of anti-Xa monitoring in renal impairment, obesity, or pregnancy. I should double-check that all of these align with guideline-endorsed pathways and FDA labeling where applicable, which they do [^114UZm63] [^111kBnyQ] [^116KMQAp] [^11367yXP] [^1142aXTo] [^114GG6nQ].

For acute DVT, use **weight-based IV heparin** with an 80 units/kg bolus [^114UZm63], then 18 units/kg/h infusion [^111kBnyQ], adjusting to a therapeutic aPTT (typically 1.5–2.5× baseline or 46–70 s) [^111kBnyQ]. Alternatively, use **LMWH** (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) [^1142aXTo] [^114GG6nQ] without routine monitoring [^1149ARZf]. Continue heparin for at least 5 days and until INR is therapeutic (≥ 2.0) for 24 hours if transitioning to warfarin [^111SxyZo]. Adjust dosing for renal impairment, obesity, or bleeding risk, and monitor platelets for HIT [^117Rq5d8] [^112688Xh].

## Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing

### Standard weight-based dosing regimen

- **Initial bolus**: 80 units/kg IV [^114UZm63] [^111swaBM].
- **Initial infusion**: 18 units/kg/h IV [^111kBnyQ].
- **Maximum initial bolus**: 5,000–10,000 units (depending on desired intensity) [^111swaBM].
- **Maximum infusion rate**: 1,250 units/h (30,000 units/day) [^111swaBM].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

- **aPTT monitoring**: Check every 6 hours initially, then daily once stable [^notfound].
- **Therapeutic range**: Typically 1.5–2.5× baseline or 46–70 seconds, corresponding to anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 IU/mL [^111kBnyQ].
- **Dose adjustments**: Increase or decrease infusion by 2–4 units/kg/h based on aPTT [^111kBnyQ].

---

## Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing

Subcutaneous UFH is an alternative when IV administration is impractical; use **weight-adjusted dosing** with an initial 333 units/kg SC, then 250 units/kg SC every 12 hours [^114XfzXF] [^115Fp1ZY]. Alternatively, a **fixed-dose regimen** uses 15,000–20,000 units SC every 12 hours [^116KMQAp] or 8,000–10,000 units SC every 8 hours [^11367yXP].

---

## Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dosing

LMWH is preferred for many patients due to predictable pharmacokinetics and minimal monitoring [^117H93Ei]. For **enoxaparin**, give 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg once daily [^1142aXTo] [^114GG6nQ]. For **dalteparin**, administer 200 units/kg SC once daily.

---

## Duration of heparin therapy

Continue heparin for at least 5 days [^111SxyZo] and until the INR is therapeutic (≥ 2.0) for at least 24 hours when transitioning to warfarin. If using **DOACs**, heparin is typically discontinued when the DOAC is initiated, per agent-specific protocols.

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust LMWH dose; UFH preferred in severe renal dysfunction [^117Rq5d8].
- **Obesity**: Use weight-based dosing; consider anti-Xa monitoring in extreme obesity [^112688Xh].
- **Bleeding risk**: Use lower doses and closer monitoring [^notfound].
- **HIT**: Monitor platelets; discontinue heparin if HIT suspected [^notfound].

## Heparin dosing for DVT

| **Heparin type** | **Regimen** | **Dose** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| IV UFH | Weight-based | 80 units/kg bolus, then 18 units/kg/h | aPTT every 6 hours |
| SC UFH | Weight-based | 333 units/kg, then 250 units/kg every 12 hours | aPTT every 6 hours initially |
| SC UFH | Fixed-dose | 15,000–20,000 units every 12 hours | aPTT every 6 hours initially |
| Enoxaparin | Weight-based | 1 mg/kg every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg once daily | Routine monitoring not required |
| Dalteparin | Weight-based | 200 units/kg once daily | Routine monitoring not required |

---

Heparin dosing for DVT is **weight-based** for UFH and LMWH, with UFH requiring aPTT monitoring and LMWH typically not. Therapy should continue for at least 5 days and until INR is therapeutic if transitioning to warfarin, with adjustments for renal function, obesity, and bleeding risk [^111SxyZo].

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^115HVmsY]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute deep venous thrombosis — thrombolytic agents and administration considerations are summarized as follows: Streptokinase, although rarely used due to the risks of allergic reactions and bleeding, remains the only thrombolytic agent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of DVT. Several series, however, have reported the successful use of urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, reteplase, and tenecteplase for venous thrombolysis. A consensus panel of the Society of Interventional Radiology has reviewed recommended thrombolytic dosages and techniques for their catheter-directed administration. Because patient characteristics and bleeding risks vary, individual judgment is required in the selection of appropriate thrombolytic and concurrent anticoagulant doses. Most would agree that thrombolytic infusion times should be minimized and balanced against lytic progress to avoid complications.

### Targeted use of heparin, heparinoids, or low-molecular-weight heparin to improve outcome after acute ischaemic stroke: an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116G8Wci]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Every year, ischaemic stroke kills 2·9 million people and leads to 3·4 million years lived with disability worldwide. Short-term stroke recovery is often complicated by venous thromboembolism (1–5%) and recurrent stroke (1–20%). Prevention of the arterial and venous thromboembolic complications of stroke could contribute to reduction of the burden of stroke-related disabilities.

Although heparins (unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and heparinoids) can reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, they also increase the risk of symptomatic intracranial and extracranial haemorrhage. In stroke, the benefits are exactly offset by the harms, and hence in systematic reviews of grouped data from randomised controlled trials of subcutaneous heparins, there was no net observable effect of anticoagulants on death or disability measured several months after stroke (even in selected subtypes).

However, some clinicians still use heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent early recurrent stroke in patients who are felt to be at particularly high risk. In the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3),24% of patients were treated with low-dose heparin and 8% were fully anticoagulated with high-dose heparin or warfarin in the first week after stroke, consistent with recent registry data from the USA, Germany, France, and Australia. Additionally, regimens of low-dose unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin are commonly prescribed for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients with stroke. National UK and other country guidelines recommend prophylactic doses of heparins for patients with stroke who are deemed at high risk of venous thromboembolismor those at low risk of bleeding, although this stratified approach had not previously been studied.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that a policy of using clinical data to target heparins in patients with ischaemic stroke who have a high risk of venous or arterial thromboembolism, and avoiding heparins in patients with a high risk of bleeding, leads to overall better outcomes. Such a hypothesis might also be of relevance to the use of thromboprophylaxis in other groups of medical patients. We therefore undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data from the five largest randomised trials of unfractionated heparin, heparinoids, and low-molecular-weight heparin in acute ischaemic stroke.

Regarding specific circumstances for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to patients with thrombophilia, ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering adjusted-dose VKAs (target INR 2.5, with an overlapping period of parenteral anticoagulation) over DOAC therapy during the treatment phase in patients with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome being treated with anticoagulant therapy.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^113BLMww]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^1149ARZf]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

### Medical management of venous thromboembolic disease [^1121k7o4]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic disease (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) are common disorders with serious morbid and mortal complications. Given the varied modes of presentation, a high clinical index of suspicion in patients at risk must exist among physicians. Standard therapy has consisted of intravenous unfractionated heparin and overlapping administration of an oral Vitamin K antagonist, commonly Warfarin. Although an effective strategy, many practical limitations exist, including the need for prolonged hospitalization, frequent laboratory monitoring for anticoagulant effect, and erratic dose-response curves. Recently, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparins have emerged as safe and effective alternatives for unfractionated heparin. Appropriate patients may be treated with low-molecular-weight heparins and oral Warfarin entirely as outpatients, with similar efficacy and risk of recurrent thromboembolic events and hemorrhage. Thrombolytic therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with iliofemoral venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism resulting in hemodynamic compromise or obstructing significant pulmonary vasculature. Risks of serious hemorrhagic side effects including intracranial hemorrhage, along with the added economic burden, have limited widespread acceptance of thrombolytic therapy as primary treatment. Emerging oral direct thrombin inhibitors and other novel agents stand to move the treatment of patients with venous thromboemboli to even greater levels of safety and efficacy.

Interventions and comparators

We assessed low dose low-molecular-weight heparin, intermediate dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low dose unfractionated heparin, intermediate dose unfractionated heparin, standard dose direct oral anticoagulants, pentasaccharides, coumarins, heparinoids, platelet inhibitors, placebo, and no intervention. The interventions low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin were categorised as low or intermediate dose according to a priori defined cut-offs that were based on summary of product characteristics and clinical trials dosing regimens (table 1). We assumed that intervention effects within either of the dose strata were interchangeable with respect to benefits and harms. We originally planned to distinguish between different doses of direct oral anticoagulants and different intensities of coumarins, but no such trials were identified. Additionally, placebo and no intervention were assessed as separate nodes in the network. The remaining interventions were assessed on a class level, regardless of dose. In two small randomised controlled trials where weight adjusted doses were used, we classified the trial according to the dose that was judged to be used most frequently.

Outcomes

We collected data for four co-primary outcomes: all cause mortality, symptomatic venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and serious adverse events. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism was a composite of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was accepted when objectified by radiological imaging or autopsy, regardless of anatomical location. If only deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism was reported, we used that value for the venous thromboembolism estimate. In randomised controlled trials that screened for deep vein thrombosis but did not specify which events were symptomatic, the deep vein thrombosis count was excluded from the venous thromboembolism outcome. Major bleeding and serious adverse events were defined according to the criteria used in the individual trials. The timing of all outcome assessments was 90 days or any reported timing closest to 90 days.

### A dose-ranging study evaluating once-daily oral administration of the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban in the treatment of patients with acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis: the einstein-DVT dose-ranging study [^113sD62A]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

We performed a randomized dose-ranging study, double-blind for rivaroxaban doses and open-label for the comparator (low-molecular-weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists) to assess the optimal dose of rivaroxaban for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. A total of 543 patients with acute deep-venous thrombosis received rivaroxaban 20, 30, or 40 mg once daily or comparator. Treatment lasted for 84 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the 3-month incidence of the composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolic complications and asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic burden as assessed by comparison of ultrasound and perfusion lung scanning at day 84 with baseline. The main safety outcome was the composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. A total of 449 (83%) of the 543 patients could be included in the per-protocol population. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 6.1%, 5.4%, and 6.6% of the rivaroxaban 20-, 30-, and 40-mg treatment groups, respectively, and in 9.9% of those receiving standard therapy. The main safety outcome occurred in 5.9%, 6.0%, and 2.2% of the rivaroxaban 20-, 30-, and 40-mg treatment groups, respectively, and in 8.8% of those receiving standard therapy. These results with simple fixed-dose oral regimens justify phase 3 evaluations (www. ClinicalTrials.gov no.NCT00395772).

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111LGyQc]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Heparin dosing strategies and early anticoagulation — In one comparison with identical total dosing (an IV bolus of 5,000 units and 30,000 units per day) using subcutaneous 15,000 units every 12 h vs continuous IV infusion of 30,000 units per day, patients assigned to IV heparin had a significantly lower rate of recurrence than those given subcutaneous heparin; in a randomized trial, fixed dosing (5,000-unit bolus followed by 1,000 units/h infusion) vs weight-based nomogram dosing (starting dose, 80 units/kg bolus followed by 18 units/kg/h by infusion) showed that patients whose heparin was weight-adjusted received higher doses within the first 24 h and the rate of recurrent thromboembolism was significantly lower with the weight-adjusted regimen; in a study of 400 consecutive patients with acute pulmonary embolism, patients who achieved a therapeutic aPTT in < 24 h had lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates than those who did not.

### Subcutaneous enoxaparin in the treatment of DVT… [^113azBAF]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis is often treated in the hospital with five to 10 days of unfractionated heparin. The activated partial thromboplastin time is maintained at more than 1. 5 times its control value. An alternative initial treatment is five to 10 days of weight-adjusted low-molecular-weight heparin. Both initial regimens are followed by at least three months of oral anticoagulant therapy. Studies supporting the use of low-molecular-weight heparin to treat DVT have been small and often have excluded patients with pulmonary embolism. Because of this, Merli and associates compared the use of continuously infused unfractionated heparin with two weight-adjusted dosages of enoxaparin, administered subcutaneously once or twice daily. In a partially blinded, international, multicenter clinical trial, patients 18 years and older were randomized to treatment with enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin.

Patients with symptomatic lower-extremity DVT confirmed by venography or ultrasonography, symptomatic pulmonary embolism confirmed by high-probability ventilation-perfusion scanning or positive pulmonary angiography with confirmation of lower-extremity DVT were included in the trial. The authors conclude that enoxaparin administered subcutaneously once or twice daily was as effective and safe as unfractionated heparin in preventing recurrence of venous thromboembolic disease. Patients with cancer and symptomatic pulmonary embolism were more likely to develop recurrence of venous thromboembolism regardless of treatment group. editor's note: The efficacy of treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism and DVT has been confirmed by many studies. For example, Hull and associates examined once-daily dosing of tinzaparin sodium compared with unfractionated intravenous heparin in patients with documented pulmonary embolism. They noted significantly fewer new episodes of DVT in the patients treated with tinzaparin sodium. The authors concluded that low-molecular-weight heparin was no less effective and probably more effective than dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin in preventing recurrent DVT in patients with pulmonary embolism and associated proximal DVT. Other studies demonstrate the feasibility of treating patients with self-injection at home under the supervision of hospital-based nurses.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation (initial management, unprovoked thrombosis), ESVS 2021 guidelines recommend to administer DOACs rather than LMWH followed by a VKA for the principal treatment phase in patients with unprovoked proximal DVT.

Recurrent VTE on long-term LMWH — dose escalation: In patients who have recurrent VTE on long-term low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and are believed to be compliant, the guideline states "we suggest increasing the dose of LMWH by about one-quarter to one-third (Grade 2C)", and remarks that recurrent VTE on therapeutic-dose anticoagulation "should prompt" reevaluation of recurrence, evaluation of compliance, and consideration of an underlying malignancy.

### Treatment of superficial vein thrombosis to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a systematic review [^113z6D3n]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) concerning the efficacy and safety of medical or surgical treatments of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Design and Methods

A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane (CENTRAL) database to identify all randomized trials that evaluated the effect of surgical or medical treatment in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with SVT of the legs.

Results

Five studies were included. Pooling of the data was not possible due to the heterogeneity among the studies. Moreover, three studies had major methodological drawbacks limiting the clinical applicability of the results. One of the remaining (pilot) studies showed a non-significant trend in favor of high- compared to low-dose unfractionated heparin for the prevention of VTE. The last remaining study showed a non-significant trend in favor of short-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) as compared to placebo shortly after treatment with respect to VTE, but the apparent benefit disappeared after three months of follow-up. Active treatment of SVT reduced the incidences of SVT extension or recurrence.

Interpretation and Conclusions

Treatment with a therapeutic or prophylactic dose of LMWH or a NSAID reduces the incidence of SVT extension or recurrence, but not VTE. More RCT are needed before any evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of SVT for the prevention of VTE can be given. With the present lack of solid evidence we would suggest treating patients with at least intermediate doses of LMWH.

Thrombolytic procedures — anticoagulation practices are as follows: Concurrent anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is recommended during thrombolytic procedures, although doses may differ depending on the thrombolytic agent and there is no robust scientific evidence to guide dosing. Subtherapeutic doses of heparin are appropriate for all thrombolytic agents except urokinase, in which case therapeutic anticoagulation may be considered.

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) Lovenox 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) Lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of Lovenox or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Lovenox or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both Lovenox regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Fixed-dose versus adjusted-dose low molecular weight heparin for the initial treatment of patients with deep venous thrombosis [^116reXdA]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were treated with a body-weight independent dosage of 2 x 8000 aXa IU low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) Certoparin. After the subcutaneous administration of 8000 IU Certoparin, pharmacodynamic parameters did not differ between patients and healthy volunteers, and the AUC of the anticoagulant effects were not related to body weight. Two clinical trials demonstrated a greater regression of thrombi and a lower occurrence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), major bleeding, and mortality within 14 days of initial therapy compared with intravenous heparin. D-dimer decreased, and anti-Xa activity increased in those patients with a regression of thrombosis. The benefit of the reduced occurrence of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality was maintained up to 6 months. Major bleeding was not related to the body weight in either treatment group. Treatment of acute DVT in adults with fixed dose of 2 x 8000 aXa IU LMWH Certoparin is more effective and safer than heparin.

Heparin pharmacokinetics and administration — parenteral routes, subcutaneous dosing, plasma recovery, and half-life: Heparin is not absorbed orally and therefore must be administered parenterally, with the two preferred routes being continuous IV infusion or subcutaneous injection, and when the subcutaneous route is selected for treatment doses the dose of heparin should be higher than the usual IV dose because subcutaneous administration is associated with reduced bioavailability; if an immediate anticoagulant effect is required, a higher initial subcutaneous dose can be administered or an IV bolus can be given with the first subcutaneous dose. Administration by subcutaneous injection in low doses (eg, 5,000 units q12h), moderate doses of 12,500 units q12h, or 15,000 units q12h reduces the plasma recovery of heparin, whereas at high therapeutic doses (> 35,000 units q24h) plasma recovery is almost complete. Heparin is cleared through a combination of a rapid saturable and a much slower first-order mechanism, with the saturable phase believed due to binding to endothelial cell receptors and macrophages and the slower nonsaturable mechanism largely renal; at therapeutic doses a large proportion of heparin is cleared through the rapid saturable, dose-dependent mechanism and the complex kinetics render the anticoagulant response nonlinear at therapeutic doses, with both intensity and duration rising disproportionately with increasing dose. Accordingly, the apparent biologic half-life of heparin increases from approximately 30 min after an IV bolus of 25 units/kg, to 60 min with an IV bolus of 100 units/kg, to 150 min with a bolus of 400 units/kg.

### A user guide to the American Society of Hematology clinical practice guidelines [^112FJbRp]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines — strength of recommendations and benefit–harm balance (GRADE) — the strength of a recommendation reflects the extent to which the panel is confident that the desirable consequences of an intervention outweigh the undesirable consequences, with a strong recommendation indicating that desirable consequences clearly outweigh undesirable consequences and a conditional recommendation expressing that the balance is close or uncertain. The GRADE approach is followed to determine the strength of recommendations, and the first key determinant is the balance between the desirable and undesirable health effects of alternative strategies. As an example, for critically ill patients, pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) probably reduces mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with minimal increase in bleeding and negligible inconvenience and costs, so advantages outweigh disadvantages and support a strong recommendation. Conversely, in pregnant women with acute lower-extremity DVT, thrombolysis may reduce severe postthrombotic syndrome at the expense of a significant increase in major bleeding, and when advantages and disadvantages are closely balanced this warrants a conditional recommendation.

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### An open-label, comparative study of the efficacy and safety of once-daily dose of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in the treatment of proximal lower limb deep-vein thrombosis [^111MyZoB]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) with a once-daily regimen of enoxaparin, rather than a continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is more convenient and allows for home care in some patients. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two regimens for the treatment of patients with proximal lower limb DVT.

Methods

201 patients with proximal lower limb DVT from 13 centers in Brazil were randomized in an open manner to receive either enoxaparin [1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous (s.c.) OD] or intravenous (i.v.) UFH (adjusted to aPTT 1.5–2.5 times control) for 5–10 days. All patients also received warfarin (INR 2–3) for at least 3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent DVT (confirmed by venography or ultrasonography), and safety endpoints included bleeding and serious adverse events. The rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) was also collected. Hospitalization was at the physician's discretion.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics were comparable between groups. The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter with enoxaparin than with UFH (3 versus 7 days). In addition, 36% of patients receiving enoxaparin did not need to be hospitalized, whereas all of the patients receiving UFH were hospitalized. The treatment duration was slightly longer with enoxaparin (8 versus 7 days). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in the rate of recurrent DVT with enoxaparin versus UFH, and similar safety.

Conclusions

A once-daily regimen of enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous is at least as effective and safe as conventional treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of UFH. However, the once daily enoxaparin regimen is easier to administer (subcutaneous versus intravenous), does not require aPTT monitoring, and leads to both a reduced number of hospital admissions and an average 4-day-shorter hospital stay.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin compared with intravenous unfractionated heparin for treatment of pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^115jzJqH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparin has greatly simplified the management of deep venous thrombosis. However, for patients who present with pulmonary embolism, the role of low-molecular-weight heparin is uncertain and unfractionated heparin remains widely used.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin with that of dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin to treat acute pulmonary embolism.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to 1 August 2003. Additional data sources were manual searches of abstract proceedings and personal contact with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing fixed-dose subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin with dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin for the treatment of nonmassive symptomatic pulmonary embolism or asymptomatic pulmonary embolism in the context of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on study design; quality; and clinical outcomes, including symptomatic venous thromboembolism, death, and major and minor bleeding. Odds ratios for individual outcomes were calculated for each trial and were pooled by using the Mantel-Haenszel method.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen trials involving 2110 patients with pulmonary embolism met the inclusion criteria. Separate outcome data for patients with pulmonary embolism were not available from 2 trials (159 patients), leaving 12 trials for meta-analysis. Compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin was associated with a non-statistically significant decrease in recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism at the end of treatment (1.4% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.18]) and at 3 months (3.0% vs. 4.4%; odds ratio, 0.68 [CI, 0.42 to 1.09]). Similar estimates were obtained for patients who presented with symptomatic pulmonary embolism (1.7% vs. 2.3%; odds ratio, 0.72 [CI, 0.35 to 1.48]) or asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (1.2% vs. 3.2%; odds ratio, 0.53 [CI, 0.15 to 1.88]). For major bleeding complications, the odds ratio favoring low-molecular-weight heparin (1.3% vs. 2.1%; odds ratio, 0.67 [CI, 0.36 to 1.27]) was also not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Fixed-dose low-molecular-weight heparin treatment appears to be as effective and safe as dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of nonmassive pulmonary embolism.

### Dosing frequency of unfractionated heparin thromboprophylaxis: a meta-analysis [^112DhP5g]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In medical patients, it is unclear whether thromboprophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be administered bid or tid.

Methods

This study was a mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis of randomized control trials that enrolled hospitalized nonsurgical patients at risk for VTE and compared UFH bid, UFH tid, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to one another or to an inactive control subject. DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, and death were measured. A Bayesian framework using a random-effects model was applied.

Results

Sixteen trials with moderate methodologic quality enrolling 27,667 patients contributed to this analysis. The relative risk and 95% credible intervals comparing UFH tid to UFH bid for DVT, PE, death, and major bleeding were 1.56 (0.64–4.33), 1.67 (0.49–208.09), 1.17 (0.72–1.95), and 0.89 (0.08–7.05), respectively. When compared with either dose of UFH, the use of LMWH has an effect similar to UFH on all four outcomes.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that subcutaneous UFH bid and UFH tid do not differ in effect on DVT, PE, major bleeding, and mortality. Either of the two dosing regimens of UFH or LMWH appears to be a reasonable strategy for thromboprophylaxis in medical patients. A future randomized trial comparing the two doses of UFH is very unlikely, considering the very large sample size that would be required to demonstrate a significant difference, which, if it exists, is undoubtedly small.

### Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin compared with low-molecular-weight heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^117H93Ei]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Low-molecular-weight heparin is the preferred choice for the initial treatment of acute, uncomplicated venous thromboembolism. In this context, unfractionated heparin is as safe and effective as low-molecular-weight heparin but requires strict laboratory monitoring. Twice-daily subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is more effective than, and as safe as, intravenous unfractionated heparin and may simplify patient treatment in or out of the hospital, being possibly cost saving, especially if it is used in weight-based, fixed, unadjusted doses. The present review focuses on the relative values of low-molecular-weight heparin and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism.

Recent Findings

The major advantages of low-molecular-weight heparin over unfractionated heparin seem to be ease of administration and cost savings associated with home therapy or early hospital discharge; however, many patients with venous thromboembolism are still admitted to the hospital for treatment, and unfractionated heparin is extensively used to this purpose, especially in the United States. Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, adjusted according to activated partial thromboplastin time algorithms, is as safe and effective as low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism, allows for quick mobilization and early discharge of suitable patients, and represents a cost-effective strategy. Fixed-dose unfractionated heparin, like low-molecular-weight heparin, may be used for the home treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

Summary

Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, targeted on activated partial thromboplastin time results or in fixed doses, may be used in or out of the hospital for the treatment of venous thromboembolism, being possibly cost effective; however, these findings need confirmation through appropriate, large-sample, randomized clinical trials.

### How complete is the evidence for thromboembolism prophylaxis in general medicine patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114PxRzP]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis for hospitalized medical patients at increased risk of thromboembolism. Despite recommendations, multiple studies demonstrate underutilization. Factors contributing to underutilization include uncertainty that prophylaxis reduces clinically relevant events, as well as questions about the best form of prophylaxis. We sought to determine whether prophylaxis decreases clinically significant events and to answer whether unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is either more effective or safer.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched through June 2008. Relevant bibliographies and conference proceedings were reviewed and LMWH manufacturers were contacted.

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing UFH or LMWH to control, as well as head-to-head comparisons of UFH to LMWH in general medicine patients.

Data Extraction and Analysis

End points of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), proximal or symptomatic DVT, pulmonary embolism, mortality, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia were extracted from individual trials. Pooled relative risks were calculated using random effects modeling.

Results

We identified 8 trials comparing prophylaxis to control, and 6 trials comparing UFH to LMWH. Prophylaxis reduced DVT (relative risk [RR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36–0.92), proximal DVT (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.31–0.69), and pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53–0.93). Prophylaxis increased the risk of any bleeding (RR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.15–2.06) but not major bleeding. Across trials comparing LMWH to UFH, there were no differences for any outcome.

Conclusions

Among medical patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis reduced the risk of thromboembolism without increasing risk of major bleeding. The current literature does not demonstrate superior efficacy of UFH or LMWH.

### Fondaparinux or enoxaparin for the initial treatment of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^117NquVq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The current standard initial therapies for deep venous thrombosis are low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin. In a dose-ranging study of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, fondaparinux had efficacy and a safety profile similar to those of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin).

Objective

To evaluate whether fondaparinux has efficacy and safety similar to those of enoxaparin in patients with deep venous thrombosis.

Design

Randomized, double-blind study.

Setting

154 centers worldwide.

Patients

2205 patients with acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

Intervention

Fondaparinux, 7.5 mg (5.0 mg in patients weighing < 50 kg and 10.0 mg in patients weighing > 100 kg) subcutaneously once daily, or enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg of body weight, subcutaneously twice daily for at least 5 days and until vitamin K antagonists induced an international normalized ratio greater than 2.0.

Measurements

The primary efficacy outcome was the 3-month incidence of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic complications. The main safety outcomes were major bleeding during initial treatment and death. An independent, blinded committee adjudicated all outcomes.

Results

43 (3.9%) of 1098 patients randomly assigned to fondaparinux had recurrent thromboembolic events compared with 45 (4.1%) of 1107 patients randomly assigned to enoxaparin (absolute difference, -0.15 percentage point [95% CI, -1.8 to 1.5 percentage points]). Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving fondaparinux and 1.2% of patients receiving enoxaparin. Mortality rates were 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively.

Limitations

Follow-up was incomplete in 0.4% of fondaparinux-treated patients and 1.0% of enoxaparin-treated patients.

Conclusions

Once-daily subcutaneous fondaparinux was at least as effective (not inferior) and safe as twice-daily, body weight-adjusted enoxaparin in the initial treatment of patients with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis.

### Heparin dose intensity and organ support-free days in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^116ABhdj]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Per-protocol analysis

The trial statistical analysis plan prespecified a per-protocol analysis based on participants' initial post-randomization anticoagulant dose received. Participants' baseline initial stable anticoagulant dose was determined centrally by either a computerized algorithm or by investigator review using a prespecified consensus dose-intensity framework that reflected patients' renal function, body size, and weight. Anticoagulant doses were categorized into 4 groups: low, intermediate, subtherapeutic, and therapeutic (Supplemental Methods). Dose thresholds were informed by guidance from the American Society of Hematology and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (United Kingdom). To determine an initial stable dose, doses prescribed within the first 48 hours after randomization were reviewed.

The per-protocol population consisted of: 1) patients randomized to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation who initially received either therapeutic or subtherapeutic doses of heparin (ie, a dose greater than intermediate); and 2) patients randomized to usual care who initially received a low- or intermediate-intensity dose of anticoagulant. Patients without information on initial dosing or without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded. The primary outcome in the mpRCT and in this per-protocol analysis was OSFDs. Key secondary outcomes included survival to hospital discharge, a composite of thrombotic events or death, the composite of macrovascular arterial or venous thrombotic events or death within 28 days, and major bleeding (as per the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition) within 14 days. Thrombotic events included pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic cerebrovascular event, systemic arterial thromboembolism, and deep vein thrombosis. The mpRCT did not employ systematic screening for venous thrombotic events. All thrombotic and bleeding events were independently adjudicated by blinded assessors using consensus definitions (Supplemental Methods).

Secondary heparin dose intensity analysis

In a post hoc analysis of the per-protocol population aimed at determining if therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin is superior to both low- and intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis, noncritically ill patients randomized to usual-care thromboprophylaxis were further categorized as those receiving low-dose or intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis. Outcomes of these 2 subgroups were separately compared to those who were randomized to and received therapeutic anticoagulation.

### Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis: better living through chemistry – in opposition [^111sK3Bg]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2005). Low credibility.

The best prophylactic regimens for thromboembolic disease continue to be debated despite years of investigation. The surgeon must balance the clinical risks and benefits. A decision depends on accurate data and our ability to balance the risks of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) to the risk of bleeding. The current risk for fatal PE is 0.1% with most current prophylactic regimes. The risk of perioperative bleeding increases 1.8% to 5.2% with low molecular weight heparins or warfarin and generally is dose dependent. Most of the current prophylactic recommendations are based on the presence or absence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). However, the correlation between the presence of a DVT and the risk of PE is low and inconsistent. Therefore, DVT may not be an accurate surrogate marker for the patient at risk after total joint surgery. Our experience with 2800 consecutive total knee arthroplasty patients, using aspirin as our principle agent, shows a fatal PE risk of 0.1% and a low risk of bleeding. Therefore, our current recommendation is aspirin.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

### Effects of a low-molecular-weight heparin on thrombus regression and recurrent thromboembolism in patients with deep-vein thrombosis [^116wSgQX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparins are frequently used to treat venous thromboembolism, but optimal dosing regimens and clinical outcomes need further definition.

Methods

In this multicenter, open-label study with blinded adjudication of end points, we randomly assigned patients with acute deep-vein thrombosis to one of three treatment regimens: intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin; subcutaneous administration of a low-molecular-weight heparin, reviparin, twice a day for one week; or subcutaneous administration of reviparin once a day for four weeks. The primary end point was evidence of regression of the thrombus on venography on day 21; secondary end points were recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding within 90 days after enrollment, and death.

Results

Of the patients receiving unfractionated heparin, 40.2 percent (129 of 321) had thrombus regression, as compared with 53.4 percent (175 of 328) of patients receiving reviparin twice daily and 53.5 percent (167 of 312) of the patients receiving reviparin once daily. With regard to thrombus regression, reviparin administered twice daily was significantly more effective than unfractionated heparin (relative likelihood of thrombus regression, 1.28; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.52), as was reviparin administered once daily (relative likelihood, 1.29; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.53). Mortality and the frequency of episodes of major bleeding were similar in the three groups.

Conclusions

In acute deep-vein thrombosis, reviparin regimens are more effective than unfractionated heparin in reducing the size of the thrombus. Reviparin is also more effective than unfractionated heparin for the prevention of recurrent thromboembolism and equally safe.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the medical patient: controversies and perspectives [^111NDS8A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with venous thromboembolism in hospitalized at-risk medical patients, the publication of large-scale studies showing that prophylaxis is effective in this patient group, and the presence of international guidelines, prophylaxis rates in medically ill patients remain suboptimal. Studies show that low-molecular-weight heparins, given once daily, are at least as effective as unfractionated heparin usually given thrice daily with equivalent or improved safety profiles, and that thrice-daily dosing of unfractionated heparin might be more effective than twice-daily dosing. However, the most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not distinguish between these regimens, and twice-daily unfractionated heparin is still commonly used in the United States. Furthermore, the optimal duration for out-of-hospital and extended prophylaxis for specific patient groups is not established. Finally, there are few data on the use of mechanical methods in this patient group and no established standard of care for prophylaxis of special patient populations, such as obese patients or those with renal insufficiency. Even though prophylaxis entails additional acquisition costs, it can reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism, which can improve care and decrease overall costs.

### Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism [^117PE35D]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

When unfractionated heparin is used to treat acute venous thromboembolism, it is usually given by intravenous infusion with dose adjustment in response to activated partial thromboplastin time measurements. These two requirements are a barrier to treatment of venous thromboembolism with unfractionated heparin, and it is uncertain if they are necessary.

Recent Findings

Two recent studies compared subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, each given twice-daily, for the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism. The Galilei study used an initial dose of unfractionated heparin that was partially weight-adjusted, with subsequent dosing based on activated partial thromboplastin time results. The FIDO study treated patients with a first dose of unfractionated heparin of 333 IU/kg, followed by 250 IU/kg twice-daily without dose adjustment in response to the activated partial thromboplastin time or other coagulation tests. There was no difference in either study between the unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin groups at the end of 3 months, for recurrent venous thromboembolism (Galilei: 4.2 vs. 3.9%; relative risk (RR) 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 2.2. FIDO: 3.8 vs. 3.4%; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5 to 2.3) or major bleeding (Galilei: 1.4 vs. 1.9%; RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.2. FIDO: 1.7 vs. 3.4%; RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.3).

Summary

Recent studies suggest that twice-daily subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is as effective and safe as low-molecular-weight heparin for the acute treatment of venous thromboembolism, and that adjustment of unfractionated heparin dose in response to activated partial thromboplastin time measurements is not necessary with a weight-adjusted dose of unfractionated heparin.

### Properties of low-molecular… [^112i3Xev]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The cost burden of this disease is quite high, since most patients with DVT require one or more diagnostic tests, treatment with intravenous heparin and a three- to seven-day hospital stay. 2 Low-molecular-weight heparin, which is administered by subcutaneous injection, offers the option of treatment on an outpatient basis for patients with DVT. Low-molecular-weight heparin can also be used effectively in patients requiring prophylaxis for DVT after general or orthopedic surgery. The activated partial thromboplastin time does not need to be monitored, and the dosage does not need to be adjusted. Since low-molecular-weight heparin is given subcutaneously, outpatient administration by the patient, with or without the assistance of a visiting nurse or family member, is both possible and cost-effective. 5 Low-molecular-weight heparin helps prevent DVT in a variety of clinical situations, including patients undergoing general surgery, or hip or knee replacements.

Given the high incidence of DVT after such procedures, prophylaxis is strongly recommended. Although a surgeon often consults in such cases, family physicians should be aware of the need for prophylaxis for DVT and should ensure that adequate therapy is provided, when appropriate. The Fourth American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy has recently published a review of the complex data on prophylactic treatment for DVT, which is summarized below.
6. 6 Low-molecular-weight heparin is as effective as low-dose subcutaneous heparin, decreasing the incidence of DVT to 5 to 8 percent following general surgery, and slightly reducing bleeding complications. Although low-molecular-weight heparin costs approximately 10 times more per dose than low-dose subcutaneous heparin, it can be given once daily, which may offset some of the higher cost. While noninvasive methods of preventing DVT are adequate in low- and moderate-risk surgical patients, low-molecular-weight heparin is an excellent therapeutic choice in high-risk patients. 6 Prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin should be given subcutaneously once or twice daily until the patient is ambulating well. DVT is especially hard to prevent following knee replacement surgery, and low-dose standard heparin provides marginal benefit.

Clinical Considerations in Incorporating DOACs in the Management of VTE

Recently published antithrombotic guidelines support the use of DOAC agents over VKA therapy (Grade 2B recommendation) in patients with DVT or PE without cancer. Despite the significant advance that DOACs represent, they are not without risk, and thus, clinicians need to consider a number of clinical issues to optimize treatment. Assessment of the following factors may be helpful in selecting one DOAC over another or, alternatively, oral anticoagulation with a VKA.

Pharmacokinetic and Dosing Considerations

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of DOACs have been well described. Because the DOACs have predictable and stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, unlike VKAs, routine monitoring of anticoagulant activity is not required. However, it is important to note that in clinical scenarios where the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic response may be altered significantly (eg, organ dysfunction or drug-drug interactions), there currently is no readily available coagulation assay approved in the United States that can precisely assess the level of anticoagulation for any of the DOACs. For information on currently available coagulation assays to measure the level of anticoagulation with DOACs, the reader is referred to several recent reviews. Despite this gap, the great majority of patients can be appropriately managed with standard fixed doses for each DOAC, which greatly simplifies many aspects of patient management compared with VKAs. The potential for dosing errors with DOACs is still present, however. The 4 agents have achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the treatment of acute or chronic VTE, each with a different dosing scheme that may differ by indication, adding some complexity for the clinician when selecting the appropriate dose. Table 1 highlights the approved dosing regimens per indication for the DOACs available in the United States.

Depending on the health care setting, clinicians may routinely interact with patients on different DOACs, and care must be taken to ensure appropriateness of the chosen therapy and initial dose. In addition, transition from injectable agent to oral DOAC (dabigatran, edoxaban) or from oral high dose to oral maintenance dose (rivaroxaban at 21 days, apixaban at 7 days) should be implemented at the appropriate juncture. Particularly at times of transitions of care (ie, bridging), the practitioner may be faced with multiple decisions regarding switching agents or alternative anticoagulation. Data to support best practice in switching from VKA to a DOAC or vice versa are, however, limited, although the phase 3 DOAC trials in VTE and atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as best practice reports provide some information.-

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^113683HU]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Geerts et al. determined the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients not receiving prophylaxis to be in the range of 10–80%. The critically ill patient is especially predisposed to thromboembolism, possessing many inherent risk factors: cardiac failure, trauma, sepsis, cancer, increasing age, and obesity. The acquisition of others, for example: respiratory support with decreased mobility and invasive monitoring, further tips the scale in favor of thrombosis during the ICU stay. Thus, these patients should undergo routine assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The use of routine thromboprophylaxis will probably be justified in most.

Discerning DVT in critically ill patients is difficult. The history and physical examination are often of little use, and thus, these patients are vulnerable to a delay in diagnosis. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are often used as a safe and effective means of prophylaxis against VTE in medical and surgical patients. However, the efficacy of LMWHs in critically ill patients is less certain.

The antithrombotic activity of LMWHs is often determined by aFXa assay, despite several studies finding no direct correlation between aFXa activity and clinical outcome. Mayr concluded that the European standard daily dose of 40 mg enoxaparin was ineffective in ICU patients to achieve the recommended, albeit unproven, aFXa levels of 0.1 to 0.3 IU/ml. Thus, existing guidelines in other patient populations should not be directly applied to critical care patients without further study.

Most intensive care physicians widely acknowledge the need for evidence-based guidelines for antithromboembolic prophylaxis in this patient population and lament the dearth of research on VTE in critical care patients. This study aims to establish the optimal dose of enoxaparin for ICU patients.

2.4 Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Treatment in Adults

In adult patients with acute symptomatic DVT and in patients with acute symptomatic PE, the recommended dose of ARIXTRA is 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 kg to 100 kg), or 10 mg (body weight greater than 100 kg) by subcutaneous injection once daily (ARIXTRA treatment regimen). Initiate concomitant treatment with warfarin sodium as soon as possible, usually within 72 hours. Continue treatment with ARIXTRA for at least 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect is established (INR 2 to 3). The usual duration of administration of ARIXTRA is 5 days to 9 days; up to 26 days of ARIXTRA injection was administered in clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14)].

2.5 Venous Thromboembolism Treatment in Pediatric Patients Aged 1 Year or Older Weighing at Least 10 kg

For patients weighing 10 kg to 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily. There is no available prefilled syringe for patients in this weight range, and a patient specific dose should be prepared (see section 2.8 Instructions for Preparation of Individual Pediatric Doses in Pharmacies). The dose should be exact and rounded to the nearest 0.1 mg (see Table 1).

For patients weighing over 20 kg, the recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily with doses rounded to the nearest prefilled syringe according to Table 2.

There is no available information for dosing pediatric patients who weigh less than 10 kg.

Monitor fondaparinux levels 2 hours to 4 hours after the second or third dose and then weekly for a month followed by every 1 month to 3 months for the duration of treatment using a fondaparinux-based anti-Xa assay with a therapeutic goal range of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L.

Dosing adjustments may be necessary to achieve peak blood concentration within the therapeutic target of 0.5 mg/L to 1 mg/L (see Table 3). Do not exceed the maximum dose of 7.5 mg/day.

There is no adequate data to support the use of ARIXTRA in pediatric patients below 1 year of age.

### What is the optimal pharmacological prophylaxis for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients with acute ischemic stroke? [^113HYK4N]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is associated with a high in-hospital mortality. The benefit from pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is uncertain probably due to doubts about the optimal agent and dose. We evaluated the benefit/risk ratio of different anticoagulant regimens in the prevention of VTE in patients with AIS.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to January 2005. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing early administration of either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) with control were included. Endpoints were objectively diagnosed deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and extracranial hemorrhage (ECH). Low-dose UFH was arbitrarily defined as ≤ 15,000 IU/day, low-dose LMWH as ≤ 6000 IU/day or weight-adjusted dose of ≤ 86 IU/kg/day.

Results

Sixteen trials involving 23,043 patients with AIS met the inclusion criteria. The number of events was small and different doses of anticoagulant treatment were used. Compared to control, high-dose UFH was associated with a reduction in pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29–0.83), but also with an increased risk of ICH (OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 2.41–6.19) and ECH (OR = 4.74, 95% CI = 2.88–7.78). Low-dose UFH decreased the thrombosis risk (OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.11–0.26), but had no influence on pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.53–1.31); the risk of ICH or ECH was not statistically significant increased (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.97–2.87 for ICH; and OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.89–2.81 for ECH, respectively). High-dose LMWH decreased both DVT (OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02–0.29) and pulmonary embolism (0.44, 95% CI = 0.18–1.11), but this benefit was offset by an increased risk for ICH (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.02–3.96) and ECH (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 0.99–3.17). Low-dose LMWH reduced the incidence of both DVT (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.19–0.59) and pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.15–0.87), without an increased risk of ICH (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.53–3.67) or ECH (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.13–16). For low-dose LMWH, the numbers needed to treat were 7 and 38 for DVT and pulmonary embolism, respectively.

Conclusions

Indirect comparison of low and high doses of UFH and LMWH suggests that low-dose LMWH have the best benefit/risk ratio in patients with acute ischemic stroke by decreasing the risk of both DVT and pulmonary embolism, without a clear increase in ICH or ECH.

### Warfarin sodium (Jantoven) [^1178gnny]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of JANTOVEN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy [^112SiWuc]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnant patients is challenging for several reasons. Coumarins can cause embryopathy and other adverse effects in the fetus. Although unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins, the cornerstones of initial therapy, are safe for the fetus, they can have significant maternal side effects, including osteoporosis and thrombocytopenia. Because they must be given parenterally, long-term administration is inconvenient. Further, although low-molecular-weight heparins probably cause less maternal osteoporosis and thrombocytopenia than unfractionated heparin, the appropriate dosing regimens for prevention and treatment of thrombosis during pregnancy have not been established. In addition, there is a paucity of reliable information on the incidence of venous thromboembolism and the risk of recurrent thrombosis during pregnancy. This paper briefly reviews the areas of controversy and provides recommendations for the treatment and prophylaxis of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnant patients.

The guideline panel identified 1 randomized controlled trial comparing therapeutic with prophylactic doses in this population and 2 prospective cohorts evaluating danaparoid, lepirudin, and fondaparinux; the danaparoid comparison found therapeutic intensity may reduce thrombotic events by 50%, the lepirudin comparisons suggested no difference in thrombotic events or platelet response, the fondaparinux comparison found no differences in thrombotic events or mortality, and an increase in bleeding with therapeutic compared with prophylactic dosing is probable. The panel agreed that providing therapeutic-intensity dosing is feasible and acceptable and that differences in costs of prophylactic- and therapeutic-intensity dosing would be negligible.

These studies therefore provide no useful evidence but merely illustrate the importance of risk refinement, as patients with a moderately high recurrence risk and a low bleeding risk may benefit from this strategy of low dosing. However, patients with a high recurrence risk may truly need a standard dose DOAC, unless they have high bleeding risk, in which case they may need low dosing.

### Treatment of PE… [^115G5JMS]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of DVT The goals of treatment for DVT are to stop clot propagation and prevent clot recurrence, PE, and pulmonary hypertension. These goals usually are achieved with anticoagulation using heparin followed by warfarin. Despite some controversy about the need to treat isolated calf-vein DVT, a recent evidence-based guideline on antithrombotic therapy recommends at least six to 12 weeks of anticoagulation. LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT HEPARIN Compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin offers distinct advantages: it has a longer biologic half-life, it can be administered subcutaneously once or twice daily, dosing is fixed, and laboratory monitoring is not required. In addition, some adverse effects of unfractionated heparin, such as thrombocytopenia, appear to be less likely.

In patients with DVT, subcutaneous administration of heparin is at least as effective as continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin in preventing complications and reducing the risk of recurrence. 9 Outpatient management of DVT using LMW heparin for short-term anticoagulation until warfarin is at a therapeutic level is safe and cost-effective, despite the higher cost of the heparin. Enoxaparin was the first LMW heparin approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of DVT in a dosage of 1 mg per kg twice daily or 1. 5 mg once daily. Dalteparin, another LMW heparin, is approved only for prophylaxis of DVT. In clinical trials of DVT treatment. Promising results have been shown for a protocol in which warfarin is initiated in a dosage of 10 mg per day. 16 In one study, 16 consecutive outpatients being treated with LMW heparin for DVT or PE were randomized to a 5-mg or 10-mg warfarin protocol. An INR higher than 1.

9 was achieved an average of
1. 4 days sooner in the patients who received warfarin according to the 10-mg protocol. Clot recurrence, bleeding events, and morbidity did not differ in the two treatment groups.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs in ∼1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, corresponding to ∼300000 to 600000 events in the United States annually.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about treatment of VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 28 recommendations for the initial management of VTE, primary treatment, secondary prevention, and treatment of recurrent VTE events.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, use of an international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 over a lower INR range for patients with VTE who use a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for secondary prevention, and use of indefinite anticoagulation for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE. Conditional recommendations include the preference for home treatment over hospital-based treatment for uncomplicated DVT and PE at low risk for complications and a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over VKA for primary treatment of VTE.

### Effect of weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus fixed-dose prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin on venous thromboembolism among noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19: the COVI-DOSE trial, a multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4 trial [^111MPEKc]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the occurrence of a symptomatic venous thromboembolism event during hospital stay or up to the 28 first days of randomization if the stay was longer. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism was defined by the occurrence of symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (either proximal or distal), and/or symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or a sudden death for which no other cause could be identified. All events were diagnosed according to current guidelines. Other effectiveness outcomes were the occurrence of a type of venous thromboembolism other than those targeted by the primary objective (superficial vein thrombosis, thombosis of a catheter/extracorporeal dialysis circuit/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and the occurrence of a symptomatic arterial thrombosis. Safety outcomes assessed during hospitalization (up to day 28) were the occurrence of major bleedingor clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Other outcomes were the net clinical benefit, defined by a composite criterion associating venous thromboembolism and major bleeding, and all-cause mortality, during hospitalization and at day 60 after inclusion. All suspected events were adjudicated by a central independent committee (Supplementary appendix) whose members were unaware of the treatment assignments.

### High doses of warfarin are more beneficial than its low doses in patients with deep vein thrombosis [^113gMbgY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of enoxaparin in outpatient treatment of deep vein thrombosis have been well studied. The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of a 10-mg loading dose of warfarin with 5 mg of the drug and enoxaparin in achieving the international normalized ratio (INR) range.

Methods

This randomized clinical trial was performed in the emergency department (ED) of our study. International normalized ratio was checked daily for 7 days and on the 14th day. Based on the patient's INR on the third day, the doses were adjusted. Patients received enoxaparin (1.5 mg/kg per day) simultaneously until the therapeutic range of INR was achieved for 2 consecutive days.

Result

The side effects were compatible in both groups. There was a significant difference in the INR rates of the 2 groups recorded on the third, fourth, and seventh days.

Conclusion

The 10-mg loading dose of warfarin induces the therapeutic range of INR earlier than the 5-mg dose without causing any significant difference in the side effects. More cases in the 10-mg group had INR levels higher than 3; the very dose, therefore, is recommended as the loading dose in cases of outpatients with deep vein thrombosis referring to the ED. Tight control of INR, after the third day of treatment, is also recommended in these cases.

### High-dose vs. standard-dose heparin for VTE prophylaxis… [^113HisLi]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer In most patients weighing more than 220 lb, high-dose heparin prophylaxis does not further reduce the risk of VTE compared with standard-dose heparin. In patients with a body mass index greater than 40 kg per m. 1 The patients were divided into high-dose and standard-dose groups. Patients were excluded if they were receiving enoxaparin or therapeutic anticoagulation; if they were admitted with VTE or bleeding; if they were pregnant, peripartum, imprisoned, or paraplegic; if they had a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; or if they underwent surgery.

A 2014 retrospective cohort study of adult medical and surgical inpatients weighing at least 220 lb compared 2, 461 patients receiving sub-cutaneous high-dose heparin or enoxaparin with 6, 780 patients receiving standard-dose heparin or enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis and bleeding. A 2016 retrospective cohort study of adult medical and surgical inpatients weighing more than 220 lb compared 751 patients receiving subcutaneous high-dose heparin with 584 patients receiving standard-dose heparin for VTE prophylaxis and bleeding. 3 Patients were excluded if they were receiving enoxaparin or anticoagulation, were hospitalized less than 48 hours, or had a history of atrial fibrillation or VTE. In-hospital VTE rates did not differ significantly between the high-dose and standard-dose groups. A hemoglobin decrease of at least 2 g per dL in any 24-hour period was greater in the high-dose group. Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^115iv1JQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is based on antithrombotic therapy, initially with parenteral administration of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for five to seven days, then subsequent long-term therapy with oral vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin). Pentasaccharides are novel anticoagulants that may be favourable over standard therapy due to their predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a harmful effect of heparins, appears to be rare during treatment with pentasaccharides.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and harms of pentasaccharides for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (22 March 2017) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2017, Issue 2) (searched 22 March 2017). We searched clinical trials databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies and the reference lists of relevant articles for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which people 18 years of age or older with a DVT confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive a pentasaccharide (fondaparinux, idraparinux, or idrabiotaparinux) for the treatment of DVT in comparison with standard therapy or other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data characterising the included trials according to the methods, participants, interventions, and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and employed the GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of the evidence. The main primary outcome for efficacy was recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the main primary outcome for harm was major and clinically relevant bleeding. Since our outcomes were dichotomous, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We combined the effects of different comparisons through a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included five randomised controlled trials of 6981 participants comparing pentasaccharides with standard therapy or other pentasaccharides. The quality of the evidence varied depending on the outcome and was judged as of moderate to very low quality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to risk of bias or imprecision, or both. Two studies evaluated fondaparinux, at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg, plus vitamin K antagonist in comparison with standard therapy. A meta-analysis of these two studies showed no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.47; 2658 participants); moderate-quality evidence. The frequencies of major bleeding were similar between interventions in the initial period of treatment (approximately five days) (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.44; 2645 participants) and at three months' follow-up (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; 2645 participants). We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate. One study (757 participants) compared idrabiotaparinux (3.0 mg) with idraparinux (2.5 mg) and demonstrated no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at six months' follow-up (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at six-month follow-up was less frequent in participants receiving idrabiotaparinux versus participants treated with idraparinux (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71); low-quality evidence. The effect of an initial treatment with LMWH followed by three months of idraparinux (10 mg) showed no clear difference from standard therapy for risk of recurrent VTE (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.90; 263 participants); very low-quality evidence; one study. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. The frequency of major and other clinically relevant bleeding at three months' follow-up ranged from 2% to 15% in participants receiving LMWH and increasing doses of idraparinux of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg. When dosage groups were combined, there was no clear difference in major plus other clinically relevant bleeding or in major bleeding alone between the idraparinux treatment group and the standard therapy group (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.40; 659 participants; RR 3.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 28.19; 659 participants, respectively); very low-quality evidence. One study (2904 participants) compared idraparinux (2.5 mg) to standard therapy. There was no clear difference in the risk of recurrent VTE at three months' follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.48); low-quality evidence. Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was not reported. Major bleeding at three months of follow-up appeared to be similar in the idraparinux group and the standard therapy group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.47); very low-quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that the effects of fondaparinux at doses of 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg, and 10.0 mg plus vitamin K antagonist are similar in terms of recurrent VTE and risk of major bleeding compared with standard treatment for DVT. Low-quality evidence suggests equal efficacy of idraparinux at 2.5 mg and the equimolar dose of 3.0 mg of idrabiotaparinux with regard to recurrent VTE, but a higher frequency of major bleeding was observed in participants treated with idraparinux. We judged evidence on the effectiveness of idraparinux compared with standard therapy, with or without initial treatment with LMWH, and on associated bleeding risk to be low to very low quality, therefore we have very limited confidence in the estimated effects. The observed similar effectiveness in terms of recurrent DVT and harmful effects in terms of bleeding risk with fondaparinux plus vitamin K antagonist compared to standard treatment for DVT suggest that it may be an alternative to conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of DVT in certain circumstances.

Intravenous UFH dosing strategies and monitoring — five RCTs compared initial IV UFH dosing according to a weight-based nomogram with a fixed-dose approach; in the remaining three RCTs a total of 292 patients were randomized, study follow-up periods ranged from 48 h to 3 months, and the two weight-based and fixed-dose approaches achieved similar therapeutic aPTTs during the first 24 to 48 h. Event data included "vs two (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.02–1.13) in the fixed-dose vs weight-adjusted group and only one major bleed (fixed-dose group)", and "These results suggest that weight-adjusted dosing and fixed dosing of IV UFH are similar in outcomes", though "Small numbers of clinical events and failure to specify the timing of thromboembolic complications are major limitations of available studies". Either regimen can be monitored with plasma heparin levels, but there is no evidence to suggest that monitoring improves clinical outcomes, and "The evidence linking plasma heparin levels of 0.3 to 0.7 International Units/mL anti-Xa activity by the amidolytic assay to the occurrence of either bleeding or thrombosis is also of low quality".

Anticoagulation for acute iliofemoral DVT — timing and selection: Prompt achievement and maintenance of fully therapeutic anticoagulation are essential for patients with acute iliofemoral DVT unless major contraindications exist (Level of Evidence A, Strength of Recommendation Strong), and consideration of ETR should not be permitted to delay the rapid achievement of fully therapeutic anticoagulation; weight-based, twice-daily, subcutaneously injected LMWH for most ETR candidates is suggested because it achieves therapeutic levels faster than intravenous UFH, enables consistent anticoagulation, and the safety of concomitantly using direct-acting oral anticoagulants with fibrinolytic drugs is uncertain; UFH is reasonable for periprocedural use provided therapeutic levels are reached quickly, active monitoring and timely dose adjustments are important, UFH may be maintained at fully therapeutic levels during on-table components and reduced to subtherapeutic levels during fibrinolytic drug infusions, and the patient's individualized risk of bleeding should be carefully considered when calibrating UFH levels.

In 2 instances where the original panel suggested one option over another, the Latin American panel considered both options equally reasonable, including recommending hospital treatment as an equally valid alternative to home treatment for patients with pulmonary embolism and low risk for complications, and addressing life-threatening bleeding during VTE treatment by making a conditional recommendation for prothrombin complex concentrates or fresh-frozen plasma. In 1 instance regarding the dose of Direct Oral Anticoagulants after the initial anticoagulation period, the original conditional recommendation for a low or a standard dose was narrowed, and the Latin American panel selected a standard dose based on the availability of formulations within the region.

### The pharmacoeconomics of deep vein thrombosis treatment [^111W5Qca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, remains a common and costly condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment options for initial management of DVT include unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), and fondaparinux, which is the first of a new class of pentasaccharide antithrombotic agents with anti-factor Xa activity. LMWHs are an important tool in DVT management, offering advantages over UFH such as ease of dosing, lack of need for coagulation monitoring, and reduced risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Fondaparinux is also characterized by a simple dosing regimen, no need for coagulation monitoring, and potentially a lower risk of HIT compared with LMWH. In a recent clinical trial of DVT management, efficacy and bleeding rates with fondaparinux appeared similar to those observed with LMWH. In contrast to LMWH, fondaparinux is generally given as a fixed dose across a range of patient weights rather than calculated per individual patient weight. Given the increasing economic burden of VTE, particularly due to its increased rate among the elderly, pharmacoeconomic analyses have become a particularly useful tool to aid in selecting among similarly effective and safe agents for VTE treatment. A recent cost-effective analysis demonstrated that fondaparinux use offers an attractive economic alternative to other agents for initial DVT therapy that could yield cost savings without compromising clinical outcomes or patient safety.

### Anticoagulants in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^113X31X1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) followed by oral administration of warfarin remains the cornerstone of clinical treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Results from numerous clinical trials demonstrate that subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is at least as effective and as safe as IV UFH. Treatment with LMWH has several clinical advantages over treatment with UFH, including less-frequent dosing and elimination of the need for monitoring. The introduction of LMWHs has made it possible for physicians to offer outpatient treatment of DVT, with the associated advantage of reduced costs due to shortened hospital stays. However, the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy after DVT is still debated, as it depends on an individual patient's potential risk for recurrence or treatment-associated complications. Patients are usually risk stratified on the basis of multiple clinical characteristics, including the location of thromboemboli, the presence or absence of cancer, the assumed etiology or cause of DVT (idiopathic vs. due to a transient risk factor), and the presence of certain thrombophilic conditions. High-risk patients often receive inpatient treatment with UFH or LMWH and are candidates for long-term (≥ 6 months) oral anticoagulation, whereas short-term anticoagulation (3 to 6 months) is usually indicated for patients who are at lower risk of recurrence or therapeutic complications and who can be treated with LMWH on an outpatient basis. The introduction of LMWHs has resulted in significant clinical progress for the treatment of DVT.

### Comparison of six-month outcome of patients initially treated for acute deep vein thrombosis with a low molecular weight heparin certoparin at a fixed, body-weight-independent dosage or unfractionated heparin [^114XE83X]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Body weight-adjusted subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been proven to be more effective and safer than aPTT-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the initial treatment of patients with acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) based on analyses pooling the results of studies with different LMWHs. We investigated whether these findings hold for a particular LMWH by pooling the results of two independent studies.

Design and Methods

Patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT (n = 1758), proven by ascending phlebography or compression ultrasound, received either a fixed, body weight independent dose of 8,000 IU Certoparin b.i.d. (n = 893) for 8.6 days or intravenous UFH (n = 865) adjusted to an 1.5 to 3.0-fold prolongation of the aPTT for 12.0 days both followed by vitamin K-antagonists for 6 months.

Results

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) re-occurred in 5.1% and 3.1% (RRR 0.62, CI 0.39–0.98, 2p = 0.04), major bleeding in 3.5% and 1.9% (RRR 0.55, CI 0.31–0.99, 2p = 0.05), mortality in 3.6% and 2.1% (RRR 0.59, CI 0.34–1.04, 2p = 0.08), and the composite outcome of all three events in 10.3% and 6.3% (RRR 0.61, CI 0.44 to 0.84, 2p = 0.002) of patients at 6 months initially randomised to UFH and LMWH, respectively.

Interpretation and Conclusions

The initial treatment of acute DVT with a fixed dose of the LMWH, certoparin, is more effective in reducing, over 6 months, the re-occurrence of VTE and the composite outcome of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality without any relation of the bodyweight of the patients to recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding complications.

### Subcutaneous enoxaparin once or twice daily compared with intravenous unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolic disease [^115vwU4Y]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparins administered subcutaneously once or twice daily have been reported to be as safe and efficacious as intravenous unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolic disease.

Objective

To determine whether subcutaneous enoxaparin administered once or twice daily is as effective as continuously infused unfractionated heparin in acute symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease.

Design

Randomized, controlled, partially blinded equivalence trial.

Setting

74 hospitals in 16 countries.

Patients

900 patients with symptomatic lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis, including 287 (32%) with confirmed pulmonary embolism.

Interventions

Initial therapy with dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin compared with subcutaneous enoxaparin at fixed dosages of 1.0 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily. Long-term oral anticoagulation was started in all patients within 72 hours of randomization.

Measurements

Clinical end points assessed during a 3-month follow-up period.

Results

Equivalent efficacy was seen in the heparin group and both enoxaparin groups. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism recurred in 12 of 290 patients receiving unfractionated heparin (4.1%), 13 of 298 patients receiving once-daily enoxaparin (4.4%), and 9 of 312 patients receiving twice-daily enoxaparin (2.9%). Compared with unfractionated heparin, the treatment difference was 0.2% (95% CI, -3.04% to 3.49%) for once-daily enoxaparin and -1.2% (CI, -4.2% to 1.7%) for twice-daily enoxaparin. Incidence of major hemorrhage did not differ among the three treatment groups. Major hemorrhage occurred in 6 of 290 patients (2.1%) in the unfractionated heparin group, 5 of 298 patients (1.7%) in the once-daily enoxaparin group, and 4 of 312 patients (1.3%) in the twice-daily enoxaparin group.

Conclusions

Subcutaneous enoxaparin once or twice daily is as effective and safe as dose-adjusted, continuously infused unfractionated heparin in the prevention of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease.

### Algorithm for subcutaneous heparin treatment of DVT… [^11437bW7]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities are usually treated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin followed by long-term oral anticoagulation. Nomograms may help to determine the rate of intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin that ensures prompt, adequate anticoagulation. Subcutaneous heparin has been shown to be as effective and safe as intravenous heparin. Prandoni and associates devised a weight-based algorithm for subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin following administration of an intravenous loading dose. Seventy symptomatic outpatients with a first episode of proximal venous thrombosis were given an intravenous bolus of sodium heparin and a subcutaneous injection of calcium heparin in dosages adjusted according to body weight.

The activated partial thromboplastin time was first measured after six hours, and subsequent dosage adjustments during the first 48 hours were scheduled according to the algorithm. The aPTT was performed in the mid-interval. After the first 48 hours, heparin administration was managed on the basis of daily aPTT determinations. Therapy was discontinued if the International Normalized Ratio was greater than 2 for two consecutive days in patients who had received heparin for at least five days and who started sodium warfarin therapy on the first or second day. Therapy with sodium warfarin was continued for 12 weeks, and patients were followed after one and three months. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Proper anticoagulation was achieved in 87 percent of patients within 24 hours and in 99 percent of patients within 48 hours.

None of the patients had major bleeding or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolism recurred in only three patients. The mean daily amount of heparin required to prolong the aPTT during the first 24 hours was greater than the dosage usually required with intravenous heparin administration. The authors conclude that the use of a weight-based algorithm for the subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin may simplify the initial treatment of venous thromboembolic disorders. This regimen allows early patient mobilization and early discharge of appropriate patients. This approach is significantly less expensive than similar treatment with low-molecular-weight heparins.

Heparin dosing nomogram — An example dose-adjustment scheme specifies an initial dose of "80 units/kg bolus, then 18 units/kg/h", with adjustments by aPTT: if "aPTT, < 35 s" give "80 units/kg bolus, then increase 4 units/kg/h"; if "aPTT, 35–45 s" give "40 units/kg bolus, then increase 2 units/kg/h"; if "aPTT, 46–70 s" make "No change"; if "aPTT, 71–90 s" "Decrease infusion rate by 2 units/kg/h"; and if "aPTT, > 90 s" "Hold infusion 1 h, then decrease infusion rate by 3 units/kg/h". A footnote states the "Therapeutic aPTT range of 46–70 s corresponded to anti-Xa activity of 0.3–0.7 units/mL".

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^116cnEcC]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower-extremity DVT thrombolysis — prevention of bleeding emphasizes technical access, dose limits, and monitoring. It should be confirmed that venous access was routinely obtained with US guidance and a micropuncture needle, and the popliteal vein may be used as the preferred access site. When recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is used, weight-based dosing at 0.01 mg/kg/h (not to exceed 1.0 mg/h) is recommended. Monitoring should include blood draws for hematocrit, platelet count, and PTT at least every 12 hours, and serial fibrinogen monitoring during CDT may help to prevent complications. It should be confirmed that arterial punctures and intramuscular injections did not occur during thrombolysis, and that thrombolytic progress was assessed by venography at least every 24 hours. For unfractionated heparin, subtherapeutic dosing — 1.2–1.7 times the control PTT — was reasonably effective and safe in one randomized trial, and low molecular weight heparin at twice-daily, weight-based, FDA-approved dosing may also be a safe method during CDT/PCDT though data are limited. One small study suggests argatroban may also be safe, but heparin-based therapy should be preferred in patients without contraindications until larger studies are available.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114bYgHm]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, initial management, provoked thrombosis, ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering adjusted-dose VKAs (target INR 2.5, with an overlapping period of parenteral anticoagulation) rather than DOACs for the treatment phase in patients with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome receiving anticoagulant therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111SxyZo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.

### Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^112WwGzf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be effective and safe in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE). They may also be effective for the initial treatment of VTE. This is the third update of the Cochrane Review first published in 1999.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin compared to adjusted dose unfractionated heparin (intravenous or subcutaneous) for the initial treatment of people with venous thromboembolism (acute deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (15 September 2016). In addition the CIS searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library (searched 15 September 2016) and trials' registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing fixed dose subcutaneous LMWH with adjusted dose intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) in people with VTE.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed for quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Six studies were added to this update resulting in a total of 29 included studies (n = 10,390). The quality of the studies was downgraded as there was a risk of bias in some individual studies relating to risk of attrition and reporting bias; in addition several studies did not adequately report on the randomisation methods used nor on how the treatment allocation was concealed. During the initial treatment period, the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolic events was lower in participants treated with LMWH than in participants treated with UFH (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to 0.98; 6238 participants; 18 studies; P = 0.04; moderate-quality evidence). After a follow-up of three months, the period in most of the studies for which oral anticoagulant therapy was given, the incidence of recurrent VTE was lower in participants treated with LMWH than in participants with UFH (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90; 6661 participants; 16 studies; P = 0.005; moderate-quality evidence). Furthermore, at the end of follow-up, LMWH was associated with a lower rate of recurrent VTE than UFH (Peto OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.88; 9489 participants; 22 studies; P = 0.001; moderate-quality evidence). LMWH was also associated with a reduction in thrombus size compared to UFH (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.82; 2909 participants; 16 studies; P < 0.00001; low-quality evidence), but there was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 56%). Major haemorrhages occurred less frequently in participants treated with LMWH than in those treated with UFH (Peto OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 8780 participants; 25 studies; P = 0.02; moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH (Peto OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; 9663 participants; 24 studies; P = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review presents moderate-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced the incidence of recurrent thrombotic complications and occurrence of major haemorrhage during initial treatment; and low-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced thrombus size when compared to UFH for the initial treatment of VTE. There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH (moderate-quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria and downgraded due to concerns over risk of bias in individual trials together with a lack of reporting on the randomisation and concealment of treatment allocation methods used. The quality of the evidence for reduction of thrombus size was further downgraded because of heterogeneity between studies.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).
