## Question

What conditions can cause headache with blurry vision?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what conditions can cause headache with blurry vision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which diseases explicitly co-present with headache and blurred vision. Then, I should categorize them by pathophysiology to structure the differential. Next, I will prioritize red flags requiring immediate action versus urgent workups. After that, I need to extract distinguishing bedside clues and testing strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations and medication-induced causes, and synthesize practical triage and evaluation steps with citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the core co-occurrence across major categories. Neurologic emergencies include subarachnoid hemorrhage with thunderclap headache, photophobia, and blurred vision; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome with headache and visual loss; and idiopathic intracranial hypertension with headache and papilledema threatening vision [^116t31zc] [^114WR6B7] [^113BDzZK]. Primary ocular disease such as acute angle-closure glaucoma causes severe headache/eye pain with halos and blurred vision, while optic neuritis can present with vision loss and headache or eye-movement pain; vascular disorders like giant cell arteritis, retinal ischemia/TMVL, and cerebral venous thrombosis can link headache and visual symptoms; and migraine spectrum disorders commonly combine head pain with visual aura or disturbance, although "blurry vision" per se is less specific than classic aura descriptions [^notfound] [^1172LqAT] [^115wevAu] [^notfound] [^1142x3cz]. Hold on, I should verify medication triggers and neoplastic/structural causes as well; topiramate-induced bilateral angle closure, orbital or intracranial tumors, and sinus or dural lesions can produce both headache and blurry vision in select contexts [^116cDzjq] [^113zADiS] [^114uejE9] [^113J6ntw].

> Next, I will prioritize true time-critical emergencies where I need to act within minutes to hours. Subarachnoid hemorrhage with sudden "worst headache" plus photophobia, neck stiffness, or visual complaints necessitates immediate noncontrast head CT and further workup if CT is negative but suspicion remains; this is a do-not-miss diagnosis due to rebleeding and mortality risk [^116t31zc] [^113zxBQ9]. Acute angle-closure glaucoma presents with severe eye pain/headache, halos, nausea, and blurred vision and requires emergent ophthalmologic management to prevent permanent vision loss; medication triggers like topiramate should be stopped promptly while intraocular pressure is treated [^113zADiS] [^116cDzjq]. Giant cell arteritis in patients over 50 with new headache and visual symptoms requires immediate steroids while confirming with inflammatory markers and vascular evaluation to prevent contralateral blindness; TMVL may be the harbinger and requires carotid/cardiac workup [^1172LqAT] [^113zADiS]. PRES in the setting of severe hypertension, eclampsia, cytotoxic therapy, or autoimmune disease presents with headache, visual loss, seizures, and encephalopathy and demands blood pressure control and MRI confirmation; delay risks permanent deficits despite the "reversible" moniker [^114WR6B7] [^113Cj1uu]. Retinal artery occlusion and high-risk TMVL syndromes also require urgent stroke-prevention pathways due to early high stroke risk [^113zADiS] [^1172LqAT].

> Now, I should review urgent but not always hyperacute conditions that still threaten vision or brain function. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension classically affects young women with obesity and causes daily headache with transient visual obscurations and papilledema; urgent confirmation with neuroimaging to exclude mass and measurement of opening pressure guides therapy, and fulminant cases may need CSF diversion to rescue vision [^113BDzZK]. Wait, let me verify bedside adjuncts: optic nerve sheath ultrasound can support elevated ICP suspicion in IIH, but I need LP and imaging to finalize the diagnosis and exclude mimics [^112BgbbZ]. Optic neuritis typically presents with decreased visual acuity and pain with eye movements, and can be confused with IIH when disc edema coexists; careful history, orbital MRI, and demyelinating antibody testing help distinguish ON from IIH when both cause disc swelling and headache [^111LXJq3]. Cerebral venous thrombosis can produce headache, papilledema, and visual symptoms, particularly in inflammatory or hypercoagulable states such as Behçet's, requiring prompt neuroimaging with venography and anticoagulation when confirmed [^115wevAu]. Space-occupying lesions and pituitary apoplexy belong in the differential when headache with progressive visual deficits evolves subacutely, warranting MRI and neuro-ophthalmology input [^113zADiS].

> Let me consider the migraine spectrum carefully so I don't overcall secondary causes. Migraine with aura often features visual phenomena such as scintillations or fortification spectra that precede or accompany headache, whereas nonspecific "blurry vision" without positive visual phenomena is less typical of aura; still, many patients describe photophobia and visual discomfort during attacks, and postdromal symptoms can linger up to 48 hours [^112w56ZH]. I should confirm the pathophysiology I am invoking: cortical spreading depression and trigeminovascular activation underlie aura and pain phases, and this neurovascular framework explains why visual symptoms and headache co-occur even without structural pathology on imaging [^1142x3cz]. But wait, what if a patient's "visual aura" has changed or is unusually frequent? That is a cue to re-image and reconsider secondary causes like occipital lesions or aura modifiers rather than assuming benign migraine each time [^113y8FjZ].

> I will now examine medication- and toxin-related contributors because they are frequently overlooked and often reversible. Topiramate can precipitate bilateral acute angle-closure glaucoma soon after dose changes, causing severe headache and acute blurry vision that mandates drug cessation and emergent IOP-lowering therapy [^116cDzjq]. Pregabalin commonly causes blurred vision and headache in clinical trials, which can mimic or exacerbate primary headache disorders; persistence should prompt reassessment of the regimen and ophthalmologic evaluation as needed [^114yhzjJ]. Several other agents list blurred vision and headache among adverse effects, including chloroquine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, sulindac, amantadine, and agents like Unituxin or ocular surface drugs such as Miebo; the clinical imperative is to anchor symptoms to timing of drug initiation, dose change, and dechallenge when safe [^113xKHy6] [^112ybsrj] [^116wUhpX] [^117Y6oGg] [^116A9LPH] [^117KrG8U] [^1136A1kt]. Hold on, I should verify angle-closure risk with anticholinergics: amantadine has mydriatic effects and is contraindicated in untreated angle-closure glaucoma, reinforcing the need to screen ocular history when prescribing [^116A9LPH].

> Next, I should review special populations where the threshold to act is lower. In pregnancy and the postpartum period, preeclampsia/eclampsia with headache, visual disturbances, and hypertension is an obstetric emergency; PRES often coexists and improves with blood pressure control and seizure prophylaxis, so obstetric and neurologic teams must be engaged early [^114GCpce] [^114WR6B7]. In pediatrics, PRES can occur in ESRD or chemotherapy contexts and may recur with hypertensive crises; a high index of suspicion is warranted with headache and new visual complaints, as timely treatment can fully reverse vision loss [^114WR6B7]. In older adults, new headache with visual symptoms demands exclusion of GCA and ischemic retinal events to prevent bilateral blindness or stroke, necessitating immediate inflammatory marker testing and empiric steroids when suspicion is high while diagnostic confirmation proceeds [^1172LqAT].

> I need to ensure the evaluation pathway is practical and risk-stratified. For red flags such as thunderclap onset, focal deficits, papilledema with altered mental status, fever/meningismus, or concern for acute glaucoma, initiate emergent neuroimaging or ophthalmologic tonometry and slit lamp as appropriate; noncontrast CT is first-line for suspected intracranial hemorrhage, MRI/MRV for suspected CVT or PRES, and immediate ophthalmology for suspected angle closure [^115f3rxm] [^113zxBQ9] [^113zADiS]. Let me first confirm bedside priorities: vital signs including blood pressure, full neurologic and funduscopic exam for papilledema, visual acuity and fields, pupil exam for RAPD, and ocular surface/anterior chamber depth if eye pain is prominent; check ESR/CRP when GCA is a consideration and activate carotid/cardiac evaluation for TMVL [^113zADiS] [^1172LqAT]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if IIH is suspected, exclude secondary causes with brain imaging before LP, and if vision is rapidly declining, escalate to urgent CSF diversion while initiating acetazolamide to preserve function [^113BDzZK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost misstated a key feature of optic neuritis — I initially thought it is typically painless, but I should correct that: pain with eye movements is common and helps distinguish ON from painless ischemic optic neuropathies or purely refractive "blur", so I need to explicitly ask about that symptom and corroborate with orbital MRI when the fundus is equivocal [^113zADiS]. Also, I see my earlier "Urgent Neurological Conditions" list was cut off at "8"; let me reconsider and complete it now by emphasizing IIH, optic neuritis, cerebral venous thrombosis, and subacute mass lesions as high-priority entities for expedited neuro-ophthalmic workup when headache and visual symptoms progress over days to weeks without a thunderclap pattern [^113BDzZK] [^111LXJq3] [^115wevAu] [^113zADiS].

> To synthesize, I should double-check triage: immediate care is warranted for thunderclap headache, severe hypertension with encephalopathy or seizures, acute painful red eye with halos, age over 50 with new headache and visual symptoms, or sudden monocular vision loss; otherwise, urgent evaluation within 24 hours is appropriate for progressive headache with papilledema, suspected optic neuritis, or features suggesting CVT or mass effect [^115f3rxm] [^112hzPTV]. Finally, I will anchor the plan to modifiable contributors, including prompt removal of offending drugs like topiramate when angle closure is suspected, and coordinate neuro-ophthalmology, neurology, and ophthalmology follow-up while ensuring blood pressure control and stroke prevention pathways are activated when vascular etiologies are on the table [^116cDzjq] [^1172LqAT] [^113Cj1uu].

Headache with blurry vision can signal serious disease. The most common causes are **migraine with aura** [^112w56ZH] and **idiopathic intracranial hypertension**. Other causes include **acute angle-closure glaucoma** [^113zADiS], **giant cell arteritis** [^1172LqAT], **optic neuritis** [^111LXJq3], **posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome** [^114WR6B7], and **subarachnoid hemorrhage** [^116t31zc]. Red flags include sudden severe headache, vision loss, focal deficits, or papilledema [^115f3rxm]; urgent evaluation is required.

---

## Primary headache disorders

### Migraine with aura

Migraine with aura presents with a unilateral, pulsating headache and a visual aura — such as scintillating scotomas, fortification spectra, or transient visual loss [^112w56ZH]. The pathophysiology involves cortical spreading depression with trigeminovascular activation [^1142x3cz]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with neuroimaging considered for atypical features or when red flags are present.

---

### Tension-type headache

Tension-type headache causes bilateral, pressing pain and may include mild blurred vision or photophobia [^111qXuTU]. The pathophysiology involves muscle tension and central sensitization. Diagnosis is **clinical** [^112CEfYV], with neuroimaging reserved for atypical presentations or when red flags are present.

---

## Secondary headache disorders

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension presents with headache, transient visual obscurations, papilledema, and pulsatile tinnitus [^113BDzZK]. It is characterized by **elevated intracranial pressure** without a mass lesion. Diagnosis relies on MRI/MRV to exclude secondary causes and a lumbar puncture demonstrating an elevated opening pressure [^112BgbbZ].

---

### Acute angle-closure glaucoma

Acute angle-closure glaucoma causes severe headache, eye pain, blurred vision with halos [^113zADiS], nausea, and vomiting. The mechanism is **a sudden rise in intraocular pressure** due to angle closure. Diagnosis is made by tonometry, gonioscopy, and a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination.

---

### Giant cell arteritis (GCA)

Giant cell arteritis manifests with temporal headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, and visual loss [^1172LqAT]. It is a large-vessel vasculitis that causes tissue ischemia. Diagnosis is supported by elevated ESR/CRP and confirmed by temporal artery biopsy, with **urgent ophthalmology involvement**.

---

### Optic neuritis

Optic neuritis presents with headache, eye pain worsened by movement, blurred vision, and color desaturation [^111LXJq3]. The cause is **demyelination** or inflammation of the optic nerve. Diagnosis is guided by MRI of the orbits/brain, visual evoked potentials, and, when indicated, a lumbar puncture.

---

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome presents with headache, blurred vision, seizures, and altered mental status [^114WR6B7]. It reflects vasogenic edema triggered by **severe hypertension** or cytotoxic drugs. Diagnosis is established by MRI demonstrating posterior-predominant white matter edema.

---

### Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)

Subarachnoid hemorrhage presents with a sudden, severe "thunderclap" [^116t31zc] headache, blurred vision, photophobia, and neck stiffness. It results from rupture of an intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Diagnosis involves a **noncontrast CT head**, lumbar puncture when CT is nondiagnostic, and cerebral angiography.

---

## Systemic conditions

### Hypertensive crisis

Hypertensive crisis features severe headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status [^112hzPTV]. It results from an acute elevation in blood pressure causing **end-organ damage** [^114WR6B7]. Diagnosis is based on blood pressure measurement, funduscopic examination, and laboratory evaluation.

---

### Eclampsia

Eclampsia presents with headache, blurred vision, seizures, hypertension, and proteinuria [^114GCpce]. It is a **pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder**. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by blood pressure assessment and urinalysis.

---

## Medication-induced causes

Several **medications can cause** headache with blurred vision, including:

- **Pregabalin (Lyrica)**: Blurred vision, headache [^114yhzjJ].
- **Lamotrigine**: Blurred vision, headache [^116wUhpX].
- **Carbamazepine**: Blurred vision, headache [^112ybsrj].
- **Topiramate**: Acute angle-closure glaucoma [^116cDzjq].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- Sudden severe headache ("thunderclap")
- Sudden vision loss or visual field defect
- Papilledema or optic disc swelling
- Focal neurologic deficits [^112hzPTV]
- Altered mental status or seizures
- Fever, neck stiffness, or immunocompromised state
- Recent trauma or anticoagulant use

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, associated symptoms, medication use, systemic conditions.
- **Physical examination**: Neurologic exam, funduscopy, visual acuity, intraocular pressure.
- **Imaging**: MRI/CT head, MRV/CT venography, lumbar puncture, ophthalmologic evaluation [^113zxBQ9].

---

Headache with blurred vision spans primary and secondary disorders; **prompt recognition of red flags** and a structured diagnostic approach are critical to prevent vision loss or neurologic injury.

### Subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116t31zc]. Neurology (2013). High credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a disease that can be associated with several symptoms and conditions. These include loss of consciousness, nausea, low back pain, head injury, and intracranial aneurysm. Patients may also experience diplopia, polycystic kidney disease, hemiparesis, blurred vision, photophobia, and thunderclap headache. Additional symptoms include limb paresis, the presence of subarachnoid blood, headache, meningismus, seizure, and xanthochromia. Neck stiffness, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypertension, tobacco use, and cranial nerve palsy are also associated with the condition. Furthermore, increased CSF RBCs, alcohol consumption, focal neurologic deficits, vomiting, and altered mental status are possible manifestations of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### Recurrent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a pediatric patient with end-stage renal disease [^114WR6B7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a condition manifested by altered mental status, seizures, headaches, and visual loss. Specific abnormalities are seen by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Awareness of this syndrome is important for emergency physicians because visual loss can be reversible with prompt treatment of the underlying cause.

We present a case of recurrent PRES in a 14-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) for headache and photosensitivity. A patient with a history of end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology was brought in by her mother for headache and photosensitivity. The patient developed blurry vision, had a seizure in the ED, and required intubation. She was discharged two weeks later with a complete return of vision.

The same patient presented to the ED many times during the next several months for hypertensive emergencies, with three subsequent episodes that involved either seizures, vision loss, or both. Each of the episodes resolved with aggressive control of blood pressure in the pediatric intensive care unit.

PRES should be considered in all patients presenting to the ED with visual loss, seizures, or headache, and can recur in some individuals. Prompt treatment can help prevent permanent vision loss.

### Bilateral optic neuritis in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a case report [^111LXJq3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Both idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and optic neuritis can present with visual loss, headaches, and optic disc edema. Therefore, a differential diagnosis of IIH and optic neuritis is needed for patients with bilateral optic disc swelling. Ophthalmologists should carefully analyze the patient's history, imaging data, and demyelinating disease antibody tests. Orbital MRI can provide useful clues in differentiating the diagnosis, as optic nerve sheath enhancement has been shown to be a unique feature of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) and is not commonly observed in IIH- or multiple sclerosis (MS)-related optic neuritis.

In this case, the patient was a middle-aged female with progressive bilateral vision loss and optic disc congestion and swelling. Orbital MRI enhancement revealed bilateral optic nerve thickening and enhancement. Initially, optic neuritis (ON) was considered. However, given her high BMI (29.1 kg/m²), MRI findings of optic nerve sheath widening and fluid accumulation, and the presence of recent headaches and tinnitus, along with lumbar puncture (LP) showing an intracranial pressure (ICP) of 270 mmH₂O, IIH was also considered. After further progression of vision loss and worsening optic disc swelling, we concluded that optic neuritis, not increased ICP, was the primary cause of her condition. This conclusion was supported by the improvement in her condition, as optic disc swelling from IIH is often symmetrical, with a more gradual onset. Additionally, the patient's vision improved significantly after optic neuritis treatment trial (ONTT) treatment, supporting the diagnosis of optic neuritis.

Although we believe that optic neuritis was the main cause of her bilateral vision loss and optic disc…

### Transient monocular visual loss: When is it an emergency [^1172LqAT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients who experience transient monocular vision loss (TMVL) commonly present to the emergency department for evaluation. Although multiple etiologies can cause TMVL, it is most important to identify patients with retinal ischemia and those with vasculitis (giant cell arteritis) as the cause of TMVL. Patients with transient retinal ischemia have the same risk of cardiovascular events and death as patients who experience transient brain ischemia. Patients with giant cell arteritis are at imminent risk of visual loss.

- **Case report**: A 65-year-old man noticed three separate episodes of sudden onset of blurry vision in one eye. Ophthalmologic examination was normal but, as his symptoms were compatible with a transient retinal ischemic attack, urgent investigations were initiated. He had normal inflammatory markers; however, a computed tomography angiogram of the brain and neck demonstrated a large plaque in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. Double anti-platelet therapy was started, and stenting of the involved carotid artery was performed. The patient was symptom-free at the last follow-up.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Patients with retinal ischemia as the etiology of TMVL are at high risk of cardiovascular events and death. Their risk of cerebrovascular accidents is highest within 48 hours from the episode of TMVL; thus, they should have an urgent ophthalmologic examination. If the examination is unrevealing, inflammatory markers should be checked, and an urgent stroke prevention protocol should be initiated. Appropriate management with medical or surgical interventions is critical.

### Rapidly progressive vision loss due to fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A diagnostic and management dilemma [^113BDzZK]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old obese woman presented with a decrease in vision in the right eye (RE) for 3 days. She reported a simultaneous onset of a holocranial headache that worsened on bending forward. She denied eye pain, pain on eye movements, and other ocular or neurological complaints. On examination, her distance best-corrected visual acuity was counting fingers at 1 meter in the RE and 20/20 in the left eye (LE). Color vision was subnormal in both eyes (BE). There was grade II relative afferent pupillary defect in the RE. Fundus examination showed disc edema in BE. Visual fields in the LE showed central scotoma extending nasally. A provisional diagnosis of papillitis was considered; however, contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits showed evidence of elevated intracranial pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was 42 cm H2O while the rest of the CSF analysis was normal. The diagnosis was revised to fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Management with medical therapy and an urgent thecoperitoneal shunt improved visual function in BE.

### Acute vision loss [^113zADiS]. Primary Care (2015). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, acute vision loss can be caused by:

- **Neurological conditions**: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, acute ischemic stroke
- **Vascular issues**: giant cell arteritis, central retinal vein occlusion, central retinal artery occlusion, amaurosis fugax, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
- **Ocular conditions**: vitreous hemorrhage, hyphema, retinal detachment, acute angle-closure glaucoma, uveitis, corneal foreign body, endophthalmitis, papillitis, keratitis, corneal opacity
- **Migraines**: ocular migraine, retinal migraine, migraine
- **Inherited or toxic causes**: Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, methanol poisoning, toxic optic neuropathy
- **Other causes**: pituitary apoplexy, acute macular neuroretinopathy, acute zonal occult outer retinopathy, functional visual loss

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^112w56ZH]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

In the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), migraine is classified into three main types: migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and chronic migraine. The clinical characteristics of each must be considered to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

- **Migraine without aura**: Migraine without aura is characterized by headache attacks that last 4–72 hours. Typical features of an attack include a unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity. However, bilateral pain is not uncommon. Population-based data indicate that approximately 40% of individuals with migraine report bilateral pain during attacks. The most common associated symptoms are photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Before the onset of pain, prodromal symptoms can include a depressed mood, yawning, fatigue, and cravings for specific foods. After resolution of the headache, postdromal symptoms can last up to 48 hours and often include tiredness, concentration difficulties, and neck stiffness.

- **Migraine with aura**: Approximately one-third of individuals with migraine experience aura, either with every attack or with some attacks. Aura is defined as transient focal neurological symptoms that usually precede, but sometimes accompany, the headache phase of a migraine attack. In more than 90% of affected individuals, aura manifests visually, classically as fortification spectra. Sensory symptoms occur in around 31% of affected individuals and are usually experienced as predominantly unilateral.

### SPL drug information for chloroquine phosphate [^113xKHy6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Common adverse reactions (1–10%) associated with the use of chloroquine phosphate PO (also known as Aralen) include abdominal pain, blurred vision, dizziness, headache, pruritus, skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Abnormal visuo-vestibular interactions in vestibular migraine: a cross sectional study [^1168pDMH]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

The role of visual aura is examined in this study. Subgroup analyses of the vestibular migraine and non-vertiginous migraine groups, based on the presence of visual aura, revealed no significant differences in vestibular-ocular reflex or perceptual thresholds. These results were consistent both before (P > 0.05, t-test) and after (P > 0.05, t-test) visual motion exposure.

### Osteoblastoma of the frontal sinuses presenting with headache and blurred vision: case report and review of the literature [^114uejE9]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Osteoblastoma is a rare benign bone tumor that usually arises in the vertebral column and long bones of young adults. Craniofacial involvement is extremely rare. At the time of writing, osteoblastoma of the frontal sinus had not been reported in the English literature. We report an osteoblastoma of both frontal sinuses in a 23-year-old male who presented with headache and blurry vision in the left eye. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an expansile lesion involving both frontal sinuses with sclerotic and fibrous components, eroding into the roof of the left orbit. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the dense portion of the lesion showed signal void on all sequences, while the fibrous matrix was isointense to grey matter on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and showed avid enhancement following intravenous contrast administration. Surgical resection was performed, and histology was consistent with osteoblastoma.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^11265WXS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Transient vision loss may indicate underlying vascular disease, including carotid occlusion and thromboembolism, or it may have a more benign etiology, such as migraine or vasospasm. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with information on how to best manage these patients.

Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important.

For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss, such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.

### Typical migraine or ophthalmologic emergency [^116cDzjq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 47-year-old woman who came to the emergency department (ED) complaining of a worse-than-typical migraine headache and blurry vision after recently doubling the dose of topiramate earlier that day. After a complete neurologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, she was found to have elevated intraocular pressures and was diagnosed with topiramate-induced bilateral acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a rare side effect of this commonly prescribed medication. She was treated with timolol, brimonidine, and prednisolone drops to reduce intraocular pressure, as well as cessation of topiramate, and was discharged home. This report briefly discusses the clinical history, appropriate evaluation, differential diagnosis, and approach to secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the ED.

### Improved modeling of human vision by incorporating robustness to blur in convolutional neural networks [^112MDP7j]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

There is a general bias to consider blurry vision as suboptimal, problematic, and in need of correction. However, such assumptions may overlook the potential contributions of blur for real-world vision and object recognition. For example, humans can leverage blurry contextual information to support more accurate object recognition, and both face and object recognition remain quite robust to substantial levels of blur. Recent work has further revealed that defocus blur provides an important cue for depth perception. Neurophysiological studies have also found that shape-selective neurons in the visual cortex can be tuned to varying degrees of blur, with some neurons preferring blurry over clear depictions of 2D object shapes. Thus, blur appears to be an important feature that is encoded by the visual system.

Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that the omission of blurry training inputs may cause CNNs to rely excessively on high spatial frequency information for object recognition, thereby causing systematic deviations from biological vision. To address this question, we compared the performance of standard CNNs trained exclusively on clear images with CNNs trained on a combination of clear and blurry images. By testing standard versus blur-trained CNNs on a diverse set of neural, visual, and behavioral benchmarks, we show that blur-trained CNN models significantly outperform standard CNNs at predicting neural responses to object images across a variety of viewing conditions, including those that were never used for training.

Unlike standard CNNs, blur-trained CNNs favor t

### Visual cortex hyperexcitability in migraine in response to sound-induced flash illusions [^113RZ47X]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Sound-induced flash illusions depend on visual cortical excitability. In this study, we explored whether sound-induced flash illusions are perceived differently in migraine, a condition associated with pathologic cortical hyperexcitability.

- **Methods**: Sound-induced flash illusions were examined in 59 migraine patients (mean age = 32 ± 16 years; 36 females), 32 without aura and 27 with aura, and in 24 healthy controls (mean age = 42 ± 17 years; 16 females). Patients were studied during attacks and interictally. Visual stimuli (flashes) accompanied by sounds (beeps) were presented in different combinations. A single flash with multiple beeps was given to induce the perception of multiple flashes ("fission" illusion), and multiple flashes with a single beep were used to reduce the number of perceived flashes ("fusion" illusion).

- **Results**: For migraineurs, the fission illusion was reduced, especially during the attack, and almost abolished when a single flash was combined with 2 beeps (except for those without aura tested interictally); the fusion illusion was less consistently reported in both migraine groups, but not completely disrupted.

Results from this study add novel clues to our understanding of visual cortex hyperexcitability in migraine, especially migraine with aura. Furthermore, these analyses underscore how pathologic changes in cortical excitability affect multisensory interactions. Cross-modal illusions represent a valid tool for exploration of functional connectivity between sensory areas, which likely has an important role in the pathophysiology of migraines.

### Unituxin [^117KrG8U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Neurological disorders of the eye were observed in two or more patients treated with Unituxin during Studies 1, 2, or 3. These conditions included blurred vision, photophobia, mydriasis, fixed or unequal pupils, optic nerve disorder, eyelid ptosis, and papilledema.

In Study 1, blurred vision was reported in three patients (2%) in the Unituxin/RA group, while no cases were reported in the RA group. Diplopia, mydriasis, and unequal pupillary size occurred in one patient each within the Unituxin/RA group, with no occurrences in the RA group. The duration of these eye disorders in Study 1 was not documented. In Study 3, eye disorders were reported in sixteen patients (15%), with resolution not documented in three patients (3%). For cases with documented resolution, the median duration of the eye disorders was 4 days, ranging from 0 to 221 days.

If a patient experiences a dilated pupil with a sluggish light reflex or other visual disturbances not leading to visual loss, Unituxin should be interrupted. Upon resolution, and if continued treatment with Unituxin is deemed necessary, the dose should be reduced by 50%. Permanently discontinue Unituxin in patients who show signs or symptoms of an eye disorder after dose reduction and in those experiencing a loss of vision [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Prolonged urinary retention**: Urinary retention persisting for weeks to months after discontinuing opioids has been observed in patients treated with Unituxin. Unituxin should be permanently discontinued in patients whose urinary retention does not resolve following the discontinuation.

### Increased frequency of headache and change in visual aura due to occipital cysticercus granuloma [^113y8FjZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common clinical disorder, quite disabling and affecting the quality of life in the majority of patients. The visual aura is the most common among all types of aura. Various types of migraine aura described in the literature include photopsia, fortification spectra, scotoma, visual distortion, hemianopia, and metamorphopsia. The epileptic visual aura differs from the aura associated with migraine in certain features: it is short-lasting, typically 2–3 minutes, occurs in clusters, and is multicolored and circular in shape. According to some reports, the ictal manifestations of occipital lobe lesions can mimic episodes of migraine with visual aura.

In this case report, we intended to highlight the aggravation and increased frequency of headache attacks and the changed pattern of aura induced by occipital lobe cysticercus granuloma in a patient diagnosed with migraine with aura. The importance of neuroimaging of the brain in the state of unexpectedly increased frequency of headache episodes has been emphasized.

### Intraocular pressure and ocular biometric parameters changes in migraine [^112WUYrK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying headache, aura, and photophobia in migraine are still not fully understood, even though migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder and much research has been conducted in this field. The most common known event in migraine pathogenesis is vascular dysregulation (vasospastic diathesis), and the neurovascular system is the most affected in this pathology. The new theory, cortical spreading depression (CSD), is associated with dramatic changes in the caliber of blood vessels and the electrophysiological activation of trigeminovascular neurons during a migraine attack. It may also trigger the headache and aura phases of migraine attacks by activating and sensitizing the trigeminovascular system, initiating a series of neural, vascular, and inflammatory events that result in pain. Several lines of evidence for vascular dysfunction have been identified in migraineurs, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that in migraineurs, the vascular system is impaired not only within the brain but also in the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary artery.

Migraine attacks have been reported to be related to decreased blood flow in the optic nerve, retina, and choroid. There is increasing evidence that ocular blood flow changes are involved in both the pathogenesis of glaucoma and the progression of glaucomatous damage. Dadaci et al. and Karalezli et al. noted that an increased choroidal thickness during the migraine attack period could reflect an alteration of ocular circulation. However, Dervisogullari et al. and Zengin et al. reported a reduction in cho

### SPL drug information for pregabalin [^116n58ds]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of pregabalin PO (also known as Lyrica):

- **Angioedema**: Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or taking other drugs associated with angioedema, such as ACE inhibitors.

- **Blurred vision**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause blurred vision.

- **Decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin is associated with an increased risk of thrombocytopenia.

- **Increased serum CK**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause serum CK elevations.

- **Peripheral edema**: Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure or taking thiazolidinediones.

- **Prolonged PR interval**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause PR interval prolongation.

- **Respiratory depression**: Use caution in patients with underlying respiratory impairment or taking CNS depressants, such as opioids.

- **Seizure**: Do not discontinue abruptly in patients with seizure disorder.

- **Somnolence**: Use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Suicidal ideation**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and ideation. Monitor closely for depression, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior.

- **Weight gain**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as pregabalin may cause weight gain.

### Intraocular pressure and ocular biometric parameters changes in migraine [^114DDezd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common disease characterized by a chronic, episodic, and disabling primary headache capable of causing significant dysfunction and coincides with neurological, gastrointestinal, and autonomic changes. Various vascular, neurovascular, hypoxic, cellular, hormonal, and genetic hypotheses have been debated in the pathogenesis of migraine, yet the pathophysiology is still not fully understood.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a wave of activity that propagates slowly across the brain surface, has been presumed since its original description in the 1940s to be the physiological substrate of the migraine aura. Although discussed for decades as the underlying mechanism of the aura in migraine, it is still not clear how CSD is related to headache. Recent studies have found that CSD is associated with dramatic changes in the caliber of blood vessels and the electrophysiological activation of trigeminovascular neurons during a migraine attack. Sensorial innervations of the eye commonly originate from the trigeminal ganglion and are also supplied by the trigeminal nerve. Long and short ciliary nerve branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve innervate different parts of the eye, such as the iris, ciliary body, choroid, and trabecular meshwork.

Although several previous studies have reported decreased blood flow in the retina and optic nerve in patients with migraines and have demonstrated changes in the retinal and choroidal layer, no study has investigated the effect of migraine on changes in the int.

### Orbital fractures and risk factors for ocular injury [^1118Lz6K]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients were differentiated based on the presence or absence of symptoms. "Symptomatic" patients had at least one of the following symptoms: blurry vision, a sensation of pressure, ocular pain, facial pain, facial numbness, pain specifically with extraocular movements, diplopia, nausea, floaters, or photopsias. Blurry vision, ocular pain, pain specifically with extraocular muscle movements, facial pain, headache, and diplopia were additionally studied as stand-alone symptoms. "Asymptomatic" patients lacked any of these complaints.

Visual acuity (VA) was measured at near with a Rosenbaum pocket vision screener. Consistent with prior studies, VA of 20/40 or worse was defined as poor vision. If the VA could not be obtained from the patient due to intubation, lack of cooperation, or altered mental status, it was recorded as "no documented vision". An "abnormal pupillary reaction" was defined as the presence of an afferent pupillary defect (APD), a questionable APD on the exam, or an unreactive pupil. If pupils were obscured or the presence of an APD could not be determined, such patients were excluded from analysis. Orbital wall fractures were categorized by the location of the fracture ("floor", "medial wall", "lateral wall", or "roof") and by the number of walls fractured.

### Mild blurry vision as the initial presentation of central nervous system relapses of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a case report [^1142i6Yg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Leukemia relapses after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can sometimes originate from the central nervous system before affecting the bone marrow, with varied manifestations.

- **Case report**: We present a case of mild blurry vision as the initial symptom of central nervous system relapse of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A 30-year-old man presented with a one-week history of painless visual loss in both eyes. At that time, there were no headaches or other systemic features. The neurological examination showed no positive findings except bilateral optic nerve edema. The patient had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which had been in clinical remission for one year post-transplant. Lumbar puncture revealed relapsed disease within the central nervous system, confirmed with cerebrospinal fluid leukemic blasts.

- **Conclusions**: This case highlights the need for ophthalmologists to be aware of the possibility of central nervous system involvement in patients with leukemia when visual symptoms present as the initial manifestation.

### Hemangiopericytoma of the confluence of sinuses and the transverse sinuses. Case report [^113J6ntw]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The authors describe the case of a 38-year-old man with progressive headache and blurred vision related to a hemangiopericytoma located exclusively in the confluence of sinuses (CoS) and in the transverse sinuses bilaterally. They believe this is the first report in which a hemangiopericytoma of the dural sinuses has been described without any intradural component. Although the diagnosis was not suspected preoperatively, gross-total resection of the tumor with restoration of sinus patency was achieved to relieve the symptoms. This diagnosis should be included in the preoperative differential diagnosis of a tumor of the CoS. Successful resection can be achieved in these cases.

### Photophobia in headache disorders: Characteristics and potential mechanisms [^116ha6Dy]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Photophobia is present in multiple types of headache disorders. The coexistence of photophobia and headache suggests potential reciprocal interactions between visual and pain pathways. In this review, we summarized the photophobic characteristics across different types of headache disorders, categorized into three diagnostic groups:

- **Primary headaches**: Types include migraine, tension-type headache, and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.

- **Secondary headaches**: These encompass headaches attributed to traumatic brain injury, meningitis, non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and disorders of the eyes.

- **Painful cranial neuropathies**: Types include trigeminal neuralgia and painful optic neuritis.

We then discussed potential mechanisms for the coexistence of photophobia and headache. In conclusion, the characteristics of photophobia vary among these headache disorders. The coexistence of photophobia and headache is associated with interactions between visual and pain pathways at the retina, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, and visual cortex. Communication between these pathways may depend on calcitonin gene-related peptide and pituitary cyclase-activating polypeptide transmission. Moreover, cortical spreading depression, an upstream trigger of headache, also plays an important role in photophobia by increasing nociceptive input to the thalamus.

### Detection and discrimination of flicker contrast in migraine [^116St4dk]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

The present results confirm that visual flicker at high temporal frequencies is not only aversive to individuals with migraine but also affects their visual systems differently in other measurable ways. While most vision research related to migraine has focused on cortical mechanisms, due in large part to the very strong evidence that visual auras originate cortically, we suggest that the heightened sensitivity of migraineurs may lie at many levels of the visual pathway, possibly beginning as early as the retina. The stimuli that cause migraineurs the most discomfort are likely to provide the greatest insight into the nature of the visual abnormalities in migraine.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^1139rW7q]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 had a significant impact on the health of the global human population, affecting almost every organ, including the organ of vision. Research has focused on understanding the pathophysiology, identifying symptoms, and exploring complications of the disease. Eye-related pathologies are important areas of investigation due to the potential for direct impact of the virus on vision.

Ophthalmologists around the world are reporting various symptoms of eye infections and ocular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2. The review of ophthalmic symptoms was conducted to help physicians of various specialties recognize possible ophthalmic manifestations of this viral disease. A literature review was conducted from January 2020 to July 2023, utilizing the PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, Scielo, and Google Scholar databases.

The literature review showed that conjunctivitis is the most common ophthalmic symptom observed during the course of COVID-19 and can occur at any stage of the disease. Changes in the eye may result from the direct effect of the virus, immune response, prothrombotic states, comorbidities, and medications used. Symptoms related to the organ of vision can be divided into changes affecting the protective apparatus of the eye, the anterior eye segment, the posterior eye segment, neuro-ophthalmic, and orbital changes.

Ocular symptoms may suggest COVID-19 infection or appear several weeks after recovery. Following COVID-19 vaccinations, a diverse range of ophthalmic symptoms was observed in various locations and at different times, mirroring observations during the infection stage.

### Lyrica [^114yhzjJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Ophthalmological effects

In controlled studies involving adult patients, a higher proportion of those treated with Lyrica reported blurred vision (7%) compared to those receiving a placebo (2%). This issue resolved in most cases with continued dosing. Less than 1% of patients discontinued Lyrica treatment due to vision-related events, primarily blurred vision.

Prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing, including visual acuity, formal visual field testing, and dilated funduscopic examination, was conducted on over 3,600 patients. Visual acuity was reduced in 7% of patients treated with Lyrica and 5% of placebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 13% of Lyrica-treated patients and 12% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 2% of both Lyrica-treated and placebo-treated patients.

Although the clinical significance of the ophthalmologic findings is unknown, patients should be informed to notify their physician if any changes in vision occur. Should visual disturbances persist, consider further assessment. Patients who are regularly monitored for ocular conditions may require more frequent assessments [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Creatine kinase elevations

Lyrica treatment was associated with elevations in creatine kinase levels. The mean change in creatine kinase from baseline to maximum value was 60 U/L for Lyrica-treated patients, compared to 28 U/L for placebo patients. Across all controlled trials involving adult patients from various populations, 1.5% of patients on Lyrica and 0.7% of those receiving a placebo exhibited elevated creatine kinase levels.

Diagnosis of chronic headache disorders can be challenging for non-expert clinicians. Depending on the clinical or research need, there are a number of adequate tools available that could be used in specific contexts. Nevertheless, there are currently no tools validated in primary care that can be used by non-expert clinicians to classify chronic headache disorders that also allow the user to screen for primary headaches other than migraine and tension-type headache (TTH). The availability of such a tool could support primary care clinicians in diagnosing and managing chronic headache disorders within primary care and allow more targeted referral to headache specialists.

### Optic atrophy secondary to minocycline-induced idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^113nCfom]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

An early adolescent female presented with blurry vision, ocular 'fullness', pulsatile tinnitus, and gait difficulty due to poor vision. She was found to have florid grade V papilloedema, two months after the use of minocycline for the treatment of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. An MRI of the brain without contrast showed fullness of the optic nerve heads concerning for increased intracranial pressure, which was confirmed on lumbar puncture with an opening pressure greater than 55 cm H₂O. She was initially started on acetazolamide, but due to high opening pressure and severity of visual loss, a lumboperitoneal shunt was placed after three days.

This procedure was complicated by a shunt migration four months later, leading to worsening vision of 20/400 in both eyes, for which she underwent shunt revision. By the time she presented to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic, she was legally blind, with her exam consistent with bilateral optic atrophy.

### Behçet: The syndrome [^115wevAu]. Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Behçet's syndrome is a complex disease associated with a range of symptoms and conditions. These include cerebral venous thrombosis, headache, genital ulcers, episcleritis, scleritis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Additionally, there may be instances of Budd-Chiari syndrome, a positive pathergy test, blurred vision, cranial nerve palsy, oral ulcers, and dysarthria. Gastrointestinal fistulas and a positive Lhermitte's phenomenon are also possible.

Patients may experience polyarticular synovitis, meningitis, photophobia, hemiparesis, red eyes, acneiform lesions, and visual disturbances due to increased intracranial pressure. Other symptoms include skin pustules, cutaneous lesions, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), abdominal pain, and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP). Behavioral or personality changes, intestinal perforation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), arthritis, nausea, optic neuritis, and ataxia can also occur.

Further signs include aphthous ulcers, uveitis, skin papules, superficial thrombophlebitis, HLA-B51 association, erythema nodosum, eye pain, and diarrhea.

### A phase-by-phase review of migraine pathophysiology [^1142x3cz]. Headache (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on migraine:

- **Definition**: Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by moderate-to-severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound.

- **Pathophysiology**: Migraine results from a complex brain network disorder involving the cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem in genetically predisposed individuals.

- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of migraine over a 3-month period in the U.S. adult population is 15.3%, affecting approximately 20.7% of females and 9.7% of males. The global lifetime prevalence of migraines is estimated at 14%.

- **Disease course**: The complex interplay between the cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem involved in the modulation of nociceptive signaling results in trigeminovascular system activation, a cortical-spreading depression-like event, and a slowly propagating wave of neuronal and glial cell depolarization and hyperpolarization. This causes unilateral, pulsating headaches of moderate to severe intensity, with or without aura.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute migraine therapies, including triptans, ergotamines, and NSAIDs, are ineffective in reducing recurrence, which accounts for over 50% of migraine reoccurrences. Approximately 2.2–3.1% of people with episodic migraine progress to chronic migraine at 1-year follow-up.

### Headache and facial pain: Differential diagnosis and treatment [^111nG9ry]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Headaches affect 90% of the population at some point in their lives. Most headaches are benign and fleeting, some are serious and life-threatening, and others require ongoing medical consultation and treatment. A careful history and physical examination are necessary to establish a differential diagnosis and guide the choice of testing to achieve an accurate diagnosis.

The most common types of headaches are discussed in this review.

- **Primary headache disorders**: These include migraine with and without aura, cluster headaches, and tension-type headaches.

- **Secondary headaches**: These occur as a result of other disorders and include conditions such as brain tumors, rhinosinusitis, diseases of intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and temporomandibular joint disease.

Understanding the classification of headaches as outlined by the International Headache Society is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment.

### Clinical reasoning: A 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral vision loss resistant to steroid therapy [^113AnZ4Q]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This case involves a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive bilateral visual impairment that initially improved with steroid therapy but subsequently worsened. The clinical problem centers on diagnosing optic nerve damage with meningeal involvement unresponsive to standard interventions. The patient's vision loss began insidiously in the right eye and later affected the left, with fundoscopy showing bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Although steroids provided temporary relief, the condition deteriorated, necessitating further investigation. MRI revealed dural thickening and enhancement near the optic canals, suggesting an infiltrative or compressive process. The diagnostic approach required considering inflammatory, compressive, and infiltrative etiologies, with a biopsy ultimately proving critical when initial treatments failed. This case underscores the importance of a stepwise diagnostic strategy and highlights the need to consider rare conditions in atypical presentations, guiding readers through the differential diagnosis.

### Ophthalmoplegic "migraine" or recurrent ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy: New cases and a systematic review [^112Fn8d1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine is a poorly understood neurologic syndrome characterized by recurrent bouts of head pain and ophthalmoplegia. By reviewing cases presenting to our centers, in whom the phenotype has been carefully dissected, and systematically reviewing all published cases of ophthalmoplegic migraine in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) era, this review sets out to clearly define the syndrome and discuss possible etiologies. We found that in up to one-third of patients, the headache was not migrainous or associated with migrainous symptoms. In three-quarters of the cases involving the third nerve, there was focal nerve thickening and contrast enhancement on MRI. Observational data suggest systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial acutely. The etiology remains unclear but may involve recurrent bouts of demyelination of the oculomotor nerve. "Ophthalmoplegic migraine" is a misnomer in that it is probably not a variant of migraine but rather a recurrent cranial neuralgia. A more appropriate name might be "ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy".

### Ocular pulse amplitude and retina nerve fiber layer thickness in migraine patients without aura [^1115xPJZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Migraine is a form of headache regarded as a neurovascular disorder. The theories about its mechanism do not provide satisfactory clarification, and the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. Recent studies have declared that neural events trigger vascular dilatation, which aggravates pain and results in further nerve activation. Migraine has several ocular manifestations, including visual disturbances during attacks, visual field defects, reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and normal tension glaucoma. Central retinal artery occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy have also been reported, indicating possible ocular vascular involvement as well as central vascular system involvement in migraine. Vasospastic events and ocular involvement have been reported mostly in migraine patients with aura.

Ocular pulse amplitude (OPA), described as the difference between systolic and diastolic intraocular pressure (IOP), is accepted as an indirect indicator of choroidal perfusion. It is measured by dynamic contour tonometry, which is a contact tonometry providing intraocular pressure and OPA simultaneously. This method has been suggested as a diagnostic tool for diseases in which choroidal perfusion changes might occur.

The posterior pole asymmetry analysis (PPAA) is a new method for determining the hemisphere asymmetry of the macula by comparing the thickness of the two hemispheres on a map, which are divided into equal cells. It is reported that PPAA could show early glaucomatous damage before it can be documented by optic disc analysis.

### Amantadine [^116A9LPH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with a history of epilepsy or other seizures should be observed closely for possible increased seizure activity.

Patients receiving amantadine hydrochloride tablets who experience central nervous system effects or allergic reactions, including blurring of vision, should be cautioned against driving or working in situations where alertness and adequate motor coordination are important.

Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or peripheral edema should be followed closely, as there are patients who developed congestive heart failure while receiving amantadine hydrochloride tablets.

Patients with Parkinson's disease improving on amantadine hydrochloride tablets should resume normal activities gradually and cautiously, considering other medical conditions, such as the presence of osteoporosis or phlebothrombosis.

Because amantadine hydrochloride tablets have anticholinergic effects and may cause mydriasis, they should not be given to patients with untreated angle closure glaucoma.

Corneal edema has been reported in patients taking amantadine. Symptoms can include blurry vision, eye pain, and vision loss, and corneal involvement is usually bilateral. Onset can occur from a few weeks to several years after starting amantadine. Resolution of symptoms has occurred as soon as weeks after amantadine cessation; however, corneal grafts have been required in some patients. It is important to ask patients if their vision has changed and consider obtaining baseline and periodic ophthalmologic examinations after initiation of therapy with amantadine.

### Clinical reasoning: Progressive headache and diplopia in an 89-year-old man [^113RjZPp]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### What to look out for, what to do, and when: 3 key messages for safely treating neck pain, headache, and/or orofacial symptoms in musculoskeletal rehabilitation settings [^112ZbWw7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

- **Synopsis**: Neck pain, headache, and/or orofacial symptoms may be the first (nonischemic) indicators of an underlying vascular pathology or blood flow limitation. If not recognized by the musculoskeletal rehabilitation clinician, such a condition may be aggravated by treatment, increasing the risk of serious adverse events. Clinicians can make an important and potentially lifesaving difference by providing specific information and advice. This is particularly crucial for patients with an intermediate level of concern, such as those showing only a few concerning features of a possible serious condition and where an initial vasculogenic hypothesis was rejected during clinical reasoning.

The article offers background information to aid in understanding the context of the problem and provides suggestions for clinicians on how to deliver appropriate information and advice to patients presenting with neck pain, headache, and/or orofacial symptoms.

### Approach to acute headache in adults [^113zxBQ9]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately one-half of the adult population worldwide is affected by a headache disorder. The International Headache Society classification and diagnostic criteria can help physicians differentiate primary headaches (e.g. tension, migraine, cluster) from secondary headaches (e.g. those caused by infection or vascular disease). A thorough history and physical examination, along with an understanding of the typical features of primary headaches, can reduce the need for neuroimaging, lumbar puncture, or other studies.

- **Red flag signs and symptoms**: Identified in the history or during a physical examination, these can indicate serious underlying pathology and will require neuroimaging or other testing to evaluate the cause of headache. Red flag signs and symptoms include focal neurologic signs, papilledema, neck stiffness, an immunocompromised state, sudden onset of the worst headache in the patient's life, personality changes, headache after trauma, and headache that is worse with exercise.

If an intracranial hemorrhage is suspected, head computed tomography without contrast media is recommended. For most other dangerous causes of headache, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography is acceptable.

### Effects of visual pathway lesions on the visual aura of migraine [^116BqDAY]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

The aim was to determine if the visual aura of migraine is altered by disease of the afferent visual pathways and if visual aura changes are associated with pre- or postgeniculate lesions. Functional neuroimaging during migraine demonstrates the primary visual/extrastriate cortex as an anatomical substrate of visual aura. Neuro-ophthalmological records, including kinetic and static perimetry, of 25 patients with visual loss and typical aura with or without migraine headache were reviewed.

The study group consisted of 25 patients (16 women and nine men) with a mean age of 59.8 years. These patients with typical aura had visual loss from pregeniculate (72%) or postgeniculate lesions (28%). Eight patients — four with postgeniculate cerebrovascular accidents or arteriovenous malformations, two with lifelong optic neuropathy/retinopathy, one with childhood ocular trauma, and one with anisometropic amblyopia — reported absence or alteration of visual aura.

Postgeniculate lesions were significantly associated (P = 0.017) with visual aura changes. The association of postgeniculate lesions with altered auras points to a postgeniculate effect on aura appearance, which is consistent with functional neuroimaging findings. Although statistically significant, this series' association of postgeniculate disease and aura changes is even more robust (P = 0.0002) when structural changes of ocular dominance columns are posited in three patients with optic neuropathy, retinopathy, and keratopathy of congenital or childhood origin.

### Acute headache in adults: A diagnostic approach [^115f3rxm]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tension-type headache, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining further investigation for secondary causes of headache in patients with headache and red flags based on history or physical examination. These include acute thunderclap headache, fever with meningeal irritation on physical examination, papilledema with focal neurologic signs or impaired consciousness, and concern for acute glaucoma.

### Primary medulla oblongata germinoma: a case report and review of the literature [^116dE2jC]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a case of primary intracranial medulla oblongata germinoma in a 16-year-old girl who presented with progressive headache and blurred vision. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a heterogeneous exophytic mass arising from the dorsal aspect of the medulla oblongata with extension into the fourth ventricle. The differential diagnosis for this patient included ependymoma, exophytic glioma, medulloblastoma, and choroid plexus papilloma. After surgical resection and radiation therapy, she remains alive and recurrence-free for 7 years.

### Concussions and their consequences: current diagnosis, management and prevention [^113tzw2x]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

Concussion is a disease that can be associated with a range of symptoms and conditions, including retinal hemorrhage, especially in children, as well as lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, and gait disturbance. Adolescents may experience headaches, anxiety, seizures, agitation, anisocoria, and neck pain. Other associations include alcohol consumption, slurred speech, depression, emotional lability, vomiting, memory impairment, aggressive behavior, dizziness, insomnia, sleeping disorders, fatigue, and nausea.

Participation in sports can be a factor, as can phonophobia and cervical spine injury. Symptoms may also include irritability, head injury, scalp laceration, blurred vision, impulsivity, diplopia, numbness, photophobia, confusion, loss of balance, difficulty concentrating, tinnitus, falls, hearing loss, and disorientation.

### Familial retinal migraines [^115FqH2Z]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of sufferers of retinal migraine are thought to have a positive family history. Retinal migraines can cause both transient and, rarely, permanent unilateral monocular visual loss. This report on familial retinal migraines furthers our understanding of this particular migraine subtype. Two families with retinal migraines are reported, suggesting an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern with variable expression and penetrance.

### The role of bedside ultrasound in pretherapeutic and posttherapeutic lumbar puncture in patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^112BgbbZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is often a debilitating condition characterized by headaches, blurry vision, nausea, and vomiting. Lumbar puncture (LP) is an essential component of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach; however, the procedure itself can cause post-lumbar puncture headache. In addition to the clinical presentation, the use of bedside ultrasound to measure the optic nerve sheath diameter may aid in differentiating the two conditions. We hereby report a case of a 33-year-old woman with known IIH who presented with a headache after the initial therapeutic LP.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after first rituximab transfusion for treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^113Cj1uu]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A woman in her 60s developed acute onset headache, blurry vision, and encephalopathy a few hours after rituximab infusion given to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis. A CT scan showed edema in the posterior circulation area, suggesting the diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and an MRI confirmed it. After being treated with aggressive blood pressure control and other supportive measures, her symptoms improved over 3–4 days. This case highlights the need for awareness and early recognition of this rare but serious adverse effect of rituximab. CT scan can be helpful in diagnosis, particularly to rule out bleeding, but the MRI provides the most accurate diagnosis.

### Dry eyes and migraines: Is there really a correlation [^116LZZWo]. Cornea (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tear film functions and clinical symptoms of patients with migraines.

- **Methods**: This observational comparative study consisted of 33 migraine patients (26 women and 7 men) referred from neurology clinics and 33 control subjects (22 women and 11 men) referred from ophthalmology outpatient clinics. The control subjects had neither systemic nor ocular disease nor any type of headache. All 66 patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination and diagnostic tests for dry eye, including tear break-up time, Schirmer test with topical anesthesia, lissamine green staining, and an ocular surface disease score. Patients with migraine were classified as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, and basilar migraine; a pain score from 1 to 4 was determined for each patient based on the American Headache Society's Migraine Disability Assessment Test.

- **Results**: Of the 33 patients who participated in the migraine group, 17 (51%) suffered from migraine with aura, 11 (33%) suffered from migraine without aura, and 5 (15%) suffered from basilar migraine. Significant differences in dry eye scores were found between the patients with migraine and the control subjects. In the migraine group, the mean tear break-up time was 7.75 ± 2.37 seconds, whereas in the control group it was 9.15 ± 1.93 seconds. For the Schirmer test, the migraine group had a mean value of 12.09 ± 4.95 mm/5 minutes, whereas the control group had a mean value of 14.90 ± 4.26 mm/5 minutes. Testing with lissamine green staining resulted in a mean value of 1.00 ± 0.16 in the migraine group.

### Ophthalmoplegic migraine: Migraine or oculomotor neuropathy [^116qcKAF]. Cephalalgia (2012). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine (OM) is a rare condition characterized by the association of headaches and an oculomotor nerve palsy. The third cranial nerve is commonly involved in attacks, whereas involvement of the sixth and fourth nerves is uncommon. It is still debated whether an uncontrolled migraine or an oculomotor neuropathy may be the primary cause of ophthalmoplegic migraine.

- **Cases**: We report two patients affected by OM with normal magnetic resonance imaging findings and a history of uncontrolled migraine before an attack of OM.

- **Conclusion**: The cases reported allow us to hypothesize that OM may be considered a form of migraine rather than a cranial neuralgia. It is possible that different factors, such as inflammatory or structural factors, may represent a vulnerability of the nerve during a severe migraine attack causing ophthalmoplegia.

### Distinctive anatomical and physiological features of migraine aura revealed by 18 years of recording [^1128Yj4j]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of the migraine aura, and the visual percept it produces, remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify a large number of visual auras recorded by a single individual over nearly two decades to gain insight into basic aura mechanisms. An individual made detailed drawings of his visual percept of migraine aura in real time during more than 1000 attacks of migraine aura without headache over 18 years. Drawings were made in a consistent fashion documenting the shape and location of the aura wavefront or scotoma in the visual field at one-minute intervals. These drawings were digitized, and the spatial and temporal features of auras were quantified and analyzed.

Consistent patterns of aura initiation, propagation, and termination were observed in both right and left visual fields. Most aura attacks originated centrally (within 10° eccentricity), but distinct sites of initiation were also noted in the visual field. Auras beginning centrally preferentially propagated first through the lower nasal field (69–77% of all auras) before travelling to upper and temporal fields on both sides. Some auras propagated from peripheral to central regions of the visual field, typically following the reverse path of those travelling in the opposite direction. The mean velocity of the perceived visual phenomenon did not differ between attacks starting peripherally and centrally. The estimated speed of the underlying cortical event (2–3 mm/min) was in the same range as previously reported.

### Clinical reasoning: A 51-year-old woman with diplopia and headache [^115uMNqX]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old woman presented with a pressure-like headache behind her right eye and horizontal diplopia. Upon examination, she was unable to abduct or adduct the right eye, though her vertical eye movements were intact. Her deficits could not be overcome using the oculocephalic reflex. Initial imaging was interpreted as optic neuritis, but a careful review with radiology confirmed an orbital infiltrate through a diffuse enhancing hyperintense signal within the orbital apex. The focus of this case study is to review the localization approach for diplopia and build a differential diagnosis for orbital processes. Another key point is the importance of relying on the physical examination as the guide to a patient's management, rather than imaging findings, which can often be misleading.

### Lyrica [^116cQYmj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In controlled studies involving adult patients, a higher proportion of individuals treated with Lyrica reported blurred vision (7%) compared to those treated with a placebo (2%). This condition resolved in the majority of cases with continued dosing. Less than 1% of patients discontinued Lyrica treatment due to vision-related events, primarily blurred vision.

Prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing, which included visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing, and dilated funduscopic examination, was conducted in over 3,600 patients. Among these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 7% of those treated with Lyrica, compared to 5% of those given a placebo. Visual field changes were identified in 13% of Lyrica-treated patients and 12% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 2% of patients in both the Lyrica and placebo groups.

Although the clinical significance of these ophthalmologic findings is unknown, patients should be informed to notify their physician if any changes in vision occur. If visual disturbance persists, further assessment should be considered. Patients who are routinely monitored for ocular conditions may require more frequent assessment [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

- **Creatine kinase elevations**: Treatment with Lyrica was associated with elevations in creatine kinase levels. The mean change in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value was 60 U/L for Lyrica-treated patients and 28 U/L for placebo-treated patients. Across all controlled trials in adult patients from various populations, 1.5% of those on Lyrica and 0.7% of those receiving a placebo experienced creatine kinase elevations.

### Headache in the emergency department: Avoiding misdiagnosis of dangerous secondary causes [^115mRR6S]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

There are several dangerous secondary causes of headaches that pose life, limb, brain, or vision threats, which emergency physicians must consider in patients presenting with acute headache. A careful history and physical examination targeted at these important secondary causes of headache will aid in avoiding misdiagnosis. Patients with acute thunderclap headache have a differential diagnosis beyond subarachnoid hemorrhage. Considering the "context" of headache "PLUS" some other symptom or sign is one strategy to help focus the differential diagnosis.

### A young woman with blurred vision and distal paresthesias [^117H5feZ]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old woman presented with blurred vision and distal paresthesias. Her initial evaluation revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema, distal lower-extremity sensory and motor deficits, and electrodiagnostic evidence of a length-dependent mixed demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy. Routine diagnostic testing, including laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture, were nondiagnostic. A targeted biopsy was ultimately required for diagnosis.

In this article, we discuss the differential diagnosis and outline the clinical evaluation indicated for a patient presenting with demyelinating polyneuropathy and papilledema.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^111YFxQe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, significantly impacted global human health, affecting almost every organ, including the eyes. Research has focused on understanding the pathophysiology and identifying symptoms and complications of the disease, with eye-related pathologies being important due to the virus's potential direct impact. Ophthalmologists worldwide report various eye infection symptoms and ocular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2.

The review of ophthalmic symptoms was conducted to aid physicians from various specialties in recognizing possible ophthalmic manifestations of this viral disease. A literature review was conducted from January 2020 to July 2023 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, Scielo, and Google Scholar databases.

The review showed that conjunctivitis is the most common ophthalmic symptom observed during the course of COVID-19 and can occur at any stage of the disease. Changes in the eye may result from the direct effect of the virus, immune response, prothrombotic states, comorbidities, and medications used. Symptoms related to vision can be divided into changes affecting:

- **The protective apparatus of the eye**
- **The anterior eye segment**
- **The posterior eye segment**
- **Neuro-ophthalmic and orbital changes**

Ocular symptoms may suggest COVID-19 infection or appear several weeks after recovery. Following COVID-19 vaccinations, a diverse range of ophthalmic symptoms was observed in various locations and at different times, mirroring the ocular manifestations associated with the infection.
