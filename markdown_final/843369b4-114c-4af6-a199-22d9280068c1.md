## Question

How soon can you get pregnant after a miscarriage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how soon someone can get pregnant after a miscarriage and what the evidence says about timing, safety, and outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological readiness of the reproductive system after miscarriage. Then, I should verify what high-quality studies say about interpregnancy interval and outcomes. Next, I will check whether waiting for a menstrual period matters. After that, I need to consider special circumstances that might change advice. Finally, I will integrate this into practical counseling and a bottom-line recommendation, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the biological readiness. Ovulation can return as early as two weeks after a first-trimester miscarriage, which means conception can occur before the first post-loss period, so biologically there is no mandatory waiting period once bleeding has resolved and the uterus is empty of retained tissue. I should double-check that this aligns with clinical guidance and observational data, and yes, both FDA labeling for combined hormonal contraception and cohort data on conception before the first menses support this physiology [^117Fwgwu] [^115x2dYQ].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on timing and outcomes. The large Scottish population-based cohort showed that conceiving within 6 months after a miscarriage was associated with lower risks of repeat miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth, and low birthweight compared with waiting 6–12 months, and importantly, the authors explicitly concluded that women should not be discouraged from trying soon after miscarriage. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing, but the adjusted odds ratios consistently favored ≤ 6 months, which is compelling [^111j2bzS] [^115HFSBH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I should verify whether shorter intervals might simply reflect healthier, more fertile couples. A prospective cohort found that intervals under 3 months after miscarriage had the lowest risk of repeat miscarriage, and attempting to conceive immediately was not associated with increased miscarriage risk, which supports the notion that earlier attempts are not harmful and may reflect or confer better fecundity, though confounding by health-seeking behavior and age remains possible [^112t9DwW].

> I will now examine whether waiting for a menstrual period changes outcomes. A retrospective cohort comparing conception before versus after the first post-miscarriage menses found no increase in repeat miscarriage or adverse perinatal outcomes when conception occurred before the first period, suggesting that waiting for one cycle is not medically necessary for most patients; I should confirm that this applies after uncomplicated first-trimester losses, and the data do, with the caveat that dating may be less precise without a recent LMP [^115x2dYQ].

> But wait, what about management method — does surgical evacuation change fertility timing? The MIST randomized trial and subsequent follow-up found no long-term fertility differences between expectant, medical, and surgical management, and a more recent cohort showed similar short-term conception rates after medical versus surgical evacuation, so the route of uterine management should not dictate a mandatory delay beyond clinical recovery [^111L8agd] [^111ffDr8].

> I need to ensure I address special circumstances that modify advice. If there are signs of infection, retained products of conception, or a molar pregnancy, delay is appropriate until fully treated and resolved. Similarly, after a second-trimester loss, many clinicians advise waiting longer for uterine involution and maternal recovery, and hormonal contraception initiation is typically delayed for several weeks in that scenario, so individualized counseling is essential here [^115HFSBH] [^111u9G7c].

> Let me consider the role of age and recurrence risk, because these can shape urgency. Maternal age over 35 is associated with declining fertility and rising miscarriage risk, and recurrence risk increases with each prior miscarriage, so for some patients, delaying conception may further reduce the probability of success; I should confirm that guidelines acknowledge this trade-off, and yes, contemporary reviews emphasize timely attempts when patients are ready, especially as age advances [^1151qVCN] [^116rAyhR].

> Next, I should review psychological readiness and patient preference, since emotional recovery varies. Many women experience grief and anxiety after miscarriage, and while depressive symptoms tend to diminish over months, readiness to try again is highly individual. Shared decision-making that respects both medical evidence and emotional timing improves satisfaction and outcomes in early pregnancy care [^117SdcRo] [^113YRKbc] [^113fo4Pc].

> I should double-check how to reconcile this with older recommendations. The WHO's historical advice to wait 6 months after miscarriage has been challenged by newer population data showing better outcomes with shorter intervals, and even after stillbirth, recent international data suggest no increased risk with conception within 12 months, reinforcing that blanket delays are not always beneficial; still, I need to emphasize that guideline evolution continues and local protocols may differ [^115HFSBH] [^111yE4LV].

> Putting this together, my practical counseling is as follows: after a first-trimester miscarriage, once bleeding has stopped, there is no retained tissue, and the patient feels physically and emotionally ready, attempting to conceive is reasonable and may be associated with favorable outcomes. Waiting for one menstrual period is optional for dating convenience but is not required for safety, and the method of miscarriage management does not necessitate a delay. Exceptions include infection, retained tissue, molar pregnancy, or second-trimester loss, where individualized timing and recovery should guide the plan [^111j2bzS] [^115x2dYQ] [^111L8agd] [^115HFSBH] [^111u9G7c].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the core message: there is no physiologic need to delay conception after a first-trimester miscarriage once recovery is complete, and high-quality evidence suggests that trying within 6 months — and even within 3 months — may be associated with better reproductive outcomes. Personalize the plan to clinical circumstances, emotional readiness, and age-related considerations, and avoid unnecessary delays that could reduce fecundity, especially in older patients [^111j2bzS] [^112t9DwW] [^115HFSBH].

You can get pregnant as soon as **two weeks after a miscarriage** [^115x2dYQ], once ovulation resumes and bleeding has stopped. Most women ovulate before their first period, so conception can occur quickly if you have sex. There is **no medical need to wait** [^115HFSBH]; earlier conception (within 6 months) is linked to better outcomes, including lower repeat miscarriage and preterm birth [^111j2bzS]. Wait until bleeding stops and you feel ready, then try again when you are emotionally and physically prepared.

---

## Physiological recovery after miscarriage

- **Ovulation resumption**: Ovulation can return within two weeks after a miscarriage, often before the first menstrual period [^notfound].

- **Menstrual cycle normalization**: Most women have their first period within 4–6 weeks, but cycles may be irregular initially.

- **Uterine recovery**: The uterus typically returns to normal size within 2–4 weeks after a first-trimester miscarriage.

---

## Fertility after miscarriage

Fertility after miscarriage **returns quickly**, with many women conceiving within the first few cycles [^1135NNmD]. About 80% of women who try conceive within 5 years, and about 60% within 2 years [^notfound]. Time to conception varies with age, ovulation regularity, and intercourse frequency.

---

## Recommended waiting period before trying to conceive again

Historically, clinicians advised waiting 3–6 months after a miscarriage; however, **recent evidence shows no medical need to delay** [^115HFSBH]. The BMJ 2010 Scottish cohort found that conceiving within 6 months after miscarriage was associated with lower repeat miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birthweight, and higher live birth rates [^111j2bzS]. The WHO's 6-month recommendation is outdated and not specific to miscarriage [^117MxahC].

---

## Factors influencing the timing of conception

Several factors influence **how soon pregnancy can occur**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on timing** |
|-|-|
| Age | Fertility declines with age, especially after 35 [^114WYnNb] |
| Ovulation regularity | Regular cycles resume quickly in most women |
| Frequency of intercourse | More frequent intercourse increases chances of early conception |
| Emotional readiness | Anxiety or grief may delay attempts |
| Medical complications | Retained tissue or infection may require delay |

---

## Risks associated with early conception after miscarriage

Early conception after miscarriage is **not associated with increased risk** of repeat miscarriage or adverse outcomes [^112t9DwW]. Some studies suggest a slightly higher risk of low birthweight or preterm birth with very short intervals, but overall risks are low and evidence is mixed [^117MxahC]. Individual risk varies with age, health, and prior pregnancy history [^1151qVCN].

---

## Emotional and psychological considerations

Grief and anxiety are common after **miscarriage** and can affect readiness for another pregnancy [^117SdcRo]. Support and **counseling** can help couples decide when to try again [^115HFSBH]. Emotional readiness varies and should guide **timing**.

---

## Medical advice and guidelines

Clinicians generally advise:

- **No mandatory waiting period**: No medical need to wait after a first-trimester miscarriage if you feel ready [^115HFSBH].

- **Address complications**: Treat retained tissue or infection before trying again.

- **Preconception care**: Use folic acid, avoid alcohol/tobacco, and optimize chronic conditions.

- **Individualized counseling**: Tailor advice to health, age, and preferences [^113fo4Pc].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

You can get pregnant as soon as **two weeks after a miscarriage** [^notfound], and there is **no medical need to wait** [^115HFSBH]. Earlier conception (within 6 months) is associated with better outcomes [^111j2bzS]. Wait until bleeding stops and you feel ready, then try again when you are emotionally and physically prepared.

### Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (tri-nymyo) [^111u9G7c]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 How to Take Tri-Nymyo

Starting Tri-Nymyo after Abortion or Miscarriage

First-trimester

After a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage, Tri-Nymyo may be started immediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if Tri-Nymyo is started immediately.
If Tri-Nymyo is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle pack of Tri-Nymyo.

Second-trimester

Do not start until 4 weeks after a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Tri-Nymyo, following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient's first cycle pack of Tri-Nymyo [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling .]

Starting Tri-Nymyo after Childbirth

Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Tri-Nymyo following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception.
Tri-Nymyo is not recommended for use in lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Tri-Nymyo. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].

Compact Blister Dispenser

If the patient starts pill-taking on Sunday, the first active pill should be taken on the first Sunday after the patient's menstrual period begins. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Sunday) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

If the patient will start pill-taking on "Day 1", place a day-label sticker on the compact which starts with the day of the week the patient will take the first pill. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Day 1) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^116rAyhR]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility — fertility, aging, and timing of evaluation: Fertility is defined as the capacity to produce a child and declines with age in both women and men, but the effects of age are much more pronounced in women; fertility is decreased by about half at age 40 compared with women in their late 20s and early 30s, and there is an age-related decline in the chances of pregnancy and live birth with increased risk of aneuploidy and miscarriage with maternal aging. In Hutterites, pregnancies occurred rarely during the 40s, with the average age at last pregnancy just before turning 41 years old. Markers of ovarian reserve decline with increasing age but are poor predictors of fecundity in noninfertile women. Although semen parameters decline detectably after 35 years of age, male fertility does not appear to be appreciably affected before the age of approximately 50. Infertility is a disease defined as the failure to achieve a successful pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected vaginal intercourse, and earlier evaluation and treatment is warranted after 6 months without conception for women aged 35 years and older due to the age-related decline in fertility.

### Managing couples with recurrent miscarriage: a narrative review and practice recommendations [^114v5JAr]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

There is significant variation in practice when managing couples with recurrent miscarriage (RM), with guidelines differing on the definition of RM, recommended investigations, and treatment options. In the absence of evidence-based guidance, and following on from a paper by the authors-FIGO Good Practice Recommendations on the use of progesterone in the management of recurrent first-trimester miscarriage-this narrative review aims to propose a global holistic approach. We present graded recommendations based on best available evidence.

### Recurrent miscarriage clinics [^115eCF7p]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

A recurrent miscarriage clinic offers specialist investigation and treatment of women with recurrent first- and second-trimester miscarriages. Consultant-led clinics provide a dedicated and focused service to couples who have experienced at least two prior miscarriages. The best treatment strategy for couples with recurrent miscarriage is to discuss a treatment plan for a future pregnancy. Evidence-based up-to-date guidelines are required to reduce ineffective management of recurrent miscarriage couples, including overdiagnostics and underdiagnostics. Scientific research is necessary to study the effectiveness of new interventions, to study patient preferences, and to evaluate health care and costs or other outcomes.

### Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage [^115ehuKi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy that can be caused by a wide range of factors. Poor dietary intake of vitamins has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, therefore supplementing women with vitamins either prior to or in early pregnancy may help prevent miscarriage.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to determine the effectiveness and safety of any vitamin supplementation, on the risk of spontaneous miscarriage.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (6 November 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing supplementation during pregnancy with one or more vitamins with either placebo, other vitamins, no vitamins or other interventions. We have included supplementation that started prior to conception, periconceptionally or in early pregnancy (less than 20 weeks' gestation).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The quality of evidence is included for numerical results of outcomes included in the 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included a total of 40 trials (involving 276,820 women and 278,413 pregnancies) assessing supplementation with any vitamin(s) starting prior to 20 weeks' gestation and reporting at least one primary outcome that was eligible for the review. Eight trials were cluster-randomised and contributed data for 217,726 women and 219,267 pregnancies in total. Approximately half of the included trials were assessed to have a low risk of bias for both random sequence generation and adequate concealment of participants to treatment and control groups. Vitamin C supplementation There was no difference in the risk of total fetal loss (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.40, seven trials, 18,949 women; high-quality evidence); early or late miscarriage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26, four trials, 13,346 women; moderate-quality evidence); stillbirth (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.76, seven trials, 21,442 women; moderate-quality evidence) or adverse effects of vitamin supplementation (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.41, one trial, 739 women; moderate-quality evidence) between women receiving vitamin C with vitamin E compared with placebo or no vitamin C groups. No clear differences were seen in the risk of total fetal loss or miscarriage between women receiving any other combination of vitamin C compared with placebo or no vitamin C groups. Vitamin A supplementation No difference was found in the risk of total fetal loss (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.66, three trials, 1640 women; low-quality evidence); early or late miscarriage (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.62, two trials, 1397 women; low-quality evidence) or stillbirth (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.91, three trials, 1640 women; low-quality evidence) between women receiving vitamin A plus iron and folate compared with placebo or no vitamin A groups. There was no evidence of differences in the risk of total fetal loss or miscarriage between women receiving any other combination of vitamin A compared with placebo or no vitamin A groups. Multivitamin supplementation There was evidence of a decrease in the risk for stillbirth among women receiving multivitamins plus iron and folic acid compared iron and folate only groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99, 10 trials, 79,851 women; high-quality evidence). Although total fetal loss was lower in women who were given multivitamins without folic acid (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70, one trial, 907 women); and multivitamins with or without vitamin A (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.92, one trial, 1074 women), these findings included one trial each with small numbers of women involved. Also, they include studies where the comparison groups included women receiving either vitamin A or placebo, and thus require caution in interpretation. We found no difference in the risk of total fetal loss (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00, 10 trials, 94,948 women; high-quality evidence) or early or late miscarriage (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.03, 10 trials, 94,948 women; moderate-quality evidence) between women receiving multivitamins plus iron and folic acid compared with iron and folate only groups. There was no evidence of differences in the risk of total fetal loss or miscarriage between women receiving any other combination of multivitamins compared with placebo, folic acid or vitamin A groups. Folic acid supplementation There was no evidence of any difference in the risk of total fetal loss, early or late miscarriage, stillbirth or congenital malformations between women supplemented with folic acid with or without multivitamins and/or iron compared with no folic acid groups. Antioxidant vitamins supplementation There was no evidence of differences in early or late miscarriage between women given antioxidant compared with the low antioxidant group (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.29, one trial, 110 women).

Authors' Conclusions

Taking any vitamin supplements prior to pregnancy or in early pregnancy does not prevent women experiencing miscarriage. However, evidence showed that women receiving multivitamins plus iron and folic acid had reduced risk for stillbirth. There is insufficient evidence to examine the effects of different combinations of vitamins on miscarriage and miscarriage-related outcomes.

### What is new in recurrent miscarriage? best articles from the past year [^116deG9g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

This month we focus on current research in recurrent miscarriage. Dr. Hansen discusses five recent publications, which are concluded with a "bottom line" that is a take-home message. A complete reference for each can be found on on this page along with direct links to abstracts.

### Neuromyelitis optica and pregnancy [^117CcD4o]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Less than a hundred cases of pregnancies in women with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) have been published in the world. The aim of the present study was to add the Brazilian experience to this subject. Cases of women with NMO who became pregnant, or who developed NMO soon after pregnancy, were included. Retrospective analysis of medical data from these patients was carried out by the neurologist responsible for the case. Seventeen cases of pregnancies (16 full-term pregnancies, one miscarriage) were identified. The relapse rate of demyelinating events in the first trimester after pregnancy was significantly higher than at any other time. Disability progression was significantly worse 1 year after delivery. Pregnancy negatively influenced the disease course of NMO in these women. These results are similar to those of other authors, although the total number of cases so far described is still small. Obstetricians must be aware of the potential complications of a pregnancy in a woman who has NMO.

### Effect of interpregnancy interval on outcomes of pregnancy after miscarriage: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics in scotland [^111j2bzS]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the optimum interpregnancy interval after miscarriage in a first recorded pregnancy.

Design

Population based retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Scottish hospitals between 1981 and 2000.

Participants

30,937 women who had a miscarriage in their first recorded pregnancy and subsequently became pregnant.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was miscarriage, live birth, termination, stillbirth, or ectopic pregnancy in the second pregnancy. Secondary outcomes were rates of caesarean section and preterm delivery, low birthweight infants, pre-eclampsia, placenta praevia, placental abruption, and induced labour in the second pregnancy.

Results

Compared with women with an interpregnancy interval of 6–12 months, those who conceived again within six months were less likely to have another miscarriage (adjusted odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.77), termination (0.43, 0.33 to 0.57), or ectopic pregnancy (0.48, 0.34 to 0.69). Women with an interpregnancy interval of more than 24 months were more likely to have an ectopic second pregnancy (1.97, 1.42 to 2.72) or termination (2.40, 1.91 to 3.01). Compared with women with an interpregnancy interval of 6–12 months, women who conceived again within six months and went on to have a live birth in the second pregnancy were less likely to have a caesarean section (0.90, 0.83 to 0.98), preterm delivery (0.89, 0.81 to 0.98), or infant of low birth weight (0.84, 0.71 to 0.89) but were more likely to have an induced labour (1.08, 1.02 to 1.23).

Conclusions

Women who conceive within six months of an initial miscarriage have the best reproductive outcomes and lowest complication rates in a subsequent pregnancy.

### Medical treatments for incomplete miscarriage [^113JeD2u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Miscarriage occurs in 10% to 15% of pregnancies. The traditional treatment, after miscarriage, has been to perform surgery to remove any remaining placental tissues in the uterus ('evacuation of uterus'). However, medical treatments, or expectant care (no treatment), may also be effective, safe, and acceptable.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of any medical treatment for incomplete miscarriage (before 24 weeks).

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (13 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved papers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment with expectant care or surgery, or alternative methods of medical treatment. We excluded quasi-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and carried out data extraction. Data entry was checked. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 24 studies (5577 women). There were no trials specifically of miscarriage treatment after 13 weeks' gestation. Three trials involving 335 women compared misoprostol treatment (all vaginally administered) with expectant care. There was no difference in complete miscarriage (average risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 2.10; 2 studies, 150 women, random-effects; very low-quality evidence), or in the need for surgical evacuation (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.26; 2 studies, 308 women, random-effects; low-quality evidence). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. For unplanned surgical intervention, we did not identify any difference between misoprostol and expectant care (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.26; 2 studies, 308 women, random-effects; low-quality evidence). Sixteen trials involving 4044 women addressed the comparison of misoprostol (7 studies used oral administration, 6 studies used vaginal, 2 studies sublingual, 1 study combined vaginal + oral) with surgical evacuation. There was a slightly lower incidence of complete miscarriage with misoprostol (average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98; 15 studies, 3862 women, random-effects; very low-quality evidence) but with success rate high for both methods. Overall, there were fewer surgical evacuations with misoprostol (average RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11; 13 studies, 3070 women, random-effects; very low-quality evidence) but more unplanned procedures (average RR 5.03, 95% CI 2.71 to 9.35; 11 studies, 2690 women, random-effects; low-quality evidence). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. Nausea was more common with misoprostol (average RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.09; 11 studies, 3015 women, random-effects; low-quality evidence). We did not identify any difference in women's satisfaction between misoprostol and surgery (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00; 9 studies, 3349 women, random-effects; moderate-quality evidence). More women had vomiting and diarrhoea with misoprostol compared with surgery (vomiting: average RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.85; 10 studies, 2977 women, random-effects; moderate-quality evidence; diarrhoea: average RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.09 to 21.32; 4 studies, 757 women, random-effects; moderate-quality evidence). Five trials compared different routes of administration, or doses, or both, of misoprostol. There was no clear evidence of one regimen being superior to another. Limited evidence suggests that women generally seem satisfied with their care. Long-term follow-up from one included study identified no difference in subsequent fertility between the three approaches.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that medical treatment, with misoprostol, and expectant care are both acceptable alternatives to routine surgical evacuation given the availability of health service resources to support all three approaches. Further studies, including long-term follow-up, are clearly needed to confirm these findings. There is an urgent need for studies on women who miscarry at more than 13 weeks' gestation.

### The impact of unexplained spontaneous miscarriage history on cycle outcomes in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization: an analysis of 6535 patients [^115tZ2CR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage is a common adverse outcome of pregnancy, with a reported prevalence of 12–15% among clinically recognized pregnancies by 20 weeks of gestation. Recurrent miscarriage, as an important part of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more miscarriages, not necessarily consecutive, represents a significant health problem. The exact incidence of recurrent miscarriage is difficult to estimate and varies widely between reports, but most studies report that RPL affects 1–5% of all couples attempting conception.

Spontaneous miscarriage following spontaneous pregnancy, especially recurrent miscarriage, potentially results from a complex interplay between parental age, genetic, hormonal, immunological, uterine, and environmental factors. These explanations allow for treatment interventions in the following pregnancy. Nonetheless, even after a comprehensive evaluation, a cause for recurrent miscarriage is identified in less than 50% of couples. Empirical treatments are usually recommended for unexplained recurrent miscarriage, including emotional support, nutritional optimization, close monitoring, and ultimately rely on natural conception. Most of these treatments show limited effects and offers little benefit to patients. Therefore, at present, unexplained recurrent miscarriage is a frustrating health problem, without effective treatments to improve the live birth rate.

Moreover, the number of previous spontaneous miscarriages is associated with the increased risk of subsequent pregnancy and perinatal complications, including early abortion, preterm birth, and perinatal death, which may also damage fertility. Therefore, even though the empirical therapies are not well defined for their effectiveness, they are still offered for patients with unexplained miscarriage history. Among them, assisted reproductive technique (ART), mainly referring to in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), usually serves as the most common treatment option. Meanwhile, patients with unexplained miscarriage history sometimes suffered from concurrent secondary infertility, in which IVF-ET becomes the compelling choice.

To date, whether couples with unexplained miscarriage histories can benefit from IVF-ET treatment is still a controversial issue and under a heated debate. Some studies believe that for patients with unexplained miscarriage history, especially for those diagnosed with RPL, IVF-ET treatment alone cannot improve the pregnancy efficiency, and may even prolong the time of the next pregnancy occurrence. Other studies have shown that, although there are some confounding factors, the implementation of IVF-ET treatment can significantly reduce the miscarriage rate. Moreover, the overall reproductive performance of women with unexplained miscarriage histories who have received IVF-ET treatment is unclarified purposefully and waiting for further investigations.

### Effectiveness of preconception weight loss interventions on fertility in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gT8go]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Weight loss before conception is recommended for women with overweight or obesity to improve fertility outcomes, but evidence supporting this recommendation is mixed.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of weight loss interventions using lifestyle modification and/or medication in women with overweight or obesity on pregnancy, live birth, and miscarriage.

Data Sources

An electronic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature was conducted through July 6, 2022, via Wiley.

Study Selection and Synthesis

Randomized controlled trials examining weight loss interventions through lifestyle and/or medication in women with overweight or obesity planning pregnancy were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted, reporting the risk ratio (RR) for each outcome. Subgroup analyses were conducted by intervention type, type of control group, fertility treatment, intervention length, and body mass index (BMI).

Main Outcome(S)

Clinical pregnancy, live birth, and miscarriage events.

Result(S)

A narrative review and meta-analysis were possible for 16 studies for pregnancy (n = 3,588), 13 for live birth (n = 3,329), and 11 for miscarriage (n = 3,248). Women randomized and exposed to a weight loss intervention were more likely to become pregnant (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.07–1.44; I² = 59%) but not to have live birth (RR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.97–1.45; I² = 69%) or miscarriage (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.79–1.74; I² = 31%) compared with women in control groups. Subgroup analyses revealed women randomized to weight loss interventions lasting 12 weeks or fewer (n = 9, RR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.13–1.83) and women with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² (n = 7, RR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.18–2.02) were more likely to become pregnant compared with women in the control groups. Miscarriage was higher in intervention groups who underwent fertility treatment (n = 8, RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.07–1.96).

Conclusion(S)

Pregnancy rates were higher in women undergoing preconception weight loss interventions with no impact on live birth or miscarriage rates. Findings do not support one-size-fits-all recommendation for weight loss through lifestyle modification and/or medication in women with overweight or obesity immediately before conception to improve live birth or miscarriage outcomes.

### Management of early pregnancy loss, with a focus on patient centered care [^113fo4Pc]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy loss is the most common complication in pregnancy. Management options for miscarriage include expectant management, medical intervention, or surgical aspiration. Non-surgical and surgical management are all safe and acceptable options for medically uncomplicated patients. Patient and provider preferences contribute profoundly to clinical decisions about miscarriage management. Shared-decision making and evidence based counseling have been shown to significantly improve patient satisfaction with early pregnancy loss care. This review article will discuss the epidemiology and risk factors of early pregnancy loss, current evidence and clinical practice guidelines around management options, and provider and patient preferences for early pregnancy loss management.

### Time to pregnancy after a previous miscarriage in subfertile couples [^115XpyH9]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the time to spontaneous ongoing pregnancy after a previous miscarriage in subfertile couples.

Design

A prospective cohort study.

Setting

The study was conducted in 38 fertility centers in the Netherlands.

Patient(S)

Subfertile couples who miscarried after completing their basic fertility work-up.

Intervention(S)

Expectant management after a miscarriage.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Spontaneous ongoing pregnancy.

Result(S)

We included 5,663 subfertile couples, of which 1,098 (19%) conceived spontaneously. Among these 1,098 couples, 199 (18%) miscarried and these couples were included in the present study. Follow-up was completed for 171 couples, of which 95 conceived again within 24 months of follow-up. Of these 95 pregnancies, 86 (91%) were ongoing. The cumulative spontaneous ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) after 24 months was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59%-81%).

Conclusion(S)

Subfertile couples, who experience a treatment-independent pregnancy resulting in a miscarriage, have very good prospects of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy in the near future. This information is useful in counseling couples who had a miscarriage after a previous period of subfertility.

### Interpregnancy interval after pregnancy loss and risk of repeat miscarriage [^112t9DwW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether interpregnancy interval length after a pregnancy loss is associated with risk of repeat miscarriage.

Methods

This analysis includes pregnant women participating in the Right From the Start (2000–2012) community-based prospective cohort study whose most recent pregnancy before enrollment ended in miscarriage. Interpregnancy interval was defined as the time between a prior miscarriage and the last menstrual period of the study pregnancy. Miscarriage was defined as pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestation. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the association between different interpregnancy interval lengths and miscarriage in the study pregnancy. Adjusted models included maternal age, race, parity, body mass index, and education.

Results

Among the 514 study participants who reported miscarriage as their most recent pregnancy outcome, 15.7% had a repeat miscarriage in the study pregnancy (n = 81). Median maternal age was 30 years (interquartile range 27–34) and 55.6% of participants had at least one previous livebirth (n = 286). When compared with women with interpregnancy intervals of 6–18 months (n = 136), women with intervals of less than 3 months (n = 124) had the lowest risk of repeat miscarriage (7.3% compared with 22.1%; adjusted hazard ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.16–0.71). Neither maternal race nor parity modified the association. Attempting to conceive immediately was not associated with increased risk of miscarriage in the next pregnancy.

Conclusion

An interpregnancy interval after pregnancy loss of less than 3 months is associated with the lowest risk of subsequent miscarriage. This implies counseling women to delay conception to reduce risk of miscarriage may not be warranted.

### Healthcare professional perspectives on improving inter-pregnancy care after a baby loss for women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^114bb72J]. Diabetic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Women with diabetes (WWD) (type 1 and type 2) are around four times more likely to experience baby loss: miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death or termination of pregnancy for medical reasons. Many WWD become pregnant again soon after loss. This study aimed to explore healthcare professional perspectives on improving inter-pregnancy care for WWD after baby loss, as they play a crucial role in facilitating access to support for WWD to prepare for subsequent pregnancy.

Methods

Eighteen healthcare professionals recruited through social media and professional networks between November 2020 and July 2021 participated in a semi-structured remote interview. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.

Results

Three main themes were identified: (1) supporting WWD who want to become pregnant again after baby loss; (2) recognising multiple hidden burdens in the inter-pregnancy interval after loss; (3) discontinuities and constraints in inter-pregnancy care. Most participants tended to assume WWD wanted time and space before thinking about pregnancy after loss, so they did not routinely broach the subject. Participants reported receiving little or no training on managing sensitive conversations. Care provision varied across providers, and unclear referral pathways were challenging to navigate. Participants reported concerns that not all healthcare professionals knew how to mitigate pregnancy risks.

Conclusions

It is unclear who is responsible for supporting WWDs preconception health between baby loss and subsequent pregnancy. Healthcare professionals may be reticent to initiate conversations about pregnancy for fear of causing upset or distress. Future research is required to scope out ways to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and practical tips on sensitively raising the topic of subsequent pregnancy.

Results

Population Characteristics

The Table shows characteristics for time-to-pregnancy and miscarriage populations. The study population for time-to-pregnancy analyses consisted of 3033 episodes among women (median [IQR] age, 31.6 years [IQR, 29.2–34.5 years]; 1875 Dutch [62.1%]; median BMI, 23.5 [IQR, 21.2–26.5]) and 2288 episodes among men (median age, 33.4 years [IQR, 30.5–36.8 years]; 1506 Dutch [66.3%]; median BMI, 24.9 [IQR, 23.0–27.4]). The study population for miscarriage analyses consisted of 2770 pregnancy episodes among women (median age, 31.5 years [IQR, 28.9–34.3 years]; 1620 Dutch [63.2%]; median BMI, 23.5 [IQR, 21.3–26.7]) and 2189 pregnancy episodes among men (median age, 33.5 years [IQR, 30.4–36.8 years]; 1370 Dutch [66.1%]; median BMI, 25.0 [IQR, 23.0–27.5]). The median time to pregnancy was 3.7 months (95% range [2.5%-97.5%], 0.0–68.3 months). In total, 541 of the 3033 episodes (17.8%) were subfertile, and 314 of the 2770 pregnancy episodes (11.3%) led to a miscarriage. Prepregnancy weight was not available in 383 of the 2770 episodes, for which we used the first early-pregnancy weight measurement. eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1 show characteristics of participants and episodes with or without an observed outcome. Nonresponse analyses showed a loss to follow-up of 7.8% (296 of 3772) when comparing women with and women without an observed outcome (eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1). Women and men included in the study populations were older, had a lower BMI, and were more frequently Dutch compared with those not included. The percentage of missing data for covariates ranged from 0% to 18.4% (509 of 2770).

### Incidence of pregnancy after expectant, medical, or surgical management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: long term follow-up of miscarriage treatment (MIST) randomised controlled trial [^116sSYXS]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

The questionnaire was sent with a consent form, covering letter, and freepost envelope for return. We estimated from published studiesthat the MIST trial cohort would give 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of about 0.7 in fertility rates between any two of the management methods.

To assess representativeness, we compared respondents and non-respondents (including those not consenting to follow-up) using either χ² test or Student's t test. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed and log rank tests used to compare fertility rates for the following possible predictors: management method (expectant, medical, surgical); any previous birth after 24 weeks' gestation (yes, no); previous miscarriages (0, 1, 2, ≥ 3); and age at recruitment to the MIST trial (< 25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ≥ 40). Significant (P < 0.05) predictors were included in a proportional hazards multivariate model. Separate analyses were undertaken for fertility (not shown) and for live births. Quoted denominators vary slightly because of occasional non-response to individual questions. Sensitivity analyses considered how the results might be affected by extreme assumptions about the non-respondents.

### Risk of miscarriage with bivalent vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18: pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^114ot9Sh]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

The power of our study to detect a moderate effect of the vaccine in subsets of pregnancies, the absence of established effects of other vaccines on miscarriage, and the low prior probability that Cervarix has an effect on miscarriage combined with the limited statistical evidence of effect lead us to conclude that the HPV vaccine probably does not cause miscarriage. The observed variation in the differences between rates of miscarriage between arms in the subset of pregnancies conceived closer to vaccination is consistent with a small effect of vaccination or statistical noise. The similarity of miscarriage rates in the two arms for conceptions that began beyond three months after vaccination provides some reassurance that there is no long term effect of the vaccine.

Nonetheless, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an increased risk among pregnancies conceived within three months of vaccination. It is unlikely that postmarketing surveillance will find small but important effects of vaccination on miscarriage because of the difficulties of ascertaining miscarriages in comparable unvaccinated women and determining timing of last menstrual period in vaccinated women, which is needed to investigate whether any effect is restricted to pregnancies conceived near vaccination. We recommend further analyses of data on miscarriage from randomised controlled trials to help to clarify further whether vaccines have any effect on miscarriage: pooling reported and as yet unreported data on both vaccines with the VLP antigen — that is, Cervarix and Gardasil — and pooling all data from Cervarix and other GSK vaccines containing the same novel adjuvant as Cervarix.

### Preliminary findings on the experiences of care for women who suffered early pregnancy losses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study [^113Q5XVM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy loss and perinatal death

Pregnancy – when desired, expected, and planned – is most often associated with optimistic sentiment, leading to a positive lifecourse trajectory. A pregnancy loss, however, can act as a 'lifecourse rupture' and detrimentally impact the imagined future of pregnancy and parenthood as this negative trajectory is taken. Every year, many millions of women, their partners, and their wider family units are affected by pregnancy loss; with worldwide estimates recording approximately 23million miscarriages and 2.6million stillbirths annually. In the UK, approximately 700,000 births occur each year. Recent incidence rates remain relatively consistent for pregnancy loss in the UK and are as follows: 1 in 4 for miscarriage; 1 in 10 for pregnancies of unknown location; 1 in 54 for early elective abortions and terminations due to foetal abnormality ;1 in 100 for ectopic pregnancies; 1 in 300 for stillbirth; 1 in 590 for trophoblastic disease ('molar pregnancies') and 1 in 660 for neonatal death.

The incidence rates for early pregnancy loss in the UK are likely to be under-reported as many pregnancies end in undetected loss and are, therefore, unrecorded, unless there is need for medical or surgical intervention and care. Whilst late (second trimester) miscarriages, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths are associated with greater recording accuracy, the recording of early pregnancy loss is also thwarted by the fact that care pathways fall between primary care services, maternity care, and gynaecological and/or specialist or private early pregnancy units, and many early pregnancy losses occur outside the healthcare system. In the UK, Early Pregnancy Assessment Units [EPAUs] are the main healthcare service responsible for the clinical care and management of early pregnancy loss; however, they vary in their organisation, but face significant organisational and human resource deficits which have the potential to impede the provision of high-quality, effective, and compassionate perinatal bereavement care.

### First trimester miscarriage [^1172yTp9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

First trimester miscarriage, or early pregnancy loss, is a common occurrence in the United States. Miscarriage management includes expectant, medical, or surgical approaches. Decisions about management options should be approached through shared decision making between the patient and provider and with consideration of patient's preferences, hemodynamic stability, cost, gestational age, and effectiveness. Emergencies requiring immediate interventions are rare. Newer developments in management, including a more effective medical regimen with the addition of mifepristone and cost-effective and convenient in-office surgical interventions, have expanded treatment options.

### Infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and risk of stroke: pooled analysis of individual patient data of 618 851 women [^11418dZy]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth

Information on infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth was mostly obtained through questionnaires at baseline, or in some studies at repeated follow-up surveys (table S2). Women provide information on their reproductive history according to their understanding, previous diagnosis, or treatment by a physician. Questions related to infertility were asked, such as whether the woman had tried to become pregnant during a period of 12 months or more without success, consulted a doctor for infertility, had a diagnosis of infertility from a doctor, or been treated for infertility. Women with any of the above experiences were identified as having experienced infertility. For miscarriage and stillbirth, the outcome of each pregnancy (livebirth, miscarriage, or stillbirth), number of miscarriages, and number of stillbirths were recorded. The numbers of miscarriages and stillbirths were categorised into four categories (0, 1, 2, and ≥ 3) and three categories (0, 1, and ≥ 2), respectively. Recurrent miscarriages was defined as three or more miscarriages, and recurrent stillbirths was defined as two or more stillbirths, which could be interspersed with livebirths.

### Incidence of pregnancy after expectant, medical, or surgical management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: long term follow-up of miscarriage treatment (MIST) randomised controlled trial [^111ZPgqd]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

The methods of the MIST trial are described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the trial recruited women who had had an early (< 13 weeks' gestation) miscarriage between May 1997 and December 2001 from early pregnancy assessment clinics in the south west of England. They were randomly allocated to surgical evacuation of retained products of conception, medical treatment with mifepristone or misoprostol, or both, or expectant management. The clinical and economic results of the trial are reported elsewhere, as are women's experiences.

A preliminary survey involving the general practitioners of 99 of the original participants was undertaken to assess ease of contacting women. This achieved a response rate of 79%. Subsequently, in 2005–7, women who completed the original trial and their general practitioners were sent a postal questionnaire; the only exclusions were women who opted out of any follow-up or for whom the original general practitioner advised against follow-up. The two items of primary interest were time to next pregnancy and time to next live birth. When questionnaire packs were returned "addressee unknown", we used the Office for National Statistics tracing services to identify the woman's current health authority information. Health authorities were then requested to forward a pack to her general practitioner for subsequent forwarding. The mailing period extended over two years because of the time delay in obtaining tracing authorisation from all four countries in the United Kingdom. Women's general practitioners were also asked for details of subsequent pregnancies; women's replies were used if there were discrepancies between the two.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^112wbRXh]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) — definition, prevalence, and evaluation thresholds — recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a distinct disorder defined by two or more failed clinical pregnancies, while clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 15–25% of pregnancies. It is estimated that fewer than 5% of women will experience two consecutive miscarriages and only 1% experience three or more. For determining whether evaluation for RPL is appropriate, pregnancy is defined as a clinical pregnancy documented by ultrasonography or histopathological examination, and ideally a threshold of three or more losses should be used for epidemiological studies while clinical evaluation may proceed following two first-trimester pregnancy losses. Self-reported losses by patients may not be accurate, and in one study only 71% of self-reported clinical pregnancy losses could be verified in hospital records.

### Preconception contraceptive use and miscarriage: prospective cohort study [^112pBnA3]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Nearly all women in the United States of America will use contraception in their lifetimes. Given the high prevalence of contraceptive use, the potential reproductive effect of contraceptives after discontinuation is important to understand. Individual discontinuation of several hormonal contraceptives has been associated with transient delays in return to fertility of up to eight cycles. However, less is known about the potential impact of contraceptive use on pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage (defined as pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestation).

Miscarriage occurs in about 20% of recognised pregnancies, but few modifiable risk factors have been identified. Several studies have evaluated the association between history of oral contraceptive use and miscarriage. Somebut not allstudies reported that use of oral contraceptives was associated with a lower risk of miscarriage compared with non-use, although these studies used various exposure definitions (eg, recent use v ever use). In mice, prolonged suppression of ovulation via use of a progestin implant slowed the physiological aging of oocytes, and may thereby reduce the risk of miscarriages associated with chromosoma abnormalities. Recent use of some hormonal contraceptives could plausibly increase risk of early miscarriage if the endometrium remains thin or endometrial receptivity is altered after cessation of the method. All hormonal contraceptives (oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, injectable, patch, ring, and implant methods) administer progestin, either alone or with estrogen, and any of these methods could affect miscarriage risk through similar mechanisms. However, no research has been published on the risk of miscarriage associated with preconception use of other contraceptives.

In this study, we evaluated preconception use of a range of contraceptives and risk of miscarriage within a North American prospective cohort study of pregnancy planners.

### Brief report: miscarriages in female rheumatoid arthritis patients: associations with serologic findings, disease activity, and antirheumatic drug treatment [^115Sx2Fi]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the association between miscarriage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and serologic findings, disease activity, and antirheumatic drug treatment, and to study disease activity and reproductive outcomes after a miscarriage.

Methods

Within a nationwide prospective cohort study (Pregnancy-Induced Amelioration of RA study), patients with RA were followed up from preconception until 6 months after delivery or miscarriage. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables of interest, with covariates included in the models if the P value for association with miscarriage was < 0.20 and subsequently excluded if the P value was > 0.10.

Results

Among 162 pregnancies, 28 miscarriages occurred (17.3%; 95% confidence interval 12.2–24.0%). Women who miscarried were older than women with an ongoing pregnancy. Women who miscarried tended to be more often positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), to have higher disease activity scores, and to have more often received methotrexate (MTX) therapy in the past. Logistic regression showed a tendency toward a higher likelihood of miscarriage in association with increasing age (P = 0.065) and presence of ACPAs (P = 0.092). After miscarriage, 33% of women had a flare of RA. Within 1 year, 68% of women became pregnant again, 14% stopped trying to conceive, and 11% were lost to followup. The live birth rate of the subsequent pregnancy was 90%.

Conclusion

The miscarriage rate in the PARA cohort is comparable to that in the general population. Due to the low frequency of miscarriages in this study, the associations between miscarriage in RA and the presence of ACPAs, disease activity, and MTX use did not reach statistical significance. Within 1 year after miscarriage, the majority of patients who continued trying to conceive achieved a pregnancy resulting in a live birth.

### Preconception contraceptive use and miscarriage: prospective cohort study [^116a7tNd]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this prospective study of nearly 9000 individuals, most contraceptives had little effect on the rate of miscarriage. Recent use of patch and injectable contraceptives was associated with a slightly higher rate of miscarriage, although these results were based on small numbers of individuals. Many behavioural and sociodemographical differences were reported across users of different contraceptives, yet, results were consistent across models adjusted for confounders.

Comparison with other studies

Hormonal contraception can be divided into progestin-only methods (implant, injectable, and some oral contraceptives (known as the minipill) and combined methods, which contain both progestin and a synthetic estrogen (vaginal ring, transdermal patch, and combined oral contraceptives) (online supplemental table S4). Continuous administration of progestins in hormonal contraceptives prevents normal fluctuations in steroid hormones and blocks the proliferative effects of oestrogen. Progestins prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and causing the endometrium to become atrophic. The addition of estrogen in combined contraceptives provides stability to the endometrium to prevent breakthrough bleeding and increases the potency of the progestin component.

Use of certain hormonal contraception is associated with transient delays in return to fertility, which suggests effects on endogenous hormonal rhythms and that the endometrial milieu persists after discontinuation. The longest delays in return to fertility have been observed for injectable contraceptives. Injectables contain substantially higher dosages of progestin compared with other types of hormonal contraceptionand thus cause large reductions in endogenous concentrations of estradiol and progesterone. In addition to these effects, the progestin component of injectable contraceptives (medroxyprogesterone acetate) has strong immunological effectsthat could impact the establishment of pregnancy.

### Preconception contraceptive use and miscarriage: prospective cohort study [^117BqwPD]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Assessment of miscarriage

Miscarriage was defined as pregnancy loss occurring before 20 completed weeks of gestation; this definition included blighted ovum but not ectopic pregnancy. We used data up to and including the first observed pregnancy per participant; in other words, we assessed one pregnancy per participant.

On follow-up questionnaires, participants reported the date of their last menstrual period, whether they were currently pregnant, whether they had had a miscarriage, and the timing of their first home pregnancy test (whether negative or positive) relative to the day of expected menses). Participants who were currently pregnant completed the early pregnancy questionnaire on which they reported any pregnancy losses since their previous questionnaire, the due date of their current pregnancy, and the timing of their first positive pregnancy test relative to the day of expected menses. Miscarriages occurring after the early pregnancy questionnaire were identified on the late pregnancy questionnaire (online supplemental figure S1).

Participants who miscarried were asked to report how many weeks the pregnancy lasted and on what date the pregnancy ended. We used the participant's reported gestational weeks at loss where available. Among participants who did not report their gestational weeks at loss but reported a due date (10%, n = 192/1841), we estimated gestational age as: (pregnancy end date – (pregnancy due date–280 days))/7. Among participants who reported neither their gestational weeks at miscarriage nor their due date (21%, n = 385/1841), we estimated gestational weeks at loss as: (pregnancy end date – last menstrual period date)/7. For participants who were lost to follow-up, we attempted to collect outcome data by contacting them via email or phone, by linking to birth registries in selected states (CA, FL, MA, MI, OH, PA, TX, and NY), and by searching for baby registries and birth announcements online.

### Patient experiences with miscarriage management in the emergency and ambulatory settings [^1123mANh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Miscarriage, or early pregnancy loss, is a common pregnancy complication, affecting approximately one in five pregnancies in the United States. Most miscarriages occur within the first trimester, and potentially before the usual time of the first prenatal appointment. Patients with concerns about a potential miscarriage, perhaps prompted by bleeding after a positive pregnancy test, present for care in emergency departments (EDs) at a rate of approximately 500,000 each year in the United States. The health care setting in which a patient receives the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of an early pregnancy complication such as miscarriage can influence her experience. People often suffer stress and grief with miscarriage, and clinicians caring for these patients have the opportunity to mitigate, rather than exacerbate, these negative outcomes.

Patients may choose the ED over the ambulatory setting for a variety of reasons, including access and affordability, level of perceived clinical urgency, or clinician recommendation. When a nonviable pregnancy is diagnosed in early pregnancy, a patient may wait for natural tissue expulsion or select active management with a procedure or medication. The choice between expectant or active management often hinges on how important the timing of the resolution of the miscarriage is to the patient. We therefore sought to characterize the timeline from presentation to resolution in patients with miscarriage seeking care in emergency and ambulatory settings, as well as patient satisfaction with miscarriage management among these two groups.

### Does a short luteal phase correlate with an increased risk of miscarriage? A cohort study [^112Bao9k]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study sought to address a very common adverse medical event that is rarely studied with the goal of identifying a novel risk factor that can be identified with fertility charting methods and may be modifiable. Additional strengths of our study included our ability to access four unique datasets representing a population of patients from the US and Europe over a 20-year period. Limitations of our study included a smaller than expected sample size that may be underpowered to detect differences among women who experienced a miscarriage as compared to those that did not. Our study was limited to largely white, non-Hispanic women. Finally, we did not have the gestational age at the time of miscarriage for the majority of women. However, statistically the highest rate of miscarriage is highest in the first trimester (> 80%) and we hypothesized that this is where a short luteal phase may have the greatest impact. Future research among more ethnically and racially diverse populations is needed. We had a limited number of cycles preceding the pregnancy cycle to adequately assess the impact of the number of short luteal phases on the outcome of the pregnancy, especially in women with two short luteal phases. Additionally, although women were generally advised to do a pregnancy test if their luteal phase was 16 days or more, if there was a loss prior to that time or women did not do a pregnancy test, it is possible that some early miscarriages were not captured. A larger sample size may have strengthened the study findings. Finally, we did not have information about other potential risk factors or causes for miscarriage, such as autoimmune or endocrine disorders that may have affected miscarriage rates.

### Norelgestromin and ethinly estradiol [^113a3D1y]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

If you are not breastfeeding, wait 4 weeks before using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system and use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If you have had sex since your baby was born, wait for your first period, or see your healthcare provider to make sure you are not pregnant before starting norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system.

If you are starting norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system after a miscarriage or abortion:

You may start norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system immediately after a miscarriage or abortion that occurs in the first 12 weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. You do not need to use another contraceptive method.
If you do not start norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system within 5 days after a first trimester miscarriage or abortion, use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, while you wait for your period to start. You have 2 ways to begin using your norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch. Choose the way that is best for you:

### Grief following miscarriage: a comprehensive review of the literature [^117SdcRo]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The literature exploring the relationship between miscarriage and grief is sparse. This paper summarizes the literature on grief subsequent to an early miscarriage to elucidate the nature, incidence, intensity, and duration of grief at this time and to identify potential moderators.

Methods

An electronic search of the Medline and Psych Info databases was conducted. Studies were selected for inclusion if they related to early miscarriage, used a standardized measure to assess perinatal grief, and specified the assessment intervals employed. Qualitative studies were included when helpful to develop hypotheses.

Results

Descriptions of grief following miscarriage are highly variable but tend to match descriptions of grief used to characterize other types of significant losses. A sizable percentage of women seem to experience a grief reaction, with the actual incidence of grief unclear. Suggestively, grief, when present, seems to be similar in intensity to grief after other types of major losses and is significantly less intense by about 6 months. Few conclusions can be drawn in regard to potential moderators of grief following a miscarriage.

Conclusions

Although additional research is clearly needed, guidelines for coping with grief following miscarriage can be based on the data available on coping with other significant types of losses. Given the range of potential meanings for this primarily prospective and symbolic loss, practitioners need to encourage patients to articulate the specific nature of their loss and assist in helping them concretize the experience.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^113dzNHa]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Sporadic miscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy. Two or three consecutive pregnancy losses is a less common phenomenon, and this is considered a distinct disease entity. Sporadic miscarriages are considered to primarily represent failure of abnormal embryos to progress to viability. Recurrent miscarriage is thought to have multiple etiologies, including parental chromosomal anomalies, maternal thrombophilic disorders, immune dysfunction and various endocrine disturbances. However, none of these conditions is specific to recurrent miscarriage or always associated with repeated early pregnancy loss. In recent years, new theories about the mechanisms behind sporadic and recurrent miscarriage have emerged. Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest a multifactorial background where immunological dysregulation in pregnancy may play a role, as well as lifestyle factors and changes in sperm DNA integrity. Recent experimental evidence has led to the concept that the decidualized endometrium acts as biosensor of embryo quality, which if disrupted, may lead to implantation of embryos destined to miscarry. These new insights into the mechanisms behind miscarriage offer the prospect of novel effective interventions that may prevent this distressing condition.

### Preconception and early-pregnancy body mass index in women and men, time to pregnancy, and risk of miscarriage [^113rFtzY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Couples could participate more than once for different preconception or pregnancy episodes. In total, there were 4036 participant episodes from 3604 unique women, leading to 3577 pregnancies of 3200 unique women at the end of the study. In total, 71.3% of partners (2568 of 3604) participated in the study. For the present study, episodes without information on BMI (n = 264) were excluded. For the time-to-pregnancy analyses, we excluded episodes without information on time to pregnancy (n = 542) or, in case of not conceiving, duration of actively pursuing pregnancy (n = 197). A total of 3033 episodes (2856 unique women) were used. Fecundability analyses were based on 2739 episodes due to removing participants using assisted reproductive technology. Subfertility analyses were based on 3018 episodes due to removing participants with a duration of actively pursuing pregnancy of less than 12 months. For the miscarriage analyses, we excluded episodes without a pregnancy at the end of the study phase (n = 458), inclusion after 22 weeks of pregnancy (n = 316), or those withdrawn (n = 116), lost to follow-up (n = 35), or who moved outside the study area (n = 77). A total of 2770 pregnancy episodes (2507 unique women) were used for logistic regression analyses and 2763 pregnancy episodes for Cox proportional hazards regression analyses due to removing participants without a gestational age at miscarriage (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: medication management for early pregnancy loss [^111hoyU1]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning — communication and terminology for EPL advises that Clinicians should use patient-centered language and individualized counseling to improve patient-clinician communication, and in a survey of English-speaking patients in the US being treated for first-trimester pregnancy loss, the terms "miscarriage" and "early pregnancy loss" were preferred by patients and provided the most clarity, with preferences varying by ethnicity and history of abortion; We do not recommend qualifiers such as "elective", "therapeutic", or "medically necessary" when referring to pregnancy loss or abortion care, as these terms further perpetuate abortion stigma.

### Incidence of pregnancy after expectant, medical, or surgical management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: long term follow-up of miscarriage treatment (MIST) randomised controlled trial [^1135NNmD]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

Of the 1199 women recruited to the original trial, we sent questionnaires to 1128 women and their GPs. For the 71 remaining we had no consent from the patient or her original general practitioner for such follow-up. Questionnaires providing subsequent pregnancy details were returned for 762 women (68% response rate), from the woman herself, her general practitioner, or both.

With data recorded as part of the original MIST trial protocol, table 1compares respondents to this follow-up survey with non-respondents (including the 71 not sent a questionnaire as well as those not returning questionnaires). The respondents were broadly representative of the MIST trial population, with no significant differences between respondents and non-respondents.

Among the survey respondents, 634/758 (84%, 95% confidence interval 81% to 86%) reported a subsequent pregnancy since the index miscarriage, with 565/689 (82%, 79% to 85%) having a live birth. Time to subsequently giving birth was similar in the three randomised groups (fig 1; P = 0.41). Five years after the index miscarriage 177/224 (79%, 73% to 84%) of those who had been randomised to expectant management had given birth, compared with 181/230 (79%, 73% to 84%) in the medical group and 192/235 (82%, 76% to 86%) in the surgical group.

### The effects of a postmiscarriage menstrual period prior to reconceiving [^115x2dYQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal interpregnancy interval after a single pregnancy loss is controversial. It is common obstetrical practice to recommend that women who have had a miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy should wait for 1 or more menstrual cycles before attempting to conceive again.

Objective

This study aimed to assess whether conception before the first menstrual period after a spontaneous pregnancy loss is associated with a risk of repeat miscarriage or adverse perinatal outcomes.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included 107 women who had a spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by a subsequent pregnancy with an interpregnancy interval of < 12 weeks. All miscarriages had ended in either spontaneous expulsion of the products of conception or medical or surgical evacuation of the uterus. The perinatal outcome measures of 57 women who conceived after the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage were compared with perinatal outcome measures of 50 women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage. The primary outcome was rate of pregnancy loss, and the secondary outcomes were gestational age at delivery and birthweight.

Results

The rate of recurrent miscarriage was 10.4% for women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage and 15.8% for those who conceived after (P = 0.604). There were no differences in the gestational age at delivery (38.9 vs 38.7 weeks; p = 0.66) or the birthweight (3347 ± 173 vs 3412 ± 156 g; p = 0.5) between the 2 groups. Other outcomes, such as mode of delivery and 5-minute Apgar score, were also similar for both groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that conception before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage was not associated with a higher incidence of subsequent miscarriage (odds ratio, 1.74; p = 0.46) or any other untoward outcome.

Conclusion

Conception shortly after a spontaneous miscarriage without waiting for at least the first postmiscarriage menstrual period is not associated with adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes compared with those of women with similar interpregnancy intervals who conceived after their next menstrual period.

### Valsartan [^112drnGV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Valsartan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Published reports include cases of anhydramnios and oligohydramnios in pregnant women treated with valsartan (see Clinical Considerations).

When pregnancy is detected, consider alternative drug treatment and discontinue valsartan as soon as possible.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Epidemiology of sporadic and recurrent miscarriage

Human reproduction is characterized by its inefficiency. Prospective cohort studies using sensitive and specific daily urinary hCG assays in women trying to conceive have demonstrated that only around one-third of conceptions progress to a live birth. An estimated 30% of human conceptions are lost prior to implantation and a further 30% following implantation but before the missed menstrual period, that is in the third or fourth week of gestation. These are often termed preclinical losses (Figure 1). Finally, the incidence of early clinical pregnancy loss is estimated to be 15% of conceptions with a significant variation according to age. Thus, the incidence ranges from 10% in women aged 20 to 24 years to 51% in women aged 40 to 44 years. Late losses between 12 and 22 weeks occur less frequently and constitute around 4% of pregnancy outcomes.

Figure 1
The pregnancy loss iceberg: an overview of the outcome of spontaneous human conceptions. It is estimated that 70% of conceptions are lost prior to live birth. The majority of these losses occur prior to implantation or before the missed menstrual period, and since they are not revealed to the woman they are termed preclinical. In the pregnancy loss 'iceberg', they are therefore below the 'waterline'. Figure reproduced with permission from Oxford University Press.

Compared to sporadic miscarriage the prevalence of RM is considerably lower irrespective of whether biochemical losses are included or not. If only clinical miscarriages are included the prevalence is 0.8% to 1.4%. If, however, biochemical losses are included the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 2% to 3%. Since the incidence of RM is greater than would be predicted by chance, it is considered to represent a disease entity defined by a series of events, with a number of possible etiologies.

### Risk of miscarriage with bivalent vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18: pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^112Abgsu]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found no significant increase in miscarriage rate in women who had received the Cervarix vaccine against HPV compared with women assigned to a control arm. We found no evidence of a decrease either in total new pregnancies or in new pregnancies ending in live birth in the HPV arm, and, thus, no evidence that the HPV vaccine affected loss of undetected pregnancies. Among our subgroup analyses, we found a non-significant imbalance in estimated miscarriage rates for pregnancies conceived within three months after the nearest vaccination, the time frame with the highest prior probability of an effect. We found no sign of a detrimental effect of HPV vaccination on miscarriage rates for pregnancies conceived beyond three months after vaccination, even though power to detect an effect with a relative risk of about 2 during this time period was substantial.

Strengths and weaknesses

Despite the reassurance from our overall results and from studies of other vaccines, we looked carefully for signs of increased risk of miscarriage because even a small effect could cause a large number of miscarriages among the millions of sexually active women worldwide whom we expect to receive the HPV vaccine. We used the permutation test to maintain power to find an effect across a range of subsets of pregnancies possibly at increased risk, while strictly controlling the chance of a false positive result that could lead to overinterpretation of an apparent effect found a posteriori in some subsets of pregnancies.

The absence of a vaccine effect is consistent with other information about risk of miscarriage from vaccination with Cervarix and Gardasil or other vaccines before or during pregnancy. The May 2008 update of guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that risk from vaccinating pregnant women is "primarily theoretical", and that no evidence has shown a risk with vaccines that are not live. ACIP guidelines for Gardasil, which uses the same type of antigen as Cervarix but with a different adjuvant, do not recommend use during pregnancy, though they note that the limited data on vaccination during pregnancy do not show a causal association with adverse outcomes or adverse events in the developing fetus.

### Defining safe criteria to diagnose miscarriage: prospective observational multicentre study [^113xHXVm]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Misdiagnosis of miscarriage is not a theoretical problem. Sensitive home pregnancy tests inform women they are pregnant before their missed period. The potential impact of this was illustrated by Bottomley et al, who showed that the likelihood of a scan showing an intrauterine pregnancy of uncertain viability was 26% at 28–34 days' gestation, 60% at 35–41 days, and 29% at 42–48 days. It is likely that if women attend for an ultrasound scan soon after a positive pregnancy test result, a viable pregnancy will not be confirmed, leaving potential for errors about possible miscarriage. This potential is compounded by the fact that diagnosing miscarriage with certainty is problematic as it is reliant on negative findings — that is, the absence of a structure or a heartbeat. For women who are found to have gestational sac or embryo measurements below or around the cut-off values that we have shown define miscarriage, a definitive diagnosis of miscarriage will only be made after a second scan has been carried out at an interval. In a recent publication, Hu et alfound that 126 of 1013 early pregnancies threatening to miscarry (12%) fell into the more conservative zones defined by the size criteria we have proposed for a single scan to define miscarriage than would have been the case had previous US guidance been used (crown-rump length, previously 5 mm now 7 mm; mean sac diameter, previously 16 mm now 25 mm). Before changes in guidance some of these 126 pregnancies would have been at risk of inadvertent termination. The downside now is that these women will undergo a second scan before a diagnosis is made. This does not mean that all women will require a second scan to make a diagnosis, as many will attend for assessment where the embryo or gestational sac size will be considerably above the decision boundaries used and so allow a definitive diagnosis on the basis of a single visit.

### Predicting outcomes of expectant and medical management in early pregnancy miscarriage using machine learning to develop and validate multivariable clinical prediction models [^116jZEpb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage is the most common pregnancy complication, affecting 1 in 4 women. Approximately 23 million miscarriages occur every year globally, or 44 per minute. Miscarriage can lead to significant psychological and physical morbidity in women and their partners. Further to the trauma of diagnosis, women with missed or incomplete miscarriages, are then left with the decision regarding how they want to manage their pregnancy loss. The options include expectant, medical or surgical management. However, provision of accurate outcome prediction to aid in the decision making is lacking. A clinical decision support tool which generates personalised outcome predictions for each miscarriage management option, may alleviate some of this burden. A machine learning based model could provide each individual a personalised chance of success with expectant and medical management respectively.

Expectant management follows the natural progression of miscarriage and is an attractive option for women who wish to avoid all forms of medical intervention in the treatment of miscarriage. Expectant management is relatively inexpensive and safe, but quoted failure rate varies between 10 and 75%. Randomized trials comparing medical treatment, most often misoprostol, with expectant management or placebo show substantial variation in success rates defined as complete miscarriage without surgical intervention. A challenge during the decision to opt for expectant management of miscarriage is the lack of defined features which reliably predict the likelihood of a complete spontaneous resolution of pregnancy.

National Institute of Clinical Excellence, National guideline UK recommends expectant management for 7 to 14 days as the first-line strategy from women with a confirmed diagnosis of miscarriage. However, there are caveats to this: if the women has a risk of haemorrhage or evidence of infection, or if she has previous adverse and/or traumatic experience associated with pregnancy. The guideline goes on to recommend offering medical management if expected management is not acceptable to the woman. Thus, demonstrating the importance of patient choice in determining miscarriage management pathway. There are no references to ultrasound findings or patient demographic features in guiding miscarriage management choice.

One previous study used clinical data to develop a prediction model with multinomial logistic regression (MLR) for expectant management of miscarriage outcome. This model achieved an AUC of 0.796 with three clinical features used to build a binary MLR model to predict the probability of successful expectant management of first trimester miscarriage. Another study has developed a model to predict medical management of miscarriage outcomes. Hamel 2022, developed a multivariable logistic regression model, using four clinical features, with an AUC of 0.67 to distinguish between success and failure of medical management in miscarriage.

### Infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and risk of stroke: pooled analysis of individual patient data of 618 851 women [^111vuyAo]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Infertility and pregnancy loss, especially recurrent miscarriages, and stillbirths, were associated with women's later risk of non-fatal and fatal stroke. The risk of stroke (non-fatal or fatal) associated with infertility or recurrent stillbirths was mainly driven by a single subtype of stroke (non-fatal ischaemic stroke or fatal haemorrhagic stroke, respectively), whereas the risk of stroke (non-fatal or fatal) associated with recurrent miscarriages was driven by both subtypes.

These findings extend our current knowledge on the associations of infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth with stroke, and highlight the need for future studies on the underlying mechanisms, linking the subtype, severity, and prognosis of stroke. A history of recurrent miscarriages and death or loss of a baby before or during birth should be considered a female specific risk factor for stroke. Early monitoring of women with recurrent miscarriages or stillbirths and tailored healthy lifestyle interventions are recommended to lower the risk of stroke.

### Resilient journeys amidst uncertainty: a qualitative study of women's experiences in subsequent pregnancies following pregnancy loss [^111Mv4bD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Theme 1: resilient yet hyper-vigilant emotional experiences

All participants described feelings of joy at becoming pregnant again, yet they remained highly cautious throughout their pregnancies due to fears of recurrent loss or complications.

N1: "I'm quite apprehensive, so I bought a fetal doppler. I have a retroverted uterus, and I didn't expect to get pregnant again so soon after the miscarriage. It feels like fate".

N13: "I can't sleep well at night; sometimes I dream that I'm about to give birth and suddenly the baby disappears. I wake up in a fright and touch my belly to reassure myself it was just a dream".

Some women, shaped by previous experiences with miscarriage, induced abortion, or invasive procedures during hospitalization, reported anticipatory anxiety about routine prenatal exams and the upcoming birth.

N8: "The past curettage was too painful for me. Every time I have prenatal tests involving blood draws or other procedures, I feel fearful. Even the sight of the examination bed makes me uncomfortable… "

N10: "Even though I changed hospitals for my prenatal care, I still feel uneasy every visit. I just want to get it over with and leave as soon as possible".

Several participants spoke of experiencing a sense of "rebirth", gaining a deeper appreciation of their own resilience and potential as mothers. They demonstrated notable psychological strength and looked forward to the arrival of their baby.

N7: "It wasn't until I decided to terminate the pregnancy that I realized I wasn't as fragile as I thought… Being a mom isn't easy, but I'm determined to do my best".

N12: "Life has its ups and downs. For the sake of a healthy baby, we have to push through every obstacle".

### Sporadic miscarriage: evidence to provide effective care [^112Tw92a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

The physical and psychological effect of miscarriage is commonly underappreciated. The journey from diagnosis of miscarriage, through clinical management, to supportive aftercare can be challenging for women, their partners, and caregivers. Diagnostic challenges can lead to delayed or ineffective care and increased anxiety. Inaccurate diagnosis of a miscarriage can result in the unintended termination of a wanted pregnancy. Uncertainty about the therapeutic effects of interventions can lead to suboptimal care, with variations across facilities and countries. For this Series paper, we have developed recommendations for practice from a literature review, appraisal of guidelines, and expert group discussions. The recommendations are grouped into three categories: (1) diagnosis of miscarriage, (2) prevention of miscarriage in women with early pregnancy bleeding, and (3) management of miscarriage. We recommend that every country reports annual aggregate miscarriage data, similarly to the reporting of stillbirth. Early pregnancy services need to focus on providing an effective ultrasound service, as it is central to the diagnosis of miscarriage, and be able to provide expectant management of miscarriage, medical management with mifepristone and misoprostol, and surgical management with manual vacuum aspiration. Women with the dual risk factors of early pregnancy bleeding and a history of previous miscarriage can be recommended vaginal micronised progesterone to improve the prospects of livebirth. We urge health-care funders and providers to invest in early pregnancy care, with specific focus on training for clinical nurse specialists and doctors to provide comprehensive miscarriage care within the setting of dedicated early pregnancy units.

### Pre-pregnancy lifestyle characteristics and risk of miscarriage: the Australian longitudinal study on women's health [^112DFvS3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Information on pregnancy history

Women reported their absolute number of deliveries (live and stillbirths), terminations and miscarriages at each follow-up time. We relied on the woman's report of whether a pregnancy ended in a miscarriage or a stillbirth, as no information on gestational week was available to further distinguish between the two pregnancy outcomes. This information was used to identify new pregnancies between two follow-up times by subtracting the number reported in the later with the previous follow-up time. If a woman did not respond to a specific follow-up questionnaire, we used closest follow-up available. For women who reported a smaller number of total pregnancies at a later time point than the prior time points, we assigned them the total number of pregnancies in the prior time point. We subsequently created a structured dataset containing the total number of new pregnancies women had experienced between recruitment and the end of follow-up. We compared miscarriages to all live births, stillbirths and induced abortions. As we did not have information available on the gestational week of the miscarriages, and we could therefore not separate early/first trimester miscarriages and late miscarriages. We did not include stillbirths as a separate outcome due to insufficient numbers which did not allow for any meaningful analysis. As we did not know the year of birth of all pregnancies that occurred between two follow-up times, we could not study sequential/recurrent miscarriage between two time points, which is commonly defined as two or more subsequent miscarriages without any other pregnancies in between.

Covariates

We obtained information on background characteristics that could influence both the lifestyle characteristics of interest and the risk of miscarriage. These included the age of the woman, marital status (married/de facto versus other), area of residence (major cities, inner regional, outer regional, remote/very remote), managing on income (impossible, difficult always, difficult sometimes, not too bad, it is easy), educational level (less than year 12, year 12 or equivalent, certificate/diploma, university), occupation (manager/professional, semi-skilled, unskilled, not in the labour force), and the number of previous pregnancies (0, 1, 2 or more). Information on these characteristics were taken from the same follow-up questionnaire as the measure of pre-pregnancy lifestyle characteristics.

### Association between interpregnancy interval and adverse birth outcomes in women with a previous stillbirth: an international cohort study [^111yE4LV]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

WHO recommends that women wait at least 2 years after a livebirth and at least 6 months after a miscarriage or induced abortion before conceiving again, to reduce the risk of adverse birth outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy. No recommendation exists for the optimal interval after a stillbirth. We investigated the association between interpregnancy interval after stillbirth and birth outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy.

Methods

In this international cohort study, we used data from birth records from Finland (1987–2016), Norway (1980–2015), and Western Australia (1980–2015). Consecutive singleton pregnancies in women whose most recent pregnancy had ended in stillbirth of at least 22 weeks' gestation were included in the analysis. Interpregnancy interval was defined as the time between the end of pregnancy (delivery date) and the start of the next pregnancy (delivery date of next pregnancy minus gestational age at birth). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for stillbirth, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age birth by interpregnancy interval by country, adjusted for maternal age, parity, decade of delivery, and gestational length of the previous pregnancy. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled ORs.

Findings

We identified 14452 births in women who had a stillbirth in the previous pregnancy; median interpregnancy interval after stillbirth was 9 months (IQR 4–19). 9109 (63%) women conceived within 12 months of the stillbirth. Of the 14452 births, 228 (2%) were stillbirths, 2532 (18%) were preterm births, and 1284 (9%) were small-for-gestational-age births. Compared with an interpregnancy interval of 24–59 months, intervals shorter than 12 months were not associated with increased odds of subsequent stillbirth (pooled adjusted OR 1·09 [95% CI 0·63–1·91] for < 6 months; 0·90 [0·47–1·71] for 6–11 months), preterm birth (0·91 [0·75–1·11] for < 6 months; 0·91 [0·74–1·11] for 6–11 months), or small-for-gestational-age birth (0·66 [0·51–0·85] for < 6 months; 0·64 [0·48–0·84] for 6–11 months). Further, we noted no difference in the association between interpregnancy interval and birth outcomes by gestational length of the previous stillbirth.

Interpretation

Conception within 12 months of a stillbirth was common and was not associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy. These findings could be used when counselling women who are planning future pregnancies after a stillbirth and for informing future recommendations for pregnancy spacing in a high-income setting.

### Navigating miscarriage in Jordan: understanding emotional responses and coping strategies [^1173pHSC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

All studies have agreed that emotional support is very important, regardless of the uniqueness of everyone's experience and healing journey. It is important to remember that people heal at their own pace and there is no right or wrong way to cope with a miscarriage. The healing process after a miscarriage is different for every woman and can take time, patience, and support.

Participants reported varied future pregnancy plans after miscarriage. Although there is no evidence of physiological benefit for delaying a pregnancy attempt after an early loss, a large percent of participants decided to postpone pregnancy. Their decision can be explained by the encouragement of gynecologists to wait a minimum of six months before the next conception to ensure an optimal obstetric and perinatal outcome, despite the need for further research on optimal timing for conception and its impact on obstetric and perinatal outcomes. Nearly 50% of our study participants initiated contraception immediately after the miscarriage, such as intrauterine devices and oral contraceptives. Almost equal percentages regarding contraception methods after miscarriage were reported in Roe et al. (2021), where 14% (33/97) selected a long-acting reversible method, 18% (44/97) a short-acting reversible method, and 8% (20/97) condoms or emergency contraception. Those who need contraception after the completion of miscarriage may safely initiate any method immediately.

On the contrary, women who desire another pregnancy need not delay conception but instead used traditional methods, including but not limited to fertility-enhancing herbs, cupping therapy, or medically assisted reproduction treatments. It was distressfully to discover that women who felt ashamed of miscarriage were three times more likely to get pregnant soon after the miscarriage. Women in Arabic countries, including Jordan, are held responsible for the health of their pregnancy and may be blamed and accused upon miscarriage, particularly if the cause of the miscarriage is not certain. Such feelings can place a woman under intense scrutiny until she proves her ability in subsequent pregnancies. It is important to implement public health programs that increase women's understanding of pregnancy and pregnancy loss, in order to alleviate any unwarranted feelings of shame that Jordanian women may be facing.

### Pregnancy intentions and contraceptive uptake after miscarriage [^111Y1Woi]. Contraception (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify factors associated with contraceptive uptake among participants in a miscarriage management clinical trial.

Study Design

We performed a secondary analysis of a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of medical management regimens for miscarriage between 5 and 12 completed weeks. Pregnancy intention was measured by patient report after miscarriage diagnosis. Participants were offered contraception in accordance with standard clinical care once their miscarriage was completed. We analyzed participants as a cohort and fit a multivariable model to describe demographic characteristics and pregnancy intentions independently associated with contraceptive uptake.

Results

Of 244 participants with available contraceptive outcomes, 121 (50%) stated that this pregnancy was planned, and 218 (90%) stated that they had planned to continue the pregnancy to term. Ninety-seven participants (40%) initiated contraception: 33 (14%) selected a long-acting reversible method, 44 (18%) a short-acting reversible method, and 20 (8%) condoms or emergency contraception, while 147 (60%) declined contraception after miscarriage completion. In the multivariable model, unplanned pregnancy (aRR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.45–3.13) and lack of intention to continue the pregnancy (aRR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.18–2.20) were independently associated with contraceptive uptake. Of participants who declined contraception, 85 (57%) did so in order to conceive again. Nearly one-quarter of participants who declined contraception described the index pregnancy as unplanned, but after miscarriage planned to conceive a new pregnancy.

Conclusion

Patients with unplanned pregnancy who miscarried were twice as likely to initiate contraception as those with planned pregnancy, however pregnancy intentions sometimes changed after miscarriage.

Implications

Miscarriage management represents an important opportunity to clarify pregnancy goals and provide contraceptive counseling. Although unplanned pregnancy correlates with contraceptive uptake, we do not recommend using this clinically to predict contraceptive need. Future research should examine how best to measure pregnancy intention and its relationship to the experience of miscarriage.

### Risk of miscarriage in relation to seasonal influenza vaccination before or during pregnancy [^113VLVem]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pregnant individuals are up to five times more likely to be hospitalized with influenza than nonpregnant individuals. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends influenza vaccination as standard prenatal care, stating that all individuals who are or will become pregnant during influenza season should receive an influenza vaccine. This recommendation is supported globally by the World Health Organization. About 50–61% of pregnant individuals in the United States receive an influenza vaccine before or during pregnancy, and vaccination rates are lower during early pregnancy. Concerns about the safety of influenza vaccination on pregnancy-related outcomes are commonly cited as factors contributing to reduced vaccination uptake.

Numerous studies have assessed the association of influenza vaccination with health outcomes at delivery; fewer studies have evaluated miscarriage, and the results of existing studies have been conflicting. Although the majority of previous studies have reported no risk of miscarriage associated with influenza vaccination, two studies have reported a protective effect of pandemic influenza vaccination on miscarriage, and a 2017 Vaccine Safety Datalink study identified a twofold increase in the odds of miscarriage associated with vaccination during the current and previous influenza seasons. Although the strength and validity of the Vaccine Safety Datalink study were questioned by scientists because of sparse data, and an updated analysis with a larger patient cohort indicated no association, surveys of obstetricians show that media reports from this study increased their concerns about influenza vaccine safety. One in five obstetricians surveyed changed the way that they recommend influenza vaccine, with many reporting that they do not recommend vaccination during the first trimester. To address this, we analyzed prospectively collected data from a large North American prepregnancy cohort study.

Through a systematic review of the existing literature, our study hypothesizes that poor sleep quality, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women may influence the risk of miscarriage. We employed a prospective design to investigate the possible relationships, utilizing both univariate and multivariate models. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the stability and reliability of the results.

Previous models for predicting miscarriage in pregnant women primarily focused on clinical blood markers, lifestyle factors, age, and previous history of miscarriage. However, the scope for altering these variables is limited, thereby restricting the potential for preventive measures against miscarriage. In contrast, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression have the characteristic of being early preventable, allowing for intervention before the onset of miscarriage symptoms, thereby enabling earlier prevention of miscarriages. Therefore, our study constructs a nomogram model for predicting the early occurrence of unexpected miscarriages in pregnant and postpartum women. This model can serve to more effectively alert pregnant and postpartum women, emphasizing the importance of improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety and depression. By doing so, it facilitates the early prevention of miscarriages and reduces the miscarriage rate.

### Spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women with 1 or more pregnancies of 24 weeks or more [^116YcQM2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

43% of parous women experienced at least one spontaneous miscarriage. Miscarriage directly increases with age as well as parity. The more pregnancies, the more miscarriages are experienced. Grand multiparas have both more children and a higher prevalence of miscarriages. Those with 1–5 miscarriages also had an average of 3 living children, those with 6–16 miscarriages, had an average of 4 living children. Parous women until their late 30s, who have experienced multiple miscarriages, can be counseled that if they keep trying, they will likely carry a pregnancy to term.

### Longer commute time is associated with a higher risk of miscarriage: a mixed-effects longitudinal study [^114yxf3L]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Confounders

The first group of confounders was biological factors that increase the probability of miscarriage due to chromosomal anomalies in the foetal tissue karyotype. Maternal age is a main risk factor for miscarriage, in particular, due to an increased risk of chromosomal anomalies among older mothers. However, the general risk of miscarriage is also higher for very young (under 20 years old) women. We used a broader age category for the youngest group because of the low incidence of these pregnancies in the data.

Next, the risk is higher for women with a history of previous miscarriages. The modelling strategy accounted for individual-level fixed effects and, in addition to that, we excluded women who reported having multiple (3 or more) miscarriages during the entire observation period. The binary outcome variable did not record consecutive miscarriages if they happened within the same interval between the two waves. We therefore know whether an adverse event happened, but we do not know whether it happened repeatedly for the same woman. This is discussed in the limitations section, though it does not impair the value of our outcome measure, which was designed to capture whether an adverse event occurred or not. Women who miscarried and subsequently became pregnant or gave birth within the same interval between two survey waves were classified as having had a miscarriage because our focus was on the incidence of adverse outcomes, not on whether a miscarriage was ultimately followed by a successful pregnancy.

To account for the time it took a woman to get pregnant, we included the time to pregnancy (TTP). The question regarding TTP was asked to women who were trying to get pregnant. TTP exceeding 12 months is typically classified as subfertility, and it is also an independent risk factor for miscarriage. We differentiate between TTP of under and over 12 months. Many women were not asked about TTP during the interview, for example, because they were not actively trying to get pregnant or they conceived and reported having had a live birth or a miscarriage in the interval between two waves (the waves were, for most of the sample, spaced 10–14 months apart). This category generally implies a short (under 3 months) time to conceive, in contrast to the other two categories, which cover longer trying times (whether under or over 12 months). We refer to these cases as interval conceptions and missing TTP information.

### Prevalence and clinical, social, and health care predictors of miscarriage [^1174gGXG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous abortion, also known as early pregnancy loss and miscarriage, typically occurs in the first trimester of gestation. Depending on the data source, these losses are estimated to occur in 10–25% of clinically-recognized pregnancies in developed countries. Approximately 50% of early-term miscarriages are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities – "random numeric chromosome errors" – which influences the conventional wisdom that early-term pregnancy losses occur at random, and that all women are at risk. However, other maternal (and sometimes paternal) characteristics have been identified as risk factors, particularly for recurrent miscarriages, including clinical, social, behavioral, and health factors.

Reliable statistics on both the population prevalence and distribution of these losses early in pregnancy are challenging to estimate. The loss may occur before the woman knows she was pregnant and whether a woman seeks medical attention will depend on the accessibility of services, severity of symptoms, and the woman's circumstances. Published estimates range from 5% to 52% of pregnancies, with the bulk of the estimates between 13 and 30%. This variation is due in part to small samples, as well as different populations and time periods under study (e.g. upward trends over time are partly due to to increased awareness of pregnancy). In prospective studies, estimates are affected by the specificity and sensitivity of different methods and assays used to detect pregnancy and when in their menstrual cycle or gestation women are enrolled in the study. Retrospective studies use diagnostic codes to identify miscarriages among hospitalized women and interview data for non-hospitalized women, where recall bias can be a particular challenge. Using existing, population-level data that includes both inpatient and outpatient health care utilization may be a cost-effective way to estimate the prevalence of these events.

### Medical treatments for incomplete miscarriage (less than 24 weeks) [^111DSgWJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Miscarriage occurs in 10% to 15% of pregnancies. The traditional treatment, after miscarriage, has been to perform surgery to remove any remaining pregnancy tissues in the uterus. However, it has been suggested that drug-based medical treatments, or expectant care (no treatment), may also be effective, safe and acceptable.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of any medical treatment for early incomplete miscarriage (before 24 weeks).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (September 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment with expectant care or surgery. Quasi-randomised trials were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Data entry was checked.

Main Results

Fifteen studies (2750 women) were included, there were no studies on women over 13 weeks' gestation. Studies addressed a number of comparisons and data are therefore limited. Three trials compared misoprostol treatment (all vaginally administered) with expectant care. There was no significant difference in complete miscarriage (average risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 2.10; two studies, 150 women), or in the need for surgical evacuation (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.26; two studies, 308 women). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. Nine studies involving 1766 women addressed the comparison of misoprostol (four oral, four vaginal, one vaginal + oral) with surgical evacuation. There was no statistically significant difference in complete miscarriage (average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.00, eight studies, 1377 women) with success rate high for both methods. Overall, there were fewer surgical evacuations with misoprostol (average RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.18; eight studies, 1538 women) but more unplanned procedures (average RR 6.32, 95% CI 2.90 to 13.77; six studies, 1158 women). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. Limited evidence suggests that women generally seem satisfied with their care. Long-term follow up from one included study identified no difference in subsequent fertility between the three approaches.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that medical treatment, with misoprostol, and expectant care are both acceptable alternatives to routine surgical evacuation given the availability of health service resources to support all three approaches. Women experiencing miscarriage at less than 13 weeks should be offered an informed choice.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (Hyzaar) [^114iDLjL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

HYZAAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue HYZAAR as soon as possible (see Clinical Considerations).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

### Effect of interpregnancy interval on outcomes of pregnancy after miscarriage: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics in scotland [^1152pTKq]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage or spontaneous pregnancy loss before 24 completed weeks of gestation affects one in five pregnancies. Women with an initial miscarriage are at increased risk not only of a second miscarriagebut also of complications in a subsequent pregnancy. Compared with women who have never been pregnant, those who have miscarried are more likely to experience threatened miscarriage, preterm birth, induced labour, and postpartum haemorrhage in the next pregnancy.

Any miscarriage is associated with distress and prompts questions about the optimal timing of the next pregnancy. How long a couple should wait before trying for another pregnancy after a miscarriage is controversial. Some clinicians believe that there is little justification for delaying the next pregnancy, as an increased interpregnancy interval is unlikely to improve perinatal outcomes, whereas a new viable pregnancy and the birth of a child could enhance the women's chances of recovery. Others suggest waiting at least six months for full mental and physical recovery before another pregnancy. Current guidelines from the World Health Organization recommend that women should wait for at least six months before trying again, whereas others suggest a delay of up to 18 months, based on reports that interpregnancy intervals of 18–23 months after a live birth can enhance maternal and perinatal outcomes in the next pregnancy. This length of delay, however, poses a particular problem for women in the Western world as they tend to delay childbearing for several social and economic reasons. Women over 35 are more likely to experience difficulties in conceiving and women aged 40 have a 30% chance of miscarriage, which rises to 50% in those aged 45 or more. Any delay in attempting conception could further decrease the chances of a healthy baby. Many women are aware of this potential problem, which is why first time mothers aged 35 or over are more likely to plan a second pregnancy shortly after their first.

We compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with different interpregnancy intervals after a miscarriage in an initial pregnancy. The Scottish morbidity records collect information on all hospital admissions in Scotland and therefore offer an ideal opportunity to examine the effects of interpregnancy intervals after miscarriage on outcomes of the subsequent pregnancy.

### Methods for managing miscarriage: a network meta-analysis [^113oAfwx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. An estimated 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Miscarriage can lead to serious morbidity, including haemorrhage, infection, and even death, particularly in settings without adequate healthcare provision. Early miscarriages occur during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically. However, there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and risks of each option.

Objectives

To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different management methods for early miscarriage, and to provide rankings of the available methods according to their effectiveness, safety, and side-effect profile using a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (9 February 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 February 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of methods for miscarriage management. Early miscarriage was defined as less than or equal to 14 weeks of gestation, and included missed and incomplete miscarriage. Management of late miscarriages after 14 weeks of gestation (often referred to as intrauterine fetal deaths) was not eligible for inclusion in the review. Cluster- and quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded non-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for the primary outcomes of complete miscarriage and composite outcome of death or serious complications. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Relative effects for the primary outcomes are reported subgrouped by the type of miscarriage (incomplete and missed miscarriage). We also performed pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available methods.

Main Results

Our network meta-analysis included 78 randomised trials involving 17,795 women from 37 countries. Most trials (71/78) were conducted in hospital settings and included women with missed or incomplete miscarriage. Across 158 trial arms, the following methods were used: 51 trial arms (33%) used misoprostol; 50 (32%) used suction aspiration; 26 (16%) used expectant management or placebo; 17 (11%) used dilatation and curettage; 11 (6%) used mifepristone plus misoprostol; and three (2%) used suction aspiration plus cervical preparation. Of these 78 studies, 71 (90%) contributed data in a usable form for meta-analysis. Complete miscarriage Based on the relative effects from the network meta-analysis of 59 trials (12,591 women), we found that five methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for achieving a complete miscarriage: · suction aspiration after cervical preparation (risk ratio (RR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.20, low-certainty evidence), · dilatation and curettage (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75, low-certainty evidence), · suction aspiration (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.62, low-certainty evidence), · mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.66, moderate-certainty evidence), · misoprostol (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46, low-certainty evidence). The highest ranked surgical method was suction aspiration after cervical preparation. The highest ranked non-surgical treatment was mifepristone plus misoprostol. All surgical methods were ranked higher than medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Composite outcome of death and serious complications Based on the relative effects from the network meta-analysis of 35 trials (8161 women), we found that four methods with available data were compatible with a wide range of treatment effects compared with expectant management or placebo: · dilatation and curettage (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.06, low-certainty evidence), · suction aspiration (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.32, low-certainty evidence), · misoprostol (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.15, low-certainty evidence), · mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.84, low-certainty evidence). Importantly, no deaths were reported in these studies, thus this composite outcome was entirely composed of serious complications, including blood transfusions, uterine perforations, hysterectomies, and intensive care unit admissions. Expectant management and placebo ranked the lowest when compared with alternative treatment interventions. Subgroup analyses by type of miscarriage (missed or incomplete) agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were the most effective treatment, followed by medical methods and then expectant management or placebo, but there are possible subgroup differences in the effectiveness of the available methods. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on relative effects from the network meta-analysis, all surgical and medical methods for managing a miscarriage may be more effective than expectant management or placebo. Surgical methods were ranked highest for managing a miscarriage, followed by medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Expectant management or placebo had the highest chance of serious complications, including the need for unplanned or emergency surgery. A subgroup analysis showed that surgical and medical methods may be more beneficial in women with missed miscarriage compared to women with incomplete miscarriage. Since type of miscarriage (missed and incomplete) appears to be a source of inconsistency and heterogeneity within these data, we acknowledge that the main network meta-analysis may be unreliable. However, we plan to explore this further in future updates and consider the primary analysis as separate networks for missed and incomplete miscarriage.

2.2 How to Take Tri-Linyah

Starting Tri-Linyah after Abortion or Miscarriage

First-trimester

After a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage, Tri-Linyah may be started immediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if Tri-Linyah is started immediately.
If Tri-Linyah is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle pack of Tri-Linyah.

Second-trimester

Do not start until 4 weeks after a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Tri-Linyah, following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient's first cycle pack of Tri-Linyah [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling .]

Starting Tri-Linyah after Childbirth

Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Tri-Linyah following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception.
Tri-Linyah is not recommended for use in lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Tri-Linyah. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].

Compact Blister Dispenser

If the patient starts pill-taking on Sunday, the first active pill should be taken on the first Sunday after the patient's menstrual period begins. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Sunday) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

If the patient will start pill-taking on "Day 1", place a day-label sticker on the compact which starts with the day of the week the patient will take the first pill. Remove the first active pill at the top of the dispenser (Day 1) by pressing the pill through the blister foil.

### Role of maternal age and pregnancy history in risk of miscarriage: prospective register based study [^1151qVCN]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the burden of miscarriage in the Norwegian population and to evaluate the associations with maternal age and pregnancy history.

Design

Prospective register based study.

Setting

Medical Birth Register of Norway, the Norwegian Patient Register, and the induced abortion register.

Participants

All Norwegian women that were pregnant between 2009–13.

Main Outcome Measure

Risk of miscarriage according to the woman's age and pregnancy history estimated by logistic regression.

Results

There were 421201 pregnancies during the study period. The risk of miscarriage was lowest in women aged 25–29 (10%), and rose rapidly after age 30, reaching 53% in women aged 45 and over. There was a strong recurrence risk of miscarriage, with age adjusted odds ratios of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.48 to 1.60) after one miscarriage, 2.21 (2.03 to 2.41) after two, and 3.97 (3.29 to 4.78) after three consecutive miscarriages. The risk of miscarriage was modestly increased if the previous birth ended in a preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.29), stillbirth (1.30, 1.11 to 1.53), caesarean section (1.16, 1.12 to 1.21), or if the woman had gestational diabetes in the previous pregnancy (1.19, 1.05 to 1.36). The risk of miscarriage was slightly higher in women who themselves had been small for gestational age (1.08, 1.04 to 1.13).

Conclusions

The risk of miscarriage varies greatly with maternal age, shows a strong pattern of recurrence, and is also increased after some adverse pregnancy outcomes. Miscarriage and other pregnancy complications might share underlying causes, which could be biological conditions or unmeasured common risk factors.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^113VPUAJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Reproductive failure is a common complication in early pregnancy, with up to two-thirds of all fertilized oocytes not producing live births. Thus, a large number of conceptions either fail to implant or are categorized as biochemical pregnancies and clinical miscarriages. Although, the incidence of karyotypic abnormalities in the parents is low this high rate of early losses is most certainly connected to a high frequency of sporadic karyotypic abnormalities in the products of conception. In couples experiencing RM, however, a parental chromosomal anomaly is found ten times more frequently than in the background population and whether these couples should be offered PGD or await prenatal invasive diagnosis once a spontaneous pregnancy has been established is a matter under debate. Soon, sequencing of the entire fetal genome from free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation will be a standard procedure and will hopefully have the potential to increase our understanding of embryonic causes of both sporadic and RM.

Biomarkers associated with predisposition to thrombophilia or autoimmunity can be found with increased prevalence in women with RM and affect the prognosis negatively, but it is still unclear to what extent anticoagulation and immune modulation therapies can improve pregnancy outcome in these cases. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of genetically determined differences in capacity for hCG production and in markers of sperm DNA damage.

The emerging role of the endometrium as a biosensor of embryo quality, which may be less discerning in some women, also provides a novel mechanism underlying RM that merits further study. Sporadic miscarriage can be seen as representing nature's quality control system, preventing embryos with severe abnormalities in most cases from progressing beyond the peri-implantation period. Should this quality control be disrupted, such embryos may be allowed to establish implantation long enough to present as clinical pregnancy before failing, resulting in recurrent clinical miscarriage. Clearly, if an embryo is of high quality, then having a less selective endometrium will not have clinical consequences, and an ongoing pregnancy may ensue. Consistent with this, most women with RM will achieve an ongoing pregnancy if they persist in trying.

However, other concurrent medical conditions outlined in this article may prevent the ready establishment of ongoing pregnancy. Recent and ongoing research is clarifying the varying mechanisms underlying the very distressing condition of RM and offer new opportunities for developing effective interventions.

### Navigating miscarriage in Jordan: understanding emotional responses and coping strategies [^1132Msuu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Self-care practices after miscarriage

Of the participating women, only 20.0% planned for subsequent pregnancy and 40.3% decided to postpone pregnancy while 39.7% did not know whether they wished to become pregnant again. The feelings of child loss, guilt, or loneliness were initially associated with the decision of subsequent pregnancy, but after performing logistic regression, they were no longer significant (Table 4). It is the feeling of shame that was the driver for many women to get pregnant again. That is, women who felt ashamed of the miscarriage were three times more likely to get pregnant soon after (Odd ration [OR] 2.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31–6.82; P = 0.01).

Those who planned to get pregnant again focused on achieving a steadily progressing and healthy pregnancy. A percentage of 74.6% of them persevered with praying, 32.4% consumed fertility-enhancing herbs, 23.9% did cupping therapy, and 15.5% utilized medically assisted reproduction treatments. On the other hand, 45.5% of women who were not ready to get pregnant again used different birth control methods, such as intrauterine devices and oral contraceptives.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol (Zafemy) [^112iWYsy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If you are starting ZAFEMY after childbirth:

If you are not breastfeeding, wait 4 weeks before using ZAFEMY and use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If you have had sex since your baby was born, wait for your first period, or see your healthcare provider to make sure you are not pregnant before starting ZAFEMY.

If you are starting ZAFEMY after a miscarriage or abortion:

You may start ZAFEMY immediately after a miscarriage or abortion that occurs in the first 12 weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. You do not need to use another contraceptive method.
If you do not start ZAFEMY within 5 days after a first trimester miscarriage or abortion, use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, while you wait for your period to start. You have 2 ways to begin using your ZAFEMY patch. Choose the way that is best for you:

First day start: Apply your first ZAFEMY patch during the first 24 hours of your menstrual period.
Sunday start: Apply your first ZAFEMY patch on the first Sunday after your menstrual period begins. Use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If your period starts on Sunday, apply your first ZAFEMY patch that day, and no back-up birth control is needed.

### Effect of interpregnancy interval on outcomes of pregnancy after miscarriage: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics in scotland [^115HFSBH]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Our research shows that it is unnecessary for women to delay conception after a miscarriage. As such the current WHO guidelines may need to be reconsidered. In accordance with our results, women wanting to become pregnant soon after a miscarriage should not be discouraged. There may be cases where a delay is desirable, for example if there are signs of infection, and women should be advised appropriately. Also, in a molar pregnancy, current guidelines advise delaying the next pregnancy for at least one year after treatment.

After a miscarriage, women should also be counselled about how to optimise their own health before and during pregnancy in preparation for subsequent conception. The potential negative effects of delaying the next pregnancy for more than 18–24 months should also be discussed with couples, allowing them to make a fully informed decision about future pregnancy.

Conclusion

In the Scottish population, women who conceive within six months of an initial miscarriage have the best outcomes and lowest complication rates in their subsequent pregnancy.

### Which approach for first trimester miscarriage? [^111KME3K]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Around 15% of all known pregnancies miscarry during the first trimester. Historically, first trimester miscarriage was managed surgically to remove all retained products of conception, with the aim of minimising the likelihood of blood loss and infection from retained tissue. Nowadays, medical management (use of drugs such as mifepristone and misoprostol) and expectant management (i.e. allowing the miscarriage to conclude naturally) have become alternatives to a surgical procedure for managing women with early miscarriage. Here, we review the evidence on these three methods to assess the benefits and disadvantages of each.

### Preconception and early-pregnancy body mass index in women and men, time to pregnancy, and risk of miscarriage [^112JgAmK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity among women of reproductive age is a major public health challenge. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, adverse birth outcomes, and cardiovascular disorders in their offspring throughout the life course. Obesity in women also seems to be associated with lower fertility, lower assisted reproductive technology success rates, and increased risks of miscarriage and pregnancy loss. Among subfertile individuals, overweight and obesity are associated with increased time until pregnancy is achieved. The association of body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) with early-pregnancy outcomes might extend beyond the extremes of obesity. The optimum BMI in association with early-pregnancy outcomes is not known yet. A growing body of evidence among subfertile individuals suggests that next to BMI in women, BMI in men is also associated with fertility outcomes and the risk of miscarriage. A better understanding of the separate and combined associations of BMI in women and men with fertility and miscarriage outcomes is needed to develop novel targeted population strategies to optimize BMI from the preconception period onward.

We hypothesized that preconception BMI and early-pregnancy BMI outside of the normal category, not only in women but also in men, are associated with time to pregnancy and miscarriage. We assessed, in a population-based prospective cohort study from preconception onward among 3604 women and their partners, separate and combined associations of preconception BMI and early-pregnancy BMI in women and men with fecundability; subfertility, defined as a time to pregnancy or, in case of not conceiving, duration of actively pursuing pregnancy of more than 12 months or use of assisted reproductive technology; and miscarriage.

### Recurrent pregnancy loss [^115ePbjd]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss is a distressing pregnancy disorder experienced by ~2.5% of women trying to conceive. Recurrent pregnancy loss is defined as the failure of two or more clinically recognized pregnancies before 20–24 weeks of gestation and includes embryonic and fetal losses. The diagnosis of an early pregnancy loss is relatively straightforward, although progress in predicting and preventing recurrent pregnancy loss has been hampered by a lack of standardized definitions, the uncertainties surrounding the pathogenesis and the highly variable clinical presentation. The prognosis for couples with recurrent pregnancy loss is generally good, although the likelihood of a successful pregnancy depends on maternal age and the number of previous losses. Recurrent pregnancy loss can be caused by chromosomal errors, anatomical uterine defects, autoimmune disorders and endometrial dysfunction. Available treatments target the putative risk factors of pregnancy loss, although the effectiveness of many medical interventions is controversial. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, couples require accurate information on their chances of having a baby and appropriate support should be offered to reduce the psychological burden associated with multiple miscarriages. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of recurrent pregnancy loss and evaluate novel diagnostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

### Conception rates after medical versus surgical evacuation of early miscarriage [^111ffDr8]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare short-term fertility rates after medical and surgical management of early miscarriage.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

Academic tertiary-care medical center.

Patient(S)

A total of 203 patients were enrolled between June 2017 and May 2018, comprising 106 surgical evacuations and 97 medical evacuations.

Intervention(S)

Either surgical or medical evacuation of the uterine cavity.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Conception rates 6 months after miscarriage.

Result(S)

Conception rates 6 months after miscarriage among women who had attempted to become pregnant were similar between the medically and surgically evacuated groups (68.0% vs. 65.1%). There were no significant differences in background characteristics between the groups, apart from younger age and earlier gestational age among the medically treated group. There was no difference in the proportion of women using assisted reproductive technologies between the medically and surgically managed groups (15.5% vs. 12.6%, respectively). The median time-to-conception was 4 ± 2 months in both groups. Cumulative pregnancy rate 12 months after pregnancy loss, live birth rate, and repeat miscarriage rate also were similar between groups.

Conclusion(S)

Modality of uterine evacuation after early miscarriage does not affect short-term fertility outcomes.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol [^117Fwgwu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

○ If you are not breastfeeding, wait 4 weeks before using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system and use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If you have had sex since your baby was born, wait for your first period, or see your healthcare provider to make sure you are not pregnant before starting norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system.

● If you are starting norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system after a miscarriage or abortion:

○ You may start norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system immediately after a miscarriage or abortion that occurs in the first 12 weeks (first trimester) of pregnancy. You do not need to use another contraceptive method.

○ If you do not start norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system within 5 days after a first trimester miscarriage or abortion, use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, while you wait for your period to start. You have 2 ways to begin using your norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system patch. Choose the way that is best for you:

### Nomenclature for pregnancy outcomes: time for a change [^111m8Vjz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Traditionally, obstetricians have grouped together all pregnancy losses before the mid-second trimester as spontaneous abortions. However, this nomenclature is arbitrary, outdated, and not clinically useful. Using this system, miscarriages due to genetic abnormalities, fetal deaths associated with abnormal placental growth and development, and spontaneous preterm births of liveborn fetuses at previable gestations are lumped together in a single category. In addition, the term abortion is fraught with emotional connotations for families suffering the loss of a pregnancy. Thus, whereas the existing classification for pregnancy loss has served a somewhat pragmatic role, it ignores precepts of developmental biology and the clinical realities of these adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this article, we propose a more useful nomenclature for pregnancy loss and preterm births that is informative and is based on developmental periods in gestation and shared pathophysiology.

### Incidence of pregnancy after expectant, medical, or surgical management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: long term follow-up of miscarriage treatment (MIST) randomised controlled trial [^114Npm2M]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

For decades the standard treatment of women who experienced an early miscarriage was evacuation of retained products of conception. This was increasingly questioned, and now women are usually offered expectant (watch and wait, no active intervention)and medicalmanagement as well. Trials have suggested that all three methods are probably equivalent in terms of gynaecological infection, including the largest trial, which recruited around 1200 women (the miscarriage treatment (MIST) trial).

Little published evidence, however, has assessed the effect of management method on subsequent fertility — a key issue for women and those responsible for their care. One small trial found no significant difference in subsequent fertility rates up to 24 months after an index miscarriage. We examined subsequent fertility rates in women randomised to the three arms of the larger MIST trial. Our primary aim was to establish if the management method for early miscarriage affects subsequent fertility. We also assessed the effects of age, previous miscarriage, and previous birth history.

### Concealed pregnancy as an act of care? A qualitative analysis of motivations for concealing and non-disclosure of early pregnancy in the Gambia [^11663Fp9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Indeed, one FGD participant, in response to a general comment from another participant, reported suffering from miscarriages attributable to these spirits and early disclosure of pregnancy:

R1: Yes, they used to say that some women have spiritual forces and once people detect that they are pregnant during their first month, they can easily have a miscarriage or it will hunt them during labour. This is why others hide their pregnancy until their delivery is due.

R2: Yes, it happens because even I am a victim; I had a miscarriage in my first pregnancy when I was three months. This is why many women don't like people knowing that they are pregnant early. It is a natural thing in some women. Once people detect that they are pregnant, they easily experience a miscarriage. — FGD2

However, some women were aware of the belief that spirits were the cause of miscarriages but did not ascribe to it, although they were aware that it influenced the actions and choices of other women. In the following exchange, the second respondent notes how a miscarriage may occur because a woman has not attended early ANC, but then perceived as being caused by spirits.

R1: Yes, this [that women may lose their pregnancies on account of spirits] is true for some women once people start talking about their pregnancy while the pregnancy is in its early stage. In most cases they will wait until the pregnancy is obvious before they book for ANC.

R2: I don't think this should prevent pregnant women from booking for ANC. It is better to book early when your pregnancy is about three months old, otherwise you might have a miscarriage and it will be attributed to evil spirits. –FGD3

### Incidence of pregnancy after expectant, medical, or surgical management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: long term follow-up of miscarriage treatment (MIST) randomised controlled trial [^111L8agd]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this large study based on a randomised trial we found that the method of management of miscarriage did not affect subsequent fertility, with around 80% of women having a live birth within five years of the index miscarriage. This rate was somewhat lower than that reported in a previous trial that randomised women to expectant or surgical management. Blohm et al surveyed 127 women (28 excluded for various reasons) two to three years after the index miscarriage and obtained an 89% response rate. There was a non-significant difference in subsequent fertility rates up to 24 months after the index miscarriage of about 4% in favour of expectant compared with surgical management.

Previous cohort studies have found subsequent pregnancy rates of about 70%, but over different time scales (undefined,18 months, five years). The only trial found a 75% rate at 12 months and a 90% rate at 24 months. The rate in our study of about 60% at two years and 80% at five years is comparable but will have been influenced downwards by those respondents (included in our analysis) who did not want to conceive again after their miscarriage. It is likely, however, that our figure of four in five women eventually conceiving is representative of those women included in the original trial as the live birth curve flattens after about six years; women might find this high success rate reassuring in the initial stages after a miscarriage. Our respondents were similar to trial participants in terms of age, previous pregnancy loss, miscarriage type, clinical symptoms, surgical intervention, and management method. It is conceivable that one management method might cause very early future losses that this type of questionnaire study might not detect, but this seems unlikely, given that women would be sensitised to a future pregnancy, have access to the wide availability of pregnancy tests, and would have recorded such losses on the questionnaire.

The low birth rate we observed in older women is not surprising because fertility reduces naturally with age, and some older women would probably not have planned the index pregnancy nor perhaps want to conceive again. Our results confirm that women experiencing three or more miscarriages might have problems subsequently giving birth and thus need to be investigated for a recurrent cause.

Women can be reassured that after miscarriage their chance of a subsequent live birth is high, irrespective of management method. This information should complement the information that they might want to receiveto enable them to choose which management method is personally preferable, bearing in mind the clinicaland economicdifferences.

### Recurrent miscarriage [^112wzZ9u]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Many human conceptions are genetically abnormal and end in miscarriage, which is the commonest complication of pregnancy. Recurrent miscarriage, the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies, affects 1% of couples trying to conceive. It is associated with psychological morbidity, and has often proven to be frustrating for both patient and clinician. A third of women attending specialist clinics are clinically depressed, and one in five have levels of anxiety that are similar to those in psychiatric outpatient populations. Many conventional beliefs about the cause and treatment of women with recurrent miscarriage have not withstood scrutiny, but progress has been made. Research has emphasised the importance of recurrent miscarriage in the range of reproductive failure linking subfertility and late pregnancy complications and has allowed us to reject practice based on anecdotal evidence in favour of evidence-based management.

### Risk factors for preterm birth: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies [^117MxahC]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Interpregnancy intervals

One association with highly controversial evidence is interpregnancy interval following a miscarriage and the risk of preterm birth. The World Health Organization (WHO) encourages women who experienced a previous miscarriage to wait for a minimum of 6 months before the next conception to achieve optimal outcome and reduce obstetric complications such as preterm birth. Contrary to the findings of the research on which WHO based its recommendations, some studies reported that the risk of adverse obstetric outcomes including preterm birth is lower in women who conceived less than 6 months after a pregnancy loss, while synthesizing all available data provided the same conclusion. This meta-analysis included eight studies and performed two analyses: one including the study of Conde Agudelo 2004 and one excluding it, and robust results were obtained after excluding this study. While this was a large retrospective study on which the WHO guidelines for delaying pregnancy for at least 6 months are based, it did not differentiate between induced and spontaneous abortions and used data from many countries where induced abortion is illegal, therefore should be interpreted with caution. More recent studies have criticized methods used in the previous studies; therefore, the question remains open as to the causal effect of short interpregnancy intervals after miscarriage on adverse obstetric outcomes remains unknown. After a miscarriage, there is a very small burden on the folate reserve, and thus, miscarriage is not very likely to lead to folate deficiency in the postpartum period, so miscarriage and delivery later in pregnancy may have differential effects on subsequent pregnancy. This could explain the reduced risk of adverse outcomes in a short IPI after a miscarriage but not after delivery. In support of this hypothesis, there is evidence to suggest that late miscarriages (after 12 weeks of gestation) are associated with worse outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy. In addition, most women who attempt another pregnancy soon after a miscarriage are likely to be motivated to take better care of their health and consequently result in better pregnancy outcomes. Another plausible reason may be that those who conceive soon after a miscarriage are naturally more fertile and younger and consequently have better pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, even though the characteristics of the meta-analysis included in our assessment classified this association as robust for a protective effect, given the complex causal structure of these associations, interpretations should be made with caution.

### Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (elinest) [^111TV9pm]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Use after pregnancy, abortion, or miscarriage

Initiate ELINESTTMno earlier than day 28 postpartum in the nonlactating mother or after a second-trimester abortion due to the increased risk for thromboembolism (see Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions concerning thromboembolic disease). Advise the patient to use a non-hormonal back-up method for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.
ELINESTTMmay be initiated immediately after a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage. If the patient starts ELINESTTMimmediately, back-up contraception is not needed.

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs

If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged.

Missed Tablets

The possibility of ovulation and pregnancy increases with each successive day that scheduled pale pink tablets are missed. If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (if she missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the probability of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.

For additional patient instructions regarding missed tablets, see the WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS section in FDA-Approved Patient Labeling below.

Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances

In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking an active tablet, handle this as a missed tablet [see FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].

### Aspirin plus heparin or aspirin alone in women with recurrent miscarriage [^113UvMgS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin are prescribed for women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, with the goal of improving the rate of live births, but limited data from randomized, controlled trials are available to support the use of these drugs.

Methods

In this randomized trial, we enrolled 364 women between the ages of 18 and 42 years who had a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage and were attempting to conceive or were less than 6 weeks pregnant. We then randomly assigned them to receive daily 80 mg of aspirin plus open-label subcutaneous nadroparin (at a dose of 2850 IU, starting as soon as a viable pregnancy was demonstrated), 80 mg of aspirin alone, or placebo. The primary outcome measure was the live-birth rate. Secondary outcomes included rates of miscarriage, obstetrical complications, and maternal and fetal adverse events.

Results

Live-birth rates did not differ significantly among the three study groups. The proportions of women who gave birth to a live infant were 54.5% in the group receiving aspirin plus nadroparin (combination-therapy group), 50.8% in the aspirin-only group, and 57.0% in the placebo group (absolute difference in live-birth rate: combination therapy vs. placebo, -2.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -15.0 to 9.9; aspirin only vs. placebo, -6.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.8 to 6.4). Among 299 women who became pregnant, the live-birth rates were 69.1% in the combination-therapy group, 61.6% in the aspirin-only group, and 67.0% in the placebo group (absolute difference in live-birth rate: combination therapy vs. placebo, 2.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.8 to 15.0; aspirin alone vs. placebo -5.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.6 to 7.8). An increased tendency to bruise and swelling or itching at the injection site occurred significantly more frequently in the combination-therapy group than in the other two study groups.

Conclusions

Neither aspirin combined with nadroparin nor aspirin alone improved the live-birth rate, as compared with placebo, among women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN58496168.)

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology [^113BDMCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. Miscarriage is an early pregnancy loss. For women who have recurrent miscarriage, it has been suggested that a causative factor may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians sometimes use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. It is important to understand if this is beneficial or harmful. This is an update of the review, last published in 2019. Previous versions included two trials that have since been retracted. This update included an updated trial search and evaluation of all trials using the Cochrane Trustworthiness Screening Tool.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2024). We also searched reference lists from relevant articles, attempted to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in pregnant participants comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment, given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. We included trials of participants who were diagnosed with recurrent miscarriage (usually of unknown origin) and who began treatment with progestogens in the first trimester of pregnancy. We excluded trials treating participants with threatened miscarriage or who had conceived by in-vitro fertilization.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was miscarriage. The main important outcomes were live birth rate and preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation). Other important outcomes were neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, stillbirth, low birthweight (< 2500 g), maternal adverse events and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Other maternal outcomes of interest were severity of 'morning sickness', thromboembolic events, depression, admission to special care unit and subsequent fertility.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors assessed the studies using the RoB 1 tool for selection, performance, detection, attrition, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We utilized a random-effects model to synthesize the results.

Included Studies

Nine trials with 1426 randomized participants met the inclusion criteria. Eight trials included analyzable data for 1276 participants. Overall, the risk of bias was low for six trials, while three had areas of concern. Because few studies reported on important outcomes, imprecision was high for those outcomes, limiting the certainty of those analyses.

Synthesis Of Results

Seven of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the other two compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in Jordan, the UK, the Netherlands, and the USA. In three trials, participants had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in six trials, participants had two or more consecutive miscarriages. Route, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eight trials with 1276 participants contributed data to the analyses. Meta-analysis suggests that there is probably little to no difference in the miscarriage rate for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 1276 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of participants with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. For women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology receiving progestogen, there was probably little to no difference in live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 5 trials, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth; there was probably little to no difference (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.41; 3 trials, 256 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other important outcomes, including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, or stillbirth. There was little or no data on other important outcomes of low birth weight, maternal adverse events, teratogenic effects, or admission to a special care unit. None of the trials reported on any other important maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, progestogen supplementation therapy probably results in little to no effect on outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^116WhGzH]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

### Prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms in women with previous miscarriages or stillbirths – A systematic review [^113YRKbc]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Women who have had miscarriages or stillbirths are known to have an elevated risk for depression. However, the prevalence of depressive disorders and/or symptoms in this group is unclear. Therefore, our aim was to estimate the corresponding prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms. A systematic literature search of the databases MEDLINE, psycINFO and PSYNDEX was conducted to consider all studies published between 2000 and 2022 in English or German on the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms in women following miscarriages or stillbirths. Studies using valid psychiatric diagnoses or validated assessment methods regarding depression were included in the systematic review. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Data concerning depressive symptoms were extracted from 14 studies. The range regarding prevalence of depressive symptoms in women with previous miscarriages or stillbirths was very wide (5%-91.2%). All longitudinal studies demonstrate a reduction of depressive symptoms over time. The prevalence of depressive disorders had a range of 5.4 (only for minor depression according to DSM-IV) - 18.6% (for depressive disorders according to ICD-10). The included studies are very heterogeneous considering the investigated groups, the length of pregnancies and time passed since the occurrence of miscarriages or stillbirths. Women with miscarriages or stillbirths have an elevated risk for depressive symptoms and disorders. In most affected women, depressive symptoms are most pronounced in the first months after the pregnancy loss and diminish over time.

### Interpregnancy interval after clinical pregnancy loss and outcomes of the next frozen embryo transfer [^11299JCE]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Compared with an IPI of 6 to 12 months between a preceding CPL and a subsequent FET, we observed that shorter IPIs of less than 3 months or 3 to less than 6 months were associated with a decreased likelihood of achieving clinical pregnancy, live birth, and healthy live birth and an increased risk of total pregnancy loss after FET.

Whether to delay a pregnancy attempt after a CPL remains controversial. The World Health Organization recommends a minimum IPI of 6 months after a spontaneous or induced abortion based on higher risks of LBW, preterm birth, and premature rupture of membranes with a shorter IPI (< 6 months) as reported in 2005 in a retrospective study conducted in Latin America. However, subsequent studies in naturally conceiving populations suggest that delaying an attempt of the next pregnancy for at least 6 months may be unnecessary. A 2017 meta-analysispooled results from 10 studies and indicated that compared with an IPI of 6 months or longer, an IPI of less than 6 months after miscarriage was not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including stillbirth, preeclampsia, and LBW; rather, it was associated with favorable outcomes in terms of a lower risk of reexperiencing miscarriage and a greater likelihood of achieving live birth in the next pregnancy. There are several possible reasons for the divergent results between these studies with naturally conceived pregnancies and our study with IVF treatment. In most of the previous studies, in naturally conceiving populations, IPI length was generally defined as the period between the end of the preceding CPL and the onset of the last menstrual cycle of the next pregnancy, which was likely confounded by female fecundity. That is, women who are able to conceive naturally sooner after a preceding CPL (ie, shorter IPI) may have better fecundity, whereas women with a longer IPI are more likely to experience compromised fecundity or subfertility, resulting in a lower likelihood of achieving live birth that possibly counteracts the benefit of longer IPIs on pregnancy outcomes. Although the results remained unaltered when taking into account the duration of trying to conceive, there may have been a possibility of self-reporting bias or recall bias (eg, the estimated date of the last menstrual period or the recall of the duration couples spent trying to conceive). In addition, we observed a higher risk of biochemical pregnancy loss among women with an IPI of less than 3 months compared with those with an IPI of 6 to 12 months. However, the outcome of biochemical pregnancy loss was rarely reported in the previous studies involving naturally conceived pregnancies that generally referred to an ultrasound confirmation of the intrauterine gestational sac or sacs.

### Defining safe criteria to diagnose miscarriage: prospective observational multicentre study [^115Xo2Da]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

The data presented in this paper offer robust evidence that recent changes in guidance in relation to cut-off values for mean gestational sac diameter and crown-rump length are not too conservative. We have also shown that aspects of guidance to make a diagnosis of miscarriage currently provided by national bodies may be associated with misdiagnosis of miscarriage in some cases. This applies to the presence or absence of embryonic structures that on repeat ultrasound scans are associated with miscarriage and the interval that should be used before making a definitive diagnosis of miscarriage. We have proposed criteria for miscarriage based on our data in table 4, and in table 5 we describe the performance of currently used guidance when applied to our data to illustrate where there are limitations.

### Norelgestromin and ethinly estradiol [^115ShCgq]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

First day start: Apply your first norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch during the first 24 hours of your menstrual period.
Sunday start: Apply your first norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch on the first Sunday after your menstrual period begins. Use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If your period starts on Sunday, apply your first norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch that day, and no back-up birth control is needed.

If you are starting norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system after a miscarriage or abortion that occurs after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (second trimester), wait 4 weeks before using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system and use a non-hormonal contraceptive method of birth control, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, for the first 7 days of your first cycle only. If you have had sex since your miscarriage or abortion, wait for your first period, or see your healthcare provider to make sure you are not pregnant before starting norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system.

### What happens after a… [^112cws1d]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

What is a miscarriage. A miscarriage is something that happens when a pregnancy stops growing. It is sometimes found when women have bleeding in early pregnancy, or it may be found during routine tests. Miscarriage happens in a pregnancy that would not have been healthy for reasons beyond your control. It is not caused by stress or regular activities like playing sports or having sex. What happens during a miscarriage. If you are having a miscarriage and the pregnancy tissue hasn't fully come out, there are three treatment options: Watch and wait: wait for the miscarriage to happen on its own. Medicine: use pills called misoprostol to make the miscarriage happen sooner. Suction procedure: have a doctor remove the pregnancy tissue using a simple office procedure. All three treatment options are safe and will not affect your ability to get pregnant. Which treatment should I choose.

The most effective treatment for you may depend on the type of miscarriage you have: Incomplete miscarriage is when the pregnancy tissue begins to pass on its own. Using the watch-and-wait option, it will pass on its own more than 90 percent of the time, but this can take weeks. Using misoprostol, the tissue passes more than 90 percent of the time within one week. Fetal or embryonic demise is when the pregnancy has stopped growing but is not passing on its own. Using the watch-and-wait option, this type of miscarriage will pass on its own about 75 percent of the time, but it can take weeks. Using misoprostol, the tissue passes almost 90 percent of the time within one week. Anembryonic pregnancy or "empty sac" is when the pregnancy stopped growing before the fetus developed. Using the watch-and-wait option, this type of miscarriage will pass on its own only 66 percent of the time, and may take many weeks.

Using misoprostol, the tissue passes about 80 percent of the time within one week. Many women choose to watch and wait as their first option. If this takes too long, you can come back to the doctor at any time to try another option. If medicine doesn't work, you may come back for a suction procedure. A suction procedure works 100 percent of the time with any type of miscarriage.

### Review of current guidelines for recurrent pregnancy loss: new strategies for optimal evaluation of women who may be superfertile [^114zr2yB]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The current evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology are compared and contrasted in this review. The clinical use of either of these guidelines will result in a probable diagnosis for only half of the affected patients. New strategies for a full evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss incorporating 24- chromosome microarary on the products of conception offer more explanations for patients and caregivers. This new algorithm should decrease the use of empiric, unproven treatments. Combining the results of genetic testing on the miscarriage tissue with the conventional diagnostic tests has made it possible to explain the etiology of pregnancy loss in more than 90% of the cases. This cost-saving strategy can decrease the emotional distress and frustration for both couples and physicians when it comes to management of recurrent pregnancy loss.

### Women's experiences of the consenting process for pregnancy remains disposal following early miscarriage [^113UsBTf]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Results

Between April 2020 and September 2022, 27 women made contact agreeing to participate and were subsequently interviewed (table 2). No participants withdrew consent. Participants volunteered a variety of reproductive histories, and many had experienced earlier pregnancy endings including miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, abortions and one stillbirth. These experiences were often used by participants as points of resonance or comparisons, and several participants had had experiences of both home miscarriage and clinically managed miscarriage. The analysis is organised under four themes (see table 3 for additional supporting quotations).

Demographic characteristics of the study participants

Examples of participant quotations supporting each theme

Positive experience of care

Patients were overwhelming positive about the care they received, saying they felt "understood", "cared for":

The staff there [Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit] provide such a brilliant service, not just in terms of the physical care but the emotional and psychological sides to everything as well.

It became clear in the initial coding phase of the research that consent for disposal was a key issue for both professional and patient participants and was commonly described as not in keeping with otherwise sensitive, responsive and excellent care.

Of the 27 women interviewed, 19 had experiences of the consent form most often in relation to the surgical management of their miscarriage (table 1) either to remove the entire pregnancy or "retained products of conception" when a miscarriage was incomplete. While four women welcomed the discussion and disposal options, 15 women felt the approach was inappropriate and, at times, unwelcome. Five women reported being distressed by the process, with more cases observed during fieldwork.

### Risk of miscarriage with bivalent vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18: pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^11787nSX]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Rates of miscarriage for subsets of pregnancies defined by time between nearest vaccination and conception

Figure 2shows the counts of miscarriages and pregnancies and the rates by arm according to the time between nearest vaccination and date of estimated conception. Table 3summarises the underlying rates for selected subsets of pregnancies. The difference was not significant (13.7% in HPV vaccine arm, 9.2% in hepatitis A vaccine arm; P = 0.033; table 2) by the permutation test for pregnancies with estimated date of conception less than 90 days from nearest vaccination. The difference in estimated miscarriage rates between arms among pregnancies conceived nearer vaccination reflects higher rates in the hepatitis A arm and lower rates in the HPV arm than in the other pregnancies. For an estimated date of conception less than 90 days after vaccination, most of the difference between miscarriage counts in the groups was for miscarriages at 7–12 weeks' gestation (20 of the total difference of 24, table 4). For pregnancies that began 90 days or more after vaccination, the miscarriage rates are similar in the two arms (counts of 130 (HPV) and 134; rates of 10.7% and 10.5%). Results with other time scales also did not show greater risk in the HPV arm (data not shown).

Fig 2 Miscarriage rates for both arms and differences according to time between nearest vaccination and estimated date of conception. Of 3599 pregnancies included in analysis, 187 (5.2%) had estimated conception date before nearest vaccination. Estimations of conception assume that ovulation occurs on day 14 after last menstrual period, though 10% of cycles have ovulation at day 24 or later. Among 187 pregnancies with conception ostensibly before vaccination, many had conception dates only a few days before vaccination (median 10 days). Given that all pregnant women had negative hCG test results at time of vaccination (based on highly sensitive β hCG assays), most subsequent pregnancies had probably been conceived after relatively late ovulations and conception had occurred after vaccination. Thus, these data do not provide useful data on the question of vaccine safety before conception (HAV = hepatitis A vaccine)

### Women's experiences of the consenting process for pregnancy remains disposal following early miscarriage [^113sWiAL]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Unprepared

Women consistently described being unprepared for the discussion about pregnancy remains disposal. Except in one case, despite encountering healthcare professionals previously, the issue was not broached until the day of the procedure:

[H]ow I cope with things is by being really prepared. So I guess when it came to that consent form, I wasn't prepared and I didn't know they were going to ask that… And I think that is why I found it so upsetting. [Scarlett]

And to be honest that completely surprised me. I did not realise there was going to be discussion, I thought… they take it out and it goes down a tube into medical waste… it almost bothered me that I had to make that decision because I had never thought about it… I would have preferred not to have the choice. [Alex]

The participant quoted above and others indicated they would have preferred to opt out of the discussion but found this was not possible.

Of the four participants who had described a positive experience, two had engaged in information-gathering and decision-making about their pregnancy material prior to their procedure by looking online and speaking to friends. These two women raised the issue of disposal prior to the consenting process.

Inappropriate timing, chronology and ontology

The inappropriateness of the timing of the procedure was described in three ways: timing on the day of treatment, timing in relation to miscarriage care pathway, and in reference to gestational time. Introduced to a discussion about disposal when they were anxious and overwhelmed with information in relation to surgery was deemed inopportune, as was timing in relation to the chronology of their miscarriage journey. Women described the point of diagnosis as critical in the experience of loss. However, the consenting process coincided with surgical management of the miscarriage, which often occurred weeks after diagnosis due to women often opting for conservative or medical management first:

In my head I was done with it and then I started having to think about it. And the emotion is high again. [Alex]

### Diabetic and hypertensive disorders following early pregnancy loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133TGE4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early pregnancy losses are not an uncommon outcome of pregnancy, with spontaneous and induced abortions frequent outcomes. Spontaneous abortion (SAB), also known as miscarriage, occurs in approximately 15–25% of all pregnancies, with an estimated 23 million SABs occurring globally each year.SAB generally refers to a loss of a pregnancy without intervention prior to a pre-specified gestational period, which varies from high-income countries (< 20–22 weeks of gestation or birthweight < 400–500 g)to low and middle-income countries (< 28 weeks of gestation or birthweight < 1000 g). It is estimated that 1–2% of women experience recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more consecutive pregnancy losses (SABs). Induced abortions (IAs) are the most common medical intervention to terminate a pregnancy, with the annual global rates estimated to be as high as 121 million. Most IAs are reported to result from unintended pregnancies.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^114XySfA]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Lower thresholds for reporting of deaths

ICD‐11 recommends including all stillbirths and deaths following live birth if gestational age is at least 154 days (≥ 22 +0 weeks). When gestational age is unavailable, the birth weight proxy (≥ 500 g) can be used. If the gestational age and birth weight are unknown it is recommended to include the case in the perinatal mortality statistics if there is a strong probability the event occurred after the defined reporting point for perinatal mortality.

Fetal deaths

National reporting requirements for fetal deaths vary, with legal thresholds often closer to the boundaries of fetal viability for example, 20 +0 to 28 +0 weeks (140–196 days) than the start of the fetal period. Recording fetal deaths from 140 days (20 +0 weeks) in local health data collection systems can improve capture and accuracy of reporting from 22 +0 weeks. The lower limit used for data recording should be specified in the statistics produced.

Deaths following live birth

ICD‐11 recommends recording all deaths following live birth, regardless of gestational age. Disparities in capturing and recording neonatal deaths, especially at lower gestational ages, pose a challenge for international comparisons of mortality rates. To address this, ICD‐11 offers clear reporting guidelines to ensure consistency across countries (see below).

Recording of pregnancy losses occurring before the perinatal period

A spontaneous abortion (or miscarriage) is the spontaneous loss of pregnancy (i.e. embryo or fetus) prior to 154 days (22 +0 weeks) gestation. To enable consistency in comparison across countries, spontaneous pregnancy losses < 154 days should always be classified as miscarriages and those ≥ 154 days as stillbirths for international reporting, regardless of local reporting requirements.

Recording of other events in the perinatal period

The above guidance relates to stillbirth and neonatal mortality only and does not include induced abortions, a minority of which occur at or after 154 days (22 +0 weeks).

Artificial termination of an ongoing pregnancy (also referred to as induced abortion, legal abortion, fetal reduction) is defined by ICD‐11 as the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of an embryo or a fetus (irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy), following a deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means, which is not intended to result in a live birth.

All events meeting the definition of artificial termination of pregnancy should be reported in mortality statistics but must be clearly distinguishable from spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Whilst transient signs of life may be present in later‐gestation termination, these should never be coded as live births and neonatal deaths.

### Developing a core outcome set for future infertility research: an international consensus development study [^111u9nqt]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Question

Can a core outcome set to standardize outcome selection, collection, and reporting across future infertility research be developed?

Summary Answer

A minimum data set, known as a core outcome set, has been developed for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and systematic reviews evaluating potential treatments for infertility.

What Is Known Already

Complex issues, including a failure to consider the perspectives of people with fertility problems when selecting outcomes, variations in outcome definitions, and the selective reporting of outcomes on the basis of statistical analysis, make the results of infertility research difficult to interpret.

Study Design, Size, Duration

A three-round Delphi survey (372 participants from 41 countries) and consensus development workshop (30 participants from 27 countries).

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods

Healthcare professionals, researchers, and people with fertility problems were brought together in an open and transparent process using formal consensus science methods.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The core outcome set consists of: viable intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound (accounting for singleton, twin, and higher multiple pregnancy); pregnancy loss (accounting for ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, and termination of pregnancy); live birth; gestational age at delivery; birthweight; neonatal mortality; and major congenital anomaly. Time to pregnancy leading to live birth should be reported when applicable.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

We used consensus development methods which have inherent limitations, including the representativeness of the participant sample, Delphi survey attrition, and an arbitrary consensus threshold.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

Embedding the core outcome set within RCTs and systematic reviews should ensure the comprehensive selection, collection, and reporting of core outcomes. Research funding bodies, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement, and over 80 specialty journals, including the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group, Ferility and Sterility, and Human Reproduction, have committed to implementing this core outcome set.
