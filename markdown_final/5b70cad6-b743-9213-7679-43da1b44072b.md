## Question

Rezafungin for candidemia and invasive candidiasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about rezafungin for candidemia and invasive candidiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and mechanism to anchor expectations. Then, I should verify the pivotal clinical trial evidence and regulatory status. Next, I will examine efficacy endpoints, including mortality, global cure, and early mycological clearance. After that, I need to check safety signals and tolerability. I will then consider special populations and practical dosing. Finally, I should integrate guideline positioning, limitations, and a bottom-line clinical recommendation with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism. Rezafungin is a next-generation echinocandin that inhibits β-1,3-glucan synthase, disrupting cell wall integrity; its distinguishing feature is a prolonged half-life enabling once-weekly dosing with front-loaded exposure, which may translate into early fungicidal activity and convenience advantages compared with daily echinocandins [^cb3c0a65] [^260fea2a].

> I need to verify the regulatory status and scope of approval. The FDA approved rezafungin in March 2023 for adults with candidemia and invasive candidiasis who have limited or no alternative options, based on a single phase 3 noninferiority trial with a 20% margin and supportive phase 2 data; importantly, the label notes that rezafungin has not been studied for endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or meningitis, so these remain off-label and unsupported indications [^0e675017] [^85067cf0] [^d5446b8f].

> Next, I should review the pivotal evidence. The phase 3 ReSTORE trial randomized 199 adults with candidemia or invasive candidiasis to rezafungin 400 mg week 1 then 200 mg weekly versus caspofungin 70 mg load then 50 mg daily; rezafungin met noninferiority for both the EMA primary endpoint of day-14 global cure and the FDA primary endpoint of 30-day all-cause mortality, with treatment differences of −1.1% and 2.4%, respectively, and overlapping confidence intervals, supporting noninferiority [^cb3c0a65] [^1785cdc3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about early outcomes; I should double-check the mycological clearance data. Pooled analyses of ReSTORE and the phase 2 STRIVE trial showed higher day-5 mycological eradication with rezafungin versus caspofungin (73% vs 65%; weighted difference 10.0%, 95% CI −0.3 to 20.4) and faster time to negative blood culture, with median times around 19–24 hours for rezafungin versus 23–27 hours for caspofungin in different analyses; this front-loaded effect is biologically plausible given the PK profile and concentration-dependent killing of echinocandins [^1d2ebb9c] [^052999a4] [^1035f1cc].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability. Across ReSTORE and pooled datasets, rezafungin had a safety profile comparable to caspofungin, with similar rates of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events; notable signals include infusion-related reactions and rare hepatic adverse events, and tremors occurred in about 2.6% of rezafungin recipients, typically resolving within a month; discontinuation rates for adverse events were similar between arms in the pivotal trial [^cb3c0a65] [^fbfecc5c] [^67fc7c91].

> Let me consider special populations and dosing practicality. Rezafungin exposure appears minimally affected by renal impairment, hepatic impairment, obesity, and critical illness, and no dose adjustments are currently recommended in these settings; this is advantageous in ICU patients where PK variability can blunt efficacy with first-generation echinocandins, though I should confirm that this is based on modeling and limited clinical PK data rather than large prospective PK trials [^2c9d8248] [^24cac609].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure alignment. The 2025 ECMM/ISHAM/ASM global guideline includes rezafungin as a first-line echinocandin option for candidemia alongside anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, reflecting its noninferior efficacy and favorable PK; however, the FDA's "limited or no alternative options" language reflects a more conservative stance pending broader real-world experience and additional data [^dd79f756] [^0e675017].

> But wait, what about limitations and uncertainties. The approval is based on a single phase 3 trial with a noninferiority margin, and subgroup analyses in ICU patients show numerically higher 30-day mortality with rezafungin versus caspofungin (34.8% vs 25.4%), albeit with overlapping CIs and similar attributable mortality; these ICU findings are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive and warrant cautious interpretation pending larger ICU-focused studies [^f147c950] [^fb7282bb].

> I should confirm practical implementation details. The recommended regimen is 400 mg IV on day 1, then 200 mg IV weekly for 2–4 total doses, with therapy individualized to clinical response; source control, including timely central venous catheter management, remains essential, and repeat blood cultures should be obtained to document clearance before stepping down or stopping therapy, consistent with IDSA guidance [^d5446b8f] [^5754ca4b].

> Let me synthesize a bottom line. Rezafungin is a reasonable first-line echinocandin for candidemia and invasive candidiasis, particularly when once-weekly IV therapy offers operational advantages or when daily IV administration is impractical; it achieves noninferior clinical outcomes to caspofungin with comparable safety and potential early mycological benefits, but it should not be used for CNS, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis, and clinicians should remain vigilant for emerging resistance and continue established stewardship practices [^cb3c0a65] [^1d2ebb9c] [^85067cf0].

---

Rezafungin is a **once-weekly echinocandin** [^cb3c0a65] approved for candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults with limited or no alternatives [^85067cf0]. In the phase 3 ReSTORE trial, rezafungin was **non-inferior to caspofungin** for day 14 global cure and day 30 all-cause mortality, with a similar safety profile [^cb3c0a65] [^1d2ebb9c]. Pooled analyses show **faster mycological clearance** and potential early clinical benefits, including shorter ICU and hospital stays, though these are exploratory and require confirmation [^1d2ebb9c] [^6f241dd1]. Rezafungin is not active against CNS or urinary infections and is not recommended for endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or meningitis [^85067cf0]. It offers a convenient weekly regimen with minimal drug–drug interactions, but routine therapeutic drug monitoring is not currently recommended [^2c9d8248].

---

## Pharmacological properties

Rezafungin is a **second-generation echinocandin** with a prolonged half-life (~133 hours) [^260fea2a], enabling once-weekly dosing [^cb3c0a65]. It inhibits β-1,3-glucan synthase, disrupting cell wall integrity and exerting fungicidal activity against Candida spp [^a8edd216]. Rezafungin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, low interpatient variability, and minimal drug–drug interactions, supporting fixed dosing without routine therapeutic drug monitoring [^260fea2a] [^2c9d8248].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Phase 3 ReSTORE trial

- **Design**: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing rezafungin (400 mg weekly after 400 mg loading dose) to caspofungin (70 mg loading dose, then 50 mg daily) [^cb3c0a65].
- **Primary endpoints**: Non-inferiority for day 14 global cure (EMA) and day 30 all-cause mortality (FDA) [^cb3c0a65].
- **Results**: Rezafungin was non-inferior to caspofungin for both endpoints, with similar safety profiles [^cb3c0a65] [^1d2ebb9c].

---

### Pooled analyses

Pooled analyses of ReSTORE and STRIVE show **comparable day 30 mortality** and **higher day 5 mycological eradication** with rezafungin versus caspofungin (73% vs 65%) [^1d2ebb9c]. Exploratory analyses suggest shorter ICU and hospital stays with rezafungin, though these findings require confirmation [^6f241dd1].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Rezafungin has a safety profile similar to other echinocandins, with **common adverse events** including hypokalemia, diarrhea, vomiting, and infusion-related reactions [^fbfecc5c]. Serious adverse events occur at comparable rates to caspofungin, and discontinuation rates are similar [^cb3c0a65]. Hepatic adverse events are rare but warrant monitoring, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disease [^fbfecc5c].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Spectrum**: Rezafungin is not active against CNS or urinary tract infections and is not recommended for endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or meningitis [^85067cf0].
- **Resistance**: Routine susceptibility testing is not currently recommended, but clinicians should remain vigilant for emerging resistance, particularly in C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis [^f0d1fe6e].
- **Special populations**: Limited data exist for pediatric, pregnant, or breastfeeding patients; use in these populations should be individualized and cautious [^2c9d8248].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recognize rezafungin as a **first-line echinocandin** for candidemia and invasive candidiasis, particularly in patients with limited or no alternatives [^dd79f756]. Its once-weekly dosing and favorable safety profile make it an attractive option for outpatient parenteral therapy and for patients unable to tolerate daily intravenous administration [^0e675017].

---

## Summary of clinical evidence

| **Endpoint** | **Rezafungin** | **Caspofungin** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Day 14 global cure | 59% | 61% | Non-inferior |
| Day 30 all-cause mortality | 24% | 21% | Non-inferior |
| Day 5 mycological eradication | 73% | 65% | Numerically higher |
| Median time to negative blood culture | 23.9 hours | 27.0 hours | Shorter |
| Serious adverse events | 56% | 53% | Similar |

---

Rezafungin is a **once-weekly echinocandin** that provides non-inferior efficacy to caspofungin for candidemia and invasive candidiasis, with a similar safety profile and potential early clinical benefits. It is particularly useful for patients requiring outpatient parenteral therapy or those unable to tolerate daily intravenous administration, but is not suitable for CNS or urinary infections.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for treatment of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis (ReSTORE): a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised phase 3 trial [^cb3c0a65]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Rezafungin is a next-generation, once-a-week echinocandin in development for the treatment of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis and for the prevention of invasive fungal disease caused by Candida, Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis spp after blood and marrow transplantation. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous rezafungin versus intravenous caspofungin in patients with candidaemia and invasive candidiasis.

Methods

ReSTORE was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised phase 3 trial done at 66 tertiary care centres in 15 countries. Adults (≥18 years) with systemic signs and mycological confirmation of candidaemia or invasive candidiasis were eligible for inclusion and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous rezafungin once a week (400 mg in week 1, followed by 200 mg weekly, for a total of two to four doses) or intravenous caspofungin (70 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 50 mg daily) for no more than 4 weeks. The primary endpoints were global cure (consisting of clinical cure, radiological cure, and mycological eradication) at day 14 for the European Medical Agency (EMA) and 30-day all-cause mortality for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), both with a target non-inferiority margin of 20%, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all patients who received one or more doses of study drug and had documented Candida infection based on a culture from blood or another normally sterile site obtained within 96 h before randomisation). Safety was evaluated by the incidence and type of adverse events and deaths in the safety population, defined as all patients who received any amount of study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03667690, and is complete.

Findings

Between Oct 12, 2018, and Aug 29, 2021, 222 patients were screened for inclusion, and 199 patients (118 [59%] men; 81 [41%] women; mean age 61 years [SD 15·2]) were randomly assigned (100 [50%] patients to the rezafungin group and 99 [50%] patients to the caspofungin group). 55 (59%) of 93 patients in the rezafungin group and 57 (61%) of 94 patients in the caspofungin group had a global cure at day 14 (weighted treatment difference -1·1% [95% CI -14·9 to 12·7]; EMA primary endpoint). 22 (24%) of 93 patients in the rezafungin group and 20 (21%) of 94 patients in the caspofungin group died or had an unknown survival status at day 30 (treatment difference 2·4% [95% CI -9·7 to 14·4]; FDA primary endpoint). In the safety analysis, 89 (91%) of 98 patients in the rezafungin group and 83 (85%) of 98 patients in the caspofungin group had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either group were pyrexia, hypokalaemia, pneumonia, septic shock, and anaemia. 55 (56%) patients in the rezafungin group and 52 (53%) patients in the caspofungin group had serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Our data show that rezafungin was non-inferior to caspofungin for the primary endpoints of day-14 global cure (EMA) and 30-day all-cause mortality (FDA). Efficacy in the initial days of treatment warrants evaluation. There were no concerning trends in treatment-emergent or serious adverse events. These phase 3 results show the efficacy and safety of rezafungin and support its ongoing development.

### Efficacy and safety of rezafungin and caspofungin in candidaemia and invasive candidiasis: pooled data from two prospective randomised controlled trials [^1d2ebb9c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Rezafungin, a new US Food and Drug Administration-approved, long-acting echinocandin to treat candidaemia and invasive candidiasis, was efficacious with a similar safety profile to caspofungin in clinical trials. We conducted pooled analyses of the phase 2 STRIVE and phase 3 ReSTORE rezafungin trials.

Methods

ReSTORE was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised phase 3 trial conducted at 66 tertiary care centres in 15 countries. STRIVE was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised phase 2 trial conducted at 44 centres in 10 countries. Adults (≥18 years) with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis were treated with once-a-week intravenous rezafungin (400 mg and 200 mg) or once-a-day intravenous caspofungin (70 mg and 50 mg). Efficacy was evaluated in a pooled modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population. Primary efficacy endpoint was day 30 all-cause mortality (tested for non-inferiority with a pre-specified margin of 20%). Secondary efficacy endpoint was mycological response. Safety was also evaluated. The STRIVE and ReSTORE trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02734862 and NCT03667690, and both studies are complete.

Findings

ReSTORE was conducted from Oct 12, 2018, to Oct 11, 2021, and STRIVE from July 26, 2016, to April 18, 2019. The mITT population, pooling the data from the two trials, comprised 139 patients for rezafungin and 155 patients for caspofungin. Day 30 all-cause mortality rates were comparable between groups (19% [26 of 139] for the rezafungin group and 19% [30 of 155] for the caspofungin group) and the upper bound of the 95% CI for the weighted treatment difference was below 10% (-1·5% [95% CI -10·7 to 7·7]). Mycological eradication occurred by day 5 in 102 (73%) of 139 rezafungin patients and 100 (65%) of 155 caspofungin patients (weighted treatment difference 10·0% [95% CI -0·3 to 20·4]). Safety profiles were similar across groups.

Interpretation

Rezafungin was non-inferior to caspofungin for all-cause mortality, with a potential early treatment benefit, possibly reflecting rezafungin's front-loaded dosing regimen. These findings are of clinical importance in fighting active and aggressive infections and reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by candidaemia and invasive candidiasis.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: the STRIVE trial [^1c0f0030]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rezafungin (RZF) is a novel echinocandin exhibiting distinctive pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. STRIVE was a phase 2, double-blind, randomized trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of RZF once weekly (QWk) to caspofungin (CAS) once daily for treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (IC).

Methods

Adults with systemic signs and mycological confirmation of candidemia and/or IC were randomized to RZF 400 mg QWk (400 mg), RZF 400 mg on week 1 then 200 mg QWk (400/200 mg), or CAS 70 mg as a loading dose followed by 50 mg daily for ≤4 weeks. Efficacy assessments included overall cure (resolution of signs of candidemia/IC + mycological eradication) at day 14 (primary endpoint), investigator-assessed clinical response at day 14, and 30-day all-cause mortality (ACM) (secondary endpoints), and time to negative blood culture. Safety was evaluated by adverse events and ACM through follow-up.

Results

Of 207 patients enrolled, 183 were in the microbiological intent-to-treat population (~21% IC). Overall cure rates were 60.5% (46/76) for RZF 400 mg, 76.1% (35/46) for RZF 400/200 mg, and 67.2% (41/61) for CAS; investigator-assessed clinical cure rates were 69.7% (53/76), 80.4% (37/46), and 70.5% (43/61), respectively. In total, 30-day ACM was 15.8% for RZF 400 mg, 4.4% for RZF 400/200 mg, and 13.1% for CAS. Candidemia was cleared in 19.5 and 22.8 hours in RZF and CAS patients, respectively. No concerning safety trends were observed; ACM through follow-up was 15.2% (21/138) for RZF and 18.8% (13/69) for CAS.

Conclusions

RZF was safe and efficacious in the treatment of candidemia and/or IC.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: the STRIVE trial [^260fea2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite significant advances in antifungal therapy over the past 2 decades, mortality rates remain between 30% and 60%. Echinocandins are recommended first-line agents in the treatment of most types of IC. Patients treated with an echinocandin show significantly better survival rates than patients treated with other classes of antifungals; however, treatment failure with echinocandin therapy occurs in approximately 40% of cases and presents an opportunity for improvement. The efficacy of echinocandins is reliant on concentration-dependent effects and drug levels within target tissue sites. Currently available echinocandins and dosing strategies may be insufficient to eradicate Candida spp. or to prevent the development of resistance.

Rezafungin (RZF) is a next-generation echinocandin with significant pharmacokinetic advantages, including a prolonged half-life (~133 hours) and high plasma drug concentrations early in the course of therapy, allowing for front-loaded, extended-interval dosing. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics have demonstrated minimal interpatient variability and a favorable safety profile. Preclinical studies have established the efficacy of RZF in animal models of candidemia, IC, and Candida biofilms. In addition, phase 1 studies have demonstrated the safety and tolerability of RZF in healthy volunteers. Here we present the results of STRIVE, a phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) RZF, compared with caspofungin (CAS) and optional oral fluconazole stepdown therapy, in the treatment of candidemia/IC.

### Treatment outcomes among patients with a positive Candida culture close to randomization receiving rezafungin or caspofungin in the ReSTORE study [^67de5d57]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Rezafungin, a novel, once-weekly echinocandin for the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (IC) was noninferior to caspofungin for day 30 all-cause mortality (ACM) and day 14 global cure in the phase 3 ReSTORE trial (NCT03667690). We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses for patients with a positive culture close to randomization in ReSTORE.

Methods

ReSTORE was a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial in patients aged ≥18 years with candidemia and/or IC treated with once-weekly intravenous rezafungin (400 mg/200 mg) or once-daily intravenous caspofungin (70 mg/50 mg). This analysis comprised patients with a positive blood culture drawn between 12 hours before and 72 hours after randomization or a positive culture from another normally sterile site sampled between 48 hours before and 72 hours after randomization. Efficacy endpoints included day 30 ACM, day 14 global cure rate, and day 5 and 14 mycological response. Adverse events were evaluated.

Results

This analysis included 38 patients randomized to rezafungin and 46 to caspofungin. In the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively, day 30 ACM was 26.3% and 21.7% (between-group difference [95% confidence interval], 4.6% [−13.7%, 23.5%]), day 14 global response was 55.3% and 50.0% (between-group difference, 5.3% [−16.1%, 26.0%]), and day 5 mycological eradication was 71.1% and 50.0% (between-group difference, 21.1% [−0.2%, 40.2%]). Safety was comparable between treatments.

Conclusions

These findings support the efficacy and safety of rezafungin compared with caspofungin for the treatment of candidemia and/or IC in patients with a positive culture close to randomization, with potential early treatment benefits for rezafungin.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^2069d020]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Clinical protocols and safety and efficacy results for the STRIVE and ReSTORE trials have been previously published. In brief, ReSTORE was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority phase 3 trial conducted in 66 tertiary care centres in 15 countries. A total of 199 patients (modified intention-to-treat [mITT] population) were randomised to receive either rezafungin (400 mg in week 1, followed by 200 mg weekly, for a total of 2–4 doses once every 7 days; n = 93), or caspofungin (70 mg on day 1 then 50 mg daily for up to 4 weeks; n = 94). Stable patients in the caspofungin group who met relevant criteria could step down to fluconazole after 3 days or more. Inclusion criteria included an established mycological diagnosis of candidemia and/or IC (IC/C) from a sample taken ≤ 96 h before randomisation, and presence of one or more systemic signs attributable to IC/C. Patients with candidemia and IC were defined as separate groups within the overall study population. STRIVE was conducted in 10 countries and had a similar design, except that patients (N = 183) were randomised to one of two weekly rezafungin doses (400/400 mg [n = 76], or 400/200 mg [n = 46]), or daily caspofungin (70/50 mg; n = 61).

Collection of health-economic endpoints focused on hospital and ICU length of stay (LoS). The health-economic endpoints of hospital and ICU length of stay were pre-defined endpoints in both the STRIVE and ReSTORE clinical studies and were conducted in the mITT population (all patients who had a documented Candida infection in line with trial requirements and received at least one dose of study drug). The total number of days in the hospital or ICU was defined as the total during the study period, including any re-admissions. For those patients who did not die before hospital/ICU discharge (‘survivors’), the time to discharge for each admission to hospital and to ICU was generated and LoS was summarised. In addition, a post-hoc analysis of LoS was performed in all patients in the mITT population regardless of discharge status (i.e. including patients who died during the study period).

### Treatment outcomes among patients with a positive Candida culture close to randomization receiving rezafungin or caspofungin in the ReSTORE study [^3fed68ee]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Candidemia and invasive candidiasis (IC) are common healthcare facility–associated fungal infections that have a substantial impact on patient morbidity and mortality and a high economic burden. Echinocandins are recommended as first-line antifungal treatment for candidemia and IC in Europe and the United States based on their efficacy and relatively fewer adverse effects and drug–drug interactions compared with polyenes and triazoles. However, the emergence of antifungal resistance among Candida species mandates the need for novel antifungal drugs.

Rezafungin is a novel, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)– and European Commission–approved echinocandin that is structurally similar to current echinocandins but has differentiated stability and pharmacokinetics. Its low clearance and prolonged half-life versus other echinocandins enables once-weekly intravenous administration resulting in front-loaded exposure that maximizes the drug effect early in therapy. These pharmacokinetic advantages may suppress the development of secondary antifungal resistance. The safety and efficacy of rezafungin in treating candidemia and/or IC were demonstrated in the phase 2, double-blind, randomized STRIVE trial comparing rezafungin and caspofungin. Primary data from the similarly designed phase 3 ReSTORE trial demonstrated noninferiority of rezafungin for day 30 all-cause mortality (ACM) and day 14 global cure versus caspofungin for the treatment of candidemia and/or IC. Both trials suggested early benefits of rezafungin versus caspofungin, including more rapid clearance of candidemia, and reported similar safety profiles for rezafungin and caspofungin.

As with prior randomized trials evaluating echinocandins, patients in the ReSTORE trial could be randomized for up to 4 days after a positive Candida culture. Patients were also allowed a maximum of 48 hours of empiric antifungal treatment before enrollment. Culture results obtained closer to the initiation of antifungal therapy could theoretically have been negative, either spontaneously or due to empiric therapy. It is important to understand the potential clinical impact of initiation of study therapy and the timing of blood/tissue cultures because patients with positive cultures closer to antifungal therapy initiation may represent a population with more severe infections.

This preplanned analysis examined the efficacy and safety of rezafungin versus caspofungin in a subgroup of patients in the ReSTORE trial with a positive culture close to randomization.

Perspectives in health economics must be differentiated and the mere drug acquisition costs is only one factor in a payer perspective health economics appraisal. To shorten the hospital length of stay, reduces the risk of complications related with IV lines, the acquisition of nosocomial infections, particularly those caused by multidrug resistant pathogens, increases the number of available beds for other patients, and alleviates the patient and his/her families’ suffering. Rezafungin, as the first long-acting antifungal agent with minimal drug-drug interactions, represents an excellent opportunity to reduce the length of hospital stay of those patients requiring prolong use of antifungals, for example patients with endocarditis or bone and joint infections.

In conclusion:

We appreciate the thoughtful commentary by Wang and colleagues and welcome the opportunity to further elaborate on the key aspects related to the use of rezafungin in critically ill patients. While acknowledging the challenges that remain in the personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis, we believe that current evidence supports the role of rezafungin as a promising antifungal agent, particularly in complex ICU populations. The high loading dose (400 mg), and its higher water stability (leading to a prolong half-life), increase the total exposure during the first hours of candidemia. It may explain the shorter duration of candidemia in comparison to caspofungin. In addition, its favorable safety profile, and once-weekly dosing regimen offer potential clinical advantages including earlier discharge. Nonetheless, we agree that continuous monitoring of resistance trends, further clinical experience, and health-economic assessments are essential to optimize its use and better define the populations who may derive the most benefit. We hope that our additional clarifications contribute to the ongoing discussion on the evolving management of candidemia.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for treatment of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis (ReSTORE): a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised phase 3 trial [^1785cdc3]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study ReSTORE was published by George R Thompson rd and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Invasive candidiasis. In the ReSTORE study, the trial question was: is rezafungin noninferior to caspofungin in patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis? In the ReSTORE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ReSTORE study, the population was: 199 patients (81 female, 118 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with systemic signs and mycological confirmation of candidemia or invasive candidiasis. The key exclusion criteria were septic arthritis in a prosthetic joint; osteomyelitis; chronic disseminated candidiasis; severe hepatic impairment; severe ataxia; tremor; or neuropathy. In the ReSTORE study, the interventions were: n=100 rezafungin (400 mg in week 1, followed by 200 mg weekly, for a total of two to four doses for no more than 4 weeks) n=99 caspofungin (70 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 50 mg daily for no more than 4 weeks). In the ReSTORE study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in global cure at day 14 (59% vs. 61%; ARD -2, 95% CI -4 to 0). In the ReSTORE study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in death or unknown survival status at day 30 (24% vs. 21%; AD 3%, 95% CI -0.01 to 6.01). In the ReSTORE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. In the ReSTORE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with systemic signs and mycological confirmation of candidemia or invasive candidiasis, rezafungin was noninferior to caspofungin with respect to global cure at day 14.

### Regulatory considerations in the approval of rezafungin (rezzayo) for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults [^0e675017]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

On 22 March 2023, the FDA approved rezafungin (Rezzayo) for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options. Rezafungin is an echinocandin that supports weekly dosing, enabling outpatient parenteral treatment that potentially avoids the need for a central venous catheter. Approval of rezafungin was based on a single adequate and well-controlled phase 3 study designed with a day 30 all-cause mortality primary end point and 20% noninferiority margin, which demonstrated that rezafungin is noninferior to the comparator echinocandin. Nonclinical studies of rezafungin in nonhuman primates identified a neurotoxicity safety signal; however, rezafungin's safety profile in the completed clinical studies was similar to other Food and Drug Administration-approved echinocandins. Here we describe the rationale for this approval and important considerations during the review process for a flexible development program intended to expedite the availability of antimicrobial therapies to treat serious infections in patients with limited treatment options.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^f147c950]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rezafungin is an echinocandin approved in the US and EU to treat candidaemia and/or invasive candidiasis. This post-hoc, pooled analysis of the Phase 2 STRIVE and Phase 3 ReSTORE trials assessed rezafungin versus caspofungin in patients with candidaemia and/or invasive candidiasis (IC) in the intensive care unit (ICU) at randomisation.

Methods

STRIVE and ReSTORE were randomised double-blind trials in adults with systemic signs and mycological confirmation of candidaemia and/or IC in blood or a normally sterile site≤96 h before randomisation. Data were pooled for patients in the ICU at randomisation who received intravenous rezafungin (400 mg loading dose then 200 mg once weekly) or caspofungin (70 mg loading dose then 50 mg once daily) for≤4 weeks. Outcomes were Day 30 all-cause mortality (primary outcome), Day 5 and 14 mycological eradication, time to negative blood culture, mortality attributable to candidaemia/invasive candidiasis, safety, and pharmacokinetics.

Results

Of 294 patients in STRIVE/ReSTORE, 113 were in the ICU at randomisation (rezafungin n=46; caspofungin n=67). At baseline,~30% of patients in each group had impaired renal function and/or an Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II score≥20. One patient (in the caspofungin group) was neutropenic at baseline. Day 30 all-cause mortality was 34.8% for rezafungin versus 25.4% for caspofungin. Day 5 and 14 mycological eradication was 78.3% and 71.7% for rezafungin versus 59.7% and 65.7% for caspofungin, respectively. Median time to negative blood culture was 18 (interquartile range, 12.6-43.0) versus 38 (interquartile range, 15.9-211.3) h for rezafungin versus caspofungin (stratified log-rank P=0.001; nominal, not adjusted for multiplicity). Candidaemia/IC-attributable deaths occurred in two rezafungin patients versus one caspofungin patient. Safety profiles were similar between groups. Overall, 17.4% (rezafungin) versus 29.9% (caspofungin) of patients discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events. Rezafungin exposure following the initial 400-mg dose was comparable between patients in the ICU at randomisation (n=50) and non-ICU patients (n=117).

Conclusions

Rezafungin was well tolerated and efficacious in critically ill, mainly non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia and/or IC. This analysis provides additional insights into the efficacy and safety of rezafungin in the ICU population.

### Clinical and mycological outcomes of candidaemia and / or invasive candidiasis by Candida spp. and antifungal susceptibility: pooled analyses of two randomized trials of rezafungin versus caspofungin [^0cddb50d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A post hoc analysis used pooled STRIVE/ReSTORE trial data to determine outcomes with rezafungin versus caspofungin by Candida species and antifungal susceptibility.

Methods

The efficacy and safety of once weekly rezafungin 400/200 mg versus once daily caspofungin 70/50 mg was demonstrated in the randomized, double-blind phase 2 STRIVE (NCT02734862) and phase 3 ReSTORE (NCT03667690) trials involving adults with candidaemia and/or invasive candidiasis. In this analysis, data were pooled for patients with a documented Candida infection within 96 hours of randomization who also received ≥1 dose of study drug. Treatment outcomes were evaluated by Candida species and baseline MICs. Susceptibility was determined using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing E.Def 7.4 broth microdilution methodology, with Tween 20-supplemented medium for rezafungin.

Results

A total of 294 patients were included (rezafungin: N = 139, caspofungin: N = 155). Susceptibility testing at baseline identified three rezafungin non-susceptible isolates. Day 14 global cure rates were numerically similar between groups for C. albicans (rezafungin: 61.0% [36/59], caspofungin: 65.2% [45/69]) and C. tropicalis (rezafungin: 70.4% [19/27], caspofungin: 63.6% [14/22]), but higher with rezafungin than caspofungin for C. glabrata (rezafungin: 71.1% [27/38], caspofungin: 60.0% [21/35]) and C. parapsilosis (rezafungin: 78.6% [11/44], caspofungin: 55.6% [15/27]). Day 30 all-cause mortality rates were numerically similar between groups for C. albicans (rezafungin: 22.0% [13/59], caspofungin: 18.8% [13/69]) and C. glabrata (rezafungin: 15.8% [6/38], caspofungin: 11.4% [4/35]), but higher with caspofungin than rezafungin for C. tropicalis (rezafungin: 18.5% [5/27], caspofungin: 31.8% [2/22]) and C. parapsilosis (rezafungin: 7.1% [1/14], caspofungin: 29.6% [8/27]). Day 5/14 mycological eradication rates were numerically similar between treatments for C. albicans and C. parapsilosis, but higher with rezafungin for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis. Outcomes by Candida species were not associated with treatment-specific MICs.

Discussion

Rezafungin appears to be an effective treatment for candidaemia/invasive candidiasis irrespective of baseline Candida species.

### Treatment outcomes among patients with a positive Candida culture close to randomization receiving rezafungin or caspofungin in the ReSTORE study [^c0ea7d7f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rezafungin, a novel, once-weekly echinocandin for the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (IC) was noninferior to caspofungin for day 30 all-cause mortality (ACM) and day 14 global cure in the phase 3 ReSTORE trial (NCT03667690). We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses for patients with a positive culture close to randomization in ReSTORE.

Methods

ReSTORE was a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial in patients aged ≥18 years with candidemia and/or IC treated with once-weekly intravenous rezafungin (400 mg/200 mg) or once-daily intravenous caspofungin (70 mg/50 mg). This analysis comprised patients with a positive blood culture drawn between 12 hours before and 72 hours after randomization or a positive culture from another normally sterile site sampled between 48 hours before and 72 hours after randomization. Efficacy endpoints included day 30 ACM, day 14 global cure rate, and day 5 and 14 mycological response. Adverse events were evaluated.

Results

This analysis included 38 patients randomized to rezafungin and 46 to caspofungin. In the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively, day 30 ACM was 26.3% and 21.7% (between-group difference [95% confidence interval], 4.6% [-13.7%, 23.5%]), day 14 global response was 55.3% and 50.0% (between-group difference, 5.3% [-16.1%, 26.0%]), and day 5 mycological eradication was 71.1% and 50.0% (between-group difference, 21.1% [-0.2%, 40.2%]). Safety was comparable between treatments.

Conclusions

These findings support the efficacy and safety of rezafungin compared with caspofungin for the treatment of candidemia and/or IC in patients with a positive culture close to randomization, with potential early treatment benefits for rezafungin.

### Rezafungin in special populations with candidaemia and / or invasive candidiasis [^2c9d8248]. The Journal of Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Achieving and maintaining therapeutic drug exposures with antifungals can be challenging in special patient populations, such as those with organ dysfunction (liver or kidney) or obesity, or elderly patients, due to dose-exposure relationships and potential drug-drug interactions. Dose adjustments may be needed in these populations to maintain therapeutic efficacy and/or prevent toxicity. We reviewed specific dosing considerations for antifungals in special populations with candidaemia and/or invasive candidiasis, focusing on those relating to echinocandins (based on prescribing information), and then explored the utility of the second-generation echinocandin rezafungin in treating these populations (based on currently available data identified from a PubMed and congress abstract search). Available data showed that echinocandins may sometimes require dosing modifications for special populations with candidaemia/invasive candidiasis, primarily due to decreases in pharmacokinetic exposures. Rezafungin appears to be suitable for use in a variety of special populations without the need for dose modifications based on available data, including patients with organ dysfunction or obesity, and elderly and critically ill patients. Further research is needed in populations where rezafungin data are not available including children, people living with HIV, patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and those with underlying neurological conditions.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^6f241dd1]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive candidiasis/candidemia (IC/C) is associated with a substantial health economic burden driven primarily by prolonged hospital stay. The once-weekly IV echinocandin, rezafungin acetate, has demonstrated non-inferiority to caspofungin in the treatment of IC/C. This paper reports a post hoc pooled exploratory analysis of length of stay (LoS) for hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stays in two previously published clinical trials (ReSTORE [NCT03667690] and STRIVE [NCT02734862], that compared rezafungin with daily IV caspofungin (stable patients in the caspofungin group who met relevant criteria could step down to fluconazole after 3 days or more).

Methods

LoS outcomes were analysed descriptively in the pooled modified intention to treat (mITT) population (all patients who had a documented Candida infection in line with trial requirements and received at least one dose of study drug). In addition, to adjust for an imbalance between treatment groups in the proportion receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline, a generalised linear model with mechanical ventilation as a binary covariate was applied. Responses to an exploratory question in the phase 3 trial on possible earlier discharge with weekly rezafungin are also reported.

Results

294 patients were included (rezafungin 139, caspofungin 155), of whom 126 (43%) had ICU admission. Patients treated with rezafungin had a numerically shorter LoS than with caspofungin in all analyses. Mean total LoS was 25.2 days, vs 28.3 days with caspofungin, and mean ICU LoS was 16.1 vs 21.6 days for rezafungin and caspofungin, respectively. After adjustment for mechanical ventilation status the difference in ICU LoS was 4.1 days, a relative difference of 24% (95% CI -11%, 72%). Physicians would have considered earlier discharge for 16% of patients (30/187) with weekly rezafungin, an average of 5-6 days earlier.

Conclusions

Rezafungin may enable shorter hospital and ICU LoS in IC/C compared with daily IV caspofungin, with accompanying savings in resource use. Further research is needed to confirm this in the real-world setting.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^c540ffe7]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Critically ill patients are at risk of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis (IC), with one-third to half of all candidaemia cases occurring in the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcomes are poor, with an estimated crude mortality rate of 40‒55% in the ICU for IC.

Echinocandins are established first-line treatment for candidaemia and IC, with azoles an acceptable alternative in selected patients. However, timely initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy is essential; delay or inadequate treatment can increase mortality. Furthermore, the increasing prominence of non- albicans Candida species and growing challenge of azole and echinocandin resistance, especially with respect to C. glabrata and C. auris, are concerns. Within the ICU, antifungal-resistant isolates spread between patients; outbreaks of azole-resistant C. parapsilosis with similar genotypes and intra-hospital spread of azole-resistant C. glabrata have been reported. The likelihood of achieving effective exposures with current dosing regimens of first-generation echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin) is also unclear, especially regarding resistant Candida species. New agents and/or dosing strategies are therefore needed for critically ill patients with candidaemia and/or IC.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^c1c28f09]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Further studies are needed to confirm the effect of rezafungin treatment on length of ICU and hospital stay in the real-world setting and to understand how rezafungin could facilitate discharge in patients who are unable to step down to oral options due to resistance, tolerability or requirement for an IV route. A full cost-effectiveness analysis will be required to confirm and quantify the overall health economic effects of introducing rezafungin to the treatment pathway for IC/C. This is currently being undertaken and will be published separately.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^570517f5]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

As described in the introduction, the pooled efficacy analysis of STRIVE and ReSTORE found a potential early treatment benefit with rezafungin, which the authors noted might reflect its front-loaded dosing regimen. As noted by Thompson et al. in the primary publication from the ReSTORE study, the efficacy of echinocandins is dependent on drug concentrations within the target tissues, as the echinocandin class exhibits concentration-dependent fungal killing. It is possible that the shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay seen in the trials may also be due to front-loaded antifungal efficacy with rezafungin and/or the faster clearance of the pathogen (as evidenced by time to first negative blood culture).

There is a recognised unmet need for new antifungals with similar activity to the currently available echinocandins, but with longer half-lives and/or oral administration. In a study of the relationship between adherence to guideline recommendations and outcomes at 64 centres in Europe, Hoenigl et al. found that treatment with echinocandins was associated with improved survival (90-day mortality) compared with other antifungals. However, they also described longer hospital stays, with 1 in 7 patients with candidemia having their hospitalisation extended solely to allow completion of IV echinocandin treatment.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: the STRIVE trial [^c397aed8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Efficacy and Safety Assessments

All consented and randomized patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. All patients who received any amount of study drug were included in the safety population, which was used to assess safety outcomes. Patients in the safety population who had documented Candida infection at baseline were included in the microbiological ITT (mITT) population used to assess primary and secondary efficacy outcomes.

The primary efficacy outcome was overall response (with overall cure defined as resolution of clinical signs of candidemia/IC + mycological eradication) at day 14 (±1 day). Mycological response was defined as success (mycological eradication, presumed or documented, with no change in antifungal therapy), failure (mycological persistence, presumed or documented), or indeterminate (culture specimen or result not available or patient lost to follow-up). Mycological eradication was documented by 2 sequential negative blood cultures ≥12 hours apart for patients with candidemia or by negative results on the most recent culture before day 14 for patients with a qualifying positive culture from a normally sterile site. Mycological eradication was presumed if follow-up culture was not available in a patient with clinical cure and with, in cases of IC, resolution/improvement of IC-related baseline radiographic abnormalities. Secondary efficacy outcomes included overall, mycological, and Investigator-assessed clinical response at day 5 (overall and mycological responses only), day 14 (±1 day), day 28 (±2 days; for IC only), and follow-up (days 45–52 for candidemia only or days 52–59 for IC, with or without candidemia), as well as all-cause mortality (ACM) at day 30.

Safety was determined by adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), ACM through follow-up, and vital signs, laboratory and EKG testing.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: the STRIVE trial [^a44d040a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Randomization, Stratification, and Blinding

The trial consisted of 2 parts with different randomization schedules, each using block randomization, and stratified based on candidemia versus IC. Patients in part A were randomized (1:1:1) to receive RZF IV once weekly for 2–4 weeks at either 400 mg (group 1) or 400 mg on week 1 followed by 200 mg on subsequent weeks (group 2), or CAS once daily (70 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg daily with an optional oral stepdown available after day 3) (group 3). In part B, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive RZF IV once weekly or CAS once daily. The initial RZF dosing regimen was 400 mg once weekly (identical to group 1 of part A). After review of unblinded part A data, the RZF regimen was modified to 400 mg on week 1 followed by 200 mg weekly thereafter (identical to group 2 of part A) to align with the dosing regimen selected for phase 3. Patients in part B who were randomized to 400 mg once weekly remained on that regimen through treatment completion. All patients and study personnel interacting with patients were blinded to treatment assignment.

RZF IV was administered on days 1 and 8, with an optional dose on day 15 as determined by the Investigator. Patients with IC may have received an additional optional dose on day 22. CAS was administered once daily, up to 21 days for candidemia and up to 28 days for IC with or without candidemia. After at least 3 days on IV therapy, patients who met qualifying criteria could be switched to the oral stepdown regimen. In the CAS group, the oral stepdown regimen was fluconazole 800 mg on the first day of the switch, followed by 400 mg/day and weekly placebo IV; in the RZF groups, the regimen comprised oral placebo capsules and weekly RZF IV. Patients continued to receive placebo, IV or oral, as needed to preserve blinding through treatment completion.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^af953575]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rezafungin was associated with numerically shorter hospital and ICU stays than caspofungin in this pooled analysis of two clinical trials, and this effect was found in two independent randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The point estimates for relative difference indicate a trend for shorter stays for patients treated with rezafungin; however, the confidence intervals were wide. Numerical differences in ICU LoS between treatment arms remained even after adjusting for differences in mechanical ventilation status. There was no difference in total hospital LoS in patients who were not admitted to ICU, and a difference was not expected due to the double-dummy study design in which patients in the rezafungin arm still required daily placebo infusions, which affected any potential discharge date.

Both the STRIVE and ReSTORE trials were double-blind and double-dummy, meaning that patients randomised to rezafungin received placebo infusions on days when rezafungin was not administered. Thus, the differences in length of hospital and ICU stay in the trial setting are not likely to be attributed to the once-weekly administration. However, rezafungin may facilitate early hospital discharge for medically stable patients in the real-world setting. As reported here, 16% of patients in the ReSTORE trial would have been considered for earlier hospital discharge (median 5 days earlier) if rezafungin had been available without the need for daily echinocandin (or placebo infusion), according to the investigating physicians.

Efficacy of rezafungin compared with caspofungin

ACM rates at Day 30 were 34.8% (16/46) and 25.4% (17/67) for the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively (treatment difference 9.4% [95% CI − 7.5, 26.8]) (Fig. 1 A). There were 14 confirmed deaths at Day 30 (i.e. excluding patients with unknown survival status) in the rezafungin group and 15 in the caspofungin group. Of these, two (14.3%, 2/14) and one (6.6%, 1/15) were attributable to candidaemia and/or IC in the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively. Deaths attributable to candidaemia and/or IC at Day 30 were 4.3% (2/46) and 1.5% (1/67) for the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively (Fig. 1 B).

Mycological eradication on Days 5 and 14 was 78.3% (36/46) and 71.7% (33/46) in the rezafungin group versus 59.7% (40/67) and 65.7% (44/67), respectively, in the caspofungin group (treatment difference 18.6% [95% CI 0.9, 34.4] at Day 5 and 6.1% [95% CI −11.8, 22.7] at Day 14) (Fig. 2).

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^923abaf0]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Rezafungin's early treatment benefits – high rates of early mycological eradication and TTNBC – are likely a result of its differentiated pharmacokinetic profile compared with caspofungin. The low clearance and long half-life of rezafungin enables a QW dosing regimen that results in higher front-loaded exposure versus caspofungin QD, and higher plasma drug concentrations early on in treatment. These characteristics, along with overall cure and TTNBC results from STRIVE and ReSTORE, support the potential benefits of infrequent, front-loaded dosing of drugs that exhibit concentration-dependent antimicrobial killing and the potential for rapid infection clearance. In contrast, exposure to first-generation echinocandin drugs at clinical doses may not always be sufficient to treat infections due to the increased minimum inhibitory concentrations of some Candida species, compounded by pharmacokinetic variability seen in critically ill patients ; this could result in reduced efficacy of these drugs in this population. The high plasma drug concentrations achieved early in rezafungin therapy may help reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance, which is particularly relevant for critically ill patients in the ICU. Indeed, the exploratory pharmacokinetic analysis of ICU versus non-ICU patients suggests that rezafungin exposure may be comparable in these two groups of patients. This observation is important, as exposure to other echinocandins, such as caspofungin, may be influenced by altered drug distribution and clearance in ICU patients. These results suggest that rezafungin dose adjustment may not be required in ICU patients. However, further prospective data are required to understand rezafungin pharmacokinetics in ICU subpopulations, such as those undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

### Treatment outcomes among patients with a positive Candida culture close to randomization receiving rezafungin or caspofungin in the ReSTORE study [^74017e4a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Differences between rezafungin and caspofungin in early eradication were more pronounced in the present subgroup analysis of patients with a positive culture close to randomization compared with the primary analysis of ReSTORE ; median TTNBC was 23.9 hours versus 60.5 hours (P =.094; subgroup analysis) and 23.9 hours versus 27.0 hours (P =.18; primary analysis) for rezafungin versus caspofungin groups, respectively. Likewise, NBC at 24 hours was observed in 55.2% versus 27.3% (subgroup analysis) and 53.7% versus 46.2% (primary analysis) of patients receiving rezafungin versus caspofungin, respectively.

Echinocandins are the recommended first-line treatment for candidemia and IC, based on trials that demonstrated their efficacy and improved clinical outcomes versus other antifungal drugs. However, several studies have suggested that first-generation echinocandins may be underdosed, especially in critically ill patients. The improved pharmacokinetic profile of rezafungin may explain why the early treatment benefits versus caspofungin were more pronounced in these patients who had a positive Candida culture closer to the time of randomization, and hence potentially had more serious infections, when compared with the overall ReSTORE population.

The optimal timing of antifungal treatment remains a challenge in the management of patients with candidemia/IC; early and appropriate initiation of antifungal therapy has been demonstrated to impact final outcomes in patients with candidemia and IC, yet treatment is frequently initiated too late. Furthermore, diagnostic challenges pose an obstacle to early and appropriate treatment initiation. The results of this analysis focusing on patients with a positive Candida culture closer to randomization therefore provide further useful insight to guide and support prompt initiation of candidemia/IC treatment.

Limitations of the analysis include the small sample size of the subgroup population, which means that these findings should be interpreted with caution and that further investigation is needed. Nonetheless, the results presented here are from a preplanned analysis of a randomized trial.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^a894ab18]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The broad-spectrum echinocandin rezafungin was developed to treat candidaemia and IC and prevent invasive fungal disease caused by Candida, Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis species in patients undergoing allogeneic blood/bone marrow transplantation. Rezafungin’s long half-life (~ 5–6 days) and high front-loaded dosing permit extended-interval dosing and high plasma drug concentrations early in therapy owing to the concentration-dependent efficacy of echinocandins.

Rezafungin once weekly (QW) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2023 for the treatment of candidaemia and IC, and by the European Medicines Agency in December 2023 to treat IC in adults. In the Phase 2 STRIVE study, rezafungin was well tolerated and showed signs of efficacy in candidaemia and/or IC. Non-inferiority of QW rezafungin versus once-daily (QD) caspofungin was subsequently demonstrated for the primary outcomes of Day 14 global cure and Day 30 all-cause mortality (ACM) in the Phase 3 ReSTORE trial. Both trials suggested that rezafungin was associated with early efficacy benefits for time to negative blood culture (TTNBC) and Day 5 outcomes, including global (ReSTORE) or overall (STRIVE) cure and mycological eradication rates. Rezafungin and caspofungin had comparable safety profiles in both trials. A pooled analysis of STRIVE and ReSTORE confirmed these findings, and suggested a potentially faster TTNBC, especially in patients with a positive blood culture close to randomisation. This post-hoc, pooled, patient-level analysis of STRIVE and ReSTORE investigated the efficacy and safety of rezafungin compared with caspofungin in the subgroup of patients with candidaemia and/or IC who were in the ICU at randomisation.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^dd4140c7]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Rezafungin is a novel echinocandin approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in adults and by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients 18 years of age or older who have limited or no alternative options for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. It has an extended half-life compared with other echinocandins, and prolonged therapeutic drug concentrations in peripheral tissues. This allows for once-weekly IV dosing consisting of a 400 mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 200 mg on Day 8 and once weekly thereafter.

In the ReSTORE phase 3 trial in hospitalised adults with IC (NCT03667690), rezafungin was non-inferior to caspofungin on the two primary endpoints of global cure at day 14 (EMA endpoint) and 30-day all-cause mortality (FDA endpoint), with a comparable safety profile. A pre-specified patient-level pooled analysis of ReSTORE and the phase 2 STRIVE study (NCT02734862) confirmed non-inferior 30-day mortality for rezafungin (methodological differences meant that Day 14 global cure data were not suitable for pooling). The pooled analysis also found potential early treatment benefits with rezafungin: the proportion of patients with mycological eradication by Day 5 was 73.4% (102/139) and 64.5% (100/155) with rezafungin and caspofungin, respectively, and a weighted treatment difference (95% CI) of 10·0% (− 0·3 to 20·4). Similarly, more patients in the rezafungin group had negative blood culture at 24 h (60.0% [63/105], compared with 49.1% [57/116] with caspofungin), suggesting that rezafungin may be associated with a shorter time to negative blood culture than caspofungin.

This paper presents an exploratory pooled analysis of length of ICU and hospital stay from the two trials, together with exploratory data on physician assessment of potential for early hospital discharge. This will be of interest to clinicians, hospital managers, and healthcare payers.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^8a094f57]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

A number of antifungal drugs are available for the treatment of IC, principally echinocandins, azoles and amphotericin B. Echinocandins are the guideline-recommended choice for empiric and initial treatment in most circumstances, due to the greater renal toxicity of amphotericin B, the more limited spectrum of activity of fluconazole, and evidence that anidulafungin is superior to fluconazole in patients with candidemia, particularly C. albicans. However, fluconazole (intravenous [IV] or oral) is recommended as an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin in selected patients. Currently approved echinocandins require daily IV administration, which is burdensome for both patients and healthcare systems and can prolong hospital stay. Stable patients with susceptible infection may be switched to oral fluconazole to simplify treatment and/or allow hospital discharge.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^7f8b2c46]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data from two RCTs found that weekly IV rezafungin for the treatment of IC or candidemia was associated with numerically shorter hospital and ICU stays than daily IV caspofungin. In addition, 16% of patients in the phase 3 trial would have been considered for earlier hospital discharge if a once-weekly echinocandin had been available. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in the real-world setting. Given its previously demonstrated non-inferiority to caspofungin, rezafungin has the potential to lower the healthcare resource and cost burden associated with current standard of care options, including daily IV echinocandin treatment, and transform the treatment of invasive candidiasis and candidemia.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^6de0a555]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analyses have several limitations. The design of both trials meant that all patients in the rezafungin group received IV therapy during the whole treatment period, but in the caspofungin group most were switched to fluconazole before the end of therapy. This could be considered a bias in favour of rezafungin given that the benefit of an echinocandin vs. fluconazole has been demonstrated. There was high heterogeneity in the data and the confidence intervals for differences between treatment arms were wide. The analyses are based on exploratory endpoints from trials primarily designed to assess efficacy and safety. The trials did not collect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data, so it was not possible to ascertain whether shorter LoS resulted in improved quality of life for patients. This is being explored in a health economic analysis using HRQoL from a clinically-validated proxy from another condition, to be published separately. There is no standard definition of what constitutes an ICU: the nature of units, the severity of the patients admitted, and the criteria for their discharge will vary between centres, particularly depending on whether or not intermediate care units are available. Provision of intermediate care units varies widely between centres and regions, and it was not possible to adjust for their use as data were not available. There was also considerable heterogeneity among the types of patients in the analysis.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^0db717d0]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This post-hoc, patient-level analysis of STRIVE and ReSTORE data assessed rezafungin versus caspofungin in patients receiving care in an ICU. Our results provide further support for potential early treatment benefits with the front-loaded, QW rezafungin dosing regimen, as demonstrated through an indication of reduced TTNBC versus QD caspofungin treatment and numerically higher mycological eradication rates on Day 5. Day 30 ACM was numerically higher with rezafungin versus caspofungin, but candidaemia/IC-attributable mortality appeared to be similar between treatments. Rezafungin was generally well tolerated, with a comparable safety profile to caspofungin.

These data are broadly in agreement with primary results from the STRIVE and ReSTORE trials and a pooled overall analysis of these trials, in which rezafungin was non-inferior to caspofungin for primary efficacy outcomes, with secondary and exploratory analyses suggesting a potential early treatment benefit for rezafungin. It should be noted that as ICU status was not a stratification factor in the primary trials, our pooled analysis had greater imbalances in patient characteristics between groups in terms of gender, race, geographical distribution, and APACHE II score, as compared with the previous pooled analysis of the whole population.

Interestingly, the approximately 20-h difference in median TTNBC between treatments was greater in the present subgroup of critically ill patients than the approximately 3-h treatment difference in the individual trials. Furthermore, both mean time from first positive blood sample to any antifungal treatment for candidaemia/IC and to the first dose of randomised treatment were longer for patients who received rezafungin versus those who received caspofungin in our analysis, which is consistent with the data reported for the ReSTORE trial. However, TTNBC may have been confounded by many factors, such as differences between treatment groups in baseline Candida species (namely C. parapsilosis), comorbidities and the proportion of patients with catheter removal within 48 h after diagnosis. A multivariate analysis would be required to validate these findings in this small study population. There was a similar trend in favour of rezafungin in the proportions of patients achieving NBCs at 24 and 48 h in the ICU versus the overall population, although treatment differences between the groups were slightly greater in patients in the ICU versus the overall population.

Methods

Study design, patients, and treatment

Methodology and primary data from STRIVE (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02734862) and ReSTORE (NCT03667690) have been reported previously. Both were multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy trials comparing QW intravenous rezafungin versus QD intravenous caspofungin in adults aged ≥ 18 years with systemic signs and mycological confirmation of candidaemia and/or IC in blood or a normally sterile site within 96 h before randomisation (as defined in Supplementary Material 1). Patients who had received a systemic antifungal agent to treat candidaemia (given for > 48 h) within 4 days prior to randomisation were excluded from both trials, except if the treatment was one for which any Candida species isolated in culture was not susceptible.

In this post-hoc, patient-level analysis, data were pooled for patients in the ICU at randomisation who received similar dosing regimens of rezafungin and caspofungin in STRIVE and ReSTORE. STRIVE had two rezafungin dosing schemes; the regimen that aligned with the one used in ReSTORE is the focus of this analysis. Patients received rezafungin QW (400 mg on Day 1, 200 mg on Day 8, with an optional 200 mg dose on Day 15). A 200 mg rezafungin dose on Day 22 was optional in ReSTORE and for those with IC in STRIVE. Caspofungin was administered QD (70 mg on Day 1, then 50 mg/day for ≥ 2 and up to 28 days [with dose adjustment for drug–drug interactions or patient weight according to the label and at the investigator’s discretion]). There was an optional step-down to oral fluconazole (caspofungin groups) or oral placebo (to maintain study blinding for rezafungin groups) if step-down criteria were met. ReSTORE and STRIVE protocols recommended removal of central venous catheters (CVCs) within 48 h after candidaemia diagnosis, aligned with Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines.

Results

Patient disposition

Of the 294 patients with candidaemia and/or IC included in STRIVE and ReSTORE, 113 were in the ICU at randomisation and comprised the mITT and safety populations for this analysis. Overall, 46 and 67 critically ill patients were treated with rezafungin and caspofungin, respectively (Supplementary Material 1 : Fig. S1).

Demographics and baseline characteristics

Baseline patient demographics and characteristics were generally similar between the rezafungin and caspofungin groups (Table 1). Approximately 30% of patients in each group had impaired renal function (baseline creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) and/or Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score ≥ 20; > 78% of patients in each group had a catheter at screening. Fewer patients were receiving mechanical ventilation in the rezafungin (34.8%; 16/46) than the caspofungin (49.3%; 33/67) group. Other common risk factors for candidaemia/IC included broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (rezafungin 78.3%; caspofungin 67.2%), major surgery (rezafungin 30.4%; caspofungin 41.8%), and total parenteral nutrition (rezafungin 23.9%; caspofungin 32.8%). One patient (in the caspofungin group) was neutropenic at baseline. The most common Candida species isolated at baseline was C. albicans (rezafungin 41.3%; caspofungin 35.8%) (Supplementary Material 1 : Table S1). Isolated Candida species were comparable between groups, except for C. parapsilosis (rezafungin 8.7%; caspofungin 26.9%) and C. glabrata (rezafungin 37.0%; caspofungin 16.4%).

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^e5e41543]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The strengths and limitations of this analysis need to be acknowledged. Firstly, neither STRIVE nor ReSTORE were designed as ICU studies; most patients were treated in hospital wards, with only approximately one-third being in the ICU. Consequently, important data for ICU studies, for example Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3, were not available. Rates of catheter removal within 48 h were also lower than expected, as removal within this time frame was only recommended and not mandatory in both studies. Furthermore, this post-hoc analysis was not preplanned or powered to detect significant differences between treatment groups; patients in the ICU at randomisation were not a predefined subgroup of STRIVE or ReSTORE. It is therefore possible that the results observed were due to chance. Pooling data from the two trials is a strength, as this has generated a more robust dataset, although the sample size remains small and, as such, the clinical relevance of numerical differences between efficacy outcomes of rezafungin versus caspofungin groups cannot be determined. It should be noted that certain efficacy endpoints were defined differently in STRIVE and ReSTORE (e.g. global cure and overall response at Day 14), although these endpoints were deemed sufficiently similar to be combined for the purpose of this analysis.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^1e67fcc4]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive candidiasis (IC) is the most common fungal infection in hospitals in high-income countries. The term includes both candidemia (bloodstream infection with Candida) and deep-seated tissue candidiasis. IC is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in at-risk groups, which include (but are not limited to) patients with immunosuppression, major surgery, solid organ or stem cell transplant, mechanical ventilation, and indwelling catheter. Approximately half of all cases occur in the intensive care unit (ICU). A survey in nine European countries reported a cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired IC of 7.07 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions, with crude 40-day mortality of 42%, while a meta-analysis of European population-based studies found an incidence of 5.5 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions and 30-day mortality of 37%. Worldwide, there are an estimated 700,000 cases of IC each year.

IC is associated with a substantial economic burden. A 2020 systematic review reported a mean total direct cost per patient in developed Western countries ranging from $48,487 to $157,574 (2016 USD), with hospitalisation accounting for over half the cost. In US hospital inpatients at high risk of invasive fungal infection, the mean cost of an inpatient hospital stay in 2018 was reported as $29,640 (length of stay 5.36 days), but this rose to $162,750 (length of stay 22.2 days) in patients diagnosed with IC. An estimate from US insurance claims data put the average cost per hospitalisation for IC at $64,723–$153,090 (2017 USD). The total economic burden of IC in the US (including direct medical costs and productivity loss) was estimated at $1.8 bn for 2019. Recent data on the economic burden in Europe are lacking, but a review covering 2000 to 2011 also found that invasive fungal infections were associated with longer hospital stay, with healthcare resource use driven by hospitalisation, diagnostic testing, and medications.

### Efficacy and safety of rezafungin and caspofungin in candidaemia and invasive candidiasis: pooled data from two prospective randomised controlled trials [^9ee3af79]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The study ReSTORE and STRIVE was published by George R Thompson rd and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Invasive candidiasis and Candidemia. In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the trial question was: is rezafungin noninferior to caspofungin in patients with candidemia or invasive candidiasis? In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the population was: 294 patients (114 female, 180 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with candidemia or invasive candidiasis. The key exclusion criteria were septic arthritis in a prosthetic joint; osteomyelitis; endocarditis or myocarditis; meningitis, endophthalmitis, or any CNS infection. In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the interventions were: n=139 rezafungin (at a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg on day 8 plus an optional 200 mg dose on day 15 or 22) n=155 caspofungin (at a loading dose of 70 mg on day 1, then 50 mg daily for at least 3 and up to 21 or 28 days). In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in the rate of 30-day all-cause mortality (18.7% vs. 19.4%; ARD -1.5, 95% CI -10.7 to 7.7). In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of mycological eradication by day 5 (73% vs. 65%; AD 10%, 95% CI -0.3 to 20.4) No significant difference in the rate of mycological eradication by day 14 (72% vs. 68%; AD 4.3%, 95% CI -6.2 to 14.7) No significant difference in global cure at day 14 (65% vs. 63%; AD 2.3%, 95% CI -8.2 to 13.9). In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent adverse event. In the ReSTORE and STRIVE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with candidemia or invasive candidiasis, rezafungin was noninferior to caspofungin with respect to the rate of 30-day all-cause mortality.

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^ae05a177]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

We have taken great interest in reading two recent studies published in Critical Care regarding the safety and efficacy of rezafungin in the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (IC). Both studies conducted a pooled analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ReSTORE and STRIVE, which demonstrated that rezafungin is comparable to caspofungin in terms of safety and efficacy. However, rezafungin has a longer half-life, allowing for reduced dosing frequency, which improves patient compliance. Additionally, it shortens the long of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. We look forward to the clinical application of this novel echinocandin antifungal drug in multiple countries and regions. However, the road to achieving personalized treatment for candidemia and/or IC still has a long way to go.

### Rezafungin: an opportunity to personalize the treatment of patients with candidemia [^07d45518]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Deterioration of liver function may occur in ICU patients. It is unlikely though that rezafungin adds to such development. In a phase 2 double-blind randomized clinical trial, patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis were treated with either once-weekly rezafungin or intravenous caspofungin, no notable differences were found in treatment-emergent hepatic adverse events across the different study groups (rezafungin 400 mg/400 mg, rezafungin 400 mg/200 mg, and caspofungin at licensed dosing). Indeed, in the rezafungin 400 mg/200 mg group there was a lower incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation and of serious adverse events leading to death. In a phase 3 double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing rezafungin 400/200 with caspofungin at licensed dosing, hepatic adverse events were rare. However, classical adverse events related with echinocandins like hypokalemia, and gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhea and vomiting) were also common with rezafungin and should be monitored.

Question 2: Patients with candidemia who are in shock still require hospitalization, even in the ICU. How to accurately select the antifungal drugs based on susceptibility breakpoints, whether repeat blood cultures are necessary, and whether the time to negativity in blood cultures has clinical significance if individualized treatment is not feasible remain questions.

Answer to question 2: As per current guidelines, repeat blood cultures are necessary to determine the overall duration of treatment, i.e. blood culture negativity plus 14 days. Whether time to blood culture negativity is clinically relevant remains to be determined. Shorter duration of blood stream infection should translate into less complication. The shorter time to negative blood cultures found with rezafungin would have facilitated earlier discharge in 16% of patients. Interestingly, the Candida III study found the same effect size.

Conclusions

This post-hoc, patient-level, pooled analysis of the STRIVE and ReSTORE data indicates that rezafungin is efficacious and well tolerated in critically ill, mainly non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia and/or IC. Our findings provide additional insights into rezafungin efficacy and safety and indicate the applicability of the overall trial results to this critical care population.

### Treatment outcomes among patients with a positive Candida culture close to randomization receiving rezafungin or caspofungin in the ReSTORE study [^17a0d69c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This preplanned subgroup analysis supports previously described findings from the ReSTORE trial and demonstrates the efficacy and safety of weekly rezafungin for the treatment of candidemia and/or IC in patients with a positive culture close to randomization, who may represent patients with more serious infections. ACM at day 30, global cure at day 14, and mycological eradication at day 14 remained comparable between the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, with potential early clinical effects, such as the more rapid clearance of Candida infection, associated with front-loaded rezafungin exposure.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: the STRIVE trial [^b825fa7d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The efficacy results of CAS treatment were consistent with previous findings, demonstrating the sensitivity and validity of STRIVE. Similarly, RZF outcomes were in line with expectations inferred from published trials of the 3 currently approved echinocandins. For the primary endpoint, the RZF 400/200 mg group had a higher rate of overall cure at day 14 compared with other groups. For the secondary endpoint of ACM at day 30, the lowest rate observed was in the RZF 400/200 mg group. The current trial, however, was not powered to evaluate differences in efficacy, and the moderate sample size limits interpretation of numerical differences between groups. Nevertheless, certain observations garnered interest and warrant discussion.

Much of the apparent difference in efficacy outcomes between the 2 RZF dose groups in STRIVE can be accounted for by the cluster of indeterminates in the RZF 400 mg group. True cure rates with indeterminate responses excluded, such as for the primary efficacy endpoint of overall response, were 81.4% for RZF 400/200 mg, 69.7% for rezafungin 400 mg, and 70.7% for CAS. The absence of toxicity or intolerability among the reasons for failure indicate that apparent differences in efficacy were not related to safety. The possibility of diminished efficacy due to paradoxical growth with higher echinocandin concentrations is likely to be raised but is unlikely to account for the observed differences in outcomes of the 2 RZF arms. While there has been substantial effort and investigation into this in vitro phenomenon over the past 2 decades, recently conducted clinical trials do not support this hypothesis. Furthermore, in the present trial, apparent differences between the RZF groups were already observed at day 5 (Table 5) when all RZF-treated patients had only received the same, initial 400-mg dose.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: the STRIVE trial [^16a4a1ba]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Prior clinical trials investigating echinocandins in the treatment of candidemia and IC have demonstrated consistently more favorable outcomes when compared to triazoles, and no significant differences between echinocandins has been shown upon direct comparison. Since the initial landmark study demonstrating favorability of anidulafungin over fluconazole, the dosing strategies currently employed for echinocandins have been further explored and refined. A recent population pharmacokinetic study of micafungin in intensive care unit (ICU) patients found low serum drug concentrations; moreover, this study also found that standard dosing regimens are associated with a very low probability of attaining the target AUC:MIC value. Additional work has similarly suggested that echinocandin peak concentration:MIC ratios correlate with efficacy, and higher peak concentration:MIC ratios have been shown to exhibit improved killing of C. albicans in animal models. Lakota and colleagues demonstrated that front-loading of RZF (higher initial concentrations) results in greater fungicidal activity than more fractionated regimens. Our observation of more rapid clearance of candidemia in the RZF-treated patients compared to those treated with CAS, with differences apparent within 24 hours of initial therapy, is consistent with these prior observations. They also support the higher overall efficacy rate observed in the RZF-treated groups at day 5 when compared to the rates seen in the CAS treatment arm in this trial (RZF pooled, 62.3% vs CAS, 55.7%). The rationally designed, front-loaded dosing strategy and unique pharmacokinetic properties of RZF result in prolonged therapeutic drug concentrations within peripheral tissues. These findings may also support the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) concept and the potential to control resistance development by maintaining drug levels above the MPC for a period of time, as described by Zhao and colleagues. Although this concept remains hypothetical, the potential implications are important for strategies to treat resistant and less-susceptible pathogens and underscore the clinical relevance of antimicrobial pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.

In conclusion, this phase 2, multicenter trial demonstrated safety, tolerability, and efficacy using once-weekly RZF in comparison with once-daily CAS followed by fluconazole, in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and candidemia. These data support the utility of a once-weekly dosing strategy with RZF for treatment of these infections and justify further evaluation in the ongoing randomized, phase 3 clinical trial (ReSTORE; NCT03667690) comparing once-weekly RZF 400/200 mg to CAS for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis.

### Treatment outcomes among patients with a positive Candida culture close to randomization receiving rezafungin or caspofungin in the ReSTORE study [^d721a98c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this preplanned analysis of the phase 3 ReSTORE study, we compared once-weekly rezafungin with once-daily caspofungin (followed by optional fluconazole) for the treatment of candidemia and/or IC in patients with a positive culture close to randomization. Our findings show comparable day 30 ACM and day 14 global response between rezafungin and caspofungin groups in this population. Because patients with a positive culture from a sample drawn more than 12 hours before randomization (blood) or more than 48 hours before randomization (other sites), who theoretically may have cleared their infection by the time of treatment initiation (either spontaneously or as a result of empiric therapy), were omitted from this analysis, this subpopulation may represent a more challenging patient population than the primary ReSTORE population. The safety and tolerability of rezafungin were comparable to caspofungin in this analysis and were consistent with previously published findings from ReSTORE and for first-generation echinocandins.

The efficacy of rezafungin versus caspofungin for the treatment of candidemia and/or IC has been previously reported in the STRIVE and ReSTORE trials. Numerically lower day 30 ACM rates and numerically higher day 14 overall cure rates were observed in patients in STRIVE who were treated with rezafungin versus caspofungin (4% vs 13% and 76% vs 67%, respectively). Primary data for ReSTORE demonstrated noninferiority of rezafungin versus caspofungin for day 30 ACM (24% vs 21%; treatment difference 2.4% [95% CI: −9.7%, 14.4%]) and day 14 global cure (59% vs 61%; weighted treatment difference −1.1% [95% CI: −14.9%, 12.7%]). This subgroup analysis adds to these prior results reporting the efficacy of rezafungin in the treatment of candidemia and/or IC.

Overall cure was achieved in 60.5% (46/76) of the RZF 400 mg group, 76.1% (35/46) of the RZF 400/200 mg group, and 67.2% (41/61) of the CAS group (Table 3). The number of indeterminates was clustered in the RZF 400 mg group (Supplementary Table 5). Rates of overall cure with these indeterminates excluded were 69.7% (46/66) in the RZF 400 mg group, 81.4% (35/43) in the RZF 400/200 mg group, and 70.7% (41/58) in the CAS group.

### Rezafungin: an opportunity to personalize the treatment of patients with candidemia [^45a92501]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

We appreciate the thoughtful commentary by Wang et al. and welcome the opportunity to further elaborate on the key aspects related to the use of rezafungin in critically ill patients by replying to his letter.

While this letter and the work entitled “The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go” are surely commendable, several points merit further discussion. The authors raised some questions regarding our sub-analyses of rezafungin use in the intensive care unit (ICU). We would like to provide answers by the following additional information:

Question 1: While the once-weekly administration significantly improves patient compliance, the pathophysiological status of critically ill patients, particularly liver function, can change rapidly. Whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is required during treatment and whether it is unnecessary to adjust the drug dosage based on liver function still need further investigation.

Answer to question 1: We would like to mention that classical echinocandins have been associated with low serum concentrations in critically ill patients leading to sub-optimal PKPD target achievement (area under the curve [AUC]/minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC]). In contrast, population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of rezafungin using data from phase 1, 2, and 3 studies showed that no clinical meaningful PK variation was observed along co-variates including body mass index, albumin, or diseases state comprising liver diseases. In addition, a recent literature review has shown that rezafungin appears to be suitable for use in a variety of special populations without the need for dose modifications based on available data, including patients with organ dysfunction or obesity, and elderly and critically ill patients.

Question 3: Is it necessary to routinely test for rezafungin susceptibility? When the treatment outcome is unsatisfactory, should FKS mutations be screened? These questions require guidance from professors specializing in pharmacy.

Answer to question 3: Given the broad susceptibility of Candida spp to echinocandins, antifungal susceptibility testing is not routinely performed in all centers managing candidemia. Rezafungin is structurally related to anidulafungin, and current in vitro data support inferring susceptibility to rezafungin from susceptibility to anidulafungin.

We acknowledge the growing concern regarding emerging echinocandin resistance and agree that close surveillance of resistance trends is essential. A most concerning situation is intrabdominal candidiasis, probably due to the lower exposure to echinocandins in peritoneal fluid. In a murine model rezafungin exhibited higher diffusion to intrabdominal abscesses as compared to micafungin. More clinical experience is needed to confirm this potential advantage in humans.

Question 4: Is it necessary to further consider the cost implications from a health economics perspective?

Answer to question 4: We agree with the authors that health resources are limited, and it is necessary to select those patients who benefit from an antifungal showing better PK properties and demonstrating shorter time to negative blood cultures. We suggest that those with non-catheter related candidemia, presenting with sepsis or septic shock are the best candidates since the probability to achieve the PK/PD target is higher with the standard dose of rezafungin than with other echinocandins, even more so in critically ill patients with hypoalbuminemia and obesity. Although there was no difference in mortality, it is also true that the mortality in rezafungin clinical trials was around 20%. That is the baseline mortality in patients with similar characteristics but without candidemia.

### Rezafungin (Rezzayo) [^1e1fb4bb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

One hundred and ninety-nine patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population were randomized. The age range was 19-91 years, the gender distribution was 62% male and 38% female, and the race distribution was 61% White, 5% Black, 29% Asian, and 5% other races or not reported. The median duration of therapy was 14 days in the two treatment arms.

The modified ITT (mITT) population included 187 patients with a culture positive for Candida species within 4 days before randomization and who received at least one dose of study drug. The most frequent species isolated at baseline was C. albicans (42%), followed by C. glabrata (26%), C. tropicalis (20%), and C. parapsilosis (13%). The majority (70%) of patients had a diagnosis of candidemia only. The majority (93%) of patients were not neutropenic (ANC ≥500) and 84% had APACHE II scores less than 20. Risk factors for candidemia were: receipt of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs (71%), presence of a central venous catheter (60%), major surgery (35%), diabetes mellitus (29%), active malignancy (25%), and total parenteral nutrition (20%). Mechanically ventilated patients were 24% (17% and 30% in the REZZAYO and caspofungin group, respectively).

Efficacy was assessed by all-cause mortality at Day 30. The number and percentage of patients in each treatment group who were alive and deceased/unknown survival status at Day 30 was determined in the mITT population. Additional efficacy outcomes were global cure (mycological eradication/presumed eradication, clinical cure, and radiological cure [for patients with documented IC by radiologic or other imaging findings at baseline]), mycological eradication/presumed eradication, and investigator's assessment of clinical cure. Results of the efficacy endpoints are shown in Table 4 .

A multicenter, randomized, dose-finding, exploratory, double-blind study was conducted in subjects with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (Trial 2: NCT02734862). The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate safety and tolerability of rezafungin and overall success (mycological eradication and resolution of systemic signs attributable to candidemia and/IC) at Day 14. The study provides safety and supportive efficacy data.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^72822c28]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

As expected, Day 30 ACM rates were higher in this subgroup of critically ill patients than those in the pooled overall analysis. Day 30 ACM rates were numerically lower with caspofungin versus rezafungin, despite a higher proportion of patients who received mechanical ventilation in the caspofungin group. However, 95% CIs for Day 30 ACM rates overlapped between the two treatment groups and there was a greater number of deaths not attributable to candidaemia in the rezafungin group. The number of deaths attributed to candidaemia/IC was similar between groups (rezafungin n = 2, 14.3% of confirmed deaths; caspofungin n = 1, 6.6% of confirmed deaths). Like TTNBC, ACM may have been affected by Candida - and non- Candida -related factors, for example, baseline Candida species, comorbidities (e.g. higher proportion of patients on dialysis in the rezafungin versus caspofungin group), and catheter management. The safety profile of rezafungin versus caspofungin in patients in the ICU was in line with previous reports from the primary and pooled analyses.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^cdc9ba78]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The severity of patients arriving in ICU is an important predictor of length of ICU stay. The STRIVE and ReSTORE trials aimed to balance severity by stratifying randomisation by diagnosis (candidemia only or IC), modified APACHE II score (ReSTORE only), and absolute neutrophil count. APACHE scores were well-balanced between treatment groups in the pooled analysis. The use of vasopressors in the pooled ICU population was also broadly comparable between the two groups (analysis to be published separately). However, there was an observed imbalance in the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation, which has been identified as one of the factors associated with longer length of ICU stay. Due to the complexity of ICU patients, and the inability to control for confounding factors such as APACHE II/SOFA scores, and/or mechanical ventilation status, data on ICU length of stay required further adjustments. Adjustment for mechanical ventilation status resulted in a reduction in the difference in ICU LoS between the rezafungin and caspofungin treatment arms from 5.5 days (unadjusted) to 4.1 days, a relatively small difference that supports the finding of a treatment-related difference. However, an influence from differences in patient severity cannot be ruled out.

In candidemia, removal of indwelling catheters is strongly recommended in guidelines. Accordingly, the study protocol recommended that central venous catheters (CVC) should be removed within 48 h after diagnosis with candidemia. However, this only occurred in a minority of patients. The impact of this on length of stay is difficult to assess. Given that rates of removal were low in both arms it is not expected to significantly impact any differences between arms, and could overestimate the LoS in the rezafungin arm as fewer patients in this arm had their CVC removed within 48 h.

Furthermore, the ReSTORE study was partially conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have affected the overall management of patients, including time to CVC removal. Patients enrolled during the peri-COVID period had a higher baseline incidence of some poor prognostic factors than patients enrolled pre-COVID, including use of invasive interventions, antibiotics, and active cancer. However, the distribution of these factors was similar between trial arms.

INTRODUCTION

Rezafungin is a second-generation echinocandin that has shown activity against a range of Candida species including wild-type and azole- and echinocandin-resistant isolates. Rezafungin has improved chemical and biological properties that are distinct from other echinocandins. Most notably, the modified backbone of rezafungin leads to a stable chemical structure with reduced metabolism and degradation relative to other echinocandins. This results in a longer half-life, which allows for weekly dosing, improved tissue penetration, and reduced organ toxicity. Less frequent dosing also results in high front-loaded exposure, which, along with good distribution to and penetration at infection sites may allow earlier mycological clearance from sites of infection with the potential to prevent the emergence of resistance. Rezafungin was approved in 2023 by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis based on clinical efficacy and safety data from the randomized Phase 2 STRIVE and Phase 3 ReSTORE clinical trials.

Candidemia treatment comparative evidence: Despite randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another; for instance, amphotericin B (AmB) plus fluconazole is at least as effective as higher-dose (800 mg daily) fluconazole given alone for patients with candidemia, but there is little role for this combination in current practice. While awaiting culture and susceptibility data, a working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical for informed therapeutic decisions.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of REZZAYO in the treatment of patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (IC) were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study (Trial 1; NCT03667690). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive REZZAYO or caspofungin. Randomization was stratified based on diagnosis (candidemia only; IC) and by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at screening. Patients with septic arthritis in a prosthetic joint, osteomyelitis, endocarditis or myocarditis, meningitis, endophthalmitis, chorioretinitis, or any central nervous system infection, chronic disseminated candidiasis, or urinary tract candidiasis due to ascending Candida infection secondary to obstruction or surgical instrumentation of the urinary tract were excluded.

Patients in the REZZAYO arm were to receive a single 400 mg loading dose on Day 1 of Week 1, followed by 200 mg once weekly, for a total of two to four doses. Patients in the caspofungin arm were to receive a single 70 mg IV loading dose, followed by caspofungin 50 mg IV once daily treatment for a total of 2 to 4 weeks. After ≥3 days of IV therapy, patients in the caspofungin group could be switched to oral step-down therapy (fluconazole), if the patient met the criteria for cure and was preparing to be discharged.

Additionally, physician-reported assessment of possible earlier discharge was captured during the ReSTORE Study. This was based on responses to a question on the case report form (CRF) for completion by the site Principal Investigator, which asked ‘In your opinion, if you had the availability of once weekly IV rezafungin and did not need to administer daily placebo/caspofungin/fluconazole, would you have considered discharging this patient from hospital earlier than the actual discharge date (yes/no)? How many days earlier?’.

The methods of the pooled efficacy and safety analysis of STRIVE and ReSTORE have also been published. The post-hoc pooled analysis reported here compared total hospital LoS and ICU LoS for patients receiving the 400/200 mg rezafungin dose with those in the caspofungin treatment arms (mITT populations). The rezafungin 400/400 mg arm from STRIVE was not included as this dose was not taken forward to phase 3. All outcomes were analysed using descriptive statistics. In addition, to adjust for an imbalance between treatment groups in the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation at baseline, a generalised linear model (log-link, gamma distribution) with mechanical ventilation as a binary covariate was applied in the all-patients LoS analyses (i.e. including non-survivors).

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^765e4236]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Data analyses

Outcomes were evaluated in patients with candidaemia and/or IC who were in the ICU at randomisation. Data are reported for the modified intent-to-treat (mITT; patients with documented Candida infection within 96 h before randomisation who received ≥ 1 study drug dose) and safety populations (patients who received ≥ 1 study drug dose), respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in the pharmacokinetic analysis population, defined as all patients who received rezafungin with at least one plasma sample for pharmacokinetic analysis. As a post-hoc analysis, outcomes were summarised using descriptive statistics (because the analysis was not powered for formal comparisons), with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provided for the primary and secondary outcome measures. Two-sided 95% CIs for the weighted (by study and Parts A and B of STRIVE) treatment difference estimate in response rates (rezafungin minus caspofungin) were calculated using stratified (by study and Parts A and B of STRIVE) Miettinen–Nurminen methodology. Kaplan–Meier methods were used to estimate median TTNBC. Statistical difference was assessed nominally for TTNBC using the stratified log-rank test (not adjusted for multiplicity) and exploratory, nominal P values are provided.

Outcomes

The primary outcome in this analysis was Day 30 ACM (FDA-mandated joint primary outcome in ReSTORE). Secondary outcomes were mycological response (eradication) on Days 5 and 14 within patients with a positive baseline blood culture. The exploratory outcome was TTNBC within those with a positive baseline blood culture. The proportions of patients with positive baseline blood cultures who had negative blood cultures at 24 and 48 h were also assessed. Definitions are included in Supplementary Material 1. Mortality attributable to candidaemia and/or IC (patients who died with systemic signs or symptoms attributable to candidaemia and/or IC, assessed by investigators in STRIVE and by the data review committee [DRC] in ReSTORE) at Day 30 in a blinded manner, Day 14 global/overall response, duration of ICU/hospital stay, and administration of vasopressors within the ICU from Day 1 onwards were post-hoc analyses. Definitions of Day 14 global cure (ReSTORE) and overall response (STRIVE) were deemed sufficiently similar to be combined for this analysis (global cure: clinical cure, radiological cure, and mycological eradication determined by a blinded DRC ; overall response was programmatically derived as resolution of clinical signs of candidaemia/IC and mycological eradication).

Safety was determined by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs: AEs occurring during or after study drug administration until follow-up visit), study drug-related TEAEs, serious TEAEs and serious drug-related TEAEs, vital signs, and laboratory tests. AEs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 23.0 and stratified by protocol-specified severity grades (mild/moderate/severe).

An exploratory analysis of the pharmacokinetic parameters of rezafungin following the first 400-mg dose (area under the plasma concentration‒time curve from 0 to 168 h [AUC 0–168 h], and maximum and minimum plasma concentrations [C max and C min]) in patients in the ICU at randomisation and non-ICU patients (i.e. all other patients in the pharmacokinetic analysis population who received the initial 400-mg dose of rezafungin who were not in the ICU at randomisation), was also performed.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: the STRIVE trial [^6d85e73d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of 2 treatment regimens of RZF once weekly to CAS once daily in the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis. Not surprisingly, in this double-blinded trial, safety and tolerability between groups were comparable in that the most common AEs (hypokalemia, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever) were neither severe nor unexpected for this patient population. As shown in Table 6, isolated differences in the incidence of individual TEAEs were observed between groups and treatments (eg, diarrhea, peripheral edema) but did not demonstrate a trend or pattern of concern. The safety findings of STRIVE, in the more than 200 patients enrolled, further validate the well-recognized safety profile of the echinocandin class of drugs and underscore the safety of RZF and its once-weekly dosing regimen. The ongoing phase 3 treatment trial of rezafungin 400/200 mg once weekly (ReSTORE; NCT03667690) will further contribute to the safety database on rezafungin.

An error appeared in this article [Thompson GR III, Soriano A, Skoutelis A, et al. Rezafungin versus Caspofungin in a Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind Study for the Treatment of Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis: The STRIVE Trial. Clin Infect Dis ciaa1380,].

The figure of time to negative blood culture (Figure 2 of the article) was based on an analysis found to have 2 programming flaws discovered during further analyses of time to negative blood culture. First, the analysis was to be of patients with positive blood cultures, but patients with invasive candidiasis (IC) were included. Second, while the first of two required negative cultures was used as the time of culture clearance, assessment of blood cultures may not have accounted for cultures that were collected from 2 separate blood draws from different locations at approximately the same time. In some cases, the first negative blood culture used for the analysis was within minutes of a positive culture collected at approximately the same time. When these issues were identified, the analysis was repeated with the following adjustments (see text and Figure 2 below).

Figure 2. 
Time to negative blood culture following treatment with RZF versus caspofungin in patients with candidemia from the mITT population (P =.0016; log-rank test, post hoc analysis). Abbreviations: mITT, microbiological intent to treat; RZF, rezafungin. The first of two required negative cultures was used as the time of culture clearance, with the first negative blood culture drawn at least 1 hour after the last positive blood culture. The overall trend is unchanged, with significant differences between treatments observed as soon as ~24 hours after the first dose.

In the reanalysis, only patients with candidemia were included; patients with IC were excluded. Additionally, the programming parameters were updated to ensure that the first negative blood culture was drawn at least 1 hour after the last positive blood culture.

The reanalysis provides increased accuracy in the assessment of time to negative blood culture and, as shown in Figure 2 below, the overall conclusions are unchanged. The difference between treatments is statistically significant (P=.0016) and observed as early as ~24 hours after the first dose. Furthermore, the overall conclusions of the paper and the reported trial, re: the STRIVE Phase 2 trial of rezafungin treatment versus caspofungin, are unchanged. The trial sponsor apologizes for the error.

Efficacy of Rezafungin Versus Caspofungin

At day 30, 26.3% (10/38) and 21.7% (10/46) of patients in the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively, were either known to have died or had unknown survival status (3 patients had unknown status [rezafungin: 1, caspofungin: 2]). The treatment difference (95% CI) for day 30 ACM was 4.6% (−13.7%, 23.5%).

At day 5, the global cure rate was 55.3% (21/38) and 43.5% (20/46) in the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively (treatment difference [95% CI]: 11.8% [−9.7%, 32.2%]); by day 14, this was 55.3% (21/38) and 50.0% (23/46), with a treatment difference of 5.3% (−16.1%, 26.0%) (Figure 3). At day 5, the proportion of patients with mycological eradication was 71.1% (27/38) and 50.0% (23/46) in the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively, with a treatment difference (95% CI) of 21.1% (−0.2%, 40.2%); by day 14, it was 63.2% (24/38) and 54.3% (25/46), with a treatment difference of 8.8% (−12.4%, 29.0%) (Figure 3). Only 1 patient was classified as a relapse between day 5 and Day 14: a patient in the caspofungin group had documented eradication at day 5 but then had breakthrough candidemia on days 9 and 11.

### Micafungin versus caspofungin for treatment of candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis [^6b7ac07b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive candidiasis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with health care-associated infection. The echinocandins have potent fungicidal activity against most Candida species, but there are few data comparing the safety and efficacy of echinocandins in the treatment of invasive candidiasis.

Methods

This was an international, randomized, double-blind trial comparing micafungin (100 mg daily) and micafungin (150 mg daily) with a standard dosage of caspofungin (70 mg followed by 50 mg daily) in adults with candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis. The primary end point was treatment success, defined as clinical and mycological success at the end of blinded intravenous therapy.

Results

A total of 595 patients were randomized to one the treatment groups and received at least 1 dose of study drug. In the modified intent-to-treat population, 191 patients were assigned to the micafungin 100 mg group, 199 to the micafungin 150 mg group, and 188 to the caspofungin group. Demographic characteristics and underlying disorders were comparable across the groups. Approximately 85% of patients had candidemia; the remainder had noncandidemic invasive candidiasis. At the end of blinded intravenous therapy, treatment was considered successful for 76.4% of patients in the micafungin 100 mg group, 71.4% in the micafungin 150 mg group, and 72.3% in the caspofungin group. The median time to culture negativity was 2 days in the micafungin 100 mg group and the caspofungin group, compared with 3 days in the micafungin 150 mg groups. There were no significant differences in mortality, relapsing and emergent infections, or adverse events between the study arms.

Conclusions

Dosages of micafungin 100 mg daily and 150 mg daily were noninferior to a standard dosage of caspofungin for the treatment of candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis.

Echinocandins—efficacy and comparative evidence in candidemia: Echinocandins demonstrate significant fungicidal activity against most Candida species with success in approximately 70%–75% of patients in randomized, comparative clinical trials. Only one study comparing an echinocandin to fluconazole suggested a strong trend toward improved global responses with anidulafungin, and a combined analysis of 7 large trials involving almost 2000 patients found that initial therapy with an echinocandin was a significant predictor of survival. It has become common practice to initiate an echinocandin and then change to an oral azole once the patient becomes clinically stable.

Empiric treatment for suspected invasive candidiasis in nonneutropenic intensive care unit (ICU) patients—empiric antifungal therapy “should be considered in critically ill patients with risk factors for invasive candidiasis and no other known cause of fever” and “should be started as soon as possible” in those with “clinical signs of septic shock” (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Preferred empiric therapy is an echinocandin: caspofungin “loading dose of 70 mg, then 50 mg daily;” micafungin “100 mg daily;” anidulafungin “loading dose of 200 mg, then 100 mg daily” (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Fluconazole “800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily” is an acceptable alternative when there has been no recent azole exposure and no colonization with azole-resistant Candida (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Lipid formulation AmB “3–5 mg/kg daily” is an alternative if other agents are not tolerated (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). If patients improve, recommended duration is “2 weeks,” the same as documented candidemia (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). If there is “no clinical response … at 4–5 days” and no evidence of invasive disease or a negative non-culture diagnostic with high negative predictive value, “consideration should be given to stopping antifungal therapy” (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Infusion-related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Hepatic Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of REZZAYO cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of REZZAYO was assessed in 76 subjects in phase 1 studies and 232 patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis in Trials 1 and 2, who received a 400 mg loading dose followed by a 200 mg dose once weekly or higher (please note that after the loading dose of 400 mg, weekly doses higher than 200 mg are not approved). A total of 151 patients received an initial 400 mg loading dose followed by a 200 mg dose once weekly thereafter (400 mg/200 mg dose); the maximum duration of dosing was 4 weekly doses (including the loading dose).

In the pooled Trial 1 and 2 safety database of REZZAYO patients treated with the 400 mg/200 mg dose, the age range was 19-91 years, the gender distribution was 64.9% male and 35.1% females, and the race distribution was 66.2% White, 7.9% Black, 17.9% Asian, 2.7% other, and 5.3% not reported.

### Evaluation of rezafungin provisional CLSI clinical breakpoints and epidemiological cutoff values tested against a worldwide collection of contemporaneous invasive fungal isolates (2019 to 2020) [^d9bd7cfa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rezafungin is a new echinocandin under development for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. CLSI recently approved provisional susceptible-only breakpoints and epidemiological cutoff values for Candida spp. and rezafungin. The activities of rezafungin and comparators against 2019 to 2020 invasive fungal isolates was evaluated by applying the new CLSI breakpoints. Rezafungin demonstrated potent activity against Candida albicans (MIC 50 /MIC 90 , 0.03/0.06mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), Candida tropicalis (MIC 50 /MIC 90 , 0.03/0.06mg/L; 100% susceptible), Candida glabrata (MIC 50 /MIC 90 , 0.06/0.06mg/L; 98.3% susceptible), Candida krusei (MIC 50 /MIC 90 , 0.03/0.03mg/L; 100% susceptible), and Candida dubliniensis (MIC 50 /MIC 90 , 0.06/0.12mg/L; 100% susceptible) when tested by the CLSI broth microdilution method. Rezafungin inhibited 99.6% of Candida parapsilosis isolates (MIC 50 /MIC 90 , 1/2mg/L) at the susceptible breakpoint of ≤2mg/L. All C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei isolates, as well as most C. glabrata (96.2% to 97.9%) and C. parapsilosis (86.2% to 100%) isolates, were susceptible to comparator echinocandins. Fluconazole resistance was detected among 0.5%, 4.5%, 10.5%, and 1.2% of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis isolates, respectively. All echinocandins displayed limited activity against Cryptococcus neoformans. Rezafungin and other echinocandins were active against Aspergillus fumigatus (minimum effective concentration for 90% of isolates tested [MEC 90 ] range, 0.015 to 0.06mg/L) and Aspergillus section Flavi (MEC 90 range, 0.015 to 0.03mg/L). All but 16 (8.6%) A. fumigatus isolates were susceptible to voriconazole, and 100% of Aspergillus section Flavi isolates were WT to mold-active azoles. When applying the CLSI clinical breakpoints, rezafungin displayed high susceptibility rates (>98.0%) against Candida isolates from invasive fungal infections and showed potent activity against Aspergillus isolates.

Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an alternative when there is intolerance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). The recommended duration of empiric therapy in patients who improve is 2 weeks, the same as for documented candidemia (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients with no clinical response at 4–5 days and no subsequent evidence of invasive candidiasis after starting empiric therapy, consideration should be given to stopping antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Safety

Rezafungin and caspofungin had comparable safety profiles (Table 2). The most common TEAEs (≥ 10% of patients in either group) were anaemia, diarrhoea, septic shock, vomiting, hypokalaemia, and sepsis. Overall, 17.4% (8/46) and 29.9% (20/67) of patients in the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively, discontinued the study/drug due to TEAEs. Serious TEAEs reported in ≥ 5% of patients in either group were septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The only study drug-related TEAE occurring in > 1 patient in either group was increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (caspofungin: 2/67 [3.0%]). Study drug-related serious TEAEs occurred in 2.2% (1/46) of patients receiving rezafungin (infusion-related reaction) and 6.0% (4/67) receiving caspofungin (ventricular tachycardia, rectal haemorrhage, hypertransaminasaemia, and anaphylactic shock; all n = 1). Study drug-related TEAEs led to study discontinuation in no patients in the rezafungin group and two in the caspofungin group (ventricular tachycardia and anaphylactic shock). Laboratory parameters in the pooled ICU subgroup are shown in Supplementary Material 1 : Table S2.

### ECIL-6 guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis in leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [^1e997fb5]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) provides recommendations for diagnostic strategies and prophylactic, pre-emptive or targeted therapy strategies for various types of infection in patients with hematologic malignancies or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. Meetings are held every two years since 2005 and evidence-based recommendations are elaborated after evaluation of the literature and discussion among specialists of nearly all European countries. In this manuscript, the ECIL group presents the 2015-update of the recommendations for the targeted treatment of invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Current data now allow a very strong recommendation in favor of echinocandins for first-line therapy of candidemia irrespective of the underlying predisposing factors. Anidulafungin has been given the same grading as the other echinocandins for hemato-oncological patients. The beneficial role of catheter removal in candidemia is strengthened. Aspergillus guidelines now recommend the use of either voriconazole or isavuconazole for first-line treatment of invasive aspergillosis, while first-line combination antifungal therapy is not routinely recommended. As only few new data were published since the last ECIL guidelines, no major changes were made to mucormycosis recommendations.

### Treatment outcomes among patients with a positive Candida culture close to randomization receiving rezafungin or caspofungin in the ReSTORE study [^1bed3313]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Assessments

Efficacy endpoints included ACM at day 30 (primary efficacy outcome of ReSTORE as mandated by the FDA) and global response at days 5 and 14 visits (primary efficacy outcome of ReSTORE as mandated by the European Medicines Agency). The ACM endpoint comprised patients who died on or before day 30 or whose survival status was unknown. Patients who were alive at day 28/day 29 but had unknown survival status at day 30 were considered alive for the purposes of this assessment. Global response was based on clinical cure as assessed by the investigator, radiological cure (for patients with IC), and mycological eradication, all of which were confirmed by an independent, blinded Data Review Committee (DRC). Outcomes according to the DRC were used for this analysis.

Additional efficacy endpoints included mycological eradication at days 5 and 14, time to first negative blood culture (TTNBC), and the percentage of negative blood cultures (NBCs) at 24 and 48 hours after the first dose of the study drug. For patients with a positive blood culture at baseline, mycological response was defined as eradication if the last blood culture drawn on or prior to the day of assessment was negative with no subsequent positive culture from a sample drawn after the first dose of the study drug. For patients with a positive culture at baseline from a normally sterile site other than blood, mycological eradication could be either documented (negative culture from the same normally sterile site on or prior to the day of assessment [ie, day 5 or day 14]) or presumed (assessment of clinical and radiological cure [for patients with evidence of disease according to imaging at baseline]) if a culture specimen from the infected site was not available. Mycological failure was defined as documented or presumed fungal persistence, change of antifungal therapy to treat candidemia and/or IC, or death from any cause before or on the day of assessment. Indeterminate mycological response was defined as the unavailability of study data for efficacy evaluation for any reason (eg, culture specimen or result not available or patient lost to follow-up). The TTNBC (for patients enrolled with a positive blood culture) was calculated as the time from the first dose of the study drug to the first NBC without subsequent positive culture. Blood cultures were repeated daily or every other day until the first NBC result for Candida spp. with no subsequent positive culture.

Critical Care 2021, 25 (Suppl 1): P038

Introduction : The Phase 2 double-blind randomized STRIVE trial (NCT02734862) examined the efficacy of rezafungin, a next-generation once-weekly echinocandin demonstrating a prolonged half-life and high front-loaded plasma exposures, in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis (IC). Early treatment outcomes and length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are presented.

Methods : Adults (≥ 18 years) with candidemia and/or IC were randomized to receive rezafungin 400/400 mg (400 mg once-weekly), rezafungin 400/200 mg (Week 1: 400 mg; 200 mg once-weekly thereafter), or caspofungin (Day 1: 70 mg; 50 mg daily thereafter) for ≤ 4 weeks. Day 5 overall cure and mycological success rates were evaluated. Post hoc analysis examined time to negative blood culture, blood culture clearance at 24 and 48 h, and ICU LOS (based on discharge from ICU excluding discharge due to death) data.

Results : The percentages of patients with negative blood cultures are presented in Table 1 along with early overall and mycological outcomes. At enrolment, 44% (80/183) of subjects were in the ICU, with a further 6% (11/183) admitted during the trial (microbiological intention-to-treat [mITT] population). Table 1 shows median ICU LOS data for each study arm.

Conclusions : Early treatment efficacy of rezafungin was demonstrated by the outcomes of negative blood culture at 24 and 48 h and day 5 overall response rate. A shorter ICU median LOS was also observed in the rezafungin group. These findings support the high front-loaded plasma exposure as a pharmacometric determinant of efficacy in patients with candidemia or IC in the ICU.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^a8edd216]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Echinocandins—spectrum, administration, and outcomes: Caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin are available only as parenteral preparations, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the echinocandins are low for most Candida species, including C. glabrata and C. krusei; however, recent case series have described treatment failures with resistant strains of C. glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis demonstrates innately higher MICs, raising concern it may be less responsive. Each of these agents has been studied for esophageal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis and has demonstrated efficacy, and pooled randomized-trial analyses in almost exclusively nonneutropenic patients suggest a survival advantage associated with initial echinocandin therapy. All echinocandins have minimal adverse effects, are administered once daily intravenously, and achieve therapeutic concentrations in all infection sites with the exception of the eye, CNS, and urine.

### Anidulafungin for the treatment of invasive candidiasis [^90d6b9cf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Candidaemia/invasive candidiasis (C/IC) is the most frequently occurring invasive fungal infection worldwide, with a particularly strong impact and high incidence in the intensive-care unit, where there is a need for new treatment options and strategies. The echinocandin anidulafungin has broad in vitro activity against a wide range of Candida species, along with favourable pharmacokinetics that allow administration in hepatic and renal impairment and with any comedication without the need for dose adjustments. The efficacy and safety of anidulafungin for the treatment of C/IC were demonstrated in a number of clinical studies and by some limited data from clinical practice. In a randomized comparative trial for the treatment of C/IC in adults, 76% of patients receiving anidulafungin and 60% of those given fluconazole were treated successfully (95% CI for difference: 4-27; p 0.01). Post hoc analyses suggest that anidulafungin is significantly more effective than standard-dose fluconazole for the treatment of candidaemia in critically ill patients. Anidulafungin is generally well tolerated, with commonly reported side effects including headache, hypokalaemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, abnormal liver function test results, and rash. In pharmaco-economic analyses, anidulafungin compared favourably with fluconazole (in terms of overall costs and hospital resource use) as well as with other echinocandins. Echinocandins, including anidulafungin, are now generally recommended as first-line therapy in moderately to severely ill patients, those with prior azole exposure, and patients with C/IC caused by Candida glabrata or Candida krusei.

### Anidulafungin versus fluconazole for invasive candidiasis [^4c845f1c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Anidulafungin, a new echinocandin, has potent activity against candida species. We compared anidulafungin with fluconazole in a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial of treatment for invasive candidiasis.

Methods

Adults with invasive candidiasis were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous anidulafungin or intravenous fluconazole. All patients could receive oral fluconazole after 10 days of intravenous therapy. The primary efficacy analysis assessed the global response (clinical and microbiologic) at the end of intravenous therapy in patients who had a positive baseline culture. Efficacy was also assessed at other time points.

Results

Eighty-nine percent of the 245 patients in the primary analysis had candidemia only. Candida albicans was isolated in 62% of the 245 patients. In vitro fluconazole resistance was infrequent. Most of the patients (97%) did not have neutropenia. At the end of intravenous therapy, treatment was successful in 75.6% of patients treated with anidulafungin, as compared with 60.2% of those treated with fluconazole (difference, 15.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9 to 27.0). The results were similar for other efficacy end points. The statistical analyses failed to show a "center effect"; when data from the site enrolling the largest number of patients were removed, success rates at the end of intravenous therapy were 73.2% in the anidulafungin group and 61.1% in the fluconazole group (difference, 12.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.1 to 25.3). The frequency and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups. The rate of death from all causes was 31% in the fluconazole group and 23% in the anidulafungin group (P=0.13).

Conclusions

Anidulafungin was shown to be noninferior to fluconazole in the treatment of invasive candidiasis. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00056368 [ClinicalTrials.gov]).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^cdcb9a5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis antifungal selection—echinocandins have emerged as preferred agents for most episodes of candidemia and invasive candidiasis except central nervous system (CNS), eye, and urinary tract infections. This preference is based on a strong safety profile, convenience, early fungicidal activity, a trend toward better outcomes, and the emergence of azole-resistant Candida species, but the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species further complicates therapy and there are no good prospective data to guide therapy. Additionally, voriconazole is as effective as sequential AmB and fluconazole for candidemia, but few would choose voriconazole because there is little advantage and potentially greater toxicity compared to other therapies.

### Is fluconazole or an echinocandin the agent of choice for candidemia [^63d5479f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Candidemia is among the most common nosocomial bloodstream infections and is associated with high mortality, increased length of hospital stay, and significant economic burden. The introduction of the echinocandins in the 2000s has expanded the armamentarium against Candida spp and provides therapeutic options that are effective, safe, and tolerable. Although the Infectious Diseases Society of America favors echinocandins as treatment for candidemia in selected settings (at least as initial therapy), there remain divergent opinions about whether an echinocandin or fluconazole is the preferred agent for candidemia, and clinical practice guidelines are in flux. In this review, the currently available laboratory and clinical data are summarized and critically evaluated.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was performed using the search terms echinocandin, fluconazole, and candidemia. References of review articles and guidelines were also screened for inclusion.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies whose primary goal was to compare echinocandins with fluconazole were evaluated as well as studies that differentiated pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties between agents.

Data Synthesis

It is clear that echinocandins and fluconazole each have roles in the management of candidemia. Specific recommendations are provided that will hopefully optimize outcomes in candidemia while incorporating stewardship concepts of cost-effectiveness and limiting the emergence of resistance.

Conclusions

Despite the advantages brought by the echinocandins and fluconazole, outcomes among patients with candidemia remain suboptimal. Improved treatment of candidemia may ultimately be achieved by optimizing the use of antifungal agents rather than the development of new drugs.

### Anidulafungin compared with fluconazole in severely ill patients with candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis: support for the 2009 IDSA treatment guidelines for candidiasis [^3664243e]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

During the past decade, the incidence of Candida infections in hospitalized patients has increased, with fluconazole being the most commonly prescribed systemic antifungal agent for these infections. However, the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) candidiasis guidelines recommend an echinocandin for the treatment of candidemia/invasive candidiasis in patients who are considered to be "moderately severe or severely" ill. To validate these guidelines, clinical trial data were reviewed.

Methods

A secondary analysis of data from a previously published prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed; it compared anidulafungin with fluconazole for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and candidemia. Patients with critical illness were identified at study entry by using the following criteria: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of ≥ 15, evidence of severe sepsis (sepsis and one or more end-organ dysfunctions) present, and/or patient was in intensive care. Global response rates were compared at the end of intravenous study treatment (the primary end point of the original study) and all-cause mortality at 14 and 28 days from study entry in this group.

Results

The patients (163 (66.5%) of 245) fulfilled at least one criterion for critical illness (anidulafungin, n = 89; fluconazole, n = 74). No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups. The global response rate was 70.8% for anidulafungin and 54.1% for fluconazole (P = 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0 to 31.5); all-cause mortality was 10.1% versus 20.3% at 14 days (P = 0.08; 95% CI, -0.9 to 21.3) and was 20.2% versus 24.3% at 28 days (P = 0.57; 95% CI, -8.8 to 17.0) for anidulafungin and fluconazole, respectively.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, anidulafungin was more effective than fluconazole for treatment of severely ill patients with candidemia, thus supporting the 2009 IDSA guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^7ccdb78b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candidemia pharmacotherapy—azole and amphotericin B roles are outlined as follows: Voriconazole does not provide predictable activity against fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, but it fills an important niche for fluconazole-resistant isolates of C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, or C. glabrata that are voriconazole susceptible and suitable for transition from an echinocandin or amphotericin B (AmB) to oral therapy. There is little role for oral itraconazole for candidemia, and although posaconazole has excellent in vitro activity, currently there is no role for posaconazole in the treatment of candidemia; isavuconazole shows similar in vitro activity and could prove useful in the future. AmB has broad activity against all Candida species except C. lusitaniae, and liposomal AmB, 3 mg/kg daily, has been shown to be as effective as micafungin for treatment of candidemia. Echinocandin-resistant and echinocandin-/azole-resistant Candida isolates, especially C. glabrata, have been documented, fluconazole resistance is frequent among echinocandin-resistant isolates, and the Expert Panel favors lipid formulation AmB for proven or suspected fluconazole and echinocandin-resistant strains until more data are available.

IDSA 2016—candidemia in nonneutropenic patients initial therapy and alternatives—An echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then 50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) is recommended as initial therapy (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Fluconazole, intravenous or oral, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily is an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin as initial therapy in selected patients, including those who are not critically ill and who are considered unlikely to have a fluconazole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is a reasonable alternative if there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence), and among patients with suspected azole- and echinocandin-resistant Candida infections, lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Voriconazole 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily is effective for candidemia, but offers little advantage over fluconazole as initial therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), and voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected cases of candidemia due to C. krusei (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^2a6b33c2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

### ECIL-6 guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis in leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [^496b800e]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

An update of the ECIL antifungal treatment recommendations was needed as there were important new data, and also because of necessary changes in the ECIL grading system so as to be in harmony with other ECIL recommendations. The most important data for invasive candidiasis came from a large review of patients included in 7 major trials.The multivariate analysis now allows a very strong recommendation in favor of an echinocandin for the first-line therapy of candidemia irrespective of the underlying predisposing factors. The controversy on the beneficial role of catheter removal can now be considered to be resolved. The most interesting new data were the publication of a first-line combination study in invasive aspergillosis and the results of a randomized comparative trial comparing isavuconazole to voriconazole. Aspergillus guidelines now include the results of these 2 clinical trials and should help clinicians in their treatment decision making. Since few new data have been published since the last ECIL guidelines, no major changes were made to mucormycosis management. Importantly, the posology and indication of antifungal agents reported in the current guidelines do not necessarily reflect those licensed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), but are the result of a consensus-based analysis of available literature within the ECIL group.

### Rezafungin (Rezzayo) [^fbfecc5c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis

The number of patients with an adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of study medication was 9.3% in the REZZAYO arm and 9.0% in the caspofungin arm. In Trial 2, patients with a history (or presenting with significant symptoms) of severe ataxia, tremor, or neuropathy or a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or a movement disorder (including Parkinson's Disease or Huntington's Disease) or currently taking a known neurotoxic medication were excluded from the trial.

Most Common Adverse Reactions in Patients with Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis

Selected adverse reactions occurring in 5% or more of the patients, who received a 400 mg loading dose followed by a 200 mg dose of REZZAYO once weekly are shown in Table 2 .

Less Common Adverse Reactions in Patients with Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis

The following selected adverse reactions occurred in <5% of patients receiving REZZAYO: infusion-related reactions, tremor, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dysphagia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fluid overload, insomnia, erythema, headache, dizziness, acute kidney injury, abnormal liver tests (including hypertransaminasemia and increased gamma-glutamyltransferase), peripheral neuropathy (includes neuropathy peripheral, polyneuropathy, and peroneal nerve palsy).

Tremors

Tremors were reported in 4/151 (2.6%) of REZZAYO-treated patients and none of the caspofungin-treated patients in Trials 1 and 2. All tremors developed in the second or third week after initiation of REZZAYO treatment and resolved within a month of onset.

### Invasive candidiasis [^9a446bc2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis is a collective term that refers to a group of infectious syndromes caused by a variety of species of Candida, 5 of which cause most cases. Candidemia is the most commonly recognized syndrome associated with invasive candidiasis. Certain conditions may influence the likelihood for one species versus another in a specific clinical scenario, and this can have important implications for selection of antifungal therapy and the duration of treatment. Molecular diagnostic technology plays an ever-increasing role as an adjunct to traditional culture-based diagnostics, offering significant potential toward improvement in patient care.

New antifungals

Among new antifungals arriving through the development pipeline, Rezafungin and Ibrexafungerp have been evaluated within phase 3 clinical trials in patients with invasive candidiasis. Rezafungin is a new echinocandin with extended half-life and improved tissue penetration compared to other echinocandins. The main PK/PD parameters and spectrum of activity are described in Table 2. Rezafungin PK is not affected by age, sex, race, body weight (34–155 kg), renal clearance (9.3 to > 120 ml/min), continuous RRT, and impaired liver function (Child Pugh B or C). The PK/PD properties of rezafungin may advocate its use in IAC. Indeed, as it has been reported that IAC could provide a reservoir for the emergence of Candida resistance, considering the front-loaded exposure and higher tissue penetration, rezafungin may be associated with a lower risk of emergence of resistance compared to the other echinocandins. However, its half-life precludes dose adjustment before one week. Considering the dynamic process of PK alteration in critically ill patients, clinical studies are warranted to quantify rezafungin exposure at the onset of infection.

Ibrexafungerp inhibits the production of 1.3-beta-glucan through non-competitive inhibition of the 1.3-beta-glucan synthase complex. The main PK/PD parameters and spectrum of activity are described in Table 2. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal and mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. Excellent tissue penetration has been reported in the liver, lung, kidney, spleen, skin and bone. Regarding IAC, one murine model has confirmed excellent penetration of ibrexafungerp penetration in the liver with prolonged therapeutic exposure.

In addition to its interest in echinocandin Candida resistant strains, ibrexafungerp could be useful as an oral drug in replacement of azoles for de-escalation, especially when azoles are not well-tolerated. Ibrexafungerp is currently under investigation for step-down therapy after initial empirical treatment with echinocandins (clinicalTrials.gov number NCT02244606).

Future prospects

The characteristics of an ‘ideal’ agent for antifungal prophylactic use include (a) broad spectrum of activity - covering both yeast and mold pathogens - with low risk of development of resistance, (b) availability in oral and parenteral formulations, (c) low potential for clinically problematic drug-drug interactions, (d) low risk of acute and chronic treatment-limiting toxicities, and (e) predictable pharmacokinetics. Several molecules with antifungal activity with a novel mechanism of action are currently in various stages of clinical development. These new molecules tackle some of the shortcomings of the currently available aramamentarium.
Rezafungin, a second generation echinocandin with enhanced PK/PD pharmacometrics, is active in vitro against most wild-type and azole-resistant Candida species (including C. auris), Aspergillus species (including azole-resistant A. fumigatus and cryptic species) and Pneumocystis jirovecii. The drug has minimal risk of drug-drug interactions and has recently been approved for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. Its prophylactic efficacy and safety, when given intravenously once weekly, is currently being tested in a phase 3 randomized double-blind study versus a standard antimicrobial regimen (including fluconazole/posaconazole plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) in allo-HSCT recipients (The ReSPECT Study).
Ibrexafungerp, a first-in-class oral glucan synthase inhibitor (a triterpenoid), is approved for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal Candida infection. The spectrum of activity is similar to the spectrum of rezafungin, but also includes Alternaria and Cladosporium species. The drug is generally well tolerated with a low risk for drug-drug interactions. Ibrexafungerp has not yet been studied as prophylactic agent but has the potential for use in primary prophylaxis (similar to rezafungin).
The fungicidal orotomide olorofim is a potent inhibitor of fungal dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The drug is given orally, has a good tissue distribution and is generally well tolerated. Although olorofim has activity against a variety of mold pathogens (excluding Mucorales species) and dimorphic fungi, the drug displays no activity against yeast pathogens. As such, olorofim is not a good candidate for primary prophylaxis, but may be used for secondary prophylaxis in patients with well documented prior mold infections (e.g. scedosporiosis or aspergillosis).
Fosmanogepix (the active moiety is manogepix) targets fungal glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall transfer protein 1, inhibiting cell wall synthesis causing loss of viability. Manogepix has a very broad spectrum of activity covering most clinically important fungal pathogens. The drug is available as an oral and IV formulation, has a wide tissue distribution and displays linear pharmacokinetics. The drug has favorable drug-drug interaction and safety profiles. A phase 1 safety and PK study has been performed in neutropenic leukemia patients receiving the drug prophylactically. Given these characteristics, the drug has potential for being investigated as prophylactic antifungal agent.
Opelconazole is an azole with activity against Aspergillus species and other fungi including various Candida sp. (including C. auris), Rhizopus oryzae, Cryptococccus neoformans, Chaetomium globosum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Trichophyton rubrum. Opelconazole was specifically designed for inhaled delivery; the drug accumulates in the lung and has a long residence time in airway cells, potentially enhancing the ability of host cells to clear the fungus, both in treatment and in prophylaxis. Systemic exposure is very low (ratio of lung: systemic concentrations is ~7000:1), resulting in a low risk for drug-drug interactions.
