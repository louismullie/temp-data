## Question

If tsh is low 0.7 what to do? T4 is norma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a TSH of 0.7 mIU/L with a normal free T4, and whether this finding constitutes subclinical hyperthyroidism or requires treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this TSH value is actually abnormal and how to classify it. Then, I should verify the persistence of the abnormality because a single value is not enough. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis for a low-normal TSH with normal free T4. After that, I need to assess risk stratification by age, cardiovascular status, and bone health. Finally, I will outline management pathways for observation versus treatment, including when to image the thyroid and how to monitor over time.

> Let me first confirm the classification. A TSH of 0.7 mIU/L sits within the conventional reference interval of about 0.4–4.5 mIU/L, so technically this is not subclinical hyperthyroidism, which requires TSH below the lower limit of normal with normal free T4 and T3; subclinical hyperthyroidism is typically defined as TSH persistently less than 0.4 mIU/L with normal free T4 and T3, and is further graded as detectable but low (about 0.1–0.4) versus fully suppressed (< 0.1) [^115nFvNi] [^116SUZCg] [^111trvZ4].

> Wait, let me verify the persistence point because management hinges on it. I initially thought "0.7 mIU/L is borderline low", but hold on, that's not correct. 0.7 mIU/L is not borderline low — it is unequivocally within the normal range, so there is no biochemical abnormality to confirm on repeat testing, though if there were a truly low TSH, guidelines emphasize repeating TSH (with free T4 and total T3) in 3–6 months to document persistence before labeling subclinical hyperthyroidism or pursuing etiologic workup [^117McmWv] [^112mMkjF] [^112MTEEc].

> I need to check the differential for why someone might have a low-normal TSH with normal free T4. In this case, since TSH is not below the reference interval, subclinical hyperthyroidism is not present, but if TSH were truly low, causes would include endogenous Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease, thyroiditis, exogenous thyroid hormone, and nonthyroidal illness. Importantly, central hypothyroidism presents with low or inappropriately normal TSH and low free T4, which is not the pattern here, and TSH assay interference or biotin use should be considered when results are discordant [^114fiaqB] [^115QehcY] [^115pVsK9].

> Next, I should review risk stratification because even when subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, treatment decisions depend on age, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and symptoms. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: treatment is generally recommended when TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mIU/L, and considered when TSH is 0.1–0.4 mIU/L in older adults or those with cardiac disease or osteoporosis; in younger, asymptomatic patients without risk factors, observation is reasonable, and progression risk correlates with the degree of TSH suppression [^117McmWv] [^1128JKhP] [^113Ak8pJ] [^114mrL9g].

> I will now examine management implications for this specific result. Since TSH is 0.7 mIU/L and free T4 is normal, no treatment is indicated, and no further thyroid-specific workup is required; reassurance and routine care are appropriate, with thyroid function reassessed periodically if clinical context changes or new symptoms emerge, consistent with general principles that minor TSH fluctuations within the reference range are common and often transient [^112wUhU4] [^114bqgrE].

> But wait, what if the original question intended a TSH of 0.07 mIU/L rather than 0.7 mIU/L? If TSH were persistently less than 0.1 mIU/L with normal free T4, that would meet criteria for subclinical hyperthyroidism, and I should confirm persistence, obtain free T4 and total T3, assess symptoms and risk factors, and consider therapy in patients aged 65 years or older, those with cardiac disease or osteoporosis, or postmenopausal women not on bone-protective therapy; in younger, low-risk patients, observation with repeat testing in 3–6 months is acceptable, and if etiology is unclear, a thyroid uptake scan can distinguish Graves' disease from nodular autonomy or thyroiditis [^117McmWv] [^1111b4h5] [^113Ak8pJ] [^114fiaqB].

> Let me reconsider monitoring cadence to ensure I'm aligned with best practice. For a TSH of 0.7 mIU/L with normal free T4, routine primary care follow-up is sufficient. If symptoms or risk factors evolve, recheck TSH and free T4, and if subclinical hyperthyroidism were ever suspected, repeat testing in 3–6 months to confirm persistence before pursuing imaging or therapy is advised, with closer intervals for high-risk patients [^117McmWv] [^113Ak8pJ].

> In summary, I should double-check that my conclusion matches the data: a TSH of 0.7 mIU/L with normal free T4 is euthyroid and does not represent subclinical hyperthyroidism. No treatment or additional thyroid evaluation is needed, though clinical context can always prompt reassessment if symptoms, medications, or risk factors change [^115nFvNi] [^111trvZ4].

---

A TSH of 0.7 mIU/L with normal free T4 is **not subclinical hyperthyroidism** and does not require treatment. This pattern is common and usually reflects normal thyroid function or transient TSH suppression. Confirm persistence with a repeat TSH in 3–6 months [^117McmWv]; if stable, no further action is needed. Only consider evaluation if TSH is persistently < 0.1 mIU/L, or if the patient is ≥ 65, has cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism [^117McmWv] [^1111b4h5]. No treatment is indicated for TSH 0.7 mIU/L with normal free T4.

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a **TSH below the reference range** with normal free T4 and free T3 [^115nFvNi]. A TSH of 0.7 mIU/L is within the typical reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) and therefore does not meet this definition. This pattern is common and usually reflects normal thyroid function or transient TSH suppression [^114fiaqB].

---

## Recommended clinical approach

### Initial evaluation

During the initial evaluation, **confirm persistence** by repeating TSH in 3–6 months to ensure stability, and **review medications and supplements** — such as glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, and biotin — that can transiently suppress TSH [^114fiaqB]. Also assess for hyperthyroid symptoms (palpitations, weight loss, anxiety, tremor) and signs (tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis) [^111TPnZE].

---

### Indications for further testing

Further testing is indicated only if any of the following are present:

- **Persistent TSH suppression**: TSH persistently < 0.1 mIU/L on repeat testing [^112mMkjF].

- **High-risk patients**: Age ≥ 65, cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic patients [^1128JKhP].

- **Suspicion of thyroid disease**: Clinical or ultrasound evidence of goiter, nodules, or thyroid eye disease [^112fdxjj].

If indicated, obtain **free T3, thyroid antibodies (TSH receptor antibody, anti-TPO), and a thyroid ultrasound**; consider a radioactive iodine uptake scan if hyperthyroidism is confirmed [^116m4Kw3].

---

## Management strategies

### Observation and monitoring

For TSH 0.7 mIU/L with normal free T4, **observation and periodic monitoring** are appropriate:

- **Repeat TSH**: Recheck in 3–6 months to confirm stability [^112MTEEc].

- **Annual monitoring**: If stable, annual TSH and free T4 are sufficient.

- **Patient education**: Explain results and advise on symptoms or changes to report [^notfound].

---

### When to consider treatment

Treatment is **not indicated** for TSH 0.7 mIU/L with normal free T4. Consider treatment only if:

- **Persistent TSH suppression**: TSH < 0.1 mIU/L on repeat testing [^112mMkjF].

- **High-risk patients**: Age ≥ 65, cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic patients [^112mMkjF].

- **Confirmed hyperthyroidism**: Elevated free T4 or free T3, or positive TSH receptor antibody [^114fiaqB].

Treatment options include **antithyroid drugs (methimazole), radioactive iodine, or surgery**, tailored to etiology and patient factors [^112PqCVC].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of intervention

### Risks of intervention

Risks of intervention include **overtreatment**, which can cause hypothyroidism requiring lifelong levothyroxine, and **adverse effects**, including atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and medication side effects [^112vewx1].

---

### Benefits of intervention

Benefits of intervention include **symptom control** for symptomatic hyperthyroidism and **risk reduction** in high-risk patients (elderly, cardiac disease, osteoporosis) [^112PqCVC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| TSH 0.7 mIU/L, normal free T4 | - Observe <br/> - Repeat TSH in 3–6 months <br/> - Annual monitoring if stable |
| Persistent TSH < 0.1 mIU/L, normal free T4 | - Further evaluation (free T3, antibodies, ultrasound) <br/> - Consider treatment if high-risk or symptomatic |
| Symptomatic or high-risk patients | - Further evaluation <br/> - Consider treatment based on etiology and risk |

---

A TSH of 0.7 mIU/L with normal free T4 is **not subclinical hyperthyroidism** and does not require treatment. Confirm persistence with repeat testing, review medications, and monitor annually if stable. Further evaluation and treatment are reserved for persistent TSH suppression, high-risk patients, or confirmed hyperthyroidism.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy — outcome evidence and degree of suppression: A meta-analysis supported efficacy of TSH suppression therapy in preventing major adverse clinical events with RR = 0.73 (CI 0.60–0.88), p < 0.05. A large RCT from Japan showed disease-free survival was equivalent with normal TSH (0.4–5 mU/L) compared with LT4 suppression therapy (TSH < 0.01 mU/L). Retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L may improve outcomes in high-risk patients, with no such evidence of benefit in low-risk patients, and higher degrees of suppression to < 0.03 mU/L may offer no additional benefit. In a prospective, nonrandomized cohort study of 2936 patients, overall survival improved significantly when TSH was suppressed to undetectable levels in NTCTCSG stage III or IV disease and to the subnormal to undetectable range in stage II disease; however, there was no incremental benefit from suppressing to undetectable levels in stage II and suppression of TSH was not beneficial in NTCTCSG stage I disease.

Discussion of the clinical literature — elderly hypothyroidism management indicates that in elderly persons (those older than 65–70 years) who are without known heart disease or without major risk factors for heart disease, LT4 therapy can be initiated at the full dose, although the method of starting with a low dose and increasing it slowly is still preferred by some experts. The final LT4 dose that normalizes the serum TSH is generally lower in the elderly compared to younger persons. In addition to the lower dose requirements related to T4 metabolism, the target serum TSH should likely be raised in older persons, especially the oldest old (patients > 80 years), and, based on current evidence, it is reasonable to raise the target serum TSH to 4–6 mIU/L in persons greater than age 70–80 years. If maintaining a regular daily schedule of LT4 therapy is problematic in an elderly individual, consideration could be given to a guardian or visiting nurse giving all the LT4 pills once weekly (or half the pills twice weekly), if appropriate.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115gXwoJ]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".

### Cost-effectiveness comparison between palpation-and ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies [^111iHqfE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There are two thyroid nodule management guidelines with global recognition: first is the management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer by American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines Taskforce and the second one is the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules. After identification of a thyroid nodule that is more than 10–15 mm, ATA recommends measuring serum TSH level. If TSH is low, a thyroid scan is next. For a hot thyroid nodule, evaluation and treatment for hyperthyroidism is recommended. If the nodule is not hot, the algorithm points to diagnostic ultrasonography. The flowchart directs again to diagnostic ultrasonography for euthyroid and hypothyroid patients with thyroid nodules. If a nodule is ultrasonographically confirmed, a cytological evaluation is next. ATA recommends ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (USG-FNA) for nodules with more than 50% cystic component and for nodules located in posterior parts of the thyroid gland. Otherwise either palpation-guided (P-FNA) or USG-FNA is next. In contrast, as indicated in the abstract of their guideline, AACE recommends universal application of USG-FNA for all thyroid nodules ≥ 10 mm, except for subjects with a low serum TSH level and a hot nodule, in whom FNA is not indicated. Except for minor changes in the sequence of diagnostic steps, ATA and AACE thyroid nodule management guidelines differ only in the utilization of ultrasound guidance. All previous studies show that USG-FNA has higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy than P-FNA. A barrier for universal recommendation of USG-FNA might be its higher initial cost. The aim of this report is to compare cost-effectiveness between palpation- and ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies from a perspective of ATA versus AACE thyroid nodule management guidelines.

Pregnancy — management of maternal hypothyroidism and positive thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) patients: When a woman with hypothyroidism becomes pregnant, the dosage of L-thyroxine should be increased as soon as possible to ensure that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is < 2.5 mU/L and that serum total thyroxine (T4) is in the normal reference range for pregnancy; in TPOAb-positive pregnancies, serum TSH should be measured as soon as possible and if ≥ 2.5 mU/L, treatment should be initiated. Serum TSH and total T4 measurements should be monitored every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and at least once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. Total T4 increases predictably in pregnancy, with the reference range ~1.5 fold that of the nonpregnant range; the upper limit of normal for the first trimester is generally < 2.5 mIU/L with respective upper normal values for the second and third trimesters approximately 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/L. Serum TSH levels decline in the first trimester and rise after 10–12 weeks gestation.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^115eGybG]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Methods

English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism published between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

Conclusion

The presented stepwise approach to the care of patients presenting with an isolated suppression of serum thyrotropin focuses on the differential diagnosis, a prediction of the likelihood of persistence, an assessment of potential risks posed to the patient, and, finally, a personalized choice of therapy.

### Screening and management of thyroid disease… [^111TPnZE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

In 1998, the American College of Physicians published guidelines on screening for thyroid disease in patients seen by primary care physicians for reasons unrelated to thyroid disease. Screening can be useful to identify overt or subclinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. A sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone test is recommended as a screening test in women more than 50 years of age. If the TSH level is less than 0. 3 to
0. 4 μU per mL or greater than 10 μU per mL, determination of the free thyroxine level is recommended. Screening is not recommended in women less than age 50 or in men because the prevalence of unsuspected symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is low in these populations. Persons found to have subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and progression to overt disease.

The optimal management of patients without goiter or ocular findings of Graves' disease is uncertain, but the author recommends repeat measurements of TSH, T 4 and T 3 every six to 12 months. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are at increased risk for hypercholesterolemia and progression to overt hypothyroidism. The effectiveness of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain; three small unrandomized trials yielded conflicting results. Observation is appropriate for persons with TSH levels between 5 and 10 μU per mL. A TSH of greater than 10 μU per mL or a high antithyroid antibody titer is associated with an increased risk of complications, and levothyroxine therapy may be appropriate. In the author's opinion, a one-year course of TSH-suppressive therapy can be started in younger patients and continued only if nodule size has decreased.

In older patients, in whom thyroid supplementation may decrease bone mineral density or increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and cardiac hypertrophy, the potential adverse effects of TSH suppression may outweigh any benefit.

### Optimal thyrotropin level: normal ranges and reference intervals are not equivalent [^111fnSEQ]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified in an attempt to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism

If the TSH levels are less than the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within 4 weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed, with tests of free T4 and/or free T3 repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated. Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations or tremor or has tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately (while waiting for results). Often larger doses are required for treatment of hyperthyroidism (e.g. propranolol, 80 mg daily) than might be used for heart disease or hypertension.

Overt hyperthyroidism is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (Fig. 2). If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed, whereas a negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. An alternative method of distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis is with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, although the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism on the basis of Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist for management, which may include anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Painless thyroiditis or subclinical hyperthyroidism may be followed by monthly TSH and free T4 monitoring until progression to overt hyperthyroidism and/or spontaneous normalization of results, whereupon resuming TSH testing every 3 months can continue.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1111mzom]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 59 — initial thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets after initial therapy: For high-risk thyroid cancer patients, initial TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For intermediate-risk patients, initial TSH suppression to 0.1–0.5 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with undetectable serum thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH may be maintained at the lower end of the reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while continuing surveillance for recurrence, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation and undetectable Tg (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with low-level serum Tg, TSH may be maintained at or slightly below the lower limit of normal (0.1–0.5 mU/L) while surveillance continues, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients who have undergone lobectomy, TSH may be maintained in the mid to lower reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while surveillance is continued, and thyroid hormone therapy may not be needed if patients can maintain serum TSH in this target range (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112GQShE]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^113zpjp4]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 63 — TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) testing: In ATA low-risk and intermediate-risk patients who have had remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy and negative cervical ultrasound (US), serum Tg should be measured at 6–18 months on thyroxine therapy with a sensitive Tg assay (< 0.2 ng/mL), or after TSH stimulation to verify absence of disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Repeat TSH-stimulated Tg testing is not recommended for low- and intermediate-risk patients with an excellent response to therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent TSH-stimulated Tg testing may be considered in patients with an indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete response following additional therapies or a spontaneous decline in Tg on thyroid hormone therapy over time in order to reassess response to therapy and disease status (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent stimulated testing is rarely needed for those with NED, and the use of sensitive Tg assays may obviate TSH stimulation when Tg on LT4 treatment is below 0.1–0.2 ng/mL.

Thyroid cancer — thyroid hormone withdrawal and TSH targets before RAI (Recommendation 53) specifies that if thyroid hormone withdrawal is planned prior to RAI therapy or diagnostic testing, LT4 should be withdrawn for 3–4 weeks; liothyronine (LT3) may be substituted for LT4 for 2–3 weeks, and in such circumstances, LT3 should be withdrawn for at least 2 weeks, with serum TSH measured prior to radioisotope administration to evaluate the degree of TSH elevation (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). A goal TSH of > 30 mIU/L has been generally adopted in preparation for RAI therapy or diagnostic testing, but there is uncertainty relating to the optimum TSH level associated with improvement in long-term outcomes (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). A randomized trial reported patients received 30 mCi of 131 I and a 2-week low-iodine diet with no differences in ablation success at 6 and 12 months (range 91.0%–97.1% among groups) among those randomized to LT4 withdrawal for 4 weeks (n = 89), LT4 withdrawal with LT3 for the first 2 weeks (n = 133), or recombinant human TSH with only brief LT4 withdrawal (n = 69).

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112PqCVC]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — management options, monitoring, and goals: The treatment of SH is similar to the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism, with radioactive iodine appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, while long-term antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with GD and SH, especially in younger patients. Some patients with SH due to GD may remit spontaneously so observation without therapy is reasonable for younger patients; a small subset of elderly patients with persistently low TSH and no evidence of true thyroid dysfunction can be followed without intervention, particularly when serum FT4 estimate and T3 are in the lower half of normal. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade may be sufficient to control cardiovascular-related morbidity, especially atrial fibrillation. Technical remarks state that some patients with SH due to mild GD may be followed without therapy with frequent (every 3 months) monitoring of thyroid function; in select SH due to TMNG with compressive symptoms or concern for malignancy, surgery is also an option; and the goal of therapy for SH is to render the patient euthyroid with a normal TSH. Data cited note stabilization or improvement in bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with SH treated, and reports of improvement in hyperthyroid symptoms with antithyroid drug therapy and after beta-adrenergic blockade.

Thyroid disease — biochemical characterization of hypothyroidism and resistance: Hypothyroidism is characterized by the relative or absolute reductions in serum levels of thyroxine (T4), and serum levels of total or free triiodothyronine (T3) are not reliable markers of hypothyroidism; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated in primary hypothyroidism but is typically low or inappropriately normal in central hypothyroidism due to pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary) disorders, and patients with generalized thyroid hormone resistance usually have high concentrations of T3 and T4 with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH and variable degrees of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid symptoms.

### Thyroid nodules: advances in evaluation and management [^116ZnosJ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant. After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration. The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring. Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^115KDSiz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

3.3.6 If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose) and a full re-evaluation carried out at the end of this period, with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed (2|⊕○○).

3.3.7 If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than to obtain an exact diagnosis, L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, then continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. By contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting (2|⊕⊕○).

3.3.6–3.3.7 Evidence

By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

3.4 Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH

Recommendations

3.4.1 For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, we recommend an immediate increase in L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% after a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test (1|⊕○○).

3.4.2 TSH and FT4 (or TT 4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose (1|⊕⊕⊕).

3.4.3 The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester and below 3 mU/L later in pregnancy (1|⊕○○).

3.4.1–3.4.3 Evidence

There is currently no specific evidence for treatment schedules in pregnant women with CH. We therefore refer to the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and The Endocrine Society regarding the management of thyroid disease during pregnancy.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115N9GwJ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypothyroidism diagnosis and initial management: We recommend measuring serum free T4 (fT4) and TSH to evaluate central hypothyroidism, noting that an fT4 level below the laboratory reference range with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112pWQ61]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

Congenital hypothyroidism — monitoring targets and follow‑up schedule: The monitoring of L‑T4 treatment should be based on both plasma TSH and FT4, with blood samples collected at least 4 hours after the last L‑T4 dose. Maintain TSH in the age‑specific reference range, avoid undetectable TSH < 0.05 mU/l, and aim for TT4 or FT4 in the upper half of the age‑specific reference range; adjust therapy accordingly and do not decrease LT4 based on a single high FT4. We recommend the first follow‑up 1 to 2 weeks after starting L‑T4, with intense follow‑up in the first year (every 2 weeks until TSH is completely normalized and every 1 to 3 months until 12 months). Between ages 1 and 3 years, evaluate every 2 to 4 months, then every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed; measurements should be more frequent if compliance is questioned.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is defined with TSH levels below normal range with normal FT4 and FT3. Prevalence of SCH globally is 0.7% to 1.4%. SCH can progress to overt hyperthyroidism in 8% of patients by 1 year and 26% of patients by 5 year. In populations with sufficient iodine intake, GD is the cause of 40% of cases of SCH. Baseline serum level of TSH, not cause of disease, is the best predictor of progression of subclinical hyperthyroidism to overt hyperthyroidism.

Treatment of SCH is recommended when serum thyrotropin levels are < 0.1 mU/L, in persons aged > 65 years and postmenopausal women due to association with adverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, bone loss, fractures, and dementia.MMI remains an effective and safe choice for SCH due to GD. For asymptomatic individuals aged < 65 years and a TSH level between 0.1 mIU/L and the lower limit of normal, observation is generally appropriate.

Thyroid Storm

Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism that presents with multisystem involvement and is associated with a significant mortality rate of 8% to 25%. Goals of treatment are to control increased adrenergic tone, achieve euthyroidism quickly and safely by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis, block thyroid hormone release, inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and reduce enterohepatic recycling of thyroid hormone (Table 4).–

Although all ATDs decrease thyroid hormone synthesis, the current ATA guidelines recommend initiating PTU in patients with thyroid storm as it blocks T4 to T3 conversion. However, recent data suggest no difference in cost, mortality, and adverse events for those treated with PTU versus MMI.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^117PTwm9]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism management — surgery for TMNG or TA — If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG or TA, patients with overt hyperthyroidism should be rendered euthyroid prior to the procedure with methimazole pretreatment (in the absence of allergy to the medication), with or without beta-adrenergic blockade, and preoperative iodine should not be used in this setting. If surgery is chosen as treatment for TMNG, near- total or total thyroidectomy should be performed, and surgery for TMNG should be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. If surgery is chosen as the treatment for TA, an ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy, or isthmusectomy if the adenoma is in the thyroid isthmus, should be performed, and we suggest that surgery for TA be performed by a high-volume surgeon. Following thyroidectomy for TMNG, we suggest that serum calcium or intact parathyroid hormone levels be measured, and that oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation be administered based on these results. Methimazole should be stopped at the time of surgery for TMNG or TA, and Betaadrenergic blockade should be slowly discontinued following surgery. Following surgery for TMNG, thyroid hormone replacement should be started at a dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 mcg/lb or 1.7 mcg/kg) and age, with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and TSH should be measured every 1–2 months until stable, and then annually. Following surgery for TA, TSH and estimated free T4 levels should be obtained 4–6 weeks after surgery, and thyroid hormone supplementation started if there is a persistent rise in TSH above the normal range.

2.0 Criteria for Diagnosis

2.1 Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration

Recommendations

2.1.1 We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is < 40 mU/L of whole blood, the clinician may postpone treatment, pending the serum results, for 1–2 days (1|⊕⊕○).

2.1.2 We recommend starting treatment immediately if serum FT4 concentration is below the norm for age, regardless of TSH concentration (1|⊕⊕⊕).

2.1.3 We suggest that treatment should be started if venous TSH concentration is persistently > 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal (2|⊕○○).

2.1.4 When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis (2|⊕○○). If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T 4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment (2|⊕○○).

2.1.1–2.1.4 Evidence

L-T 4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT 4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment if DBS TSH concentration is above this value. Given that the period between birth and the age of 3 years is a critical time for neurocognitive development, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L, carefully monitoring thyroid function to avoid overtreatment, and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located. Management remains a matter of debate for cases in which TSH concentrations are high, but to a lesser extent (6–20 mU/L), and FT4 levels are normal. The family should be informed that this is a "gray area" but that many clinicians would advise "playing safe" and treating during early childhood in this situation.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — TSH targets, supplementation, and suppression risks are outlined with on-page thresholds and outcomes. Prior studies suggest that if the TSH goal is within the normal range, about 70–80% of patients who undergo lobectomy can avoid thyroid hormone supplementation, whereas if the goal TSH level is 0.5–2.0 mIU/L, only 20–30% of patients who undergo lobectomy can avoid thyroid hormone supplementation. In active surveillance, for patients < 50 years a time-weighted average TSH > 1.74 mIU/L was associated with disease progression (defined as tumor volume increase ≥ 50%, size increase ≥ 3 mm, or new lymph node metastases), and serum TSH of 7 mIU/L or higher predicted tumor progression. Among 771 low- to intermediate-risk total thyroidectomy patients, 5.6% had recurrence, 3.9% osteoporosis, and 2.3% atrial fibrillation, and patients with a TSH ≤ 0.34 mIU/L were at increased risk of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis; another observational study showed survival was lower when serum TSH was < 0.02 mIU/L.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^112QYPbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

Neonatal thyroid screening pathways — follow‑up actions after initial tests: Most programs initially assessing T4 only subsequently evaluate TSH concentration for neonates with the lowest T4 values (usually the lowest 10% of the T4 values for the day); if TSH concentration is high, the infant is recalled for evaluation and testing; repeat dried blood spot (DBS) specimens are collected if the T4 value is below a defined cutoff for gestational age; if the initial TSH was normal but repeat analysis shows TSH to be high, evaluation should be initiated promptly; neonates with a persistently low T4 in DBS tests should have serum FT4 and TSH determinations to confirm or exclude central congenital hypothyroidism (CCH).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^112vewx1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — Principles of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression state that the use of levothyroxine to maintain low TSH levels is considered optimal for papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, although data are lacking to permit precise specification of serum TSH levels. In general, patients with known structural residual carcinoma or at high risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained below 0.1 mU/L. Patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained at the normal range, and for patients at low risk for recurrence with biochemical evidence but no structural evidence of disease (eg, Tg positive, but imaging negative), maintain TSH levels at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Patients who remain disease free for several years should have their TSH levels maintained within the reference range. Given the potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine — including cardiac tachyarrhythmias (especially in the elderly) and bone demineralization (particularly in post-menopausal women) as well as frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis — the risks and benefits of TSH-suppressive therapy must be balanced for each individual patient. Patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed should be counseled to ensure adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Nontoxic goiter — nonsurgical treatment includes iodine replacement, suppressive T4 therapy, and radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation; in an iodine-sufficient region trial, suppressive T4 therapy (target thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] 0.2–0.8 mU/l) plus iodine or alone decreased thyroid volume at 1 year, but has low efficacy with a temporary effect (regrowth to baseline within 2 years) and is associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, lifelong use, atrial fibrillation, and osteoporosis. RAI has long been used; in a randomized clinical trial of 131I versus T4 suppression, at 2 years goiter size was reduced by 44% versus 16%, and recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) enhances RAI uptake while adverse effects include transient posttreatment thyrotoxicosis, transient or permanent hypothyroidism, initial gland swelling (problematic in large goiters), and rare secondary malignancies. RAI is not appropriate with a suspicious thyroid nodule on imaging or cytology, during pregnancy or impending pregnancy, or if treatment or isolation constraints cannot be tolerated; in summary, RAI ablation may be considered for benign goiter in selected patients and T4-suppression should be avoided.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Unnecessary levothyroxine treatment of subclinical disease may lead to increased fractures and cardiac arrhythmias. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained. 1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2.

5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

1. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks.

9 Because hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and decreased bone mineral density, the American Thyroid Association recommends treating subclinical hyperthyroidism if TSH levels are less than 0. 1 mIU/L in two groups: adults 65 years and older and adults younger than 65 years who have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic hyperthyroidism. 2, 9.

Newborn thyroid dysfunction screening — scope, methods, and timing: Congenital hypothyroidism screening is performed routinely in all 50 states of the United States and programs are also being introduced in many developing countries, accounting overall for approximately one third of the world's population. Blood spot specimens eluted from filter paper are utilized, and the optimal timing of measurement is at 2–5 days of age to avoid confounding by the physiologic surge in neonatal TSH. Some programs employ primary T4 screening with TSH measurement when specimens demonstrate a value below a specified cutoff, whereas others use a primary TSH determination with reflex FT4 strategy. Newborn screening for hypothyroidism should be performed routinely on all infants, with blood spot analysis typically 2–5 days after birth. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Response to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, thyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms; the goal of retreatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid, patients with persistent, suppressed TSH with normal total T3 and free T4 may not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely, and in the small percentage refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be considered.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — TSH target ranges for treatment: In nonpregnant patients, the target range should be within the normal range, and data are lacking to support targeting low normal or subnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. If third-generation assay normal limits are unavailable, use the NHANES III reference population range of 0.45–4.12. In pregnancy, there are no prospective trials establishing optimal target TSH ranges, and the lower range of normal for serum TSH in pregnancy is generally 0.1–0.2 mIU/L lower than the normal range for nonpregnant individuals.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

TSH as systemic indicator and its limitations — During initiation of LT4 therapy in myxedematous patients, serum TSH correlated well with both the administered dose (r = −0.9) and the serum FT4 concentration achieved (r = −1.0), and serum TSH has been accepted as a robust, sensitive, and reproducible indicator of thyroid status. The logarithmic relationship between TSH and thyroid hormone means that even with circulating T3 and T4 in the normal range euthyroidism cannot be assumed, and individual ranges for T3 and T4 are broader than individual variance, making measurement of T3 and T4 a suboptimal way to assess thyroid status; however, a caveat is that TSH remains normal in some LT4-treated hypothyroid patients with a high T4:T3 ratio even when T3 levels are lower than normal range.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (treatment targets), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to assess serum free T4 to guide therapy in patients with central hypothyroidism, targeting to exceed the midnormal range value for the assay being used.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — central hypothyroidism targets: In the case of central hypothyroidism estimates of dose are based on 1.6 μg/kg L‑thyroxine daily and assessment of free T4, not TSH should guide therapy; determinations are best done prior to taking thyroid hormone, and the goal of therapy is generally to attain values above the mean for assays being employed.

Method of thyroid re-evaluation — For a precise diagnosis, L‑T4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period with re‑evaluation at the end including biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed; alternatively, L‑T4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks, and if TSH increases to ≥ 10 mU/l continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed, whereas if thyroid function remains normal the dose may be reduced further followed by retesting. By the age of 2 to 3 years, severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or high TSH levels despite treatment in cases of imperfect compliance.

Congenital hypothyroidism — evidence context for treatment thresholds: L‑T4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT4 or TT4 levels are low; the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/l, supporting immediate treatment above this value; given the critical period from birth to the age of 3 years, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/l with monitoring and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located; many, but not all, patients have permanent disease particularly when early TSH is high (e.g., > 100 mU/l) with normal FT4; families should be informed this is a 'gray area' and that many clinicians would advise 'playing safe' and treating during early childhood.

### Evaluation of thyroid hormone status: are simultaneous TSH and FT4 tests necessary? Analysis of thyroid function test results taken from the greater manchester care record 2010–2023 [^111gYAAK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge previous work suggesting that combined fT4 and TSH testing is not necessary, with the alternative being a two‐step approach based on first testing TSH. However, in this representative large community sample, we have identified a large number of people treated with levothyroxine who have a fT4 outside the laboratory RR.

There is variability in relation to the way that thyroid hormone status assessment is decided. However, the laboratory can lead on best practice. We here have provided evidence that thyroid function testing for individuals on levothyroxine replacement should include a check of fT4 as well as TSH. Such an approach, if adopted, can be enabled by the simple strategy of requiring the clinician requesting the test to state whether or not the patient is taking thyroid hormone replacement with a mandatory tick box.

Regarding cost estimates, while assay costs will be subject to some variation between laboratories, our estimate is for an additional £0.80 (Euro 0.93) of fT4 estimation to be added to TSH (£1.00) (Euro 1.16) for the cost of TSH alone, giving a total cost of £1.80 (Euro 2.09) for fT4 and TSH to be assayed together.

We accept that we do not have sufficient data to support a universal recommendation. Given the possible risks associated with prolonged exposure to high and low fT4 levels, we suggest that where indicated, fT4 and TSH should both be measured, in particular for those treated with levothyroxine, to enable thyroid hormone replacement dose adjustment as appropriate. In any case, if pituitary/hypothalamic disease is suspected fT4 and TSH should be checked in order not to miss pituitary insufficiency.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^115ZzzzT]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).
