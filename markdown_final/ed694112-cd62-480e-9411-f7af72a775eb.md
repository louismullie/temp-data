## Question

Elevated free T4 and normal TSH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an elevated free T4 with a normal TSH, including how to exclude assay interference and how to distinguish rare central etiologies from more common causes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical pattern and excluding pre-analytical or assay-related artifacts. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis for discordant thyroid tests and decide which entities truly fit this pattern. Next, I will outline a stepwise diagnostic workup, including when to image the pituitary and when to pursue genetic testing. Finally, I will consider management principles tailored to the underlying diagnosis and highlight pitfalls to avoid, making sure I double-check each step against current guidelines and reviews before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical abnormality and its implications. An elevated free T4 with a non-suppressed TSH is discordant because, in primary hyperthyroidism, TSH should be suppressed due to the inverse log-linear relationship between free T4 and TSH; thus, a normal or inappropriately normal/elevated TSH alongside high free T4 suggests either assay interference or a central process such as a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma) or resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTHβ) [^112AZiH6] [^11385f4o] [^114fiaqB].

> Wait, let me verify potential pre-analytical and assay interferences before labeling this as a central disorder. I need to check for biotin use, which can spuriously elevate free T4 and free T3 and suppress TSH in some immunoassays; I should ask about supplements and, if suspected, repeat testing after holding biotin for at least 72 hours and consider an alternate platform if interference persists [^1172q5sC] [^115uotdx]. I should also consider heterophile antibodies, anti-iodothyronine antibodies, macro-TSH, and binding protein abnormalities; repeating TSH and free T4 on a different assay platform, performing serial dilutions, polyethylene glycol precipitation, or equilibrium dialysis/ultrafiltration can help detect interference, and I must remember that euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia from high TBG or familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia elevates total T4 but not necessarily free T4, so I should confirm that the free hormone is truly elevated using a reliable method before proceeding [^11385f4o] [^112jhSYv] [^114fiaqB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also review clinical context and medications that mimic this pattern. Amiodarone commonly raises free T4 and lowers T3 via deiodinase inhibition, and in some patients TSH may not be fully suppressed, so I need to check for amiodarone and other drugs, and consider nonthyroidal illness or acute psychiatric states that can transiently alter thyroid tests; if the pattern is medication- or illness-related, I should avoid over-calling a central disorder and instead repeat testing after the confounder resolves [^113XpJMe].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis that truly fits "elevated free T4 with non-suppressed TSH" after excluding artifacts. The two principal central etiologies are TSHoma and RTHβ; both are rare, with TSHoma prevalence around 2.8 per million and RTHβ documented in hundreds of families worldwide, and neither the age/gender profile nor the magnitude of hormone elevation reliably distinguishes them, so I must rely on targeted testing rather than phenotype alone [^11385f4o] [^115N9GwJ]. But wait, what if the patient is on levothyroxine? Poor compliance or supraphysiologic dosing can yield high free T4 with variable TSH, and rarely coexisting RTHβ plus autoimmune hypothyroidism complicates interpretation, so I should confirm adherence and dosing before attributing the pattern to a central cause [^111yC7gv].

> I will now examine the initial confirmatory laboratory strategy. I should repeat TSH and free T4 on a different platform, add total T3, measure sex hormone–binding globulin and consider SHBG as a marker of tissue thyrotoxicosis, and check an alpha-subunit and calculate the alpha-subunit/TSH molar ratio; a ratio greater than 1 supports TSHoma, though I need to remember this is less useful in postmenopausal women, and I should integrate this with imaging rather than using it in isolation [^115N9GwJ]. Let me double-check that I also plan to assess for clinical clues of hyperthyroidism versus euthyroidism, because patients with TSHoma are more often frankly hyperthyroid, whereas RTHβ patients are frequently euthyroid or have variable symptoms, which can guide pretest probabilities before advanced testing [^11385f4o].

> Next, I should review dynamic endocrine testing, but I need to ensure I choose tests available locally and appropriate to the patient. A thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test can help: an exaggerated or normal TSH rise favors RTHβ, whereas a blunted response favors TSHoma, though TRH is not available in many countries and there is a gray zone of 3–5 fold responses that are indeterminate, so I should interpret results cautiously and in context [^11385f4o]. Alternatively, a T3 suppression test can be informative, but I must avoid it in older adults or those with cardiac disease or psychiatric instability; even then, overlap exists, so no discrete cutoff perfectly separates RTHβ from TSHoma, reinforcing the need to synthesize all data rather than rely on a single test [^11385f4o].

> Hold on, I should verify when to image the pituitary. If central etiologies remain plausible after excluding assay interference and the initial labs support a central process, I should obtain a pituitary MRI with contrast; however, I must remember that up to a quarter of TSHomas present as microadenomas and that incidental pituitary lesions are common, so imaging must be interpreted alongside biochemical and clinical data to avoid misattribution [^11385f4o]. Let me reconsider: if the biochemical pattern is convincingly explained by interference or medication, I should avoid unnecessary imaging and instead address the confounder and repeat testing [^11385f4o].

> I need to ensure I consider genetic testing when RTHβ is suspected. Sequencing of THRB is appropriate when family members have discordant thyroid tests or when the phenotype and dynamic testing support resistance; importantly, I should confirm segregation of variants within affected relatives when possible to avoid misclassification, and I should be prepared to interpret variants of uncertain significance with caution [^112oXwFz]. But wait, what if resources are limited? A targeted gene approach guided by the biochemical pattern can be economical, but as costs fall, broader panels or exome testing may be reasonable in select cases [^112oXwFz].

> Let me think about management principles, and I should confirm they are diagnosis-specific. For TSHoma, transsphenoidal surgery is first-line, with somatostatin analogs as adjuncts; I should coordinate care with a pituitary center and monitor free T4 and T3 to guide therapy rather than TSH, which remains unreliable early after treatment [^115N9GwJ]. For RTHβ, most patients are euthyroid and require no treatment; if levothyroxine is already in use for coexisting hypothyroidism, I should titrate to keep free T4 at the high end of normal for that family's RTHβ baseline and avoid overtreatment, with cardiac monitoring if doses are high [^113FvSzw]. For assay interference, I should remove the offending agent or use alternative platforms and avoid inappropriate therapy; for amiodarone or other drug effects, management focuses on the underlying indication and risk–benefit rather than altering thyroid-specific therapy unless clinically indicated [^112jhSYv] [^113XpJMe].

> I should double-check monitoring strategies to avoid premature conclusions. After any intervention or medication change, I should reassess free T4 and T3 at appropriate intervals because TSH can lag for weeks to months in both hyper- and hypothyroid states. In central disease, free T4 is the primary parameter to follow, and in suspected central hypothyroidism, a drop in free T4 by about 20% from baseline or movement into the lower quartile of normal should prompt treatment even if TSH is not frankly low [^112mXRxo] [^117Uf2Sh]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to follow TSH in central disease — no, that would be incorrect. I should correct that and anchor monitoring to free T4 in central etiologies [^112SDVCZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainty and avoid overtreatment. Many patients with discordant thyroid tests undergo unnecessary imaging, procedures, or lifelong therapy when a structured, interference-first approach would have clarified the diagnosis; over half of discordant cases in some series were misdiagnosed without such a pathway, so I should explicitly document the stepwise plan, discuss risks of false positives with the patient, and arrange follow-up to confirm persistence before committing to invasive or irreversible treatments [^1136Mkur].

Elevated free T4 with normal TSH is most often due to **assay interference** (biotin, heterophile antibodies, or abnormal binding proteins) [^1172q5sC] or **exogenous levothyroxine** (over-replacement or nonadherence) [^111yC7gv]. Less common causes include **TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma** [^115N9GwJ] or **resistance to thyroid hormone beta** [^11385f4o]. Confirm with **repeat TSH/free T4 on a different platform** [^112jhSYv], check for biotin, and review medications. If interference is excluded, **pituitary MRI** [^115N9GwJ] and genetic testing for THRB mutations are indicated [^112oXwFz]. Management is cause-specific: stop biotin, adjust levothyroxine, or treat TSHoma/RTHβ per guidelines [^113FvSzw].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Assay interference

- **Biotin supplementation**: Can cause falsely elevated free T4 and falsely normal TSH in immunoassays [^115uotdx].
- **Heterophile antibodies**: Anti-analyte or anti-reagent antibodies can distort results [^1136Mkur].
- **Abnormal binding proteins**: Familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia or TBG abnormalities can mimic hyperthyroxinemia [^114fiaqB].

---

### Exogenous thyroid hormone

Exogenous thyroid hormone most often reflects **levothyroxine over-replacement** or **intermittent nonadherence** with rebound elevation of free T4 and a normal TSH [^111yC7gv].

---

### Central causes

- **TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma)**: Inappropriately normal/elevated TSH with elevated free T4/T3 [^115N9GwJ].
- **Resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTHβ)**: Genetic THRB mutations causing tissue resistance and elevated free T4 with normal TSH [^11385f4o].

---

### Other causes

Other causes include **acute psychiatric illness** [^113XpJMe], **amiodarone therapy** [^113XpJMe], and **nonthyroidal illness** [^113XpJMe].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Step 1: confirm the abnormality

Repeat **TSH and free T4** on a different platform or with an alternate method (e.g. equilibrium dialysis) [^111h6Ex7].

---

### Step 2: exclude assay interference

- **Biotin**: Stop 72 hours before testing [^115uotdx].
- **Heterophile antibodies**: Use heterophile-blocking agents or send to a reference lab [^112jhSYv].
- **Binding proteins**: Measure TBG, assess clinical context [^115tWPPB].

---

### Step 3: review medications and clinical context

Review medications and clinical context for **levothyroxine adherence/dosing**, **amiodarone**, and **acute psychiatric illness** [^113XpJMe].

---

### Step 4: evaluate for central causes if interference excluded

- **Pituitary MRI**: Evaluate for TSHoma [^115N9GwJ].
- **Alpha-subunit**: Elevated in TSHoma [^115N9GwJ].
- **Genetic testing**: THRB sequencing for RTHβ [^112oXwFz].

---

## Clinical implications and management

| **Cause** | **Clinical implications** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Assay interference | False results; no true thyroid disease | Stop biotin; use alternate assays [^115uotdx] |
| Levothyroxine | Symptoms of hyperthyroidism | Adjust dose; ensure adherence [^112VJzEn] |
| TSHoma | Hyperthyroidism; mass effect | Surgery; somatostatin analogs; radiotherapy [^notfound] |
| RTHβ | Variable symptoms; often mild | Beta-blockers; adjust levothyroxine if treated for hypothyroidism [^113FvSzw] |

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up and monitoring should include **repeat TSH/free T4** after addressing interference or medication issues and **regular monitoring** for TSHoma/RTHβ per guidelines [^116Va2cz].

---

Elevated free T4 with normal TSH most often reflects **assay interference** or **exogenous levothyroxine**; after excluding these, evaluate for TSHoma or RTHβ using MRI and genetic testing, and tailor management to the cause [^11385f4o].

In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112LJbJr]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Methimazole (MMI) dosing for Graves' disease — At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of 10–30 mg daily are used to restore euthyroidism, and the dose can then be titrated down to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). The task force suggests the following as a rough guide to initial MMI daily dosing: 5–10 mg if free T4 is 1–1.5 times the upper limit of normal; 10–20 mg for free T4 1.5–2 times the upper limit of normal; and 30–40 mg for free T4 2–3 times the upper limit of normal; serum T3 levels are important to monitor initially because some patients normalize their free T4 levels with MMI but have persistently elevated serum T3, and adverse drug reactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155cNLx]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

fT4 is not the active thyroid hormone at the cellular nuclear level. The strong relationships of parameters, especially AF (risk increased up to 9 × across the normal reference range (30)), with levels of fT4 indicate that the active intracellular triiodothyronine generated by thyroid hormone transporters and deiodinases appears to be, at least in the heart, proportional to circulating fT4. Any discrepancy, indicating local regulation of thyroid effect, may be more prominent in more severe pathophysiological circumstances, and therefore more relevant in the circumstances of multisystem entities such as frailty, death, and metabolic disturbance.

Our results do not imply that no information can be gleaned from the presence of an abnormal TSH level. In the presence of normal thyroid hormone levels, such TSH levels indicate that the thyroid gland physiology is abnormal. However, for the function of other tissues and organs, the TSH level required to maintain a given level of thyroid hormones appears generally not to be relevant.

It remains possible too that additional analyses might find that TSH levels are providing an additional signal to fT4 levels, in some populations for some conditions. It has been suggested that TSH itself may have physiological effects apart from the stimulation of thyroid hormone levels, and such effects rather than via the reflection of thyroid status might explain such a TSH signal. Empirically, thus far, the evidence suggests that any of these TSH effects are small.

The association of thyroid hormone and particularly fT4 levels, rather than TSH levels, with clinical features has been noted by many authors, covering many individual parameters. In particular, the meta-analysis regarding AF noted the association with fT4 but not with TSH. Authors also previously found evidence of associations of clinical parameters with fT4 in the absence of an association with subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently diagnosed. One of these studies also showed associations with TSH.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement — serum TSH is widely used for diagnosis and screening, with age-specific interpretation needs; in newborns < 3 days of age results are confounded by the postnatal surge, while in newborns 3 days to 1 month a serum TSH > 20 mIU/L is generally treated as a clinical cutoff requiring immediate action; primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency; in the elderly the upper bound of the TSH reference interval increases with age; interpretation leverages the log-linear relationship between TSH and free thyroxine (fT4) and must consider factors such as iodine intake, age, sex, biological variation, reproductive status, ethnicity, and the assay method used.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^116NZHCj]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^112oXwFz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genetic Testing

DNA sequencing to identify variants in genes encoding circulating TH binding proteins (ALB, TBG, TTR) or mediating TH action (SLC16A2, SECISBP2, TRU-TCA1–1, DIO1, THRA, THRB), enables definitive diagnosis of genetic entities and disorders.

In resource-limited settings, we suggest that using particular patterns of discordant TFTs (as illustrated in Tables 4–6) to guide and inform the selection of specific candidate genes for sequencing can be an economical approach, especially for entities (eg, FDH, transthyretinemic hyperthyroxinemia, RTHβ) where most cases are associated with a restricted repertoire of causal or pathogenic genetic variants, localizing to a few coding exons. However, as costs of this technology continue to fall, it may become cost-effective to sequence panels of genes (eg, mediating hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism) or analyze the whole exome or genome of an individual.

Table 6.
Causes of raised (free) T4 and (free) T3 and nonsuppressed TSH

Irrespective of the approach, it is important to recognize that gene sequencing can identify variants of unknown significance. To avoid misclassification of variants and misdiagnosis as has been recently highlighted with THRB, it is important to show that the variant genotype cosegregates with abnormal thyroid function or phenotype in families. If this is not possible (eg, in sporadic cases or due to the unavailability of family members), modeling based on protein structures or even functional studies of a variant protein to establish its pathogenicity, may be required.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114PrnPb]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy-related thyroid function test interpretation describes that serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy, especially in gestational weeks 9–13, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit of normal for TSH in the pregnant population can be used. Free T4 and T3 measured in an equilibrium dialysis or an ultrafiltrate of serum may be slightly higher (5%–10%) than nonpregnancy values early in gestation, then gradually decrease so that late third trimester values are lower than in nonpregnant women. Serum total T4 and T3 reference ranges increase at a rate of 5% of nonpregnant values per week over the 10-week period of gestation weeks 7–16, after which this 50% increase stabilizes and reference range limits remain 1.5 times above nonpregnancy ranges over the remaining weeks of pregnancy.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115N9GwJ]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

### Is total thyroxine better than free thyroxine during pregnancy? [^113M6tvK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims were to establish a gestational-age specific curve for serum total thyroxine (T4) levels and to compare pregnancy outcomes of euthyroid women with those identified to have subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) defined by an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in conjunction with either total T4 or free T4 determinations.

Study Design

Over a 2.5 year period, serum thyroid analytes were measured in all women presenting for prenatal care. After exclusion of women with overt thyroid disorders, the normal distribution of serum total T4 levels were determined by quantile curves for those screened in the first 20 weeks and who were delivered of a singleton infant weighing at least 500 g. Pregnancy outcomes for women with an elevated TSH and normal total T4 concentrations were analyzed and compared with those of women identified to have SCH defined by normal free T4 levels.

Results

Of 17,298 women tested, serum total T4 increased into the second trimester and plateaued around 16 weeks. The upper threshold for total T4 ranged from 12.6 to 16.4 μg/dL, and the lower threshold ranged from 5.3 to 8.0 μg/dL. Women identified to have SCH defined by serum free T4, total T4, or both were at risk for preterm delivery (P = 0.007) and placental abruption (P = 0.013) when compared with euthyroid women.

Conclusion

When combined with elevated TSH levels, free or total T4 determinations are equally sensitive to identify women with SCH who are at increased risk for preterm birth and placental abruption when compared with euthyroid women.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy — monitoring schedule and dose adjustment: An assessment of serum free T4 and total T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks after initiation, and serum T3 should be monitored because serum free T4 may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3; serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months and is therefore not a good early monitoring parameter. Once euthyroid, methimazole (MMI) dose can be decreased by 30%–50% with biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks; once euthyroid on the minimal dose, evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and if receiving long-term MMI (> 18 months), the interval can be increased to 6 months.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^114rAP4D]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) frequency and causes — SH has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population; in older persons TMNG is probably the most common cause, with other etiologies including GD, solitary autonomously functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis. Other causes of a suppressed TSH with normal estimated free T4 and T3 include corticosteroid therapy, central hypothyroidism, and nonthyroidal illness. Once SH has been detected, it is important to document persistence by repeating the serum TSH at 3 or 6 months, and scintigraphic studies suggesting autonomous thyroid function would favor SH.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^114PyJnP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurement of circulating free thyroid hormones (THs) (thyroxine, T4; triiodothyronine, T3) and thyrotropin (TSH) using immunoassays is an essential step when assessing thyroid status, and produces characteristic patterns of thyroid function tests (TFTs) that correlate with classical thyrotoxicosis (raised THs, suppressed TSH) and hypothyroidism (raised TSH, subnormal THs), or deviate to generate anomalous or discordant TFTs due to different underlying causes. Here, we describe our approach to the investigation of patients with different patterns of biochemical hyperthyroidism: isolated, elevated free T4 [FT4] [hyperthyroxinemia]; isolated, raised free T3 [FT3] [hypertriiodothyroninemia]; combined elevation of FT4 and FT3 with nonsuppressed TSH. We review different categories of assay interference (eg, due to abnormal TH binding proteins, hormone displacement from binding proteins, antihormone (iodothyronines, TSH) or anti-assay reagent antibodies, biotin) causing spuriously abnormal hormone measurements. We consider some physiological (eg, T4 replacement), pathological (eg, nonthyroidal or acute psychiatric illness) and drug treatment (eg, amiodarone) contexts that are associated with this biochemical pattern, with other entities, outside the scope of this review, being discussed elsewhere. We outline genetic or acquired conditions that are associated with genuine hyperthyroxinemia (eg, genetic or functional deficiency of deiodinase enzymes), hypertriiodothyroninemia (dyshormonogenesis, resistance to thyroid hormone α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 [MCT8] deficiency) or both raised FT4 and FT3 (Resistance to Thyroid Hormone β [RTHβ], TSH-secreting pituitary tumor).

To exclude assay interference, we describe additional, simple tests that can be undertaken in many laboratories, even in resource-limited settings, and also complex investigations that are best undertaken in specialist centers. We discuss molecular genetic tests used to diagnose heritable causes of biochemical hyperthyroidism and nonsuppressed TSH.

Prismatic clinical cases, exhibiting different patterns of nonsuppressed TSH and biochemical hyperthyroidism, have been used to illustrate our diagnostic approach, which combines clinical, biochemical, and (if appropriate) genetic and/or radiological investigation.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1136Mkur]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We have reviewed patterns of discordant thyroid function (raised [free] T4 and/or [free] T3 and nonsuppressed TSH) due to entities causing interference with measurement methods or disorders associated with genuinely altered hormone concentrations. While we have illustrated the susceptibility of most current TH immunoassay methods to measurement interference, we recognize that this is a dynamic situation. Specifically, with manufacturers continually changing the architecture and biochemical conditions of their measurement methods, it is quite possible that their susceptibility to some types of interference will be eliminated, whilst exposing vulnerability to new or different interference mechanisms.

In our overall approach to evaluation of raised THs and nonsuppressed TSH, we have outlined an algorithm for differential diagnosis (Fig. 2), which we hope is both economical and applicable in resource-limited settings.

Figure 2.
Antibody interference in free T4/T3 measurement can be due to anti-iodothyronine or antireagent antibodies, and in TSH measurement due to anti-TSH (macroTSH) or antireagent antibodies Abbreviations: CH, congenital hypothyroidism; GFC, gel filtration chromatography; PEG, polyethylene glycol; RTHα, resistance to thyroid hormone α; RTHβ, resistance to thyroid hormone β; SHBG, sex hormone–binding globulin; SRL, somatostatin receptor ligand.

Finally, with one review suggesting that over 50% of cases with discordant thyroid function were associated with misdiagnosis, inappropriate investigation and management, the potential for preventing unnecessary costs and adverse health outcomes via a structured approach to this biochemical entity cannot be underestimated.

Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and TSH-mediated hyperthyroidism — diagnostic considerations are as follows: In the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance, a normal serum TSH makes hyperthyroidism unlikely, and "euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia" denotes elevated total serum T4 (often total T3) without hyperthyroidism due to thyroid hormone–binding protein disorders including elevations in TBG or transthyretin, abnormal albumin with high-capacity T4 binding (familial hyperthyroxinemic dysalbuminemia), abnormal TTR, and rarely immunoglobulins binding T4 or T3; TBG excess may be hereditary X‑linked or acquired with pregnancy, estrogen administration, hepatitis, acute intermittent porphyria, or drugs (5‑fluorouracil, perphenazine, some narcotics), and other causes include drugs that inhibit T4→T3 conversion (amiodarone or high‑dose propranolol), acute psychosis, extreme high altitude, amphetamine abuse; spurious free T4 elevations may occur with heparin therapy; when free thyroid hormone concentrations are elevated with normal or elevated TSH, further evaluation is necessary and, after excluding euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, TSH‑mediated hyperthyroidism should be considered, with a pituitary lesion on MRI and disproportionately high alpha‑subunit supporting a TSH‑producing pituitary adenoma, while family history and positive genetic testing for T3 receptor mutations support thyroid hormone resistance; heterophilic antibodies can cause spuriously high TSH values.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^111qM5wU]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT) is defined as a consistently elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with a free T4 (fT4) within the reference range. This diagnosis may lead to additional monitoring, levothyroxine therapy and increased patient concerns, despite lack of evidence of treatment benefit in older adults. In order to avoid this diagnosis, we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction, in older adults in primary care and compared it with TSH-based screening.

Individuals aged > 65years in primary care were selected for this retrospective study when both TSH and fT4 were individually requested irrespective of the TSH value. Exclusion criteria were C-reactive protein > 10 mg/l or a history of thyroid hormone monitoring in the previous year.

Screening based on fT4 instead of TSH decreased reflex testing from 23.8% to 11.2%. The positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism increased from 17.3% to 52.2%. The negative predictive value was 96.1% with TSH-based screening versus 97.8% with fT4-based screening. Elevation of the TSH cutoff value from 4.2 to 6.5 mU/l resulted in a reflex test percentage of 12.5% and a PPV of 31.0%.

Our results suggest that screening for thyroid dysfunction in older individuals in primary care can be improved by screening based on fT4 instead of TSH or by adjusting the TSH cutoff value. Adjustment of the screening strategy may be of interest to health policy makers because of potential cost reduction. From a patient perspective, medical concerns and unnecessary biochemical follow-up might be reduced by circumventing the diagnosis SCHT.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: deciding when to treat… [^112VJzEn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism Measurement of serum TSH is generally considered the best screening test for thyroid disease; increased values usually indicate hypothyroidism, and decreased values usually indicate hyperthyroidism. This test has proved to be both sensitive and specific. Its very sensitivity, however, may create a dilemma, since some patients are found to have elevated serum TSH levels, suggesting hypothyroidism, but have normal levels of thyroid hormone, whether measured as free thyroxine or free T 4 index. This state — an elevated TSH level with a normal free T. 4 level — is referred to as subclinical hypothyroidism. The term "subclinical" may not be strictly correct, since some of these patients may have clinical symptoms, but no better term has been proposed.

The elevation of TSH levels reflects the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to small decreases in circulating thyroid hormone; as the thyroid gland fails, the TSH level may rise above the upper limit of normal when the free T 4 level has fallen only slightly and is still within the normal range. Clinical manifestations, if present, may be explained by assuming that a T 4 level of 6 or 7 μg per dL, although not outside the normal range of 4. 5 to
12. 5 μg per dL, may represent a significant fall from an original level of 9 or 10 μg per dL and, thus, is low for this particular patient. 8 In selected cases, the risk of progression to overt disease may be closer to 20 percent per year. 9 Consideration of these possible outcomes affects the decision about whether to treat or to observe without treatment.

A common error is the failure to decrease the levothyroxine dosage if the TSH level is suppressed below the normal range, which may occur without the free T 4 level rising above normal. This state is considered to represent "subclinical hyperthyroidism, " and although formerly it was thought to be harmless, it is now believed to be associated with undesired effects on bone density and cardiac function, and to be a possible cause of neuropsychologic symptoms and other mild manifestations of hyperthyroidism. 16, 17.

### Evaluation and follow-up of clinically euthyroid children with normal free T4 and suppressed TSH [^1156QMVU]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

Although subnormal TSH between 0.1–0.4 mIU/L is fairly common and benign, suppression of TSH to < 0.1 mIU/L with normal free T4 is less common and more worrisome. We have conducted a retrospective chart review of a collection of such cases and have summarized the features and outcome on follow up.

Methods

We studied 23 consecutive patients referred from 2005–07 to our pediatric endocrine clinic with TSH < 0.1 mIU/L and free T4 in the range of 0.8–2 ng/dl. We collected historical, clinical and laboratory data, and analyzed their outcome.

Results

The natural evolutions of these subjects were separated into 4 groups. Group 1, 14 subjects, (61%) became euthyroid within a mean of 3.7 months. Group 2, 4 subjects, (17%) became hypothyroid within a mean of 2.8 months. Group 3, 2 subjects (9%) progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. Group 4, 3 subjects (13%) had persistently suppressed TSH, 8–14 months after initial testing, of which one had a multinodular goiter and had a thyroidectomy. Elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) was seen in 54.5% of those tested.

Conclusion

Only 2/23 in our series became overtly hyperthyroid. Substantial number of subjects had a short period of transient TSH suppression that resolved spontaneously. Markers suggestive of autoimmune thyroid disease were consistently seen in group 2 and less so in others. It is prudent to observe such cases in the short term with serial follow up TSH, free T4 and T3, and to reserve further testing and treatment for those who become symptomatic or do not resolve.

### Hypothyroidism [^113mkwj1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition in which the thyroid gland provides insufficient amounts of thyroid hormone for the needs of peripheral tissues. The most common cause in adults is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), but there are many other causes. Because most of the clinical features of hypothyroidism are nonspecific, the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the best diagnostic test; an elevated TSH level almost always signals primary hypothyroidism. Serum free thyroxine levels may be below the reference range (overt hypothyroidism) or within the reference range (subclinical hypothyroidism). All patients with overt hypothyroidism should be treated, but those with subclinical hypothyroidism do not always benefit from treatment, especially elderly patients and those with baseline TSH levels below 10 mU/L. Oral L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice because of its well-demonstrated efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Therapy goals are symptom relief and maintenance of serum TSH levels within the reference range. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening form of decompensated hypothyroidism that must be treated with aggressive L-thyroxine replacement and other supportive measures in the inpatient setting.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

Key Points

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care.
Adjustment of the screening strategy will reduce costs, unnecessary follow-up and patient concerns.
An alternative strategy is to elevate the TSH cutoff value; this also led to improved positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^113XpJMe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Approach to Diagnosis

Considering the clinical context is helpful when evaluating a patient with discordant thyroid function. For instance, objective abnormalities (eg, goiter, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, increased uptake on thyroid isotope scan) can suggest that the observed biochemical hyperthyroidism is genuine. Sedation with chloral hydrate (often undertaken in children) prior to blood sampling is a recognized cause of transient, reversible hyperthyroxinemia. Potential confounding factors, including altered physiological states (eg, pregnancy), intercurrent illness or concurrent medication should be considered (also reviewed in detail in).

Amiodarone Therapy

Changes in TFTs are almost universal in amiodarone-treated patients, with 2% to 24% developing overt thyroid dysfunction. The drug inhibits TH biosynthesis and pituitary type 2 deiodinase activity, prompting an initial rise in circulating TSH (1 week after commencement), which typically normalizes by 12 weeks. Subsequently, the drug blocks hepatic, type 1 deiodinase activity, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3 and breakdown of reverse T3, resulting in a TFT profile of raised/high normal T4, low/low-normal T3, and markedly elevated reverse T3. This pattern may be evident as early as 2 weeks after commencement of treatment and can persist after drug withdrawal, with the changes in TFTs being dose dependent. Due to inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, patients with amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism may require T4 replacement in supraphysiologic dosage to normalize TSH and therefore exhibit concurrently raised FT4 and TSH levels.

Nonthyroidal Illness

Prolonged or severe critical illness is often associated with abnormal TFTs; typically, circulating FT3 and FT4 fall (usually to low-normal levels), reverse T3 rises, and TSH values are low or low-normal. The degree of excursion in hormones is related to illness severity. Recovery is heralded by a rise in TSH with subsequent normalization of T4 and T3. Notably, changes in TFTs are not restricted to critical illness, with a low FT3, raised TSH and FT4 pattern being recorded in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery and in the weeks following myocardial infarction.

Acute Psychiatric States

True hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis can be associated with psychiatric abnormalities. Conversely, transient hormonal changes (typically elevated circulating FT4 with nonsuppressed TSH) are seen in patients (∼15%) admitted with acute psychiatric states, with this pattern being short lived, reversible, and not associated with a particular psychiatric condition.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^114Ub1fK]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111C2vCG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

We, therefore, aimed at determining whether or not a systematic review of the literature might indicate the relative merits of thyroid hormone levels and TSH levels, in terms of associations with a broad range of clinical parameters. Because of the strong negative population correlation between free thyroxine (fT4) and TSH, we expected to find associations between both TSH and fT4 levels and the clinical features of thyroid dysfunction. We further reasoned that if the clinical features were associated better with TSH levels, the current rationale for thyroid function testing and the current consequent clinical and research classifications and practices would be supported, but, if the clinical features were associated better with thyroid hormone levels, these classifications and practices would warrant review. In this latter circumstance, the previously noted associations of clinical features with TSH levels could be attributed to the aforementioned strong negative population correlation between fT4 and TSH.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1141dvkY]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — thyroid and prolactin assessment: Assessing thyroid function and prolactin levels is important in adolescents and women with FHA, and if a patient has more profound hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 100 ng/mL), she will require additional evaluation that is beyond the scope of this guideline; if TSH is low, one should consider a diagnostic assessment for thyrotoxicosis, especially if the free T4 is high, whereas if TSH is high, and free T4 is low or in the lower range of normal, then clinicians must consider subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism, and conversely, a normal or minimally elevated TSH with a low free T4 may indicate central hypothyroidism; in FHA, thyroid function is similar to that seen with any chronic illness, that is, TSH and free T4 levels in the lower range of normal, which generally reverse to normal with weight gain and psychological recovery, and evaluating basal pituitary hormones is usually sufficient to establish hypopituitarism while pituitary stimulation tests often do not determine the causes of the pituitary hypofunction; food, sleep, exercise, coitus, nipple stimulation, breast examination, lactation, and many medications can elevate prolactin concentrations.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### The clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^1151xyer]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease (SCTD) is defined as serum free T(4) and free T(3) levels within their respective reference ranges in the presence of abnormal serum TSH levels. SCTD is being diagnosed more frequently in clinical practice in young and middle-aged people as well as in the elderly. However, the clinical significance of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. Subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism can have repercussions on the cardiovascular system and bone, as well as on other organs and systems. However, the treatment and management of SCTD and population screening are controversial despite the potential risk of progression to overt disease, and there is no consensus on the thyroid hormone and thyrotropin cutoff values at which treatment should be contemplated. Opinions differ regarding tissue effects, symptoms, signs, and cardiovascular risk. Here, we critically review the data on the prevalence and progression of SCTD, its tissue effects, and its prognostic implications. We also examine the mechanisms underlying tissue alterations in SCTD and the effects of replacement therapy on progression and tissue parameters. Lastly, we address the issue of the need to treat slight thyroid hormone deficiency or excess in relation to the patient's age.

### Is an isolated TSH elevation in chronic nonthyroidal illness "subclinical hypothyroidism"? [^111brCgr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Elevated TSH with normal T4 frequently occurs with chronic kidney, liver, and heart diseases. Whether isolated TSH elevations represent mild thyroid gland failure has not been established.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed was searched for longitudinal studies in chronic heart, liver, or kidney disease documenting persistent isolated TSH elevations or progression to overt hypothyroidism.

Evidence Synthesis

Four articles met inclusion criteria. In 16 end-stage renal failure patients, four had isolated TSH elevations. All normalized within 14 months. In 452 systolic heart failure patients, 20 had isolated TSH elevations, five of 20 were persistent, and none progressed to overt hypothyroidism within 6 months. In 207 untreated chronic hepatitis C patients, 12 had isolated TSH elevations and four had increased TSH with reduced free T4; all were female, and 14 had positive antithyroid antibodies. After 1 year, two of 12 developed "clinical hypothyroidism". In 72 chronic hepatitis C patients, nine females had positive antithyroid antibodies. Two antibody-negative patients had TSH 5–6 mU/L with reduced free T4. After 1 year, three of four with positive antithyroid antibodies and baseline TSH < 4 mU/L had elevated TSH with reduced free T4.

Conclusions

In chronically ill patients, there is inadequate evidence to determine: 1) that isolated TSH elevations usually persist or progress to overt hypothyroidism; 2) the etiology and clinical significance of isolated TSH elevations; and 3) whether levothyroxine therapy is indicated for persistent isolated TSH elevations. Thus, isolated TSH elevations in chronic renal, cardiac, or liver diseases have not been documented to indicate mild thyroid gland failure.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care [^1157Sc4o]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Screening for thyroid dysfunction is frequently performed in older individuals presenting with fatigue and general malaise to exclude thyroid disease. The diagnosis of thyroid disease is largely biochemical. Hence, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) cutoff values, which vary significantly between laboratories, are important determinants of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment. Current screening guidelines for thyroid dysfunction in primary care suggest a TSH assay followed by analysis of fT4, if TSH results are outside the reference interval (reflex testing). TSH is a sensitive marker. Linear changes in fT4 lead to exponential changes in TSH. Hence, TSH has traditionally been the first choice screening test.

A consistently elevated TSH with an fT4 within the reference range results in the diagnosis subclinical hypothyroidism (SCHT). Although associations between SCHT and some areas of medicine such as cardio-renal metabolic disease are still under investigation, in older persons (65 years and over) SCHT is generally believed not to be associated with quality of life, symptom burden, physical or cognitive functioning, other diseases or mortality. Additionally, multiple studies have shown that older adults with SCHT do not benefit from levothyroxine supplementation. Still, in daily practice, the diagnosis SCHT leads to additional monitoring, unnecessary treatment and increased patient concerns.

Therefore, fT4-based screening to identify clinical thyroid disease would potentially be a more efficient screening strategy for older adults with possible symptoms of thyroid disease. This strategy could reduce costs and patient concerns. Several reports dating from the '80's and '90's have already suggested such a testing algorithm. Alternatively, TSH decision limits could be adjusted to reduce unnecessary reflex testing and thus reduce unwarranted monitoring.

In this retrospective study we evaluated the efficiency of fT4-based screening for thyroid dysfunction in older adults in primary care compared with TSH-based screening. Furthermore, the alternative approach of elevating TSH decision limits was investigated in parallel.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood [^111qrnmf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is defined as an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in association with a normal total or free thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3). It is frequently encountered in both neonatology and general paediatric practice; however, its clinical significance is widely debated. Currently there is no broad consensus on the investigation and treatment of these patients; specifically who to treat and what cut-off level of TSH should be used.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^117W8kM1]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

### Elevated free thyroxine and non-suppressed thyrotropin [^111h6Ex7]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A young man was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 10 years prior to current presentation after a random health screening revealed an elevated free thyroxine (fT4) of 36.9 pmol/L. During that time, he saw multiple physicians and was treated with carbimazole intermittently. His repeat thyroid function tests showed persistently elevated fT4 ranging 25–35.7 pmol/L and non-suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations of 6.78–22.1 mIU/L. He had a smooth, firm and non-tender goitre. At our institution, laboratory interference was first excluded by serial dilution study (TSH) and retesting of TSH and fT4 on alternate assay, which gave reproducible results. His normal α-subunit and sex hormone binding globulin, partially suppressed TSH by high dose triiodothyronine (T3), and positive TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation were consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome. The diagnosis was confirmed by direct sequencing of thyroid hormone receptor-β gene, revealing a heterozygous R320 L mutation that causes reduced T3 affinity and reduced corepressor dissociation.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^115tWPPB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (eg, abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (eg, resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered. We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### Consensus-based disease definitions for endocrine immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^115uotdx]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The biochemical assessment of thyroid function involves measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4) level and sometimes triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Interpretation should be made based on local laboratory reference ranges, and with awareness of local assay limitations. Limitations of free T3 assays include a lack of validation and robustness, when compared with free T4 assays. The measurement of total T3 is therefore preferred to free T3 in most settings. Specific assays for thyroid hormones and TSH may be susceptible to biotin interference, thereby leading to increased thyroid hormone levels and/or decreased TSH levels measured, depending on the assay used. To avoid biotin interference in susceptible assays, patients should be advised to stop biotin for a minimum of 72 hours prior to blood collection. Certain biomarkers such as antithyroid antibodies have been shown to be associated with higher risk of developing thyroid irAEs. The prevalence of baseline positivity of antithyroid antibodies such as anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, however, is high in the general population. As the study of biomarkers in thyroid irAEs remains an evolving field at present, the role of measurement of antithyroid antibodies in the diagnosis of thyroid irAEs is currently unknown.

Given the high incidence of thyroid irAEs, a proactive screening approach is recommended for the diagnosis of ir-thyroiditis. Most guidelines suggest assessing thyroid function at baseline and subsequently every 4–6 weeks, or with each cycle of ICI treatment. The frequency of testing should be tailored to the individual patient's clinical course. For example, patients in the thyrotoxic phase of ir-thyroiditis may require more frequent monitoring of both clinical symptoms and TFT, whereas those with established ir-thyroiditis and hypothyroidism, on a stable dose of thyroid hormone replacement months into ICI treatment, may be considered for less frequent monitoring.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism

If the TSH levels are less than the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within 4 weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed, with tests of free T4 and/or free T3 repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated. Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations or tremor or has tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately (while waiting for results). Often larger doses are required for treatment of hyperthyroidism (e.g. propranolol, 80 mg daily) than might be used for heart disease or hypertension.

Overt hyperthyroidism is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (Fig. 2). If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed, whereas a negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. An alternative method of distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis is with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, although the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism on the basis of Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist for management, which may include anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Painless thyroiditis or subclinical hyperthyroidism may be followed by monthly TSH and free T4 monitoring until progression to overt hyperthyroidism and/or spontaneous normalization of results, whereupon resuming TSH testing every 3 months can continue.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained.

1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. 8 Measuring TSH levels is also recommended as the first-line test for pregnant patients with a personal or family history of thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, or a clinical concern for thyroid disease. In pregnant patients with hypothyroidism, TSH levels should be maintained between the trimester-specific lower limit and 2. 5 mIU/L, and TSH measurement should be obtained every 4 to 6 weeks to ensure appropriate levels of levothyroxine.
8. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

1.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^1151wBvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T3 and T3/T4 Ratio With Nonsuppressed TSH

Some acquired or genetic conditions can be associated with high-normal/high circulating FT3 and low-normal/low FT4 concentrations, computing to a raised T3/T4 ratio, with normal TSH levels.

Dyshormonogenesis

Iodine deficiency, typically caused by a restrictive diet with inadequate intake of this element, can result in low circulating FT4 with slightly increased FT3 (due to preferential production of T3 over T4) and normal TSH concentrations, with chronic deficiency causing goiter formation. Progressive goiter, normal TSH, and raised circulating FT3 or an elevated T3/T4 ratio has been reported in the context of mild, dyshormonogenic CH due to partial, loss of function mutations in thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin gene defects, with hypersecretion of T3 being attributed to increased thyroidal activity of pituitary type 2 deiodinase. Increased thyroidal deiodinase enzyme activity in cases of metastatic follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer also mediates higher circulating FT3 concentrations and an elevated T3/T4 ratio.

Resistance to thyroid hormone α

Heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor α gene cause a disorder characterized by features of hypothyroidism, but associated with normal circulating TSH, low-normal/low FT4, high-normal/high FT3, and a raised T3/T4 ratio.

Monocarboxylate transporter 8 deficiency

Mutations in an X-linked gene (SLC16A2), encoding a membrane protein (MCT8) required for transport of THs into the central nervous system, cause a disorder (Allan–Herndon Dudley syndrome) with psychomotor retardation, elevated circulating FT3, low or low-normal FT4, and normal TSH concentrations.

Table 5 illustrates how entities sharing this pattern of TFTs can be differentiated, using a combination of clinical features and key biochemical measurements (eg, urinary iodine, serum thyroglobulin, and reverse T3).

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

True Biochemical Hyperthyroidism With Nonsuppressed TSH

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4

Thyroxine therapy, including with poor compliance

Variable compliance with T4 therapy in hypothyroidism can cause a biochemical pattern of normal or elevated FT4 and raised TSH concentrations. In this context, a seemingly appropriate increase in thyroxine dosage (perhaps to a supraphysiological level) can normalize TSH levels but be associated with concomitantly elevated circulating THs, raising the possibility of underlying RTHβ. Distinguishing this clinical situation from true coincidence of RTHβ with autoimmune hypothyroidism (which occurs rarely), is discussed further below.

Separate to this, it is also recognized that a subset of hypothyroid patients, compliant with thyroxine therapy in physiological dosage, can exhibit raised circulating FT4 but normal FT3 and TSH concentrations. This phenomenon has been attributed to diminished activity of type 2 deiodinase, reducing the generation of T3 (from its T4 precursor) that is available to inhibit pituitary TSH secretion.

Deficiency of selenocysteine-containing proteins, including deiodinase enzymes

Over 25 human proteins, including the thyroid deiodinase enzymes, contain the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). The incorporation of Sec into selenoproteins during their translation is dependent on a unique cellular pathway that includes its own transfer RNA (Sec-tRNA (Ser)Sec, encoded by TRU-TCA1–1) and a protein (SECIS binding protein 2, encoded by SECISBP2), which binds a specific sequence (SElenium Cysteine Insertion Sequence [SECIS]) located in the 3′-untranslated region of all selenoprotein mRNAs. Biallelic mutations in SECISBP2 cause a rare multisystem disorder, often presenting in childhood with growth retardation and developmental delay. Diminished activity of deiodinase enzymes and low circulating selenoproteins cause a distinctive biochemical signature of raised FT4, normal or low FT3, normal or raised TSH, elevated reverse T3 and low circulating selenium concentrations in all patients (Table 4); this biochemical pattern has also been documented in 2 patients with selenoprotein deficiency due to a homozygous nucleotide substitution in TRU-TCA1–1.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114444oN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) in hypopituitary patients — diagnostic considerations emphasize that low-normal free thyroxine (fT4) may suggest CH, but confirmation is difficult because there are no validated thyroid function measures in this population; studies have suggested that 10–18% of high-risk pituitary patients have unrecognized CH with low-normal fT4 levels, and suggested approaches for patients with low-normal fT4 levels include starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20%; serum T3 or free T3 (fT3) levels are generally not helpful, peripheral indices of thyroid hormone action lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity, and classifying CH based on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responsiveness to exogenous TSH-releasing hormone has not proven useful in clinical practice.
