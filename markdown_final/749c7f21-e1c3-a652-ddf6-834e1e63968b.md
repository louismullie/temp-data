## Question

Adverse reactions farxiga

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the adverse reactions of Farxiga (dapagliflozin). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality sources and how to classify adverse reactions by frequency and severity. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility and reconcile any conflicting data. Next, I will quantify key risks where possible and outline practical mitigation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful risk–benefit conclusion and highlight special populations and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative sources and scope. The FDA prescribing information is the primary source for labeled adverse reactions, warnings, and precautions, and I should prioritize those data while integrating large randomized trials and meta-analyses for context and precision of estimates, especially for events like DKA, genital infections, and volume depletion [^86f82988] [^8810247f] [^507fe0bf].

> I will now examine the most common adverse reactions from pooled placebo-controlled trials in adults with type 2 diabetes. Genital mycotic infections are consistently increased with dapagliflozin, approximately 4–6% versus about 1% on placebo, with higher risk in women and in those with prior history; urinary tract infections are also more frequent, though absolute differences are smaller and vary by pool, and both are mechanistically expected with glucosuria [^507fe0bf] [^0fb311a2]. Volume depletion–related events, including dehydration, orthostatic hypotension, and dizziness, occur in about 1–3% and are more likely in older adults, those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², or on loop diuretics; I should double-check that these figures align with DECLARE and the pooled glycemic trials, which they do [^507fe0bf] [^8810247f]. Other common effects include modest increases in hematocrit, nasopharyngitis, back pain, constipation, dysuria, and nausea, generally mild and self-limited [^3f0d12ce].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about DKA frequency without anchoring to large datasets. In DECLARE-TIMI 58, adjudicated DKA occurred in 27/8574 with dapagliflozin versus 12/8569 with placebo, yielding an absolute risk around 0.3% and a relative risk near 2.25; importantly, many events were euglycemic, and risk signals are far stronger in type 1 diabetes, where regulatory authorities have withdrawn the indication due to a markedly increased DKA risk [^8810247f] [^4d3464a8] [^16d5aefa]. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline summaries noting a roughly 3.4-fold increase in T1D, which it does [^e21dd694].

> Next, I should review serious but rare infections. Fournier's gangrene has been reported in postmarketing surveillance and is highlighted in boxed warnings; however, large outcome trials show extremely low event rates, and a recent review suggests no consistent increase across SGLT2 inhibitors, so the signal is rare and likely confounded by ascertainment and reporting bias; nonetheless, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for perineal pain, erythema, or swelling with systemic symptoms and act urgently if suspected [^e0593025] [^39b10790]. Urosepsis and pyelonephritis are also described in warnings; again, while serious events are uncommon, they mandate prompt recognition and treatment, particularly in patients with obstructive uropathy or recurrent UTIs [^d59b5827].

> I need to check renal and hemodynamic effects carefully. Initiation of dapagliflozin causes a predictable, reversible dip in eGFR of about 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m² within 1–2 weeks that stabilizes thereafter; this is hemodynamic and not indicative of structural injury, but I should confirm that atypical trajectories warrant evaluation for AKI, which the label supports [^8810247f]. Postmarketing AKI has been reported, though large trials generally show neutral or favorable renal outcomes; in DAPA-CKD, dapagliflozin reduced renal events, reinforcing that the early eGFR dip is expected and manageable with appropriate monitoring and hydration counseling [^8810247f] [^7b2cbbbf].

> Let me consider hypoglycemia risk, because this is often misunderstood. Monotherapy with dapagliflozin does not meaningfully increase hypoglycemia, but when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia becomes more frequent; in DECLARE, severe hypoglycemia was about 0.7% with dapagliflozin versus 1.0% with placebo, suggesting no excess overall, yet pragmatically I should advise reducing insulin or secretagogue doses when starting SGLT2 therapy to mitigate risk [^507fe0bf] [^e0593025]. I should double-check that this aligns with consensus pathways recommending insulin dose reductions around 20% in appropriate patients, which it does [^a0ac7985].

> I should confirm hypersensitivity and laboratory anomalies. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, are rare but documented; if they occur, dapagliflozin should be discontinued and not rechallenged, consistent with contraindications in patients with prior serious hypersensitivity to the drug or excipients [^9965b398] [^8810247f]. Increases in hematocrit reflect osmotic diuresis and are typically mild; clinically significant polycythemia is uncommon but may warrant review in patients with underlying hematologic disorders or hypoxia [^notfound].

> But wait, what about malignancy signals and amputations. Early concerns about bladder cancer were raised during initial regulatory review, yet subsequent large programs and outcome trials have not confirmed a carcinogenic signal for dapagliflozin; nonetheless, caution is reasonable in patients with active bladder cancer or a strong history, and routine screening is not mandated by labeling [^bae6fdc9] [^65bdd936]. Regarding amputations, unlike canagliflozin, dapagliflozin has not shown a consistent increase in lower-limb amputations in major trials; nonetheless, good foot care and vigilance for infections remain essential, particularly in high-risk patients [^7314e9bd] [^d17fd9b3].

> Next, I should review special populations and practical mitigation. In type 1 diabetes, dapagliflozin is not indicated due to excessive DKA risk; if considered off-label, it should only be done with specialist oversight, ketone monitoring, and clear sick-day rules, recognizing that regulatory authorities have withdrawn the T1D indication in several regions [^4d3464a8] [^16d5aefa]. Before surgery or prolonged fasting, hold dapagliflozin for at least 3 days to reduce postoperative ketoacidosis risk, and reassess volume status and renal function when restarting [^521586aa] [^d59b5827]. In older adults or those on loop diuretics, start low, go slow, and counsel on hydration to mitigate hypotension and AKI risk [^d59b5827].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations. Dapagliflozin is approved for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes in patients aged 10 years and older, with a safety profile similar to adults; use in younger children is not established, and the same infection and volume precautions apply [^286a8ee7]. Pregnancy and lactation are not addressed in the provided materials, so I will avoid speculation and simply note that SGLT2 inhibitors are generally not recommended in pregnancy and that lactation data are limited in animals, prompting caution and shared decision-making [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. The most frequent and predictable adverse effects are genital mycotic infections, volume depletion–related symptoms, and a transient, hemodynamic eGFR dip; these are generally mild, manageable, and often preventable with patient education and proactive measures. Serious events such as DKA, Fournier's gangrene, and urosepsis are rare but require vigilance and prompt action; DKA risk is materially higher in type 1 diabetes and in the setting of insulin deficiency, acute illness, surgery, or reduced caloric intake. Overall, in type 2 diabetes populations, the absolute risks of these serious events are low, and the cardiovascular and renal benefits of dapagliflozin in appropriate patients generally outweigh the harms when standard precautions are followed [^507fe0bf] [^8810247f] [^7b2cbbbf] [^d182c3f2].

> Finally, I should confirm practical monitoring and counseling points. Before starting, assess volume status and renal function, and review concomitant diuretics and insulin or sulfonylurea doses; counsel on genital hygiene and prompt treatment of urinary symptoms; advise holding the drug during acute illness, prolonged fasting, or before surgery; and consider ketone testing in patients at higher DKA risk. During therapy, monitor for hypotension, dehydration, and atypical changes in creatinine, and reassess renal function periodically, especially in CKD or elderly patients [^d59b5827] [^8810247f] [^521586aa].

---

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) has a well-characterized safety profile, with **genital mycotic infections** and **volume depletion** as the most common adverse effects [^3f0d12ce] [^507fe0bf]. Serious but rare risks include **euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis** (especially in type 1 diabetes or with insulin deficiency) [^4d3464a8], **Fournier's gangrene** [^e0593025], and **acute kidney injury** (more likely with renal impairment, diuretics, or elderly patients) [^d59b5827]. Hypoglycemia is uncommon with monotherapy but increases when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^e0593025] [^507fe0bf]. Routine monitoring of renal function, volume status, and ketones in high-risk patients is recommended [^d59b5827] [^27a1071c].

## Common adverse reactions

Common adverse reactions occur in **≥ 2% of patients** and are generally mild to moderate [^3f0d12ce]:

| **Adverse reaction** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Genital mycotic infections | 4.8–5.7% [^507fe0bf] |
| Volume depletion (dehydration, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension) | 1–3% [^507fe0bf] |
| Urinary tract infections | 3–5% [^0fb311a2] |
| Increased hematocrit | 3–4% [^notfound] |
| Nasopharyngitis | 2–3% [^notfound] |
| Back pain, constipation, dysuria, nausea, pain in extremity, urinary frequency | 1–3% [^notfound] |

---

## Serious adverse reactions

Serious adverse reactions are rare but require **immediate medical attention**:

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)**: Rare overall; risk is higher in type 1 diabetes or with insulin deficiency, and may be euglycemic (normal glucose) [^4d3464a8] [^e21dd694].
- **Fournier's gangrene**: Rare, life-threatening necrotizing infection of the perineum; requires urgent surgical intervention [^e0593025].
- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Rare; more likely with renal impairment, loop diuretics, or elderly patients [^d59b5827].
- **Serious hypersensitivity reactions**: Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported [^9965b398].

---

## Special populations and precautions

- **Type 1 diabetes**: Contraindicated due to increased risk of DKA [^4d3464a8].
- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of volume depletion and renal impairment; monitor closely [^d59b5827].
- **Patients with renal impairment**: Increased risk of AKI and volume depletion; assess renal function before and during therapy [^d59b5827].
- **Patients on insulin or sulfonylureas**: Increased risk of hypoglycemia; consider dose reduction of insulin or sulfonylurea [^e0593025].

---

## Monitoring and management

- **Renal function**: Monitor eGFR and serum creatinine before initiation and periodically during therapy [^d59b5827].
- **Volume status**: Assess and correct volume depletion before starting therapy; monitor for hypotension, especially in elderly or those on diuretics [^d59b5827].
- **Ketone monitoring**: Consider in patients at risk for DKA (e.g. type 1 diabetes, insulin deficiency, acute illness, surgery) [^d59b5827].
- **Patient education**: Teach recognition of DKA symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea) and when to seek medical attention [^d59b5827].

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Volume Depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Genital Mycotic Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

FARXIGA has been evaluated in clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in adult patients with heart failure, and in adult patients with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety profile of FARXIGA was consistent across the studied indications. No new adverse reactions were identified in the DAPA-HF and DELIVER heart failure trials, or in the DAPA-CKD trial in patients with chronic kidney disease. Severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were observed only in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Clinical Trials for Glycemic Control in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for FARXIGA 5 and 10 mg for Glycemic Control

The data in Table 1 is derived from 12 glycemic control placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In 4 trials FARXIGA was used as monotherapy, and in 8 trials FARXIGA was used as add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

These data reflect exposure of 2338 adult patients to FARXIGA with a mean exposure duration of 21 weeks. Patients received placebo (N = 1393), FARXIGA 5 mg (N = 1145), or FARXIGA 10 mg (N = 1193) once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population were male; 81% were White, 14% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 6 years, had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.3%, and 21% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 92% of patients and moderately impaired in 8% of patients (mean eGFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m²).

Table 1 shows common adverse reactions in adults associated with the use of FARXIGA. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on FARXIGA than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either FARXIGA 5 mg or FARXIGA 10 mg.

Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for FARXIGA 10 mg for Glycemic Control

FARXIGA 10 mg was also evaluated in a larger glycemic control placebo-controlled trial pool in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled trials, including 3 monotherapy trials, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy trials, and an initial combination with metformin trial. Across these 13 trials, 2360 patients were treated once daily with FARXIGA 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m²).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FARXIGA in patients with diabetes mellitus. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Infections: Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), urosepsis and pyelonephritis

Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Ketoacidosis

Renal and Urinary Disorders: Acute kidney injury

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity) were reported with FARXIGA treatment. In glycemic control trials in adults, serious anaphylactic reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions and angioedema were reported in 0.2% of comparator-treated patients and 0.3% of FARXIGA-treated patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of FARXIGA; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.

Ketoacidosis in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], events of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported in 27 out of 8574 adult patients in the FARXIGA-treated group and 12 out of 8569 adult patients in the placebo group. The events were evenly distributed over the trial period.

Laboratory Tests in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR

Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA causes a small increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR. These changes in serum creatinine and eGFR generally occur within two weeks of starting therapy and then stabilize regardless of baseline kidney function. Changes that do not fit this pattern should prompt further evaluation to exclude the possibility of acute kidney injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In two trials that included adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment, the acute effect on eGFR reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with FARXIGA.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There were no reports of overdose during the clinical development program for FARXIGA.

In the event of an overdose, consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. It is also reasonable to employ supportive measures as dictated by the patient's clinical status. The removal of dapagliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of dapagliflozin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Dapagliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). However, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data is not clear. Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women that use of FARXIGA is not recommended while breastfeeding.

Data

Dapagliflozin was present in rat milk at a milk/plasma ratio of 0.49, indicating that dapagliflozin and its metabolites are transferred into milk at a concentration that is approximately 50% of that in maternal plasma. Juvenile rats directly exposed to dapagliflozin showed risk to the developing kidney (renal pelvic and tubular dilatations) during maturation.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of FARXIGA as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older. Use of FARXIGA for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled trial with a 26-week extension in 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, pediatric pharmacokinetic data, and trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]. The safety profile observed in the placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of FARXIGA for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age.

The safety and effectiveness of FARXIGA have not been established in pediatric patients to reduce the risk of [see Indications and Usage (1)].

sustained eGFR decline, end stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit in patients with heart failure.
hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

See full prescribing information for information on drug interactions and interference of FARXIGA with laboratory tests. (7)

---

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^d59b5827]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue FARXIGA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting FARXIGA.

Withhold FARXIGA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume FARXIGA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue FARXIGA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

FARXIGA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating FARXIGA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. However, the benefit-risk for the use of dapagliflozin in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be individually assessed since the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied in this population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Other Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Volume Depletion

FARXIGA causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the 12-trial and 13-trial, short-term, placebo-controlled pools and for the DECLARE trial are shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hypoglycemia

The frequency of hypoglycemia by trial in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] is shown in Table 3. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when FARXIGA was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], severe events of hypoglycemia were reported in 58 (0.7%) out of 8574 adult patients treated with FARXIGA and 83 (1.0%) out of 8569 adult patients treated with placebo.

Genital Mycotic Infections

In the glycemic control trials in adults, genital mycotic infections were more frequent with FARXIGA treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on FARXIGA 5 mg, and 4.8% on FARXIGA 10 mg, in the 12-trial placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with FARXIGA 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 1). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the trial than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, FARXIGA 5 mg, and FARXIGA 10 mg, respectively). In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], serious genital mycotic infections were reported in < 0.1% of patients treated with FARXIGA and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Genital mycotic infections that caused trial drug discontinuation were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with FARXIGA and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. FARXIGA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with FARXIGA [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with FARXIGA presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue FARXIGA, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.6 Genital Mycotic Infections

FARXIGA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor and treat appropriately.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dapagliflozin PO (also known as Farxiga):
- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold dapagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating dapagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

### Dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^b083d6a9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and adverse effects of dapagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor.

Data Sources

Data were gathered from articles indexed in PubMed, International Pharmaceutical from (2006 to April 2014) was performed using the following terms "dapagliflozin", "SGLT-2 inhibitor", and "Farxiga". Abstracts and manufacturer's package insert were also used as an additional reference.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language prospective randomized, double-blinded trials evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes were identified.

Data Synthesis

We evaluated 9 clinical trials with dapagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy. Results from these studies demonstrated that dapagliflozin to be noninferior to metformin in treatment naïve patients for reduction in A1C. Additionally, dapagliflozin was noninferior to glimepiride when added on to metformin. As an add-on therapy to insulin, insulin sensitizers or sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was found to be clinically effective compared to placebo. Finally, in all of the clinical trials increased risk of urinary infection was common in dapagliflozin group.

Conclusion

As the second SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in the United States, dapagliflozin is safe and effective for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It appears to have no increased cardiovascular risk and provides a moderate benefit for patients with high blood pressure or those who are overweight. However, dapagliflozin was found to be associated with nasopharyngitis, mycotic infections, and genital or urinary tract infections. This medication may be best used as adjunctive therapy for patients not well-controlled on other antidiabetic agents. However, caution should be taken when used in patients at risk of urinary tract infections and dehydration.

Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin

A total of 808 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 10.5%) were randomized in a 24-week, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate FARXIGA as add-on therapy to insulin (NCT00673231). Patients on a stable insulin regimen, with a mean dose of at least 30 IU of injectable insulin per day, for a period of at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment and on a maximum of 2 oral antidiabetic medications (OADs), including metformin, were randomized after completing a 2-week enrollment period to receive either FARXIGA 5 mg, FARXIGA 10 mg, or placebo in addition to their current dose of insulin and other OADs, if applicable. Patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of background OADs. Up- or down-titration of insulin was only permitted during the treatment phase in patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals. Dose modifications of blinded trial medication or OAD(s) were not allowed during the treatment phase, with the exception of decreasing OAD(s) where there were concerns over hypoglycemia after cessation of insulin therapy.

In this trial, 50% of patients were on insulin monotherapy at baseline, while 50% were on 1 or 2 OADs in addition to insulin. At Week 24, FARXIGA 10 mg dose provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c and reduction in mean insulin dose, and a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo in combination with insulin, with or without up to 2 OADs (see Table 12); the effect of FARXIGA on HbA1c was similar in patients treated with insulin alone and patients treated with insulin plus OAD. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure relative to placebo in combination with insulin was −3.0 mmHg with FARXIGA 10 mg in combination with insulin.

At Week 24, FARXIGA 5 mg (−5.7 IU, difference from placebo) and 10 mg (−6.2 IU, difference from placebo) once daily resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean daily insulin dose (p < 0.0001 for both doses) compared to placebo in combination with insulin, and a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients on FARXIGA 10 mg (19.6%) reduced their insulin dose by at least 10% compared to placebo (11.0%).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Dapagliflozin has been evaluated in clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in adult patients with heart failure, and in adult patients with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety profile of dapagliflozin was consistent across the studied indications. No new adverse reactions were identified in the DAPA-HF and DELIVER heart failure trials, or in the DAPA-CKD trial in patients with chronic kidney disease. Severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were observed only in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Regulatory status of SGLT2 inhibitors

Different SGLT2 inhibitors, also called gliflozins, are currently marketed or are undergoing clinical development and approval procedures (Table 3). In November 2012, the first-in-class SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin (Forxiga), was granted a marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Dapagliflozin was initially rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) owing to concerns noted by an Advisory Panel about potential increases in the risk of bladder and breast cancers associated with the drug. In January 2014, FDA granted marketing authorization for dapagliflozin (Farxiga) after new safety data on dapagliflozin from ongoing studies were provided. The FDA required to perform several post-marketing studies, in which > 17 000 patients will be followed for 4–5 years to clarify whether dapagliflozin therapy is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular (CV) events, liver toxicity or cancer. Other post-marketing studies are required by the FDA to further assess bladder cancer risk and dapagliflozin's effect in paediatric patients. Furthermore, an intense pharmacovigilance programme to monitor reports of liver toxicity and pregnancy outcomes has to be implemented by the company. Canagliflozin (Invokana) was approved by the FDA in March 2013, and in November 2013 by the EMA. Marketing authorizations followed a positive opinion of Advisory Committees, but concerns about safety of canagliflozin remained, which are addressed in several post-authorization safety studies (please also refer to the section on safety of SGLT2 inhibitors for details). In Europe, canagliflozin is labelled with an inverted black triangle in the package leaflet and the summary of product characteristics (SmPC), indicating that the drug is under additional monitoring by regulatory authorities. On March 2014, the EMA recommended granting of a marketing authorization for a third SGLT2 inhibitor empaglifozin (Jardiance), and in May 2014 the European Commission followed the positive vote of the EMA. Initially, FDA rejected approval of empagliflozin in March 2014 owing to previously observed deficiencies at a facility where empagliflozin is manufactured, but finally approved it in August 2014. In Japan four SGLT2 inihibitors, namely dapagliflozin, ipragliflozin, tofogliflozin and luseogliflozin, were approved in 2014 (Table 3).

Other Adverse Reactions with Dapagliflozin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) for the 12-trial and 13-trial, short-term, placebo-controlled pools and for the DECLARE trial are shown in Table 4 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hypoglycemia

The frequency of hypoglycemia in adult patients by trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] is shown in Table 5. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], severe events of hypoglycemia were reported in 58 (0.7%) out of 8574 adult patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 83 (1.0%) out of 8569 adult patients treated with placebo.

Genital Mycotic Infections

In the glycemic control trials in adults, genital mycotic infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 4.8% on dapagliflozin 10 mg, in the 12-trial placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 3). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the trial than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg, respectively). In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], serious genital mycotic infections were reported in < 0.1% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Genital mycotic infections that caused trial drug discontinuation were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.

Conclusion

In conclusion, dapagliflozin has the potential to be a useful addition to currently available antidiabetes treatments as it lowers fasting and postprandial glucose levels, improves glycemic control, and causes weight loss with a low risk of hypoglycemia. However, data regarding longterm safety including urinary tract infection, genital infection, and cardiovascular safety are needed, and its place in the algorithm of T2DM management is still to be determined.

Summary and Therapeutic Applications

T2DM is a progressive disease with a significant impact on patients, society, and healthcare systems. The aim of treatment is to achieve near normal glycemia in order to prevent the development or slow the progression of microvascular and possibly macrovascular complications. Currently available antidiabetes treatments have many limitations, including hypoglycemia (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and insulin), weight gain (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, TZDs, and insulin), heart failure (TZDs), gastrointestinal side effects (alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin), and the need for multiple injections and/or self-monitoring (insulin, amylin mimetics, and GLP-1 analogs). Furthermore, due to the progressive nature of the disease, most patients will ultimately require multiple antidiabetes treatments to achieve glycemic targets. Hence, there is a need for new antidiabetes treatments that produce a sustainable impact on glycemic control with low risk for hypoglycemia and weight loss, and minimal need for self-monitoring. SGLT2 inhibitors are a novel class of antidiabetes therapy that are taken orally, result in improvements in glycemic parameters with a low risk for hypoglycemia, and are associated with weight loss. They have the potential to harness what has long been considered a manifestation of diabetes, glucosuria, and turn it into a therapeutic strategy. However, like other newer antidiabetes treatments, this class lacks long-term (including cardiovascular) safety data.

With such a plethora of options to treat patients with T2DM, the decision to use a particular drug, or combination of drugs, in a particular patient should be individualized based on the patient's specific risk-benefit balance and not solely upon a drug's perceived ability to lower HbA 1c. Metformin (in addition to lifestyle changes) remains a well-established first-line treatment for patients with T2DM, due to good long-term safety data, lack of hypoglycemia or weight gain, and evidence for cardiovascular protection. However, as metformin does not halt the progression of the disease, patients with T2DM are likely to need additional antidiabetic medications administered alone or in combination with metformin. Should SGLT2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, prove to have an acceptable safety profile they may have the potential to be administered alone or in combination with metformin or insulin. The lack of long-term (including cardiovascular) safety data and other outcome data may limit their use initially to specific/defined low-risk patient groups.

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. XIGDUO XR may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with XIGDUO XR presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue XIGDUO XR, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.7 Vitamin B12Concentrations

In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on XIGDUO XR and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Other Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the 12 trial and 13 trial, short term, placebo controlled pools and for the DECLARE trial are shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hypoglycemia

The frequency of hypoglycemia by trial in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] is shown in Table 3. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], severe events of hypoglycemia were reported in 58 (0.7%) out of 8574 adult patients treated with dapagliflozin and 83 (1.0%) out of 8569 adult patients treated with placebo.

Genital Mycotic Infections

In the glycemic control trials in adults, genital mycotic infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 4.8% on dapagliflozin 10 mg, in the 12-trial placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 1). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the trial than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg, respectively). In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], serious genital mycotic infections were reported in < 0.1% of patients treated with dapagliflozin and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Genital mycotic infections that caused trial drug discontinuation were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with dapagliflozin and < 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.

### Practical approach to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes [^c7d163a5]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Adverse Events Associated with SGLT2 and Concomitant Therapies

The overall incidence of AEs using dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, or empagliflozin varies between 57.3% and 83.0% in different clinical trials, which is similar to other antidiabetic drugs (e.g. with metformin it ranges between 36.6% and 81.0%). Most frequent AEs are infections of the genitourinary tract (including vulvovaginitis in women or balanitis in men), with a frequency between 3.6% and 9.0%. Patients usually experience only a single episode, mild in intensity, and that responds to standard treatment.

SGLT2 inhibitors, when used in monotherapy, are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia owing to their insulin-independent mechanism of action. Additionally, long-term use of SGLT2 inhibitors has been associated with a rise in plasma glucagon levels and increased hepatic glucose production. Interestingly, SGLT2-induced glucagon secretion is prevented by administering sulfonylureas concomitantly, thus explaining the risk of hypoglycemia with the use of these agents. The frequency of hypoglycemia increases significantly when SGLT2 inhibitors are used with a background therapy that includes sulfonylureas or insulin, compared to placebo. Reported frequencies of hypoglycemia using SGLT2 inhibitors vary greatly, from 6.9% to 43.2% with sulfonylureas, and from 29.2% to 60.4% with insulin. AEs are more likely to occur during the first few days or weeks of treatment.

Reducing the insulin dose has also been associated with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in May 2015 about the potential risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors and, in February 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) established recommendations to reduce the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis reported in these patients. Nevertheless, the warning and recommendations come from case series with few patients, mainly those with type 1 diabetes who are insulin deficient. To date, the cause of the higher frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with T2DM is unclear and requires further investigation. Recent studies have reported that SGLT2 inhibitors in pancreatic alpha cells trigger glucagon secretion. The resulting hyperglucagonemia might contribute to ketogenesis under conditions of low insulin concentration. The osmotic diuresis induced by SGLT2 inhibitors can lead to dehydration, reduction in intravascular volume, and orthostatic hypotension.

### Effects of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on HbA (1c), body weight, and hypoglycemia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy [^50d6a9e4]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure, bladder cancer, or bone fractures, known side effects of long-term use of pioglitazone, were rare events; too rare at this stage to infer any effect on the risk of these events with the addition of dapagliflozin. Two fractures did occur in the dapagliflozin 5-mg group, but all patients received pioglitazone, and thiazolidinediones are known to increase the risk of fractures.

Dapagliflozin added on to pioglitazone resulted in sustained glycemic benefits in both fasting and postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. As a possible mild diuretic and consistent glucouretic, dapagliflozin mitigated the weight gain and fluid retention due to pioglitazone. Even though more genital infections occurred with dapagliflozin than placebo, dapagliflozin added on to pioglitazone was effective and well-tolerated. The direct removal of glucose by dapagliflozin complements the insulin-sensitizing action of pioglitazone, providing a potential combination that balances well the benefits and risks of therapy for some patients with type 2 diabetes.

AEs of special interest (AESIs) included hypoglycaemia, events adjudicated as definite DKA, genital infections, urinary tract infections, volume depletion, fractures, worsening renal function, hypersensitivity and cardiovascular AEs.

Hypoglycaemia was assessed as the proportion of participants with an event and the frequency and severity of the events. Hypoglycaemic events were defined according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification criteria. 9 Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an event that resulted in unconsciousness because of hypoglycaemia or requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or to take other corrective actions to promote neurological recovery. 8

Participants were advised how to identify potential signs and symptoms of DKA and were provided with blood ketone monitors and instructions for use. Participants recorded home ketone values (β‐hydroxybutyrate) and relevant risk factors in a diary, and were advised to contact the study site if their self‐measured blood ketone reading was ≥ 0.6 mmol/L. Potential events of DKA were identified by the investigator based on symptoms, diagnoses or home ketone values, as described previously. 8 Queries were also raised by the sponsor based on predefined Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms for AEs potentially indicating DKA. An independent, blinded, DKA adjudication committee classified all potential events of DKA as definite, possible or unlikely DKA. Definite DKA was defined using the ADA consensus criteria and included laboratory‐confirmed acidosis (pH < 7.3 and/or bicarbonate < 18 mEq/L); signs and symptoms of DKA were part of a well‐documented diagnosis but were not explicitly required. 8, 10, 11 To avoid missing any potential euglycaemic DKA events, glucose was not part of the diagnostic criteria. There were no adjudication criteria for possible and unlikely DKA events as these were not explicitly defined.

### A study of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving high doses of insulin plus insulin sensitizers: applicability of a novel insulin-independent treatment [^f728f2d3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Disease progression in type 2 diabetes is frequently accompanied by a cycle of deteriorating glycemic control due to declining β-cell function. Therapies that depend on insulin supplementation or secretion entail the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, decreased insulin sensitivity, and eventual loss of effectiveness. This frustrating clinical setting is exemplified most dramatically by patients with late-stage type 2 diabetes who require escalating insulin doses, often with oral agents such as metformin and/or TZDs to maintain glycemic control. Ultimately, > 25% of patients are treated with insulin-based regimens, often in combination with OADs. A novel strategy for controlling glycemia independently of insulin involves limiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney, where glucose is reabsorbed via SGLT2 receptors. Dapagliflozin selectively inhibits SGLT2, thereby limiting glucose reabsorption.

Patients recruited for this study had inadequate glycemic control despite aggressive regimens of insulin plus OADs. After reducing the insulin dose by 50%, patients in the placebo arm experienced weight loss, little change in A1C, and a mean 17.8 mg/dl increase in FPG, an outcome that probably reflects the relatively severe insulin resistance in these patients and perhaps improved compliance with diet and lifestyle as a result of study participation. Treatment with dapagliflozin, with its insulin-independent mechanism of action, was associated with additional weight loss of ∼2.5 kg and with improvements in glycemic control compared with placebo. Although the total number of hypoglycemic events reported was greater with dapagliflozin than with placebo, there were no major hypoglycemia episodes with dapagliflozin. The effect of dapagliflozin in this insulin-treated population was similar to that observed in treatment-naive diabetic patients.

Improvements in glycemic outcome measures were dose dependent, as was the potential safety signal of genital tract infections, more frequently seen in the 20-mg dapagliflozin dose arm. However, the main pharmacodynamic measure, 24-h urinary glucose, increased by ∼85 g/day at week 12 in both the 10-mg and 20-mg dapagliflozin groups. A plausible explanation is that 20 mg dapagliflozin may have caused greater glucosuria earlier in the study, as has been seen in other settings, but that the resulting greater declines in glycemia in the 20-mg dose group led to a lower filtered load of glucose at the kidney, such that by week 12, the point at which glucosuria was measured, the amount of glucose in the urine had equalized between the dapagliflozin dose groups.

2.4.2 Safety

Safety assessments, including adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), were monitored throughout the long‐term study period, including up to the week 56 follow‐up visit, and are reported for the pooled population as well as for the subgroups. AEs of special interest, including hypoglycaemia, DKA, genital infections, urinary tract infections, fractures and cardiovascular AEs, were also recorded.

Details of assessing hypoglycaemia and DKA have been described previously. 3, 4, 5 Hypoglycaemic events were defined according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification criteria. 9, 10 Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an event resulting in unconsciousness caused by hypoglycaemia or an event requiring the assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or to take other corrective actions to promote neurological recovery. 9

Patients were advised on identifying potential DKA events, and were provided with blood ketone meters with instructions for their use to record ketone levels. Potential DKA events were identified based on investigator review of home ketone meter readings, review of symptoms and diagnoses, and from queries according to predefined terms in the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. An independent DKA Adjudication Committee adjudicated all reported DKA events. Criteria for definite DKA included acidosis diagnosed by low blood pH (< 7.3) and/or decreased serum bicarbonate levels (≤ 18 mEq/L). Symptoms/signs listed in the ADA consensus statement on the diagnosis of DKA were also assessed. 11 There were no adjudication criteria for possible and improbable DKA events.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, dapagliflozin significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

---

### Dapagliflozin [^27a1071c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS.

Withhold DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.3 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### What next after metformin? Thinking beyond glycaemia: are SGLT2 inhibitors the answer? [^ccee2da1]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

If we are to advocate the use of a relatively new therapeutic entity such as an SGLT2 inhibitor as widely as the preferred treatment option following metformin failure, then safety is an extremely important consideration. Some concerns have been raised regarding the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly adverse events including mycotic genital infections, Fournier gangrene, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute kidney injury, lower-limb amputation and fracture. There has been considerable focus on the safe and optimal use of the SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice. Data from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study further supports the safety profile of the SGLT2 inhibitors. Dapagliflozin was not associated with any excess in amputation, bone fracture, urinary tract infection, malignancy, Fournier gangrene, volume depletion or hypoglycaemia compared with placebo, and there were numerically fewer cases of acute kidney injury with dapagliflozin (1.5% vs. 2.0%). Genital mycotic infections and adjudicated DKA were both higher in dapagliflozin-treated subjects (0.9% vs. 0.1% and 0.3% vs. 0.1%, respectively); however, these adverse events occurred at a very low frequency and as such the benefit–risk profile remains overwhelmingly in favour of the SGLT2 inhibitor. The risk of adverse events should not mask the CV and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors as results from the majority of studies indicate that the safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is good. However, SGLT2 inhibitor clinical studies have been of relatively short duration, with DECLARE-TIMI 58 having the longest median follow-up of over 4 years. As such, further studies assessing both efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in longer-term trials are now needed.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity) were reported with dapagliflozin treatment. In glycemic control trials in adults, serious anaphylactic reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions and angioedema were reported in 0.2% of comparator-treated patients and 0.3% of dapagliflozin-treated patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of dapagliflozin; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.

Ketoacidosis

In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], events of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported in 27 out of 8574 adult patients in the dapagliflozin-treated group and in 12 out of 8569 adult patients in the placebo group. The events were evenly distributed over the trial period.

Laboratory Tests in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treated with Dapagliflozin or Metformin HCl

Dapagliflozin

Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR

Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, causes a small increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR. These changes in serum creatinine and eGFR generally occur within two weeks of starting therapy and then stabilize regardless of baseline kidney function. Changes that do not fit this pattern should prompt further evaluation to exclude the possibility of acute kidney injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In two trials that included adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment, the acute effect on eGFR reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with dapagliflozin.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^cd31ba8c]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 (SGLT2), which mediates approximately 90% of active renal glucose reabsorption in the early proximal tubule of the kidney. Dapagliflozin significantly reduces glucose reabsorption and decreases serum glucose concentration in an insulin-independent manner. The decrease of glucose reabsorption by dapagliflozin has also been associated with a reduction in body weight. Furthermore, the drug modestly reduces blood pressure levels through weight loss and its action as osmotic diuretic. Dapagliflozin has been approved as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who cannot tolerate metformin or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, with the exception of pioglitazone due to the theoretical increased risk of bladder cancer. The drug should not be prescribed in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients at risk for developing volume depletion. Dapagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of genital and lower urinary tract infections, but these infections are usually mild to moderate and respond to standard antimicrobial treatment. Based on current evidence, dapagliflozin is a useful drug for patients with T2DM with a favorable safety profile. However, further research regarding the effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes is needed.

3.3 Safety

Few adverse events were reported in either the DAP group or the PIO group in the 24‐week study period (Table S1). Those adverse events that did occur were mild, and were resolved with appropriate observation and administration of antibiotics. No patients discontinued from the trial or reported a recurrent infection, severe hypoglycaemia, dehydration, ketoacidosis or a cardiovascular event.

2.2 Procedures

Detailed procedures for the DEPICT trials have been reported previously. 1, 2, 3, 7 Eligible participants with T1D entered an 8‐week, lead‐in period for the optimization of diabetes management. Participants completing this period were randomized (1:1:1) to receive dapagliflozin (5 or 10 mg) or matched placebo, orally once daily during the treatment period. Participants completing 24 weeks of randomized treatment (short‐term study) who were eligible for the 28‐week extension (long‐term study) continued their allocated randomized therapy until week 52. The last follow‐up was at week 56. In the DEPICT‐1 study, 55 participants (with any BMI) were randomized incorrectly; these participants, where applicable, were excluded from efficacy analyses but included in safety analyses.

Glucose control (including self‐monitoring of blood glucose) and home blood ketone (beta‐hydroxybutyrate) measurements were reviewed at each study visit. Self‐monitoring blood‐glucose readings, local guidance and individual circumstances were used to adjust insulin dose as needed. Mode of insulin administration could not be changed during the trial, unless an insulin pump needed replacement, in which case the participant could temporarily use multiple daily injections, restarting continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion at the earliest possible time.

Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study and during the last follow‐up visit. Adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, physical examination findings, electrocardiogram and laboratory values were monitored.

2.3 Endpoints

The following efficacy outcomes were analysed at weeks 24 and 52: changes from baseline in HbA1c and body weight, percentage change from baseline in daily insulin dose and proportion of participants achieving HbA1c reduction ≥ 0.5% with no severe hypoglycaemia. Changes from baseline in mean interstitial glucose measured using continuous glucose monitoring, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions and time in target glycaemic range [> 70 and ≤ 180 mg/dL (> 3.9 and ≤ 10.0 mmol/L)] at week 24 were also assessed. Safety analyses included assessment of AEs, SAEs and AEs of special interest, including hypoglycaemia (classified according to the American Diabetes Association classification criteria) 8 and events of DKA (subject to adjudication). Safety analyses were assessed up to week 56.

### Dapagliflozin treatment for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^033ac5ba]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and places a heavy burden on society. Dapagliflozin is a novel treatment choice for type 2 diabetes.

Objective

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin treatment.

Data Sources

Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via OVID) and the Cochrane Library (up to August 2012) were searched, and RCTs were collected.

Study Selection

Studies included type 2 diabetic subjects, who had been treated with dapagliflozin, and recorded HbA1c as outcomes.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently assessed articles and study quality. Patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes were collected.

Data Synthesis

Ten RCTs were included. Risk of bias for outcomes was low. Fixed or random effects models were used to pool the results. Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a reduction in HbA1c [weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.53%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.58% to -0.47%; p < 0.00001], fasting plasma glucose (WMD: -1.06mmol/L; 95% CI: -1.20, -0.92; p < 0.00001), and body weight (WMD: -1.63kg; 95% CI: -1.83, -1.43; p < 0.00001). Dapagliflozin monotherapy did not lead to hypoglycaemia [relative risk (RR): 1.44; 95% CI: 0. 86, 2.41; p = 0.17], although hypoglycaemic risk increased (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.29; p = 0.005) when dapagliflozin was combined with other hypoglycaemic drugs. Dapagliflozin increased urinary glucose excretion (WMD: 26.98; 95% CI: 21.72, 32.24; p < 0.00001) and was associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections (RR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.60; p = 0.004) and genital tract infections (RR: 3.23; 95% CI: 2.50, 4.18; p = 0.00001).

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin appears to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes, although it may increase the risk of urinary tract infections and genital tract infections.

### Dapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^6a633d9c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature and describe the pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties; clinical safety; and efficacy of dapagliflozin, a new drug currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE (1995-November 2011) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using the terms dapagliflozin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and SGLT2 inhibitor. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language studies, including abstracts, evaluating dapagliflozin use in humans were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Dapagliflozin is the first-in-class oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that represents a new potential therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its mechanism of action is insulin- and insulin-sensitivity independent. Preliminary data suggest that dapagliflozin decreases hemoglobin A(1c), fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial plasma glucose, while also promoting weight loss. In Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, dapagliflozin has exhibited a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of placebo.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin is a novel oral antihyperglycemic agent that has demonstrated promise as monotherapy and as synergistic combination therapy with currently available agents in Phase 3 clinical trials. On January 19, 2012, the FDA issued a complete response letter to AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb regarding the new drug application for dapagliflozin. The FDA is requesting additional clinical data-from ongoing studies and potentially new clinical trials-to better describe the risk-benefit profile of the drug. Both manufacturers remain committed to the development of dapagliflozin, and there are currently 8 Phase 3 trials ongoing. Dapagliflozin has the potential to be the next new oral agent in the diabetes drug armamentarium.

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^2fd7db03]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dapagliflozin / metformin ER PO (also known as Xigduo XR):
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold dapagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections.
- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as metformin has been associated with an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. Assess hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B12 every 2–3 years.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating dapagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

### Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving high doses of insulin: a randomized trial [^d62dda98]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, may improve glycemic control with a lower dose of insulin and attenuate the associated weight gain in patients with inadequate control despite high doses of insulin.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding dapagliflozin therapy in patients whose type 2 diabetes mellitus is inadequately controlled with insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.

Design

A 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial followed by a 24-week extension period. An additional 56-week extension period is ongoing. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00673231)

Setting

126 centers in Europe and North America from 30 April 2008 to 19 November 2009.

Patients

808 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving at least 30 U of insulin daily, with or without up to 2 oral antidiabetic drugs.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and allocated with a computer-generated scheme to receive placebo or 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of dapagliflozin, once daily, for 48 weeks.

Measurements

The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A(1c) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, insulin dose, and fasting plasma glucose level at 24 weeks and during the 24-week extension period. Adverse events were evaluated throughout both 24-week periods.

Results

800 patients were analyzed. After 24 weeks, mean hemoglobin A(1c) decreased by 0.79% to 0.96% with dapagliflozin compared with 0.39% with placebo (mean difference, -0.40% [95% CI, -0.54% to -0.25%] in the 2.5-mg group, -0.49% [CI, -0.65% to -0.34%] in the 5-mg group, and -0.57% [CI, -0.72% to -0.42%] in the 10-mg group). Daily insulin dose decreased by 0.63 to 1.95 U with dapagliflozin and increased by 5.65 U with placebo (mean difference, -7.60 U [CI, -10.32 to -4.87 U] in the 2.5-mg group, -6.28 U [CI, -8.99 to -3.58 U] in the 5-mg group, and -6.82 U [CI, -9.56 to -4.09 U] in the 10-mg group). Body weight decreased by 0.92 to 1.61 kg with dapagliflozin and increased by 0.43 kg with placebo (mean differences, -1.35 kg [CI, -1.90 to -0.80 kg] in the 2.5-mg group, -1.42 kg [CI, -1.97 to -0.88 kg] in the 5-mg group, and -2.04 kg [CI, -2.59 to -1.48 kg] in the 10-mg group). These effects were maintained at 48 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, patients in the pooled dapagliflozin groups had a higher rate of hypoglycemic episodes (56.6% vs. 51.8%), events suggesting genital infection (9.0% vs. 2.5%), and events suggesting urinary tract infection (9.7% vs. 5.1%).

Limitation

Insulin doses were not titrated to target, and the study was not designed to evaluate long-term safety.

Conclusion

Dapagliflozin improves glycemic control, stabilizes insulin dosing, and reduces weight without increasing major hypoglycemic episodes in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.

5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.7 Vitamin B12Concentrations

In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Safety of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors [^7314e9bd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have a well-defined safety profile based on data obtained from numerous clinical trials, including cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) and postmarketing pharmacovigilance reporting. Adverse events including risk of genital mycotic infection and volume depletion-related events are consistent with the mechanism of action of this drug class. However, several emergent (albeit infrequent) serious safety issues have also been reported. In their respective CVOTs, the proportion of patients with reported diabetic ketoacidosis was similar in empagliflozin or canagliflozin compared with their placebo groups, but it was higher for dapagliflozin. Canagliflozin may be associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and lower limb amputation; however, data are inconclusive. There is no evidence linking SGLT2 inhibitors with an increased risk of cancer, but these agents, particularly dapagliflozin, should be used with caution in patients with hematuria or a history of bladder cancer. Postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury have occurred in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, and cases identified in recent CVOTs occurred with similar frequency in SGLT2 inhibitor and placebo groups. Common adverse events associated with SGLT2 inhibitors (such as genital infections or volume depletion) are generally mild and manageable by patients or by primary care physicians, and the risk of rare events (such as ketoacidosis) can be minimized by appropriate patient selection and early recognition of symptoms. When selecting treatment, it is important that clinicians weigh the known risks of SGLT2 inhibitors against their proven benefits, including the reduction of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — contraindications, cautions, and adverse effects to monitor — include the following. Contraindications include history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to drug, pregnancy or breastfeeding, on dialysis, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (dapagliflozin), ESRD (dapagliflozin and empagliflozin), and severe renal impairment (empagliflozin). Cautions include to discontinue at least 3 days before a planned surgery to prevent postoperative ketoacidosis; if HbA1c is well controlled or there is a history of frequent hypoglycemic events, wean or stop sulfonylurea or glinide and consider reducing total daily insulin dose by ~20% when starting therapy; consider diuretic dose reduction due to intravascular volume contraction; and use with caution in patients with prior amputation, severe peripheral neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or active diabetic foot ulcers or soft tissue infections; note a possible increased risk of bone fractures with canagliflozin. Adverse effects to monitor are genital fungal infections, urinary tract infections, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and lower limb ulcerations and soft tissue infections.

5.2 Debated safety issues

There are different uncertainties as regards the risk of BKAs, bone fractures, infections and ketoacidosis, which were not scrutinized in CVD‐REAL studies. Genital and urinary tract infections were associated with all members of the class and predictable on the basis of the mechanism of action; although the true rate in clinical practice is still uncertain, the high reporting frequency in the postmarketing phase calls for real‐time pharmacovigilance monitoring. 50 The overall evidence suggests that SGLT2‐Is increase the risk of genital mycotic infections by four to five times according to the largest MA, 51 although they are usually mild to moderate, can be adequately treated with standard medical therapy, and drug discontinuation is not required. Conversely, gathered evidence is not consistent for an increased risk of urinary infections, with MAs showing mixed results. 52 However, clinicians should be aware that severe infections have been described, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis, especially in patients with urinary tract outlet obstruction.

The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was publicly disseminated by the FDA, which released a warning in May 2015 based on 20 case reports (both in type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM patients), and by the European Medicines Agency in June 2015, which identified a total of 147 cases of DKA in patients treated with SGLT2‐Is. A recent literature review analysed RCTs, cohort studies, case reports and pharmacovigilance database studies 53: DKA incidence was less than 1/1000 in RCTs (in line with data from an MA 54) and 1.6/1000 person‐years in cohort studies. In case reports and in pharmacovigilance databases, duration of SGLT2‐I treatment before DKA onset was extremely variable; overall, DKA is a rare adverse event during SGLT2‐I therapy, with fatal episodes representing 1.6% of all reported cases. 55 The latest cohort investigations compared SGLT2‐Is with DPP4‐Is and found an increased risk with SGLT2‐I exposure, 56 especially in patients with diabetic microvascular complications and in those taking diuretics. 57

### Potential for combination of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^ec570610]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 Inhibitors

Three SGLT2 inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of T2DM in the USA and the European Union: canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. These agents cause reduced reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate and increased excretion of glucose into the urine, and cause urinary glucose excretion to occur at a lower plasma glucose concentration. SGLT2 inhibition results in the loss of ∼60–80 g of glucose in the urine per day, which helps to reduce hyperglycaemia in individuals with T2DM. In addition to improvements in glycaemic control, SGLT2 inhibitors provide other effects that are desirable in a T2DM agent, such as weight loss, moderate reductions in systolic blood pressure and no increase in hypoglycaemia risk.

Clinical trial data have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors improve glycaemic control by reducing HbA1c, postprandial glucose and FPG concentrations, and produce modest reductions in body weight and blood pressure–. When used as monotherapy, these agents have been found to lead to reductions in HbA1c [from −0.34 to −1.03% (3.7–11.3 mmol/mol)], body weight (from −2.0 to −3.4 kg), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (from −1.7 to −6.4 mmHg and from −0.3 to −2.6 mmHg, respectively). Specific adverse reactions of SGLT2 inhibitors are related to urinary glucose excretion, in that the continual presence of glucose in the urine may increase the risk of urinary tract infections and/or genital mycotic infections.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus insulin glargine over 52 weeks as add-on to metformin with or without sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, parallel-design, open-label, phase 3 trial [^ee4587ce]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinically relevant and sustained change in BW from baseline to week 52 in the DAPA + SAXA group, which was significantly greater compared with the INS group, supports results from previous studies showing that treatment with DAPA alone or in combination with SAXA was associated with BW reduction, whereas insulin treatment was associated with BW gain. 10, 23, 26 The higher proportion of patients achieving optimal glycaemic control after 52 weeks with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia in the DAPA + SAXA group compared with those receiving INS corroborates previous evidence. 27, 28, 29 However, evidence is lacking regarding the effect of these drugs alone compared with insulin in achieving optimal glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia or BW gain. More patients required rescue medication in the INS group than the DAPA + SAXA group.

Overall, AEs and SAEs were balanced between the two groups. The safety and tolerability profile of DAPA + SAXA was consistent with that of the individual agents, supporting observations from previous studies. 5, 10, 12, 30, 31 Oral administration of glucose‐lowering drugs is often preferred to injections by both patients and healthcare professionals. 32 A treatment strategy including oral, insulin‐independent, glucose‐lowering drugs instead of injectable basal insulin in patients with uncontrolled T2D is a welcome alternative. The function of DPP‐4is with sulphonylurea mechanistically relies on residual β‐cell activity, while SGLT‐2is work complementarily to DPP4is, reducing hyperglycaemia through renal excretion of glucose, independent of insulin secretion, thus reducing glucotoxicity 33 and β‐cell burden. The risk of genital infections with combination therapy is lower than that observed with DAPA alone, which is suggestive of a protective effect. 13, 34, 35

### Exploring the potential of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in type 1 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^0887219a]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin adjustments to maintain glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes often lead to wide glucose fluctuations, hypoglycemia, and increased body weight. Dapagliflozin, an insulin-independent sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, increases glucosuria and reduces hyperglycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of this study was to assess short-term safety of dapagliflozin in combination with insulin; secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy parameters.

Research Design and Methods

A 2-week, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study randomly assigned 70 adults with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 7–10%), who were receiving treatment with stable doses of insulin, to one of four dapagliflozin doses (1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo. The insulin dose was not proactively reduced at randomization but could be adjusted for safety reasons.

Results

Sixty-two patients (88.6%) completed the study. Any hypoglycemia was common across all treatments (60.0–92.3%); one major event of hypoglycemia occurred with dapagliflozin 10 mg. No diabetic ketoacidosis occurred. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Glucosuria increased by 88 g/24 h (95% CI 55 to 121) with dapagliflozin 10 mg and decreased by -21.5 g/24 h (95% CI -53.9 to 11.0) with placebo. Changes from baseline with dapagliflozin 10 mg by day 7 were as follows: -2.29 mmol/L (95% CI -3.71 to -0.87 [-41.3 mg/dL; 95% CI -66.9 to -15.7]) for 24-h daily average blood glucose; -3.77 mmol/L (95% CI -6.09 to -1.45 [-63.1 mg/dL; 95% CI -111.5 to -14.8]) for mean amplitude of glycemic excursion; and -16.2% (95% CI -29.4 to -0.5) for mean percent change in total daily insulin dose. Corresponding changes with placebo were as follows: -1.13 mmol/L (95% CI -3.63 to 1.37), -0.45 mmol/L (95% CI -4.98 to 4.08), and 1.7% (95% CI -22.8 to 33.9), respectively. However, for every efficacy parameter, the 95% CIs for all dapagliflozin doses overlapped those for placebo.

Conclusions

This exploratory study of dapagliflozin in adults with type 1 diabetes demonstrated acceptable short-term tolerability and expected pharmacokinetic profiles and increases in urinary glucose excretion. Within the dapagliflozin groups, dose-related reductions in 24-h glucose, glycemic variability, and insulin dose were suggested, which provide hope that SGLT2 inhibition may prove in larger randomized controlled trials to be efficacious in reducing hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes.

Safety and tolerability

Several clinical trials involving SGLT-2 inhibitors in T2DM patients have shown more adverse reactions such as genital infections, amputations, DKA, and fractures in SGLT-2 inhibitor compared with placebo. There is little or no evidence of effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on blindness, amputation, neuropathic pain, eye disease, or health-related quality of life in large meta-analyses. Compared with GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors were related to a lower risk of adverse events resulted in patient withdrawal. SGLT2 inhibitors significantly decreased the risk of all serious adverse events (HR = 0.91, P < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (HR = 0.74; P < 0.001). A meta-analysis reported dose-independent adverse events with SGLT2 inhibitors. Compared with controls or placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of acute pancreatitis.

Overall adverse events and adverse event-related discontinuation rates were generally similar between placebo, sitagliptin, glimepiride, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. However, canagliflozin 100 mg had a higher incidence of adverse events than placebo or sitagliptin. The safety profile of empagliflozin was similar to sitagliptin or metformin, and most adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity. Adverse events were similar between dapagliflozin and placebo, with few adverse events associated with volume depletion (< 1% vs. 0%) or renal function (1% vs < 1%). The most common adverse events related to dapagliflozin in DURATION-8 were diarrhea, injection site nodules, nausea, and urinary tract infection. In DAPA-HF, the incidence of adverse reactions associated with volume depletion, renal insufficiency, as well as hypoglycemia did not differ between placebo and dapagliflozin. The incidence of hypovolemia, symptomatic hypoglycemia, and urinary tract infection did not differ obviously between groups in patients receiving ertugliflozin compared with placebo or metformin.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of dapagliflozin / saxagliptin PO (also known as Qtern):
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as saxagliptin has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis.
- **Acute pyelonephritis, urosepsis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious UTIs, including pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
- **Angioedema**: use caution in patients with a history of angioedema related to other DPP4 inhibitors.
- **Arthralgia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as DPP4 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of severe and disabling arthralgia.
- **Bullous pemphigoid**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as DPP4 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of bullous pemphigoid.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, recent surgery, reduced insulin dose, volume depletion, or excessive alcohol use. Consider obtaining ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. Withhold dapagliflozin at least 3 days, if possible, before major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume once clinically stable and after oral intake has resumed.
- **Fournier's gangrene**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibors have been associated with an increased risk of Fournier's gangrene.
- **HF**: use caution in patients with a history of HF or renal impairment. Assess renal function before initiating saxagliptin.
- **Reactivation of genital mycotic infections**: use caution in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections.
- **Volume depletion**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of volume depletion, especially in patients with renal impairment, taking loop diuretics, or advanced age. Assess and correct volume status before initiating dapagliflozin. Monitor for volume depletion throughout treatment.

3.5 Safety

Overall, AEs were more common in patients treated with RASi (who were also older and had a longer duration of T2D) compared with patients without RASi treatment. However, among patients with RASi treatment, the AE profile was similar in the placebo and dapagliflozin treatment groups (Table 2). Among the group without RASi treatment, the proportion of patients with at least one AE was greater in the dapagliflozin‐treated patients than in the placebo‐treated patients (Table 2).

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets.

Withhold Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.3 Volume Depletion

Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl extended-release tablets in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension and renal function after initiating therapy.

5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis

Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular therapies — benefits, risks, and cautions for SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs include efficacy and adverse-effect profiles along with practical considerations. SGLT2 inhibitors with demonstrated CV benefit reduce MACE, incident HF, HF hospitalization, and CV death but increase the risk of genital mycotic infections, polyuria, and potential volume depletion; GLP-1RAs with demonstrated CV benefit reduce MACE and progression of macroalbuminuria but are associated with transient nausea and vomiting. Both classes have nonglycemic benefits in systolic blood pressure and weight and have a low risk of hypoglycemia on their own or with metformin and other oral glucose-lowering medications (except insulin secretagogues). Notably, dapagliflozin was used safely even in patients without diabetes in the DAPA-HF trial; injectable GLP-1RAs use a small needle and pen device, and the first oral GLP-1RA, semaglutide, has been approved by the FDA for improving glycemic control in patients with T2D. Caution is suggested when starting an SGLT2 inhibitor in those with peripheral artery disease, severe peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity diabetic ulcers, or soft tissue infections; for active proliferative retinopathy when a significant rapid HbA1c reduction is expected, consider a GLP-1RA alternative to semaglutide SQ; and caution is suggested with GLP-1RA use in patients with active gallbladder disease or a history of pancreatitis.

5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues

Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Both dapagliflozin and saxagliptin can individually increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with QTERN [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

5.7 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene)

Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death.

Patients treated with QTERN presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue QTERN, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control.

5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue QTERN, treat per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms are resolved. Assess for other potential causes for the event. Institute alternative treatment for diabetes.

Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with saxagliptin.

5.9 Genital Mycotic Infections

Dapagliflozin increases the risks of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)]. Monitor and treat appropriately.

### Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in drug-naive Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, blinded, prospective phase III study [^e22675e8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Dapagliflozin is a highly selective, orally active inhibitor of renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 that reduces hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion. The goal of this study was to evaluate dapagliflozin as monotherapy in drug-naive Asian patients with type 2 diabetes whose disease was inadequately controlled with diet and exercise.

Methods

In this Phase III, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind study, drug-naive patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels ≥ 7.0% to ≤ 10.5% (≥ 53- ≤ 91 mmol/mol) were randomized (by using an interactive voice response system) to receive placebo (n = 132), dapagliflozin 5 mg (n = 128), or dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 133). The primary end point was mean change from baseline in HbA1c level at week 24 (last-observation-carried-forward). Secondary end points included changes in fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, body weight, and other glycemic parameters.

Results

Baseline characteristics were balanced across groups. Most patients (89%) were Chinese, median disease duration was 0.2 year, and mean HbA1c level was 8.26%. Most patients (87%) completed the study. At week 24, mean reductions in HbA1c were -0.29% for placebo versus -1.04% and -1.11% for dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both doses). Changes in fasting plasma glucose were 2.5, -25.1, and -31.6 mg/dL (0.14, -1.39, and -1.75 mmol/L) for placebo, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and dapagliflozin 10 mg. Changes in 2-hour postprandial glucose were 1.1, -46.8, and -54.9 mg/dL (0.06, -2.60, and -3.05 mmol/L). Reductions in body weight were -0.27, -1.64, and -2.25 kg. Proportions of patients achieving HbA1c levels < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) were 21.3%, 42.6%, and 49.8%. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 63.6%, 61.7%, and 60.9% of patients, and serious AEs occurred in 1.5%, 3.9%, and 3.0% of patients. No deaths occurred. Hypoglycemia was uncommon (1.5%, 0.8%, and 0.8%); no hypoglycemic event led to discontinuation. Genital infections occurred in 0.8%, 3.1%, and 4.5% of patients and urinary tract infections in 3.0%, 3.9%, and 5.3% of patients. No AEs of renal infection or pyelonephritis were reported. No changes in renal function or AEs of renal failure occurred.

Conclusions

Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in HbA1c levels after 24 weeks of treatment. Dose-dependent, statistically significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and weight were also observed for both doses compared with placebo. AEs and serious AEs were balanced across groups, with low rates of hypoglycemia and no increase in renal events. Genital infections and urinary tract infections were more common with dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin as monotherapy in these drug-naive Asian patients was well tolerated, significantly improving glycemic control with the additional benefit of weight loss.

The different classes of agents now available for the treatment of diabetes, each with its own unique mechanism of action, present the clinician with numerous choices to achieve glycemic control. Therapy can be tailored for each patient. If the primary problem is insulin resistance, a thiazolidinedione can be used. The clinician should remember the potential adverse reactions of the drugs and their potential interaction with other conditions a patient may have. After this careful consideration, the optimal therapeutic regimen for a patient can be developed.

Dapagliflozin reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) by up to 5 mmHg, with no significant increase in heart rate or occurrence of orthostatic hypotension.

Rates of hypotension, dehydration, and hypovolemia were similar in dapagliflozin groups (1–2%) to those in the placebo/comparator groups (0–1%). Dapagliflozin treatment was not associated with an increased risk of acute renal toxicity or deterioration of renal function. The dapagliflozin Summary of Product Characteristics advises against its use in patients receiving loop diuretics or who are volume depleted, and recommends appropriate monitoring if volume depletion is likely to occur.

Symptoms suggestive of genital infection, such as cutaneous fungal infections, and lower urinary tract infection (UTI) were common adverse events with dapagliflozin and were reported more frequently compared with placebo/comparator. Genital infection occurred in 2–13% of patients receiving dapagliflozin compared with 0–5% of those receiving placebo/comparator, with women affected more commonly than men. Most cases were not severe and responded well to standard therapy. Lower UTIs also occurred more frequently with dapagliflozin (3.0–12.5%) than with placebo/comparator (0–9.0%). None of these events were serious, and all cases resolved with standard antibiotic therapy. The pooled safety analysis (n = 4,545) reported that genital infections and UTIs were more common with dapagliflozin than placebo, and between-group differences were less marked for UTIs (genital infection: 4.1–5.7% dapagliflozin vs. 0.9% placebo; UTIs: 3.6–5.7% dapagliflozin vs. 3.7% placebo).

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin added to metformin over 102 weeks showed sustained improved glycemic control, modest weight reduction, and no increased risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone. These effects suggest a complementary use of the insulin independent effects of dapagliflozin in combination with metformin.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease, with and without other cardiovascular medications: DAPA-CKD trial [^7b2cbbbf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to examining whether cardiovascular medications modified the effects of dapagliflozin in this population, we took the opportunity to examine the effects of dapagliflozin in patients based on baseline dosing of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. While higher doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs are generally thought to afford patients a greater benefit than lower doses, dosing in practice is frequently limited by hypotension or hyperkalemia, and some patients are intolerant of troublesome side effects (eg, cough) or serious allergic reactions (eg, angioedema) seen more frequently with ACE inhibitors. We found consistent relative and absolute benefits of dapagliflozin across the range of RAAS inhibitor doses.

Our results generally confirm findings observed in other populations treated with dapagliflozin and in patients with diabetic kidney disease treated with dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors. In the DAPA‐HF trial, in which the primary composite end point was cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure, Docherty et al found consistent benefits of dapagliflozin by use/nonuse or dose of a variety of background heart failure treatments, including diuretics, RAAS inhibitors, and β‐adrenergic antagonists in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Verma et al found similar results in the EMPEROR‐Reduced trial in which patients were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo; both studies also examined effects of SGLT2 inhibitors with and without background use of guideline‐concordant therapies in combination. These analyses did not examine effects of background heart failure therapies on incidence or progression of kidney disease. In an analysis of data from the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, Mayer et al showed that the effects of empagliflozin on a classic kidney composite end point (ie, doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of dialysis, or death due to kidney disease) were consistent among patients irrespective of baseline use/nonuse of diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and RAAS inhibitors. The analyses we present here confirm and extend previously published findings by documenting the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin with use/nonuse of a wide range of cardiovascular medications, demonstrating benefits on kidney end points among patients with and without type 2 diabetes, and among patients with mild, moderate, and advanced CKD, populations at higher risk of adverse drug effects relative to persons with normal or near normal kidney function.

### Cardiovascular effects of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and different risk categories: a meta-analysis [^f8dd31e1]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

In a pre-specified meta-analysis investigating CV outcomes in 21 trials from the dapagliflozin clinical development programme, which was conducted in line with the FDA guidance, no increase in CVD risk was observed in patients with T2DM receiving dapagliflozin compared with those receiving control (placebo or comparator treatment) with or without background glucose-lowering therapies. The CV risk increases in patients with age, decrease in renal function and presence of one or several risk factors or comorbid conditions. The meta-analysis reported here aimed to characterise the CV profile of dapagliflozin overall and in subgroups of patients grouped by degree of CV risk, based both on baseline and in-study risk factors (i.e. hypoglycaemic events), with a focus on major adverse CV events (MACE).

Safety and tolerability

Safety and tolerability will be assessed during the trial. Given the comprehensive experience with dapagliflozin, not all adverse events will be reported. However, serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events (AEs) leading to (temporary) trial drug interruptions and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) [i.e. clinically significant hypoglycaemia, defined as glucose concentration < 3.0 mmol/l (i.e. < 54 mg/dl), ketoacidosis, urinary tract infections, genital infections] will be reported by number and percentage of patients. These AESIs will be investigated, as SGLT2 inhibitors have been suggested to be associated with these AEs. The investigator will report all SAEs to the sponsor within 24 hours after obtaining knowledge of the events. The Service Desk Clinical Research Office at UMC Groningen will act as the monitoring body and will be responsible for reporting SAEs and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) on behalf of the sponsor. The sponsor will inform the participating centres about SAEs and SUSARs and will take care of periodic safety reports for the central ethics committee and regulatory authorities (The Netherlands and Belgium). For the other sites, this will be performed by the local monitoring bodies according to the national reporting obligations. However, a low risk of AESIs is expected. Several placebo-controlled trials in patients with T2DM showed that the frequency of hypoglycaemia was similar in SGLT2 inhibitor treatment and placebo groups. Moreover, a meta-analysis of cardiovascular and CKD trials showed no increased risk for urinary tract infections and only a slightly increased risk for genital mycotic infections.

Ethical considerations

The trial has been approved in accordance with European medical ethical regulations in The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Spain and the national regulations for Australia. Medical ethical approval will be requested for the trial in Singapore. The trial is conducted in accordance with the International Conference of Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and follows the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.

1.7 Perineal necrotising fasciitis

Concern has been raised that SGLT2 inhibitors may be associated with a minor increase in the risk of perineal necrotizing fasciitis, also known as Fournier's gangrene, although the extreme rarity of the complication makes the magnitude of the association difficult to quantify. Isolated reports in pharmacovigilance databases like the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System may not establish a causal relationship and are subject to reporting and other bias. In the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 trial, there was 1 perineal necrotizing fasciitis event with dapagliflozin compared with 5 events with placebo. There were no recorded events with SGLT2 inhibitor use in the other large cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials. Additionally, a real‐world study including more than 1 800 000 people with T2DM found no increase in hospital admission rates for perineal necrotizing fasciitis among SGLT2 inhibitor users. As a precaution, clinicians should advise people with diabetes who are using an SGLT2 inhibitor to seek urgent medical attention if they experience perineal pain, swelling or erythema and if they are systemically unwell.

1.8 Adverse effects with no apparent association withinhibitor use

Adverse effects with no convincing evidence of association with SGLT2 inhibitor use in studied populations are discussed in Box 2.

Urinary Tract Infections

Early case reports of SGLT2 inhibitor use, and the mechanism of action of increasing the glucose content of urine, raised concerned about a possible increased risk of urinary tract infections. There is no increased risk at meta‐analysis level, including more than 50 000 patients, and in subsequently published major clinical trials, or among real‐world patients. Specifically, no significant increase in risk of urosepsis or pyelonephritis has been observed in routine care.

### Sodium glucose transporter protein 2 inhibitors: focusing on the kidney to treat type 2 diabetes [^294c3814]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. Treatment of T2DM continues to present challenges, with a significant proportion of patients failing to achieve and maintain glycemic targets. Despite the availability of many oral antidiabetic agents, therapeutic efficacy is also offset by side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic agents with an improved benefit-risk profile continues. In the following review we focus on a novel class of oral antidiabetic drugs, the sodium glucose transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which have unique characteristics. SGLT2 inhibitors focus on the kidney as a therapeutic target, where they inhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, causing an increase in urinary glucose excretion. Doing this, they reduce plasma glucose independently of the β-cell function of the pancreas. SGLT2 inhibitors are effective at lowering hemoglobin A1c, but also induce weight loss and reduce blood pressure, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. In general, the SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse events being mild urinal and genital infections. Since their primary site of effect is the kidney, these drugs are less effective in patients with impaired kidney function but evidence is emerging that these drugs may also have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy. This review focuses on the most extensively studied SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin. Dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have already been approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration. The European Medicines Agency has accepted all three drugs for marketing.

### Glucuretic effects and renal safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^65bdd936]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States, the European Union and other countries. Dapagliflozin increases renal glucose excretion in an insulin-independent manner, and its mechanism of action is complementary to those of other antidiabetes medications. When used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetes medications or insulin, dapagliflozin improves glycemic measures in patients with T2DM. Dapagliflozin treatment is also associated with weight reduction and a decrease in blood pressure, both of which may be beneficial in patients with T2DM. Because of its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin has a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, dapagliflozin is well tolerated, with the frequency of most adverse events similar to that seen with placebo. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in dapagliflozin-treated groups compared with placebo groups. In the clinical development program, more cases of newly diagnosed bladder cancer were reported for patients treated with dapagliflozin (0.17%) compared with placebo or comparator (0.03%). Although there were not enough cases to determine causality, dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer. Dapagliflozin may decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), especially in elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function. Renal function should be monitored before initiation of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin should not be used in patients with an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). No cardiovascular safety signals have been detected for dapagliflozin, and a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study is ongoing. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that dapagliflozin is a promising new treatment option for T2DM.

### Cardiovascular effects of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and different risk categories: a meta-analysis [^8650fe70]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis of data from across the dapagliflozin clinical development programme, including high CV risk patients, there was no evidence for increased risk of major adverse CV events with dapagliflozin. The results suggest the potential for a beneficial CV effect by dapagliflozin which is consistent with the multifactorial benefits on CV risk factors associated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

### SGLT2i: beyond the glucose-lowering effect [^d17fd9b3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

An approximately twofold increase in the risk of lower limb amputation associated with SGLT2i compared with placebo was observed in clinical trials. However, the recent CREDENCE trial reported no significant difference in lower limb amputation risk between the canagliflozin and placebo groups. Meta-analysis of 14 RCTs (N > 26,000) demonstrated that SGLT2i as a class was not significantly associated with amputation risk, but subgroup analysis showed an increased risk for canagliflozin compared with other oral antihyperglycemic agents. All patients with diabetes have a higher risk of lower limb infections, ulcers and amputation. However, it remains unclear whether SGLT2i increase this risk, suggesting that we need to evaluate patient foot health on a regular basis.

A previous study indicated that canagliflozin increased the risk of developing renal tubule tumors, pheochromocytomas and testicular Leydig cell tumors in rats. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of intestinal carbohydrate absorption, the increase in calcium excretion in renal tubules and the synthesis of luteinizing hormone induced by canagliflozin. However, there are differences between animals and people, and animal models cannot completely replace clinical research. Further clinical trials showed that the risk of bladder cancer and breast cancer in the dapagliflozin treatment group was higher than that in the control group. However, the study did not conduct tumor screening and could not determine whether the tumor was caused by dapagliflozin treatment. Therefore, there is still controversy about whether SGLT2i can induce tumorigenesis.

Large-sample multicenter clinical trials and additional basic experimental verification are still needed. Additional adverse reactions reported clinically include hypotension, dehydration, hypoglycemia and so on. However, the risk of hypoglycemia is low unless coadministered with insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g. sulfonylureas, glinides). Thus, consideration needs to be given to reducing the dose of either agent used in combination with an SGLT2i. Mechanistically, SGLT2i are not associated with increased hypoglycemia risk.

The above adverse reactions suggest that medical staff should prescribe drugs in a reasonable manner, with an understanding of the complications to properly avoid risks. At the same time, the research and development of safe glucose-lowering drugs with high selectivity is also a difficult problem that we urgently need to overcome.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 Safety endpoints

Safety analyses were conducted using the treated patients' data set (including data after rescue), defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the study medication. Safety and tolerability were evaluated based on the analyses of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, hypoglycaemia and clinical laboratory evaluations. AEs were classified by primary system organ class and the preferred term according to MedDRA20.0 and were sorted by decreasing frequency. All AEs (serious and non‐serious), including all hypoglycaemic events, were summarized by treatment group, where applicable. No formal comparisons were made between treatments. Two analyses‐related deaths were reported during the study in the DAPA + SAXA group, one each in the short‐ and long‐term periods. Serious AEs (SAEs), including hypoglycaemic events, were described in narratives regardless of the investigator's assessment of causality. All AEs that led to discontinuation were listed.

Separate summaries were provided for AEs of special interest (AESI) and included hypoglycaemic events, urinary tract infections, renal impairment, genital infections, hepatic injury, bone fractures, hypersensitivity reactions, volume depletion and cardiac failure. The AESI and serious AESI with an onset from day 1 of the short‐term treatment period through 4 and 30 days after the last dose date in the short‐ and long‐term treatment periods, respectively, occurred during the combined short‐ and long‐term periods.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^d903ffee]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

SGLT-2 inhibitors

SGLT-2 inhibitors prevent glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, causing glucosuria and leading to a reduction in plasma glucose in patients with diabetes. Since excess glucose is excreted in the urine, SGLT-2 inhibitor use is also associated with weight loss. Less than 10% of patients taking SGLT-2 inhibitors develop genital infections, which was 2–3 times more than placebo in clinical trials. The risk is higher in women and in people with a history of genitourinary infections. Rare but serious side effects include ketoacidosis, fractures, foot amputations, and genital infections. – People at high risk for these serious adverse events should avoid SGLT-2 inhibitors.

The EMPA-REG OUTCOME study established empagliflozin as the first SGLT-2 inhibitor known to reduce cardiovascular events. The 14% reduction in composite primary outcome was driven by a 38% reduction in cardiovascular death; this study also showed a 35% relative risk reduction for heart failure hospitalizations. In 2017, CANVAS showed that canagliflozin was associated with a 14% relative reduction in the rate of MACEs compared with placebo and decreased the rate of hospitalizations for heart failure by 33%. Dapagliflozin was non-inferior but not superior to placebo in its cardiovascular outcomes trial. Similarly, data from the VERTIS trial were released at the 2020 American Diabetes Association Conference, showing cardiovascular safety, but not additional protection, when ertugliflozin is added to the standard of care.

Secondary analyses of SGLT-2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcomes trials showed a reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure as a likely class effect independent of the diagnosis of diabetes. In 2019, dapagliflozin was shown to reduce the rate of progression of heart failure or cardiovascular death compared with placebo in patients with and without diabetes. Additionally, the CREDENCE study showed a 30% relative risk reduction for the primary composite renal outcome (end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine levels, and renal or cardiovascular death) with canagliflozin compared with placebo.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors

DPP-IV inhibitors increase insulin release by prolonging the life of incretins such as GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Cardiovascular outcomes trials for saxagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin, and linagliptinall showed non-inferiority but failed to show superiority compared with placebo. Additionally, there was an increase in rates of hospitalization for heart failure with saxagliptin.

### SGLT2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy for type 1 diabetes: balancing benefits and risks [^7232cf6d]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have several beneficial effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, including glucose lowering, weight loss, blood pressure lowering, and a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. To address high unmet medical need via improved glycaemic control, several clinical trials have been done to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. In this Personal View, we summarise data from eight clinical trials of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes. HbA 1c -lowering efficacy was greatest at 8–12 weeks of therapy, but the magnitude of HbA 1c lowering waned with longer duration of treatment (up to 52 weeks). Data are not yet available to establish for how long glycaemic efficacy could be sustained during long-term therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy induces serious adverse events, including a roughly six-times increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that one additional case of ketoacidosis will occur for every 26 patient-years of exposure of patients with type 1 diabetes to sotagliflozin therapy. Assuming a case mortality of 0.4%, this estimate translates into 16 additional deaths per year per 100000 patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing treatment. These considerations raise important questions about the risk-to-benefit profile of SGLT2 inhibitors when used as adjunctive therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Safety Outcomes

During the study, 16 of 124 subjects in the dapagliflozin group (12.9%) and 13 of 124 subjects in the DPP4i group (10.5%) reported adverse events (Table 8). Death was not reported during the study, and serious adverse events were reported in 2 (1.6%) and 1 (0.8%) subjects in the dapagliflozin and DPP4i groups, respectively. One subject in the dapagliflozin group reported hypoglycemia-like symptoms, but the symptom was mild, and recovered without any treatment intervention. No severe hypoglycemia was reported in either group throughout the study. No significant difference was observed in the frequency of adverse events or serious adverse events between the groups. Known side effects of the study agents, such as dehydration, urinary tract infection, genital infection, and cystitis in the dapagliflozin group, and bullous pemphigoid in the DPP4i group, were not reported throughout the study.

### Evaluating the safety and efficacy of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in subjects with prediabetes: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^0ed88eed]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors have been initially used as a novel class of glucose-lowering agents by acting on SGLT2 in the renal tubules and inhibiting the reabsorption of filtered glucose in the kidneys. While safety concerns have been raised, including volume depletion, diabetic ketoacidosis, genitourinary infections, and hyperkalemia, large-scale clinical trials have not shown a substantial increase in adverse reactions compared to placebo groups. In addition to glucose-lowering effects independent of insulin secretion, the advantages of SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes management include weight loss without major hypoglycemic events, cardiovascular benefits supported by clinical trials, and prevention of nephropathy and renal function decline among patients with or without diabetes. Large RCTs, including DAPA-HF, DAPA-CKD, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY, conducted for at least 52 weeks, have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduce the risk of diabetes development in adults with either chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Additionally, in individuals without heart and kidney disease, a 14-day treatment of individuals with insulin resistance using dapagliflozin resulted in significant metabolic adaptations in whole-body and skeletal muscle substrate metabolism. Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated safety and additional benefits in patients without diabetes, particularly those with heart or kidney failure.

Despite the accumulated knowledge of SGLT2 inhibitors, their overall effectiveness and safety in improving the metabolism of people with prediabetes remain uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this RCT is to rigorously assess the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on individuals with prediabetes. By investigating the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors on glycemic control, we aim to contribute to the understanding of SGLT2 inhibitors as a potential intervention for prediabetes, ultimately informing diabetes prevention strategies.

### Safety of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Saudi arabia: a post authorization safety study [^dbd19f76]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2015, the FDA issued a warning on the risk of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors and announced the identification of 73 cases of ketoacidosis in patients with diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. This FDA announcement has resulted in added warnings to the labels of all SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Moreover, there was a recent change in the FDA label (prescribing information) for all SGLT2 inhibitors in March 2020. It recommends temporary discontinuation of dapagliflozin at least 3 days before any scheduled surgery to minimize the post-surgical risk of ketoacidosis. Given the seriousness of DKA risk with SGLT2 inhibitors, keeping in mind its incidence in clinical practice is extremely important. In the present study, one patient (0.2%) experienced mild DKA. Our results are similar to other previous studies; in a pooled analysis of 21 large placebo-/comparator-controlled clinical trials, one serious adverse event of DKA was reported in the dapagliflozin group (in a patient who received dapagliflozin in addition to metformin and insulin compared to none in the control group). In this analysis, the estimated incidence of DKA was 0.02%.

Dapagliflozin demonstrated favorable glycemic control in T2DM patients for 52 weeks when added to other antidiabetic agents. It was associated with a significant reduction in mean HbA1c from the baseline by − 1.09 (1.39) % and − 1.23 (1.39) % after 6 and 12 months of treatment, respectively (p < 0.0001).

Our results were in accordance with other studies conducted on 10 mg dapagliflozin when used as a dual or triple combination in T2DM. Bailey et al. assessed the efficacy of dapagliflozin combined with metformin for 2 years. They reported a maintained reduction in HbA1c. The mean changes from baseline HbA1c (8.06%) were + 0.02% for placebo compared with -0.78% for dapagliflozin at 102 weeks (p < 0.0001).

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes (the DEPICT-2 study): 24-week results from a randomized controlled trial [^c7b87d8d]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This 24-week, double-blinded, phase 3 clinical trial (DEPICT-2; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02460978) evaluated efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as adjunct therapy to adjustable insulin in patients with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes (HbA 1c 7.5–10.5%).

Research Design and Methods

Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to dapagliflozin 5 mg (n = 271), dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 270), or placebo (n = 272) plus insulin. Insulin dose was adjusted by investigators according to self-monitored glucose readings, local guidance, and individual circumstances.

Results

Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. At week 24, dapagliflozin significantly decreased HbA 1c (primary outcome; difference vs. placebo: dapagliflozin 5 mg -0.37% [95% CI -0.49, -0.26], dapagliflozin 10 mg -0.42% [-0.53, -0.30]), total daily insulin dose (-10.78% [-13.73, -7.72] and -11.08% [-14.04, -8.02], respectively), and body weight (-3.21% [-3.96, -2.45] and -3.74% [-4.49, -2.99], respectively) (P < 0.0001 for all). Mean interstitial glucose, amplitude of glucose excursion, and percent of readings within target glycemic range (> 70 to ≤ 180 mg/dL) versus placebo were significantly improved. More patients receiving dapagliflozin achieved a reduction in HbA 1c ≥ 0.5% without severe hypoglycemia compared with placebo. Adverse events were reported for 72.7%, 67.0%, and 63.2% of patients receiving dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo, respectively. Hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, was balanced between groups. There were more adjudicated definite diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events with dapagliflozin: 2.6%, 2.2%, and 0% for dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo, respectively.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin as adjunct therapy to adjustable insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes was well tolerated and improved glycemic control with no increase in hypoglycemia versus placebo but with more DKA events.

### Delayed euDKA associated with dapagliflozin after pancreatitis [^d800af5b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) is a rare but life-threatening adverse effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. We present a case of delayed euDKA seven days after cure of acute pancreatitis and discharge from the hospital of a 51-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) managed with a combination of antidiabetic medications, including the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. Prior acute pancreatitis was postulated to be a contributing factor to the development of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated euDKA in this patient discharged from the hospital. The patient was managed accordingly and improved clinically while his oral hypoglycemic agents were stopped. The risk of euDKA from SGLT2 inhibitor therapy may be increased by some stress factors (eg, infection, surgery, acute illness, low-carbohydrate diet, excessive alcohol intake). As these SGLT2 inhibitors become a popular therapeutic strategy for the management of hyperglycemia in T2DM, clinicians should be aware that acute illnesses such as pancreatitis in patients with T2DM can be potential predisposing factors for the development of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated euDKA.

### Dapagliflozin's effects on glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes: a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 28-week extension [^3ffa54fb]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), documented pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and a history of hypertension.

Research Design and Methods

Patients (N = 922) were randomized to receive 10 mg dapagliflozin or placebo in a double-blind trial for 24 weeks, followed by a 28-week extension period. In patients receiving insulin, the insulin dose was reduced by 25% at randomization. Patients were stratified by age, insulin use, and time from the most recent qualifying cardiovascular (CV) event. Co-primary end points were a change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and the proportion of patients achieving a combined reduction in HbA1c of ≥ 0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol), body weight (BW) of ≥ 3%, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 3 mmHg.

Results

At 24 weeks, dapagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.38% [-4.2 mmol/mol]) from baseline (8.18%) compared with a slight increase with placebo from baseline (8.08%) (0.08% [0.9 mmol/mol]). Significantly more patients met the three-item end point with treatment with dapagliflozin than with placebo (11.7% vs. 0.9%, respectively). Changes were maintained over 52 weeks. Although ∼42% of patients were ≥ 65 years old, similar results were observed in both age-stratified groups. Serious adverse events, hypoglycemia, urinary tract infections, and cardiac disorders were similar between groups. Adverse events of hypotension, dehydration, hypovolemia, genital infection, and renal failure or impairment occurred more often with dapagliflozin treatment.

Conclusions

In this study that evaluated T2D patients who were at high risk for future CVD events, dapagliflozin administration had significantly greater effects in reducing HbA1c, BW, and SBP, without adversely impacting CV safety when compared with placebo treatment.

### Association of dapagliflozin use with clinical outcomes and the introduction of uric acid-lowering therapy and colchicine in patients with heart failure with and without gout: a patient-level pooled meta-analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^8d6cea5a]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The reduction in the initiation of anti-gout medication with dapagliflozin most likely reflects the uric acid–lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors, but the mechanism for this is unknown. Whatever the reason, the reduction in the need for initiation of anti-gout medication represents a meaningful additional clinical benefit of dapagliflozin in patients with HF. In addition, avoiding anti-gout medication is desirable because of drug intolerance; drug interactions with HF therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and furosemide; risks of serious adverse events, such as hypersensitivity reactions; and less polypharmacy, which could improve patient adherence to lifesaving HF therapies.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. The analyses were not prespecified. Serum uric acid was not measured in DELIVER. Colchicine may be used for medical conditions other than gout flares, eg, pericarditis. Only serious adverse events and selected adverse events were collected in DAPA-HF and DELIVER; consequently, we did not have information on the occurrence of gout flares and had to use prescription of colchicine as a proxy, which may have underestimated the true incidence. A small proportion of patients without a history of gout were receiving uric acid–reducing therapy at baseline, potentially representing patient misclassification, although asymptomatic hyperuricemia is treated in some patients in some countries.
